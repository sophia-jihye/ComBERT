 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Company Overview 

Enstar Group Limited ("Enstar") is a Bermuda-based holding company, formed in 2001. Enstar is a multi-faceted insurance group that offers innovative capital release solutions and specialty underwriting capabilities through its network of group companies in Bermuda, the United States, the United Kingdom, Continental Europe, Australia, and other international locations. Enstar is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the ticker symbol "ESGR". In this report, the terms "Enstar," "the Company," "us," and "we" are used interchangeably to describe Enstar and our subsidiary companies. 

Our fundamental corporate objective is growing our net book value per share. We strive to achieve this primarily through growth in net earnings from both organic and accretive sources, including the completion of new acquisitions, the effective management of companies and portfolios of business acquired, and the execution of active underwriting strategies. 

Enstar focuses on the acquisition and management of insurance and reinsurance companies in run-off, and the acquisition and management of portfolios of insurance and reinsurance business in run-off. Since formation, we have completed the acquisition of over 70 insurance and reinsurance companies and portfolios of business. Although achieving growth through strategic acquisitions is our primary focus, we also provide management, consulting and other services to the insurance and reinsurance industry globally. 

In recent years, Enstar has diversified further, and we now operate two specialty active underwriting businesses: 

&#8226; 

Atrium Underwriting Group Limited and its subsidiaries ("Atrium"), which manage and underwrite specialist insurance and reinsurance business for Lloyd&#8217;s Syndicate 609; and 

&#8226; 

StarStone Insurance Bermuda Limited and its subsidiaries ("StarStone") (formerly known as the Torus group), which is an A.M. Best A- rated global specialty insurance group with multiple underwriting platforms. 

Business Strategy 

Enstar aims to maximize growth in net book value per share by employing the following strategies: 

We Leverage Management&#8217;s Experience and Industry Relationships to Solidify Enstar&#8217;s Position in the Run-Off Market . Enstar leverages the extensive experience and relationships of our senior management team to solidify our position as a leading run-off acquirer and generate future growth opportunities. 

We Engage in Highly Disciplined Acquisition, Management and Reinsurance Practices across a Diverse Portfolio of Loss Reserves. Enstar employs a disciplined approach when assessing, acquiring or managing portfolios of risk, which we believe minimizes risk and increases the probability of delivering positive operating results from the companies and portfolios acquired or managed. Enstar is highly selective in reviewing potential acquisition targets and management engagements. When considering any acquisition, we carefully analyze the target&#8217;s risk exposures, claims practices and reserve requirements. 

We Aim to Profitably Underwrite Selected Specialty Lines to Enhance Future Growth Opportunities. &#160; Through our Atrium and StarStone segments, Enstar selectively underwrites in chosen specialty lines, with a focus on balancing risk exposures. Through Atrium and StarStone, the group&#8217;s underwriting activity grows organically; and when Enstar acquires run-off businesses, the group&#8217;s active underwriting companies are well-positioned to capture profitable active business in specialty lines previously identified as attractive. 

We Manage Claims Professionally, Expeditiously, and Cost-Effectively. Enstar aims to manage claims made against group companies and portfolios in a professional and disciplined manner, drawing on in-house expertise to dispose of risks efficiently. Enstar strives to pay valid claims on a timely basis, while relying on well-documented policy terms and exclusions where applicable, and litigation when necessary, to defend against paying invalid claims. 

We Seek to Commute Assumed Liabilities and Ceded Reinsurance Assets at a Discount to the Ultimate Liability. Using detailed claims analysis and actuarial projections, Enstar seeks to negotiate with policyholders, both in the non-life run-off insurance and reinsurance companies or portfolios that the group owns or manages, with a goal of commuting existing insurance and reinsurance liabilities at a discount to the ultimate liability. 

We Prudently Manage Investments and Capital. In managing investments and deploying group capital, Enstar strives to achieve superior risk-adjusted returns, while growing profitability and generating long-term growth in shareholder value. 

Recent Developments and Strategic Growth Initiatives 

Enstar transactions typically take the form of either acquisitions or portfolio transfers. In an acquisition, we acquire an insurance or reinsurance company and manage the run-off or continued underwriting of risk in its business lines. In a portfolio transfer, a reinsurance contract transfers risk from the initial insurance or reinsurance company to a company in the Enstar group. Enstar also enters into reinsurance to close ("RITC") transactions with Lloyd's of London ("Lloyd's") insurance and reinsurance syndicates in run-off, whereby a portfolio of run-off liabilities is transferred from one Lloyd&#8217;s syndicate to another. 

The substantial majority of Enstar&#8217;s acquisitions have been in the non-life run-off business, which generally includes property and casualty, workers&#8217; compensation, asbestos and environmental, construction defect, marine, aviation and transit, and other closed business. 

Following our acquisitions of Atrium and Starstone, in 2013 and 2014, respectively, Enstar has evolved from a stand-alone run-off consolidator to a more diversified insurance group with active underwriting capabilities. Enstar had several rationales for acquiring Atrium and StarStone: 

&#8226; 

Atrium&#8217;s and StarStone&#8217;s underwriting businesses now provide Enstar with a new earnings stream, which reduces the impact of volatility in earnings from non-life run-off businesses, while concurrently offering the group new growth avenues. 

&#8226; 

We believe that having active underwriting businesses enhances the group&#8217;s overall ability to compete for new acquisition targets because the addition of active underwriting capabilities allows the group to acquire renewal rights or provide loss portfolio reinsurance in connection with such acquisitions. These capabilities can attract certain vendors, and may provide Enstar with additional flexibility in structuring proposed transactions. 

&#8226; 

Having both run-off and active underwriting businesses within our group allows Enstar to evaluate an acquisition target not only for its fundamental run-off potential, but also for the ongoing value of its profitable business lines. 

The management of claims and the control of expenses are Enstar&#8217;s core competencies and active underwriting is a relatively new area for the group. Accordingly, we partnered with the Trident V funds ("Trident") (managed by Stone Point Capital LLC) in the acquisitions of the active underwriting businesses. Stone Point Capital is a financial services-focused private equity firm that has significant experience investing in insurance and reinsurance companies and other insurance-related businesses, which Enstar believes is valuable in our active underwriting joint ventures. 

In each of the Atrium and StarStone transactions, Enstar has a 59.0% equity interest, Trident has a 39.3% equity interest, and Dowling Capital Partners, L.P. ("Dowling") has a 1.7% equity interest. 

Enstar has further expanded its portfolio of run-off businesses in recent years to include closed life and annuities, primarily through the acquisitions of the Pavonia companies in 2013 and National Suisse Assurance in 2015 (now renamed Alpha Insurance SA). In addition to increasing the group&#8217;s portfolio diversification, we believe the addition of life and annuities businesses has the potential to provide a stable long-term earnings and cash flow stream that may counter some of the earnings volatility in the group&#8217;s core non-life run-off business. 

Recent Acquisitions and Significant New Business 

Allianz SE 

On February 17, 2016, we entered into a reinsurance agreement with Allianz SE ("Allianz") to reinsure portfolios of Allianz's run-off business. Pursuant to the reinsurance agreement, our subsidiary will reinsure 50% &#32;of certain portfolios of workers' compensation, construction defect, and asbestos, pollution, and toxic tort business originally held by Fireman's Fund Insurance Company, and in the process will assume net reinsurance reserves of approximately $1.1 billion . Affiliates of Allianz will retain approximately $1.1 billion &#32;of reinsurance premium as funds withheld collateral for the obligations of our subsidiary under the reinsurance agreement and we will transfer approximately $110.0 million &#32;to a reinsurance trust to further support our subsidiary's obligations. We have also provided a limited parental guarantee, which is subject to a maximum cap. The combined monetary total of the support offered by us through the trust and 

parental guarantee will initially be capped at $270.0 million . Consummation of the transaction is subject to final regulatory approval. 

In addition to the reinsurance transaction described above, we have entered into a consulting agreement with San Francisco Reinsurance Company, an affiliate of Allianz, with respect to the entire $2.2 billion portfolio, including the 50% share retained by affiliates of Allianz. 

Doctors 

On November 30, 2015, we completed the assignment and assumption of a portfolio of primarily workers' compensation business from The Doctors Company and its affiliates. Total assets and liabilities assumed were $29.5 million . 

Nationale Suisse Assurance 

On November 13, 2015, we acquired Nationale Suisse Assurance S.A. ("NSA") from Helvetia Group. NSA is a Belgium-based insurance company with non-life insurance and life insurance business. We changed the name of NSA to Alpha Insurance SA ("Alpha") at closing. The total consideration for the transaction was &#8364;32.8 million (approximately $35.2 million), which we financed from cash on hand. 

Sun Life 

On September 30, 2015, we entered into two 100% reinsurance agreements and a related administration services agreement with Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada and its U.S. branch (together, "Sun Life") pursuant to which we reinsured all of the run-off workers' compensation carve-out and occupational accident business of Sun Life. We assumed gross reinsurance reserves of $128.3 million, received total assets of $122.5 million and recorded a deferred charge of $5.8 million included in other assets. We transferred approximately $30.6 million of additional funds into trust to further support our obligations under the reinsurance agreements. We also provided limited parental guarantees, subject to an overall maximum of approximately $36.8 million. 

Voya Financial Reinsurance (ReliaStar) 

On May 27, 2015, we entered into two 100% reinsurance agreements and related administration services agreements with a subsidiary of Voya Financial Reinsurance ("Voya"), pursuant to which we reinsured all of the run-off workers' compensation and occupational accident assumed reinsurance business of the Voya subsidiary and that of its Canadian branch. Pursuant to the transaction, the Voya subsidiary transferred assets into two reinsurance collateral trusts securing our obligations under the reinsurance agreements. We assumed reinsurance reserves of $572.4 million, received total assets of $307.0 million and recorded a deferred charge of $265.4 million included in other assets. We transferred approximately $67.2 million of additional funds to the trusts to further support our obligations under the reinsurance agreements. We also provided a limited parental guarantee, subject to a maximum cap with respect to the reinsurance liabilities. As of December 31, 2015, the amount of the parental guarantee was $58.0 million. 

Life Settlements (Wilton Re) 

On May 5, 2015, we completed the acquisitions of two Delaware companies from subsidiaries of Wilton Re Limited ("Wilton Re") that own interests in life insurance policies acquired in the secondary and tertiary markets and through collateralized lending transactions. The total consideration for the transaction was $173.1 million , payable in two installments. The first installment of $89.1 million &#32;was paid on closing. The second installment of $83.9 million , due on the first anniversary of closing, is expected to be funded from cash on hand. Subsequent to the closing of this transaction, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board ("CPPIB"), the majority shareholder of Wilton Re, separately acquired certain voting and non-voting shares of Enstar, as described below. 

Sussex Insurance Company (formerly known as Companion Property and Casualty Insurance Company) 

On January 27, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Companion Property and Casualty Insurance Company ("Companion") from Blue Cross and Blue Shield of South Carolina, an independent licensee of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association. Companion is a South Carolina-based insurance group with property, casualty, specialty and workers' compensation business, and has also provided fronting and third-party administrative services. The total consideration for the transaction was $218.0 million in cash, which was financed 50% through borrowings under a Term Facility Agreement with National Australia Bank Limited and Barclays Bank PLC (the "Sussex Facility") and 50% from cash on hand. We changed the name of Companion to Sussex Insurance Company ("Sussex") following the acquisition, and the company is operating as part of our Non-life Run-off segment. In addition, StarStone is renewing certain business from Sussex. 

Reciprocal of America 

On January 15, 2015, we completed a loss portfolio transfer reinsurance transaction with Reciprocal of America (in Receivership) ("Reciprocal") and its Deputy Receiver relating to a portfolio of workers' compensation business that has been in run-off since 2003. The total insurance reserves assumed were $162.1 million with an equivalent amount of cash and investments received as consideration. 

The tables below sets forth summaries of acquisitions and significant new business in excess of $50 million in acquired assets that we have signed or completed since January 1, 2015. For a more detailed explanation of these transactions, as well as transactions completed in 2014 and 2013, refer to "Note 3 - Acquisitions" and "Note 4 - Significant New Business" in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included within Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Other Transactions 

Aligned Re 

We announced in December 2015 that we had agreed in principle to act as reinsurance manager for a newly-formed Bermuda company, Aligned Re Ltd. ("Aligned Re"), which is expected to be funded with third-party capital alongside anticipated investments from Enstar and certain of our affiliates, including $100.0 million that Enstar has already invested. UBS O'Connor LLC is expected to act as investment manager for Aligned Re. StarStone is expected to purchase reinsurance via quota share agreements with Aligned Re. In addition, certain Enstar run-off subsidiaries are expected to enter into loss portfolio transfer agreements with Aligned Re. 

StarStone Rebranding 

On September 14, 2015, Torus announced that we were changing the names of it and its subsidiary companies to StarStone with immediate effect. The rebranding reflects significant progress in strengthening the management team and reorganizing areas of the business. The business approach and organizational values remain unchanged as the leadership, underwriting and service teams continue to focus on delivering specialty products to a global client base. The new brand highlights StarStone&#8217;s position within Enstar and the strength of the combined partnership with Stone Point Capital, which manages the Trident funds co-invested in StarStone. We also changed the name of the 

StarStone holding company from Bayshore Holdings Limited ("Bayshore") to StarStone Specialty Holdings Limited ("StarStone Holdings"). 

For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized an impairment charge of $4.0 million related to the Torus brand in relation to the StarStone rebranding exercise. 

Reorganization of Certain Subsidiary Holding Companies 

On December 23, 2015, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Kenmare Holdings Ltd. ("Kenmare"), together with its co-investors in StarStone Holdings (formerly Bayshore) and Northshore Holdings Limited ("Northshore"), completed a corporate holding company reorganization of these companies (the "Reorganization"). Our co-investors in StarStone Holdings and Northshore are Trident and Dowling. StarStone Holdings is a holding company that was formed to acquire the StarStone group of companies in 2014. Northshore is a holding company that was formed to acquire Atrium and Arden Reinsurance Company Ltd. ("Arden") in 2013. Following the Reorganization, StarStone Holdings and Northshore are owned by a common parent, North Bay Holdings Limited, a Bermuda exempted company ("North Bay"). The Reorganization streamlines the ownership structure for Enstar&#8217;s two active underwriting platforms, StarStone and Atrium, and is expected to provide administrative efficiencies. The Reorganization did not materially affect any of the investor rights and obligations or the ultimate economic ownership of either company. 

Repurchase of Noncontrolling Interests 

On June 30, 2015, we entered into a Sale and Purchase Agreement with J.C. Flowers II L.P., J.C. Flowers II-A L.P., J.C. Flowers II-B, L.P. and Financial Service Opportunities L.P. (collectively, the "JCF II Funds"), pursuant to which we purchased all of the non-voting preference shares of Cumberland Holdings Ltd. and Courtenay Holdings Ltd., which represent all of the noncontrolling interest owned directly by the JCF II Funds in our subsidiaries, for an aggregate price of $140.0 million. Immediately prior to the repurchase, the book value of the JCF II Funds&#8217; noncontrolling interest was $182.8 million. The transaction closed on September 30, 2015. 

On September 3, 2015, we entered into a Sale and Purchase Agreement with Shinsei Bank, Limited ("Shinsei"), pursuant to which we purchased all of the Class B shares of Comox Holdings Ltd., which represents all of the noncontrolling interest owned directly by Shinsei in our subsidiaries, for an aggregate price of $10.4 million. Immediately prior to the repurchase, the book value of Shinsei&#8217;s noncontrolling interest was $12.5 million. The transaction closed on September 8, 2015. 

Significant New Shareholder - CPPIB 

On June 3, 2015, CPPIB purchased voting and non-voting shares in Enstar from FR XI Offshore AIV, L.P., First Reserve Fund XII, L.P., FR XII-A Parallel Vehicle L.P. and FR Torus Co-Investment, L.P. (collectively, "First Reserve"). These shares constitute a 9.3% voting interest and a 9.9% aggregate economic interest in Enstar. On September 29, 2015, CPPIB exercised its acquired right to appoint a representative to our Board of Directors. CPPIB has also signed a definitive agreement to acquire additional voting shares. Upon the closing of that acquisition, which is subject to regulatory approval, CPPIB and certain parties affiliated with CPPIB would own a 13.9% voting interest in Enstar and a 13.8% aggregate economic interest. 

&#32;&#32;CPPIB, together with management of Wilton Re, owns 100% of the common stock of Wilton Re. The closing of our transaction with Wilton Re (described in "Acquisitions and Significant New Business" above) occurred prior to CPPIB's investment in Enstar. 

Operating Segments 

We have four &#32;segments of business that are each managed, operated and reported on separately: (i) Non-life Run-off; (ii) Atrium; (iii) StarStone; and (iv) Life and Annuities. For additional information and financial data relating to our segments, see "Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations by Segment," "Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Investments" and "Note 22 - Segment Information" in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included within Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Non-life Run-off 

Our Non-life Run-off segment comprises the operations of our subsidiaries that are running off their property and casualty and other non-life lines of business, including the run-off businesses of StarStone and Arden. It also includes our smaller management business, in which we manage the run-off portfolios of third parties through our service companies. 

In the primary (or direct) insurance business, the insurer assumes risk of loss from persons or organizations that are directly subject to the given risks. In the reinsurance business, the reinsurer agrees to indemnify an insurance or reinsurance company, referred to as the ceding company, against all or a portion of the insurance risks arising under the policies the ceding company has written or reinsured. When an insurer or reinsurer stops writing new insurance business, either entirely or with respect to a particular line of business, the insurer, reinsurer, or the line of discontinued business is in run-off. 

Participants in the industry often have portfolios of business that are either inconsistent with their core competency or provide excessive exposure to a particular risk or segment of the market (i.e., workers' compensation, property/casualty, asbestos, environmental, director and officer liability, etc.). These non-core and/or discontinued portfolios are often associated with potentially large exposures and lengthy time periods before resolution of the last remaining insured claims, resulting in significant uncertainty to the insurer or reinsurer covering those risks. These factors can distract management, drive up the cost of capital and surplus for the insurer or reinsurer, and negatively impact the insurer&#8217;s or reinsurer&#8217;s credit rating, which makes the disposal of the unwanted company or portfolio an attractive option. Alternatively, the insurer may wish to maintain the business on its balance sheet, yet not divert significant management attention to the run-off of the portfolio. The insurer or reinsurer, in either case, is likely to engage a third party that specializes in run-off management, such as Enstar, to purchase or manage the company or portfolio in run-off. 

In the sale of a company in run-off, a purchaser, such as Enstar, may pay a discount to the book value of the company based on the risks assumed and the relative value to the seller of no longer having to manage the company in run-off. Such a transaction can be beneficial to the seller because it receives an up-front payment for the company, eliminates the need for its management to devote any attention to the disposed company and removes the risk that the established reserves related to the run-off business may prove to be inadequate. The seller is also able to redeploy its management and financial resources to its core businesses. 

In some situations, an insurer or reinsurer may wish to divest itself of a portfolio of non-core legacy business that may have been underwritten alongside other ongoing core business that the insurer or reinsurer does not want to dispose of. In such instances, we are able to provide economic finality for the insurer or reinsurer by providing a loss portfolio reinsurance contract to protect the insurer or reinsurer against deterioration of the non-core portfolio of loss reserves. 

Alternatively, if the insurer or reinsurer hires a third party, such as Enstar, to manage its run-off business, the insurer or reinsurer will, unlike in a sale of the business, receive little or no cash up front. Instead, the management arrangement may provide that the insurer or reinsurer will retain the profits, if any, derived from the run-off with certain incentive payments allocated to the run-off manager. By hiring a run-off manager, the insurer or reinsurer can outsource the management of the run-off business to experienced and capable individuals, while allowing its own management team to focus on the insurer&#8217;s or reinsurer&#8217;s core businesses. 

Overall, the focus of our Non-life Run-off segment is to acquire companies or portfolios in run-off and to effectively manage that business in ways that further our primary corporate objective of growing Enstar's net book value per share. 

Acquisition Process 

We evaluate each acquisition opportunity presented by carefully reviewing the portfolio&#8217;s risk exposures, claim practices, reserve requirements and outstanding claims, and may seek an appropriate discount and/or seller indemnification to reflect the uncertainty contained in the portfolio&#8217;s reserves. Based on this initial analysis, we can determine if a company or portfolio of business would add value to our current portfolio of run-off businesses. If we determine to pursue the purchase of a company in run-off, we then proceed to price the acquisition in a manner we believe will result in positive operating results based on certain assumptions including, without limitation, our ability to favorably resolve claims, negotiate with direct insureds and reinsurers, and otherwise manage the nature of the risks posed by the business. 

At the time we acquire a company in run-off, we estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired based on external actuarial advice, as well as our own views of the exposures assumed. While we earn a larger share of our total return on an acquisition from disciplined claims management and/or commuting the liabilities that we have assumed, we also try to maximize reinsurance recoveries on the assumed portfolio of business as well as investment returns from the acquired investment portfolios. 

Run-off Management 

Following the acquisition of a company or portfolio of business in run-off, or a new consulting engagement to manage a company or portfolio of business in run-off, we strive to conduct the run-off in a disciplined and professional manner to efficiently discharge the liabilities associated with the business while preserving and maximizing its assets. Our approach to managing our acquired companies and portfolios of business in run-off, as well as run-off companies or portfolios of businesses we manage on behalf of third-party clients, includes, where possible, negotiating with third-party insureds and reinsureds to commute their insurance or reinsurance agreement (sometimes called policy buy-backs) for an agreed upon up-front payment by us, or the third-party client, and to more efficiently manage payment of insurance and reinsurance claims. We attempt to commute policies with direct insureds or reinsureds to eliminate uncertainty over the amount of future claims. Commutations and policy buy-backs provide an opportunity for the company to exit exposures to certain policies and insureds generally at a discount to the ultimate liability and provide the ability to eliminate exposure to further losses. Commutations can also reduce the duration, administrative burden and ultimately the future cost of the run-off. 

In certain lines of business, such as direct workers&#8217; compensation insurance, commutations and policy buy-back opportunities are not typically available, and our strategy with respect to these businesses is to derive value through efficient and effective management of claims. 

An integral factor to our success is our ability to analyze, administer, and settle claims while managing related expenses, such as loss adjustment expenses ("LAE"). We have implemented claims handling guidelines along with claims reporting and control procedures in all of our claims units. All claims matters are reviewed regularly, with all material claims matters being circulated to and authorized by management prior to any action being taken. Our claims management processes also include leveraging our extensive relationships and developed protocols to more efficiently manage outside counsel and other third parties to reduce expenses. With respect to certain lines of business, we have arrangements with third-party administrators to manage and pay claims on our subsidiaries&#8217; behalf and advise with respect to case reserves. These agreements generally set forth the duties of the third-party administrators, limits of authority, indemnification language designed for our protection and various procedures relating to compliance with laws and regulations. These arrangements are also subject to review by our relevant claims departments, and we monitor these administrators on an ongoing basis. 

Following the acquisition of a company or portfolio of business in run-off, or new consulting engagement, we analyze the acquired exposures and reinsurance receivables on a policyholder-by-policyholder basis to identify those we wish to approach to discuss commutation. In addition, policyholders and reinsurers often approach us requesting commutation. We then carry out a full analysis of the underlying exposures in order to determine the viability of a proposed commutation. From the initial analysis of the underlying exposures, it may take several months, or even years, before a commutation is completed. In a number of cases, if we and the policyholder or reinsurer are unable to reach a commercially acceptable settlement, the commutation may not be achievable, in which case we will continue to settle valid claims from the policyholder, or collect reinsurance receivables from the reinsurer, as they become due. 

Certain insureds and reinsureds are often willing to commute with us, subject to receiving an acceptable settlement, as this provides certainty of recovery of what otherwise may be claims that are disputed in the future, and often provides a meaningful up-front cash receipt that, with the associated investment income, can provide funds to meet future claim payments or even commutation of their underlying exposure. Therefore, subject to negotiating an acceptable settlement, many of our insurance and reinsurance liabilities and reinsurance receivables are able to be either commuted or settled by way of policy buy-back over time. Properly priced commutations may reduce the expense of adjusting direct claims and pursuing collection of reinsurance, realize savings, remove the potential future volatility of claims and reduce required regulatory capital. 

We manage cash flow with regard to reinsurance recoverables by working with reinsurers, brokers and professional advisors to achieve fair and prompt payment of reinsured claims, taking appropriate legal action to secure receivables where necessary. We also attempt where appropriate to negotiate favorable commutations with our reinsurers by securing a lump sum settlement from reinsurers in complete satisfaction of the reinsurer&#8217;s past, present and future liability in respect of such claims. 

Consulting Services 

We provide consultancy services to third parties in the insurance and reinsurance industry primarily through our subsidiaries, the Cranmore companies, Enstar Limited, Enstar (US), Inc., Paladin Managed Care Services, Inc. ("Paladin") and Kinsale Brokers Limited. The services we provide range from full-service incentive-based or fixed fee run-off management to bespoke solutions such as claims inspection, claims validation, reinsurance asset collection 

and IT consulting services. Paladin, acquired in 2013 as part of the SeaBright Holdings, Inc. ("SeaBright") transaction, provides medical bill review, utilization review, physician case management and related services in the workers&#8217; compensation area. In addition to third-party engagements, our consultancy companies also perform these services in-house for our Enstar companies, using their expertise to assist in managing our run-off portfolios and performing certain due diligence matters relating to acquired businesses. 

Atrium 

Our Atrium segment is comprised of the active underwriting operations and financial results of Northshore, a holding company that owns Atrium and its subsidiaries and Arden. Enstar acquired Atrium on November 25, 2013. Atrium was regarded as an attractive expansion opportunity by Enstar management primarily because of its skilled underwriting and management teams, and its strong historical performance at Lloyd&#8217;s. 

Atrium&#8217;s wholly-owned subsidiary, Atrium Underwriters Ltd, manages Syndicate 609 which underwrites specialist insurance and reinsurance business at Lloyd&#8217;s. Atrium&#8217;s wholly-owned subsidiary, Atrium 5 Ltd., provides approximately 25% of the underwriting capacity and capital to Syndicate 609, with the balance provided by traditional Lloyd&#8217;s Names. Atrium has offices in London, the United States, Canada, and Singapore. Generally speaking, Atrium continues to operate in accordance with the underwriting and other business strategies established pre-acquisition, although we and Trident continually review these strategies and business goals and expect to develop synergies with our existing business operations over time. 

Arden is a Bermuda-based reinsurance company that provides reinsurance to Atrium (through an approximately 65% quota share reinsurance arrangement with Atrium 5 Ltd, which is eliminated upon consolidation) and is currently in the process of running off certain other discontinued businesses. Results related to Arden&#8217;s discontinued business are included within our Non-life Run-off segment. 

Business Lines 

Syndicate 609 provides insurance and reinsurance on a worldwide basis including the United States, Europe, the Far East and Australasia. Atrium specializes in a wide range of industry classes, including accident and health, aviation, marine, property and casualty binding authorities, non marine direct and facultative, liability, reinsurance, upstream energy and war and terrorism. Lloyd&#8217;s business is often underwritten on a subscription basis across the insurance market. Atrium is the lead underwriter in approximately 35% of the business it underwrites. 

Lloyd&#8217;s is a surplus lines insurer and an accredited reinsurer in all U.S. states and territories, and a licensed (or admitted) insurer in Illinois, Kentucky and the U.S. Virgin Islands. 

A description of each of Atrium's lines of business follows: 

Marine . &#32;&#32; The Marine line of business is a worldwide portfolio writing marine hull, cargo, fine art and specie, marine and energy liability and total loss only business. This includes hull all risks, hull total loss interests, yachts, fishing vessels, ship construction, ports, cable construction and cable operating risks, tows, mortgages interests, port property, war risks and a number of other specialist areas of marine insurance. Cargo, fine art and specie includes exporters, museums, auction houses, jewelers, banks and security houses. Business is written on a direct, reinsurance, proportional and excess of loss basis. 

Property and Casualty Binding Authorities . The property and casualty binding authority portfolio includes a broad range of small and medium business entity insurance products offered across the United States and Canada. Typical property risks include commercial, vacant and hard-to-place residential dwellings. Typical casualty risks include owners, landlords and tenants, business owners, artisan, special events and various niche products. Business is written through both traditional binding authorities as well as online binding authorities through AUGold, Atrium&#8217;s proprietary online system that is used by brokers. 

Upstream Energy . The upstream energy line of business is split into two main categories of assureds: operators (private and publicly quoted companies, national oil companies and Oil Insurance Limited members) and contractors (for drilling, service and construction entities). The principal coverage is physical damage/business interruption, control of well and associated pollution, construction and Gulf of Mexico windstorm and other natural catastrophe perils. Nearly all of the upstream energy line of business is sourced through Lloyd&#8217;s brokers, with the significant majority written on a facultative basis and a smaller amount written on a treaty basis. 

Reinsurance . The reinsurance line is a worldwide portfolio and includes aviation reinsurance, casualty reinsurance, property reinsurance, and marine reinsurance. Business is mainly written on a risk excess of loss, 

catastrophe excess of loss or retrocessional basis. Aviation reinsurance is written through an underwriting consortium managed by Atrium. 

Accident and Health . The accident and health line is a global account that encompasses a wide range of classes, including group and individual disability, personal accident, travel insurance, medical expenses, aviation personal accident, war risks, kidnap and ransom insurance, and sports accident insurance. The line includes both insurance and reinsurance business, written as facultative placements and under delegated underwriting facilities and both proportional and non-proportional treaties. 

Non-Marine Direct and Facultative . The non-marine direct and facultative portfolio includes a diverse mix of property business offered in both the international and U.S. markets, comprised of physical loss or damage, business interruption, extra expense, construction, contingency and pecuniary loss risks in respect of onshore property and onshore engineered risks. The majority of this line of business is written through Lloyd&#8217;s brokers and under delegated underwriting facilities. 

Liability . The liability line of business includes a professional liability North American portfolio of products covering a diverse range of classes including architects, consultants and lawyers and also a miscellaneous range encompassing many different professions. Included within this line of business is international liability, which is a book of primary coverholder business covering the security, leisure and hotel industries. The majority of business is produced through delegated binding authority contracts. 

Aviation . The aviation portfolio includes all aspects of aviation insurance, with Atrium specializing in rotor wing and non-major airlines. The majority of the account is sourced through London brokers as direct or facultative reinsurance of a local reinsurer. This line of business also includes a space account, which covers launch as well as in-orbit risks and is written through an underwriting consortium managed by Atrium. 

War and Terrorism . The war and terrorism line includes aviation war, marine war, and terrorism. Aviation war covers hull war and other perils commonly excluded from hull and liability all risk policies. Atrium leads a number of the major marine war contracts in London. This line also includes political violence business, in which Atrium focuses on writing with security consultants engaged to provide risk or country surveys. 

Distribution 

All of the business in the Atrium segment is placed through insurance and reinsurance brokers, and a key distribution channel for Syndicate 609 is the managing general agent binding authorities. Atrium seeks to develop relationships with insurance and reinsurance brokers, insurance and reinsurance companies, large global corporations and financial intermediaries to develop and underwrite business. Independent brokers Marsh Inc., Willis Group Holdings Ltd. and Aon Benfield Group Ltd. accounted for 11%, 11% and 8%, respectively, of Atrium&#8217;s gross premiums written for the year ended December 31, 2015 (approximately 30% collectively). Other brokers (each individually less than 10%) accounted for 70% of gross premiums written. 

Atrium&#8217;s proprietary online platform, AUGold, provides end-to-end processing, quote and policy production for managing general agents across a range of classes of business. The platform provides agents with efficient and cost effective access to Lloyd&#8217;s binding authorities and is designed to enable Atrium to compete more effectively with North American excess and surplus lines carriers. 

Managing Agency Services 

Atrium receives a managing agency fee of 0.7% of Syndicate 609 capacity and a 20% profit commission based on the net earnings of Syndicate 609, pursuant to its management contract. Atrium also receives management fees and profit commission from the management of underwriting consortiums. These fees and profit commission are included within fees and commission income in our consolidated statement of earnings. 

Claims Management 

Claims in respect of business written by Syndicate 609 are primarily notified by various central market bureaus. Where a syndicate is a "leading" syndicate on a Lloyd&#8217;s policy, its underwriters and claims adjusters work directly with the broker or insured on behalf of itself and the following market for any particular claim. This may involve appointing attorneys or loss adjusters. The claims bureaus and the leading syndicate advise movement in loss reserves to all syndicates participating on the risk. If necessary, Atrium's claims department may adjust the case reserves it records from those advised by the bureaus. 

Reinsurance Ceded 

On an annual basis Atrium purchases a tailored outwards reinsurance program designed to manage its risk profile. The majority of Atrium&#8217;s third-party reinsurance cover is with Lloyd&#8217;s Syndicates or other highly rated reinsurers. 

StarStone 

Our StarStone segment is comprised of the active underwriting operations and financial results of StarStone Holdings (formerly known as Bayshore), a holding company that owns StarStone and its subsidiaries. Results relating to StarStone&#8217;s run-off lines of business are included within our Non-life Run-off segment. 

We acquired StarStone (formerly known as Torus) on April 1, 2014 in partnership with Trident (managed by Stone Point Capital). Dowling also has a minority investment. StarStone rebranded during 2015, as described above. Under our ownership, and with a strengthened management team, StarStone&#8217;s strategy emphasizes underwriting discipline and focuses on profitable lines and improvement of operational effectiveness and efficiency. 

StarStone is a global specialty insurer operating worldwide from key underwriting hubs in the Lloyd's and London markets, Bermuda, Continental Europe, and the United States. StarStone has six wholly-owned insurance platforms and licenses to serve a global client base. Through Syndicate 1301, we offer a variety of specialty products at Lloyd&#8217;s. Syndicate 1301 is managed by StarStone's wholly-owned Lloyd&#8217;s managing agency. 

Business Lines 

StarStone offers a broad range of property, casualty and specialty insurance products to both large multi-national and small and middle-market clients around the world. A description of StarStone's business lines is as follows: 

Casualty . &#160; Casualty is StarStone's largest product group, including StarStone&#8217;s U.S. excess casualty, global management and professional liability, global healthcare, and accident and health products. The U.S. excess casualty product includes umbrella, excess and retained limit products across a wide range of market segments focused on small to mid-market businesses. The global management and professional liability product specializes in directors and officers and professional liability protection for both traditional and emerging professions. Our healthcare product provides insurance for acute care centers, nursing homes, small hospitals, physician groups, senior living facilities, and others. The accident and health product provides protection for a broad range of groups and individuals such as air crew personal accident and loss of license, accidental death and permanent and temporary disability for individuals including athletes and high net worth individuals. 

Marine . We provide a broad range of marine and specialty products including hull and machinery, marine and energy liabilities, cargo, war, transport, specie and fine art, and terrorism. These products are written through Lloyd's Syndicate 1301, our European branch network and by some of our U.S.-based teams. We also provide high excess casualty coverage placed in the London wholesale market which is focused on high excess layers for Fortune 500 companies. 

Property . This includes all of our property insurance products. The construction portfolio focuses on large, complex, infrastructure and contractor cover across all risk areas. Property also includes our onshore, power, and upstream and offshore products written through our Lloyd's and London platforms. Most lines are written on a full value, primary, excess of loss or quota share basis. 

Aerospace . We serve a diverse client base within the aerospace sector including airlines, aircraft manufacturers and airport service providers. Our products are split between short-tail and long-tail risks and by aircraft type into three areas: airlines, aviation products and liability, and general aviation. We previously wrote a space product, which we no longer offer. 

Workers' compensation . This line provides workers' compensation solutions for a range of industries, including energy and maritime businesses to high-hazard operations. We also cover cross-state, multi-jurisdictional exposures in single policies. Business is written directly with clients and through partnerships with independent agents, managing general underwriters, and select wholesale brokers throughout the United States. 

Distribution 

StarStone's distribution strategy is to focus on proximity to clients and brokers, using its Lloyd&#8217;s platform, European branch distribution network, its U.S. wholesale distribution strategy, as well as its relationships with insurance and reinsurance brokers and risk carriers, corporations and financial intermediaries. 

Syndicate 1301 can conduct business in over 200 countries and territories worldwide. In addition to underwriting business directly at Lloyd&#8217;s in London, it provides local access to Lloyd&#8217;s in Continental Europe and the United States. 

In the United States, products are written locally through our admitted and excess and surplus lines carriers. Our U.S. strategy also utilizes our online e-commerce broker portal, ESCAPE, which offers immediate wholesale distribution to all 50 states. StarStone also harnesses the technology behind ESCAPE for its managing general agent partners across Europe. 

Business in the StarStone segment is generally placed through insurance and reinsurance brokers and managing general agents. Independent brokers Marsh Inc., Willis Group Holdings Ltd. and Aon Benfield Group Ltd. accounted for 12%, 9% and 7%, respectively, of StarStone&#8217;s gross premiums written for the year ended December 31, 2015 (28% collectively). Other brokers and managing general agents (each individually less than 10%) accounted for 72% of gross premiums written. 

Claims Management 

Claims in respect of business written by Syndicate 1301, as well as in respect of StarStone&#8217;s other London market business, are primarily notified by various central market bureaus whereby the leading syndicate or company advise all participants of movement in loss reserves. If necessary, StarStone's claims department may adjust the case reserves it records from those advised by the bureaus. 

Claims in respect of non-bureau business are handled by StarStone&#8217;s experienced claims professionals. StarStone uses claims handling guidelines along with a global claims management system to review, report and administer claims. With respect to certain lines of business, StarStone may use third-party administrators to manage and pay claims on its behalf and advise with respect to case reserves. StarStone also utilizes Enstar&#8217;s experience in claims management. 

Reinsurance Ceded 

StarStone purchases an annual tailored outwards reinsurance program designed to manage its risk profile. The majority of StarStone&#8217;s third party reinsurance cover is with highly rated reinsurers or is collateralized by letters of credit. As described above, StarStone also expects to purchase reinsurance via quota share agreements with Aligned Re, a newly-formed reinsurer. &#32; 

Life and Annuities 

Our Life and Annuities segment consists of the operations of our subsidiaries managing our closed-block of life and annuity business and our life settlements business. The segment includes the companies we acquired in the Pavonia acquisition in 2013, which operate primarily out of our New Jersey office. The segment also includes Laguna Life Limited, a small Irish-based closed-life company. 

On May 5, 2015, we expanded this business segment with our acquisition of a life settlements business from Wilton Re. On November 13, 2015, we added Belgian insurer Alpha, a European insurance company that wrote credit and life insurance, which is now in run-off. Alpha also wrote non-life business, which is reported in our Non-life Run-off segment. 

Similar to our Non-life Run-off segment, our life and annuities companies are no longer writing new policies, however, unlike that segment, these companies continue to generate premiums with respect to their in-force policies. 

Our strategy in the Life and Annuities segment differs from our non-life business, in particular because we have limited ability to shorten the duration of the liabilities of these businesses through either early claims settlement, commutations or policy buy-backs. Instead, we hold the policies to their natural maturity or lapse, while aiming to efficiently manage our invested assets in those businesses to match the duration and cash flows of the liability profile, and will pay claims as they come due. 

Life Business 

Our life run-off business consists of: (i) Pavonia's credit life and disability insurance, term life insurance, corporate owned life insurance, assumed reinsurance of term ordinary life and accidental death and dismemberment products sold in the United States and Canada; (ii) Laguna Life Limited's term life insurance primarily sold in the U.K. and Europe; and (iii) Alpha's credit and life insurance sold in Europe. The life companies continue to generate premiums, and accordingly, the reserves remain sensitive to lapse rates as well as mortality rates. 

Annuities 

Our annuities run-off business relates solely to business assumed by one of the Pavonia companies of a closed block of structured settlement, lottery, and other immediate annuities (the "PPA business"). Reserves relating to the PPA business constitute approximately 80% of the aggregate reserves of the Pavonia companies as at December 31, 2015 . The contracts within the portfolio are largely structured settlements, although the portfolio also includes a smaller amount of lottery annuities and supplementary contracts. 

The PPA business was issued from 1982 to 1995, although the majority of the reserves pertain to the period from 1985 to 1989. The contracts within the portfolio operate pursuant to a variety of different payment features, such as life contingency payments, certain payments (or a combination thereof), one-time lump payments, or payments patterns such as level, compound increase or fixed amount increase payments. Regardless of payment structure, however, the portfolio generally has known and predictable cash flows, which makes the asset liability matching process and the mitigation of interest rate risk a vital component to our management of this portfolio. We have a long-duration held-to-maturity investme nt portfolio designed to manage the cash flow obligations of the PPA business. 

Life Settlements 

Our life settlements business relates solely to our investments in life settlement contracts acquired from Wilton Re. The two Delaware companies we acquired own interests in U.S. life insurance policies acquired in the secondary and tertiary markets and through collateralized lending transactions. We pay premiums on these policies and other costs to keep the policy in force, and we recognize income upon a policy maturity event. The investments in collateralized lending transactions were transferred to the Non-life Run-off segment during 2015. 

Liability for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses 

The liability for losses and LAE, also referred to as loss reserves, represents our gross estimates before reinsurance for unpaid reported losses and losses that have been incurred but not reported ("IBNR") for our Non-life Run-off, Atrium and StarStone segments. We recognize an asset for the portion of the liability that we expect to recover from reinsurers. LAE reserves include allocated loss adjustment expenses ("ALAE"), and unallocated loss adjustment expenses ("ULAE"). ALAE are linked to the settlement of an individual claim or loss, whereas ULAE are based on our estimates of future costs to administer the claims. 

Loss Reserving 

We establish reserves for individual claims incurred and reported, as well as IBNR claims. We use considerable judgment in estimating losses for reported claims on an individual claim basis based upon our knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the claim, the severity of the injury or damage, the jurisdiction of the occurrence, the potential for ultimate exposure, the type of loss, and our experience with the line of business and policy provisions relating to the particular type of claim. We also use considerable judgment to establish reserves for IBNR claims using a variety of generally accepted actuarial methodologies and procedures to estimate the ultimate cost of settling IBNR claims. See "Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies - Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses" for a description of our loss reserving process. 

The estimation of unpaid claim liabilities at any given point in time is subject to a high degree of uncertainty for a number of reasons. A significant amount of time can lapse between the assumption of risk, the occurrence of a loss event, the reporting of the event to an insurance or reinsurance company and the ultimate payment of the claim on the loss event. Our actuarial methodologies include industry benchmarking which, under certain methodologies, compares the trend of our loss development to that of the industry. To the extent that the trend of our loss development compared to the industry changes in any period, it is likely to have an impact on the estimate of ultimate liabilities. Unpaid claim liabilities for property and casualty exposures in general are impacted by changes in the legal environment, jury awards, medical cost trends and general inflation. Certain estimates for unpaid claim liabilities involve considerable uncertainty due to significant coverage litigation, and it can be unclear whether past claim experience will be representative of future claim experience. Ultimate values for such claims cannot be estimated using reserving techniques that extrapolate losses to an ultimate basis using loss development factors, and the uncertainties surrounding the estimation of unpaid claim liabilities are not likely to be resolved in the near future. In addition, reserves are established to cover loss development related to both known and unasserted claims. Consequently, our subsequent estimates of ultimate losses and LAE, and our liability for losses and LAE, may differ materially from our initial estimates. 

&#32;In our Non-life Run-off segment, policy buy-backs and commutations provide an opportunity for us to exit and settle exposures to policies with insureds and reinsureds, often at a discount to the previously estimated ultimate liability. Commutations are beneficial to us as they extinguish liabilities and reduce the potential for future adverse loss 

development. Our estimates of ultimate liabilities and our estimates of IBNR reserves are based upon actuarial methodologies applied to the remaining non-commuted aggregate exposures and revised historical loss development information, after adjusting for the elimination of historical loss development relating to commuted and bought-back exposures. In addition, the routine settlement of claims, at either below or above the carried advised loss reserve, updates historical loss development information to which actuarial methodologies are applied often, resulting in revised estimates of ultimate liabilities. Our loss reserves are largely related to casualty exposures and include latent exposures primarily relating to asbestos and environmental. In establishing reserves, we consider facts currently known and the current state of the law and coverage litigation. Liabilities are recognized for known claims (including the cost of related litigation) when sufficient information has been developed to indicate the involvement of a specific insurance policy, and we can reasonably estimate its liability. 

Reconciliation of Claims Reserves 

A reconciliation of activity in the liability for losses and LAE is included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included within Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Loss Reserve Development 

The loss development tables for each segment below show the year-end reserves from 2005 through 2015 and the subsequent changes in those reserves presented on a historical basis. The reserves for our Atrium and StarStone segments are presented from the date of acquisition. We re-estimate the reserves as more information becomes known about the frequency and severity of losses for individual years. Prior period estimates of net liabilities may change as our management considers the combined impact of commutations, policy buy-backs, settlement of losses on carried reserves and the trend of incurred loss development compared to prior forecasts. 

The information in the tables is presented in accordance with the reporting requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and differs substantially from other formats and information commonly reported by the insurance industry, such as accident year or underwriting year. 

A redundancy means the original estimate was higher than the current estimate; a deficiency means that the current estimate is higher than the original estimate. The "Reserve redundancy" line represents, as of the date indicated, the difference between the latest re-estimated liability and the reserves as originally estimated. Also included in the loss development tables is the impact of foreign exchange rate movements during each year presented. Portions of our loss reserves relate to claims expected to be paid in currencies other than our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar. Movements in foreign exchange rates, therefore, result in variations in our estimated net loss reserves, and such variations are recognized as they arise in our consolidated statements of earnings. 

Conditions and trends that have affected development of the ultimate liability in the past may not necessarily occur in the future. Accordingly, it may not be appropriate to extrapolate redundancies or deficiencies into the future based on the tables below. 

Further information regarding net incurred losses and LAE is included in "Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditio n and Results of Operations - Results of Operations by Segment."

Life and Annuity Benefits and Claims Reserves 

We estimate our life and annuity benefit and claim reserves on a present value basis using standard actuarial techniques and cash flow models. We establish and maintain our life and annuity reser ves at a level that we estimate will, when taken together with future premium payments and investment income expected to be earned on associated premiums, be sufficient to support future cash flow benefit obligations and third-party servicing obligations as they become payable. 

The following table summarizes our policy benefits for life and annuity contracts as at December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 :

Investments 

For information regarding our investment strategy, portfolio and results, refer to "Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Investments." 

Ratings 

In our active underwriting businesses, financial strength ratings are an important factor in establishing competitive position and in product marketing. Financial strength ratings by third-party organizations provide an opinion of an insurer&#8217;s or reinsurer&#8217;s financial strength and ability to meet ongoing obligations to its policyholders. These ratings reflect A.M. Best&#8217;s, S&#38;P&#8217;s, and Fitch&#8217;s opinions of capitalization, performance and management, and are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold our securities. These ratings may be changed, suspended or withdrawn at the discretion of the agencies. These rating agencies charge us fees for their services. 

Our Lloyd&#8217;s Syndicates 609 (Atrium) and 1301 (StarStone) are part of a group rating for the Lloyd's overall market. Lloyd&#8217;s is rated "A" (Excellent) by A.M. Best, "A+" (Strong) by Standard and Poor&#8217;s (or S&#38;P) and "AA-" (Very Strong) by Fitch Ratings. 

StarStone&#8217;s operating insurance entities have been assigned a financial strength rating of "A-" (Excellent) by A.M. Best. The A.M. Best rating for StarStone of "A-" (Excellent) by A.M. Best is the fourth highest of 16 rating levels. 

Refer to "Item 1A. Risk Factors - Downgrades of financial strength ratings at StarStone or Lloyd&#8217;s could materially and negatively impact our active underwriting business and our company," for more information regarding the importance of financial strength ratings. 

Competition 

Our Non-life Run-off and Life and Annuities segments compete in international markets with domestic and international reinsurance companies to acquire and manage insurance and reinsurance companies in run-off and portfolios of insurance and reinsurance business in run-off. The acquisition and management of companies and portfolios in run-off is highly competitive, and driven by a number of factors, including proposed acquisition price, reputation, and financial resources. Some of these competitors have greater financial resources than we do, have been operating for longer than we have and have established long-term and continuing business relationships throughout the insurance and reinsurance industries, which can be a significant competitive advantage. As a result, we may not be able to compete successfully in the future for suitable acquisition candidates or run-off portfolio management engagements. 

Our Atrium and StarStone active underwriting segments operate in the highly competitive insurance and reinsurance markets, where companies compete on the basis of many factors, including premium rates, reputation and perceived financial strength, the terms and conditions of the products offered, ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, speed of claims payments and quality of administrative services, relationships with insurance and reinsurance companies and insurance intermediaries, capacity and coverage offered, experience in the particular risk to be underwritten, and various other factors. 

Atrium and StarStone compete in the international insurance and reinsurance markets directly with numerous other parties, including established global insurance and reinsurance companies, start-up insurance and reinsurance entities, other Lloyd&#8217;s syndicates, as well as capital markets and securitization structures aimed at managing risk. Many of these competitors have significant operating histories, underwriting expertise and capacity, extensive capital resources, and longstanding customer relationships. Any of these factors can be a significant competitive advantage and may make it difficult for us to write business effectively and profitably. Because few barriers exist to prevent insurers and reinsurers from entering the non-life active underwriting business, market conditions and capital capacity influence the degree of competition at any specific point in time. Periods of intense competition, which typically include broader coverage terms, lower prices and excess underwriting capacity, are referred to as a "soft market," while a favorable insurance market is referred to as a "hard market" and is characterized by stricter coverage terms, higher prices and lower underwriting capacity. Historically, the performance of the non-life active underwriting business has tended to fluctuate in cyclical periods of price competition and excess underwriting capacity, followed by periods of high premium rates and shortages of underwriting capacity. This cyclical market pattern can be more pronounced in the specialty insurance and reinsurance markets in which Atrium and S tarStone compete. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had 1,327 &#32;employees, as compared to 1,201 as of December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to employees added in connection with the Sussex and Alpha acquisitions. Our employee count is not expected to be consistent from period to period due to our business strategies, which include anticipated ongoing acquisition and integration activities. As of December 31, 2015, the percentage of our total employees in each segment was approximately as follows: Non-life Run-off, 55%; StarStone, 29%; Atrium, 12%; and Life and Annuities, 4%. 

Financial Information About Geographic Areas 

For financial information about geographic areas, see "Note 22 - Segment Information" in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included within Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Enterprise Risk Management 

Risk assumption is inherent in our business and appropriately setting risk appetite and executing our business strategies in accordance therewith is key to our performance. Effective risk oversight is an important priority for our Boards of Directors (both at the Company level and at a subsidiary level), and we place strong emphasis on ensuring we have a robust risk management framework to identify, measure, manage, report and monitor risks that affect the achievement of our strategic, operational and financial objectives. 

The overall objective of our enterprise risk management ("ERM") framework is to support good risk governance, support the achievement of business objectives, and provide overall benefits to us by adding value to the control environment and contributing to an effective business strategy, efficiency in operations and processes, strong financial performance, reliable financial reporting, regulatory compliance, a good reputation with key stakeholders, business continuity planning, and capital planning.

Our ERM framework consists of numerous processes and controls that have been designed by our senior management (including our risk management team), with oversight by our Board of Directors and its committees, management by our executive leaders, and implementation by employees across our organization. Accountability for the implementation and oversight of risk appetite and processes is aligned with individual corporate executives. Risk committees and boards receive regular risk management information to support risk governance at the group and subsidiary levels. 

Board of Directors 

The Board of Directors and its committees have risk oversight responsibility and play an active role in overseeing management of the risks we face. Our Underwriting and Risk Committee has responsibility for the oversight of underwriting strategy and ERM, reviews our overall risk appetite with input from management, reviews our ERM methodologies and oversees management&#8217;s execution of our ERM objectives. Our Audit Committee, comprised entirely of independent directors, oversees our accounting and financial reporting-related risks. Our Investment Committee is responsible for overseeing investment-related risk, including those related to our cash and investment portfolio and investment strategy. Our Compensation Committee oversees compensation-related risks; and our Nominating and Governance Committee is responsible for overseeing corporate governance-related risks. 

Executive and Risk Management Organization 

Our Global ERM Committee ("GERMC"), a group of senior management personnel charged with assessing all significant risk issues on a global basis, reviews and evaluates the risks to which the Group is exposed, and monitors and oversees the guidelines and policies that govern the processes by which the Group identifies, assesses and manages its exposure to risk. The GERMC is chaired by the Chief Risk Officer ("CRO"). Its membership includes our Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), Chief Integration Officer ("CIO") and senior management from across our corporate functions and business units. Our CRO reports periodically on behalf of the GERMC to both the Underwriting and Risk Committee and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. 

In addition to director oversight, our ERM governance structure is directed by local jurisdictional and subsidiary risk committees, which include senior management and members of the global senior management team. The committees provide oversight and governance of our ERM initiatives, oversee the operation of our internal controls, monitor the identified risks compared to our risk appetite, and provide analysis to management in order to appropriately manage and govern the business and the associated risks on a day-to-day basis. 

Our Risk Management department focuses primarily on implementing and overseeing the administration of the Underwriting and Risk Committee and GERMC directives and facilitating an efficient, effective and consistent approach to ERM across our Group. Our Internal Audit department independently reviews the effectiveness of our ERM framework. The results of audits are monitored by the Audit Committee. Our executive management committees have oversight of specific risk management processes, including, for example, those relating to underwriting, investments and reserving matters. 

Entity Level Management 

At the operating subsidiary level, risks attendant to our individual insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are also overseen by the subsidiary boards of directors, subsidiary risk committees and other committees, and management teams, consistent with applicable regulatory requirements and our risk management framework. 

Certain risks related to our Atrium and StarStone segments are distinct from our Non-life Run-off and Life and Annuities segments, and these businesses include external stakeholders that also differ from our other businesses, including our joint venture partners, rating agencies, and, with respect to Atrium, third-party Lloyd&#8217;s names who provide approximately 75% of the underwriting capacity to Syndicate 609. Accordingly, in addition to the Group oversight of risks relating to our active underwriting businesses, Atrium and StarStone each maintain dedicated risk governance and management frameworks to manage risk, return and capital in their individual businesses, which fit into and form part of our Group ERM framework. These include oversight at the Atrium and StarStone holding company boards of directors, as well as executive risk committees and other committees that manage and monitor risks relevant to specified functional areas. Individualized risk policies and risk appetites are established and tailored to the specific needs of Atrium and StarStone, respectively. Enstar senior executives serve as members of the Atrium and StarStone boards of directors and certain committees. 

Each regulated insurance and reinsurance subsidiary has its own risk register documenting its risk landscape with risk and control owners assigned, which is maintained through a risk management software system. The Group information technology department maintains risk registers with more detailed IT and information security-specific risks. We recognize the importance of information technology and management of data in supporting our businesses, and we utilize a number of technology platforms to assist in our ERM, underwriting, investments, financial and regulatory reporting processes and procedures across our organization. We review and seek to enhance our technology platforms on an ongoing basis. 

We frequently conduct the risk assessment process for the Group and for each of our regulated insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries. The assessment process utilizes a risk management software system. The risk management department reviews and consolidates these risk assessments on a quarterly basis and aggregates the assessment at a jurisdictional and G roup level to facilitate discussion and challenge and to assess the overall risk categories. 

Risk Appetite 

Our risk appetite considers material risks relating to, among other things, strategic risk, insurance risk, market risk, liquidity risk, credit/counterparty risk, operational risk, and regulatory/reputational risk. Our risk appetite is established at the Group level and represents the amount of risk that we are willing to accept compared to risk metrics based on our shareholders equity, capital resources, potential financial loss, and other risk-specific measures. Risk levels are monitored and any deviations from pre-established levels are reported in order to facilitate responsive action. 

Our non-life run-off and life and annuities subsidiaries set individual risk appetites and risk level monitoring consistent with the Group-wide risk management framework. 

Atrium and StarStone establish individual risk appetites unique to each business, aligned to their business plan and strate gy and consistent with the Group-wide risk management framework. Their risk appetites are set in conjunction with annual business planning and include, among other things, risk tolerances with respect to risk categories and underwriting limits by individual lines of business. We consider and review group risk aggregation across our active underwriting businesses. 

Risk Categories 

We manage our ERM process based on the major categories of risk within our business discussed below. Our ERM is a dynamic process, with updates continually being made as a result of changes in our business, industry and the economic environment. This process and our controls cannot provide absolute assurance that our risk management objectives will be met or that all risks will be appropriately identified and managed, and accordingly, the possibility of material adverse effects on our company remains. See "Item 1A. Risk Factors" for important information on the risks we face. 

Strategic Risk . Strategic risk is the risk of unintended adverse impact on the business plan objectives arising from business decisions, improper implementation of those decisions, inability to adapt to changes in the external environment, or circumstances that are beyond our control. We manage strategic risk by utilizing a strategic business planning process involving our executive management and Board of Directors. Our annual business plan is reviewed and overseen by our executive management and Board of Directors, and actual performance, trends, and uncertainties are monitored in comparison to the plan throughout the year. We specifically evaluate acquisition opportunities pursuant to a detailed and proprietary process that takes into account, among other things, the risk of the transaction and potential returns, the portfolio&#8217;s risk exposures, claims management practices, reserve requirements and outstanding claims, as well as risks specifically related to our ability to integrate the acquired business. Our governance process, led by our Board of Directors, reviews newly proposed transaction opportunities, capital-raising matters, and other significant business initiatives. 

Insurance Risk . Insurance risk refers to the risks spanning many aspects of our insurance operations, including underwriting risk, risk assumed upon acquisitions/portfolio transfers, risk associated with our reserving assumptions, and life and annuities portfolio risk. 

Underwriting risk in our active underwriting businesses relates to the inherent uncertainty as to the occurrence, amount and timing of insurance liabilities we assume through our underwriting process. Our Atrium and StarStone subsidiaries manage exposure levels across risk categories to maintain them within the approved risk appetite. Underwriting risk management strategies may differ depending on the line of business involved and the type of account being insured or reinsured. 

We strive to mitigate underwriting risk through our controls and strategies, including our underwriting risk selection, diversification of our underwriting portfolios by class and geography, purchasing reinsurance, establishing a business plan and associated parameters, underwriting peer review, authority limits, underwriting guidelines that provide detailed underwriting criteria and a framework for pricing, along with the use of specialized underwriting teams supported by actuarial, catastrophe modeling, claims, risk management, legal, finance, and other technical personnel. 

We utilize internally developed pricing models to evaluate individual underwriting decisions within the context of business plans and risk appetites. We also use internally developed capital models, which provide information on key risks and facilitate an understanding of the interaction among the risks and related exposures, as a comprehensive tool for business and capital planning. 

In some business lines we are exposed to multiple insured losses arising out of a single peril, such as a natural catastrophe event (for example, a hurricane, windstorm, tornado, flood or earthquake) or a man-made event (for example, war, terrorism, airplane crashes and other transportation-related accidents, or building fires). We model and manage our individual and aggregate exposures to these events and other material correlated exposures in accordance with our risk appetite. Our modeling process utilizes a major commercial vendor model to measure certain of these exposures. The incidence, timing and severity of catastrophes and other event types are inherently unpredictable, and it is difficult to estimate the amount of loss any given occurrence will generate. Accordingly, there is material uncertainty around our ability to measure exposures, which can cause actual exposures and losses to deviate from our estimates. 

To monitor catastrophe risk, we review exceedance probability curves aggregated across Atrium and StarStone together with aggregated realistic disaster scenarios. We consider occurrence exceedance probability and aggregate exceedance probability, which reflect losses resulting from single or multiple events, from individual perils and in the aggregate. In addition, Atrium manages its underwriting exposure through a combination of reporting zonal aggregations, realistic disaster scenarios and stochastic modeling. StarStone also manages its underwriting exposure through monitoring realistic disaster scenarios for man-made events and certain natural catastrophe risks, and applying absolute maximum limits by line of business. 

We manage acquisition and reserving risks through our acquisition evaluation process, and reserving practices discussed above in "Operating Segments," as well as through our commutation and policy buy-back strategy and claims management practices. 

Market Risk . We are principally exposed to four types of market risk: interest rate risk, credit risk, equity price risk and foreign currency risk. We manage market risk in a number of ways, including use of investment guidelines; regular reviews of investment opportunities; market conditions; portfolio duration; oversight of the selection and performance of external asset managers; regular stress testing of the portfolio against known and hypothetical scenarios; established tolerance levels; and, where possible, foreign currency asset/liability matching. Investments are primarily managed by our Investment Department, which is overseen by our Investment Committee. 

Liquidity Risk . Liquidity risk is the risk that we are unable to realize investments and other assets in order to settle financial obligations when they fall due or that we would have to incur excessive cost to do so. We manage this risk generally by following a conservative investment strategy designed to emphasize the preservation of our invested assets and provide sufficient liquidity for the prompt payment of claims and contract liabilities, as well as for settlement of commutation payments. Liquidity risk also includes the risk of our dependence of our future cash flows upon the availability of dividends or other statutorily permissible payments from our subsidiaries, which is limited by applicable laws and regulations. We manage this risk through our capital planning processes, which include reviews of minimum capital resources requirements at our regulated subsidiaries and anticipated distributions, as well as anticipated capital needs. 

Credit / Counterparty Risk . Credit risk relates to the uncertainty of a counterparty&#8217;s ability to make timely payments in accordance with contractual terms of the instrument or contract. We are exposed to direct credit risk primarily within our portfolios of fixed maturity and short-term investments, and through customers, brokers and reinsurers in the form of premiums receivable and reinsurance recoverables. In our run-off businesses, we manage credit risk with respect to our reinsurance recoverables by ongoing monitoring of counterparty ratings and working to achieve prompt payment of reinsured claims, as well as through our commutation strategy. In our active underwriting businesses, we firstly mitigate credit risk through our reinsurance purchasing process, where reinsurers are subject to financial security and rating requirements prior to approval and by limiting exposure to individual reinsurers. Thereafter we manage credit risk by the regular monitoring of reinsurance recoveries and premium due directly or via brokers and other intermediaries. In our fixed maturity and short-term investment portfolios, we attempt to mitigate credit risk through diversification and issuer exposure limitation. 

Operational Risk . Operational risk is the risk of a loss arising from inadequate or failed internal processes, or from external events, personnel, systems or third parties. Due to our acquisitive strategy, operational risk also includes risks and challenges associated with integrating new companies into the Group. We seek to mitigate operational risks through the application of our policies and procedures and internal control and compliance processes throughout the Group and a focus on acquisition integration and assimilation of new companies into our internal control systems, including but not limited to business continuity planning, information security procedures, financial reporting controls and a review process for material third-party vendor usage. 

Regulatory / Reputational Risk . Regulatory and &#32; reputational risk is the risk that an act or omission by us or any of our employees could result in damage to our reputation or loss of trust among our stakeholders. We manage reputational risk through a focus on compliance with laws and regulations, adherence to our policies and procedures (including our Code of Conduct) and our internal controls, an established corporate governance framework and practices, and communication and engagement with external stakeholders. 

Regulation 

General 

The business of insurance and reinsurance is regulated in most countries, although the degree and type of regulation varies significantly from one jurisdiction to another. Our material operations are in Bermuda, the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia and several European countries. We are subject to extensive regulation under the applicable statutes in these countries and any others in which we operate. In addition, the Bermuda Monetary Authority ("BMA") began acting as group supervisor of our insurance and reinsurance companies (our "Group") on January 1, 2016. A summary of the material regulations governing us in these countries is set forth below. 

We may become subject in the future to regulation in new jurisdictions or additional regulations in existing jurisdictions de pending on the location and nature of any companies acquired and the volume and location of business being written by our existing companies. 

Bermuda 

The Insurance Act 1978 of Bermuda and related regulations, as amended (together, the "Insurance Act"), regulate the insurance and reinsurance business of our operating subsidiaries in Bermuda. The Insurance Act imposes certain solvency and liquidity standards and auditing and reporting requirements and grants the BMA powers to supervise, investigate, require information and the production of documents and intervene in the affairs of insurance companies. 

Significant requirements pertaining to our regulated Bermuda subsidiaries vary depending on the class in which our company is registered, but generally include the appointment of a principal representative in Bermuda, the appointment of an independent auditor, the appointment of an approved loss reserve specialist, the filing of annual statutory financial statements, the filing of statutory financial returns, compliance with group solvency and supervision rules (if applicable), and compliance with the Insurance Code of Conduct (relating to corporate governance, risk management and internal controls). 

Our regulated Bermuda subsidiaries must also comply with a minimum liquidity ratio and minimum solvency margin. The minimum liquidity ratio requires that the value of relevant assets must not be less than 75% of the amount of relevant liabilities. The minimum solvency margin, which varies depending on the class of the insurer, is determined as a percentage of either net reserves for losses and LAE or premiums or pursuant to a risk-based capital measure. StarStone Insurance Bermuda Limited, a Class 4 insurer, and Cavello Bay Reinsurance Limited, a Class 3A insurer, both domiciled in Bermuda, are subject to an enhanced capital requirement ("ECR") determined pursuant to a risk-based capital measure. 

Each of our regulated Bermuda subsidiaries would be prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends if it were in breach of its minimum solvency margin or liquidity ratio or if the declaration or payment of such dividends would cause it to fail to meet such margin or ratio. In addition, each of our regulated Bermuda subsidiaries is prohibited, without the prior approval of the BMA, from reducing by 15% or more its total statutory capital as set out in its previous year&#8217;s statutory financial statements. Our Bermuda insurance companies that are in run-off are required to seek BMA approval for any dividends or distributions. 

The BMA&#8217;s group supervision objective is to provide a coordinated approach to the regulation of an insurance group and its supervisory and capital requirements. Bermuda has been recognized by the U.S. National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") as a qualified jurisdiction. Recognition by the E.U. of Bermuda's full equivalence under Solvency II is subject to a three-month review process of a delegated act sent to the European Parliament and 

Council. This review process commenced on November 26, 2015 and, if the act is agreed, Solvency II equivalence is expected to be effective retroactively from January 1, 2016. 

As our Group supervisor, the BMA performs a number of functions including: (i) coordinating the gathering and dissemination of information for other regulatory authorities; (ii) carrying out a supervisory review and assessment of our Group; (iii) carrying out an assessment of our Group's compliance with the rules on solvency, risk concentration, intra-group transactions and good governance procedures; (iv) planning and coordinating, through regular meetings with other authorities, supervisory activities in respect of our Group; (v) coordinating any enforcement action that may need to be taken against our Group or any Group members; and (vi) coordinating meetings of colleges of supervisors in order to facilitate the carrying out of these functions. StarStone Insurance Bermuda Limited has been named as our Group&#8217;s Designated Insurer. As Designated Insurer, StarStone Insurance Bermuda Limited is required to facilitate compliance by our Group with the insurance solvency and supervision rules. 

On an annual basis, the Group is required to file Group statutory financial statements, a Group statutory financial return, a Group capital and solvency return, audited Group financial statements and a Group Solvency Self-Assessment ("GSSA") with the BMA. The GSSA is designed to document our perspective on the capital resources necessary to achieve our business strategies and remain solvent, and to provide the BMA with insights on our risk management, governance procedures and documentation related to this process. In addition, SIBL and the Group are required to file a quarterly financial return with the BMA. 

We are required to maintain available Group statutory capital and surplus in an amount that is at least equal to the group enhanced capital requirement ("Group ECR"). The BMA has also established a group target capital level equal to 120% of the Group ECR. 

The BMA also maintains supervision over the controllers of all Bermuda registered insurers, and accordingly, any person who, directly or indirectly, becomes a holder of at least 10%, 20%, 33% or 50% of our ordinary shares must notify the BMA in writing within 45 days of becoming such a holder (or ceasing to be such a holder). The BMA may object to such a person and require the holder to reduce its holding of ordinary shares and direct, among other things, that voting rights attaching to the ordinary shares shall not be exercisable. 

United Kingdom and Lloyd&#8217;s 

United Kingdom 

Our U.K.-based insurance subsidiaries consist primarily of run-off companies and StarStone Insurance Limited. These subsidiaries are authorized by the U.K. Prudential Regulatory Authority (the "PRA"), and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (the "FCA", together with the PRA, the "U.K. Regulator"). Our U.K. run-off subsidiaries may not underwrite new business without the approval of the U.K. Regulator. E.U. directives also allow certain of our regulated U.K. subsidiaries to conduct business in E.U. states other than the U.K. within the scope of permission granted by the U.K. Regulator without the necessity of additional licensing or authorization in E.U. countries. 

Our U.K.-based insurance subsidiaries are required to maintain adequate financial resources in accordance with the requirements of the U.K. Regulator. The calculation of the minimum capital resources requirements in any particular case depends on, among other things, the type and amount of insurance business written and claims paid by the insurance company. 

In addition, until January 1, 2016, the U.K. Regulator&#8217;s Individual Capital Adequacy Standards ("ICAS") framework required insurance companies to carry out various capital modeling and risk management exercises in order to calculate a company-specific Individual Capital Assessment ("ICA") amount, which was the company&#8217;s internal calculation of its capital requirements under the ICAS framework. For companies in run-off, the U.K. Regulator typically required specific loadings (i.e., increasing the company's estimated capital requirements by a specified percentage) to be applied to a company&#8217;s ICA (as stipulated by the U.K. Regulator) in order to calculate a company&#8217;s Individual Capital Guidance ("ICG"), which represents the amount of capital a company was required to hold at all times such that there would be no material risk that its policyholder liabilities could not be met as they fell due. 

The Solvency II framework directive took effect on January 1, 2016, although our U.K. subsidiaries had been preparing for compliance in the years leading up to its effectiveness. Solvency II sets out new E.U.-wide requirements on capital adequacy and risk management for insurers with the aim of further increasing policyholder protection, instilling greater risk awareness and improving the international competitiveness of E.U. insurers. In place of the ICAS framework, insurers must now comply with a Solvency Capital Requirement ("SCR"), which is calculated using either the Solvency II standard formula or a bespoke internal model. Our non-Lloyd's U.K. companies intend to use the standard formula. 

The U.K. Regulator&#8217;s rules require our U.K. insurance subsidiaries to obtain regulatory approval for any proposed or actual payment of a dividend. Until January 1, 2016, the U.K. Regulator used the ICG and the estimated SCR when assessing requests to make distributions. From January 1, 2016, the U.K. Regulator uses the SCR, among other tests, when assessing requests to make distributions. 

Under the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 ("FSMA"), any company or individual (together with its or his concert parties) proposing to directly or indirectly acquire "control" over a U.K. authorized insurance company (which is generally defined as acquiring 10% or more of the shares or voting power in a U.K. authorized insurance company or its parent company) must seek prior approval of the U.K. Regulator of his intention to do so. A person who is already deemed to have "control" will require prior regulatory approval if the person increases the level of "control" beyond 20%, 30% and 50%. 

Lloyd&#8217;s 

We participate in the Lloyd&#8217;s market through our interests in: (i) Atrium&#8217;s Syndicate 609, which is managed by Atrium Underwriters Limited, a Lloyd's managing agent, and the Atrium corporate member; (ii) StarStone&#8217;s Syndicate 1301, which is managed by StarStone Underwriting Limited ("SUL"), a Lloyd&#8217;s managing agent, and the StarStone corporate member; and (iii) Syndicate 2008, a wholly aligned syndicate that has permission to underwrite RITC business and other run-off or discontinued business type transactions with other Lloyd&#8217;s syndicates, and its corporate member. During 2015, SUL assumed the role of managing agent for Syndicate 2008 in place of Shelbourne Syndicate Services Limited as we streamlined our organizational structure and combined Shelbourne and StarStone resources into one agency. 

Our Lloyd&#8217;s operations are subject to authorization and regulation by the U.K. Regulator and compliance with the Lloyd&#8217;s Act(s) and Byelaws and regulations, as well as the applicable provisions of the FSMA. The Council of Lloyd&#8217;s has wide discretionary powers to regulate members&#8217; underwriting, and its exercise of these powers might affect the return on an investment of the corporate member in a given underwriting year. This discretion includes the ability to assess up to 3% of a member&#8217;s underwriting capacity in any one year as a Central Fund contribution. 

The underwriting capacity of a member of Lloyd&#8217;s must be supported by providing a deposit (referred to as "Funds at Lloyd&#8217;s") in the form of cash, securities or letters of credit in satisfaction of its capital requirement. The amount of the Funds at Lloyd&#8217;s is assessed annually and is determined by Lloyd&#8217;s in accordance with applicable capital adequacy rules. 

Business plans, including maximum underwriting capacity, for Lloyd&#8217;s syndicates requires annual approval by the Lloyd&#8217;s Franchise Board, which may require changes to any business plan or additional capital to support underwriting plans. 

In order to achieve finality and to release their capital, Lloyd&#8217;s members are usually required to have transferred their liabilities through an approved RITC, such as offered by Syndicate 2008. RITC is generally put in place after the third year of a syndicate year of account. On successful conclusion of RITC, any profit from the syndicate for that year of account can be remitted by the managing agent to the syndicate&#8217;s members. 

The Lloyd&#8217;s market has applied the Solvency II internal model under Lloyd&#8217;s supervision, and our Lloyd&#8217;s operations are required to meet Solvency II standards. Effective January 1, 2016, the Society of Lloyd's received approval from the PRA to use its internal model under the Solvency II regime. 

Lloyd&#8217;s approval is required before any person can acquire control of a Lloyd&#8217;s managing agent or Lloyd&#8217;s corporate member. 

United States 

Our insurance and reinsurance companies domiciled in the United States consist of property and casualty companies and life and annuities companies in run-off, as well as StarStone Specialty Insurance Company (a U.S. excess and surplus lines insurer) and StarStone National Insurance Company (a U.S. admitted insurer that is licensed in all 50 states and the District of Columbia). Our U.S. insurers are subject to extensive governmental regulation and supervision by the states in which they are domiciled, licensed and/or eligible to conduct business. The insurance laws and regulations of the state of domicile have the most significant impact on operations. We currently have U.S. insurers domiciled in Illinois, Michigan, New York, South Carolina, Delaware and Rhode Island, with two of these insurers also commercially domiciled in California. 

Generally, regulatory authorities have broad regulatory powers over such matters as licenses, standards of solvency, premium rates, policy forms, marketing practices, claims practices, investments, security deposits, restrictions on size of risks that may be insured under a single policy, methods of accounting, form and content of financial statements, reserves and provisions for unearned premiums, unpaid losses and LAE, reinsurance, minimum capital and surplus requirements, dividends and other distributions to shareholders, periodic examinations, annual and other report filings, and transactions among affiliates. 

U.S. insurers are also required to maintain minimum levels of solvency and liquidity as determined by law, and to comply with risk-based capital requirements and licensing rules. Insurers having less statutory surplus than required by the risk-based capital calculation will be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action. If any of our U.S. insurers were to have risk-based capital levels that are below required levels, they would be subject to increased regulatory scrutiny and control by their domestic and possibly other insurance regulators. As of December 31, 2015, all of our U.S. insurers exceeded their required levels of risk-based capital. 

Applicable insurance laws also limit the amount of dividends or other distributions our U.S. insurers can pay to us. The insurance regulatory limitations are generally based on statutory net income and/or certain levels of statutory surplus as determined by the insurer&#8217;s state or states of domicile. Generally, prior regulatory approval must be obtained before an insurer may pay a dividend or make a distribution above a specified level. 

All states have enacted legislation regulating insurance holding company systems that requires each insurance company in the system to register with the insurance department of its state of domicile and furnish information concerning the operations of companies within the holding company system that may materially affect the operations, management or financial condition of the insurers within the system. The NAIC has adopted amendments to the Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act and associated regulations, which all states in which our U.S. insurers are domiciled or commercially domiciled have adopted. The amendments provide the regulators with additional tools to evaluate risks to an insurance company within the insurance holding company system. They impose more extensive informational requirements on parents and other affiliates of licensed insurers with the purpose of protecting them from enterprise risk, including requiring an annual enterprise risk report by the ultimate controlling person of the insurers identifying the material risks within the insurance holding company system that could pose enterprise risk to the insurers and requiring a person divesting its controlling interest to make a confidential advance notice filing. 

The NAIC has also adopted the Risk Management and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment Model Act, which requires insurers to maintain a risk management framework and establishes a legal requirement for insurers or their insurance group to conduct an Own Risk and Solvency Assessment ("ORSA") in accordance with the NAIC&#8217;s ORSA Guidance Manual. The ORSA Model Act has been adopted in all of the states in which our U.S. insurers are domiciled with the exception of South Carolina, and our insurers in these states may become subject to ORSA requirements beginning in 2016 if certain premium thresholds are exceeded. Where applicable, we must regularly conduct an ORSA consistent with the ORSA Model Act, including undertaking an internal risk management review no less often than annually and preparing a summary report assessing the adequacy of risk management and capital in light of our insurers&#8217; current and future business plans. 

The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act"), represents a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry within the United States and, among other things, established the Financial Services Oversight Council and created within the United States Department of the Treasury a Federal Insurance Office. These bodies are authorized to study, monitor and report to Congress on the U.S. insurance industry and the significance of global reinsurance to the U.S. insurance market. The Dodd-Frank Act also authorizes the federal preemption of certain state insurance laws and streamlines the regulation of reinsurance and surplus lines/non-admitted insurance. Many provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act continue to become effective over time, and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act require the implementation of regulations that have not yet been adopted. These regulations may affect our industry and our business. 

Before a person can acquire control of a domestic insurer (including a reinsurer) or any person controlling such insurer (including acquiring control of Enstar Group Limited), prior written approval must be obtained from the insurance commissioner of the state in which the domestic insurer is domiciled and, under certain circumstances, from insurance commissioners in other jurisdictions. Generally, state statutes and regulations provide that "control" over a domestic insurer or person controlling a domestic insurer is presumed to exist if any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds with the power to vote, or holds proxies representing, 10% or more of the voting securities or securities convertible into voting securities of the domestic insurer or of a person who controls the domestic insurer. 

One of our Pavonia companies has a Canadian branch operation, which is subject to regulation by the Office of Superintendent of Financial Institutions in Canada. Canadian regulations require compliance with risk-based capital measures and also place certain restrictions on dividends. 

Australia 

Our Australian regulated insurance entities (which include our insurance subsidiary and our non-operating holding company) are subject to prudential supervision by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority ("APRA"). APRA is the primary regulatory body responsible for regulating compliance with the Insurance Act 1973. APRA has issued prudential standards that apply to general insurers in relation to capital adequacy, the holding of assets in Australia, risk management, business continuity management, reinsurance management, outsourcing, audit and actuarial reporting and valuation, the transfer and amalgamation of insurance businesses, governance, and the fit and proper assessment of the insurer&#8217;s responsible persons. 

APRA&#8217;s prudential standards require that all insurers maintain and meet prescribed capital adequacy requirements to enable their insurance obligations to be met under a wide range of circumstances. 

As of January 1, 2015, APRA introduced revised prudential standards on risk management and governance. These requirements include the need for regulated insurance entities to have a risk management framework that is consistent and integrated with its risk profile and capital strength, supported by a risk management function and subject to comprehensive review. APRA&#8217;s proposed risk management enhancements include the requirement that regulated insurance entities have a board risk committee that provides the Board with objective non-executive oversight of the implementation and on-going operation of its risk management framework, and the requirement that regulated insurance entities designate a chief risk officer who is involved in, and provides effective challenge to, activities and decisions that may materially affect the regulated insurance entities&#8217; risk profile. Our Australian regulated insurance entities are compliant with these standards. 

An insurer must obtain APRA&#8217;s written consent prior to making any capital releases, including any payment of dividends in excess of current year earnings. Our insurance subsidiary must provide APRA a valuation prepared by an appointed actuary that demonstrates that the tangible assets of the insurer, after the proposed capital reduction, are sufficient to cover its insurance liabilities to a 99.5% level of sufficiency of capital before APRA will consent to a capital release or dividend. 

Under the Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Act 1998, the interest of an individual shareholder or a group of associated shareholders in an insurer is generally limited to a 15% "stake" of the insurer. A person&#8217;s stake is the aggregate of the person&#8217;s voting power and the voting power of the person&#8217;s associates. A higher percentage limit may be approved by the Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia on national interest grounds. Any shareholder of Enstar Group Limited with a "stake" greater than 15% has received approval to hold that stake from the Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia. 

Europe 

In addition to Bermuda, the United Kingdom, Australia and the United States, we have subsidiaries in Switzerland, Ireland and Belgium, as well as StarStone Insurance Europe AG, a Liechtenstein-based company that continues to underwrite new business. Certain of our U.K. entities also have branches in European jurisdictions. 

Our Swiss insurance subsidiary is regulated by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority ("FINMA") pursuant to the Insurance Supervisory Act 2004. This subsidiary is obligated to maintain a minimum solvency margin based on the Swiss Solvency Test regulations as stipulated by the Insurance Supervisory Act. From January 1, 2016, Switzerland has been granted full Solvency II equivalence by the European Commission. The amount of dividends that this subsidiary is permitted to distribute is restricted to freely distributable reserves, which consist of retained earnings, the current year profit and free reserves. Any dividend exceeding the current year profit requires FINMA&#8217;s approval. The solvency and capital requirements must continue to be met following any distribution. 

Our subsidiaries and branches in European jurisdictions such as Ireland, Belgium and Liechtenstein are regulated in their respective home countries. Typically, such regulation is for the protection of policyholders and ceding insurance companies rather than shareholders. Regulatory authorities generally have broad supervisory and administrative powers over such matters as licenses, standards of solvency, investments, reporting requirements relating to capital structure, ownership, financial condition and general business operations, special reporting and prior approval requirements with respect to certain transactions among affiliates, reserves for unpaid losses and LAE, reinsurance, minimum capital and surplus requirements, dividends and other distributions to shareholders, periodic examinations 

and annual and other report filings. The application of the Solvency II framework across such European jurisdictions from January 1, 2016 may result in a more uniform approach to regulation.
