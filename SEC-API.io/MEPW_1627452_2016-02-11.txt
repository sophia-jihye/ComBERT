General 

JAREX SOLUTIONS CORP. (&#147;the Company&#148;, &#147;we&#148;, &#147;us&#148; or &#147;our&#148;) was incorporated in the state of Nevada on October 28, 2014. We develop ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition) software for companies that have parking zones or access control on their sites. We develop a software based on the ANPR technologies in Latvia. Our software is intended to provide easy-to-use, high quality and cost-effective automation and management solutions based on ANPR technology. We intend to design and operate our systems as either a stand-alone solution or to be integrated with existing access control equipment. We plan to develop a wide range of ANPR access control applications including car parking, gated communities, factories, corporate facilities, warehouses, restricted areas, private areas, airports and schools. We plan to sell software and hardware and we intend to develop software which is easily integrated into existing security and video surveillance systems as well as to develop custom solutions in addition to existing surveillance systems. The software is designed and created by our sole officer and president Jaroslavna Tomsa. 

Our principal office address is located at Puces iela 47 dz.40, Riga, Latvia, LV-1082. Our plan of operation is forward-looking and there is no assurance that we will ever reach profitable operations.
