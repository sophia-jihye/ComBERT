 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Corporate Development 

&#160; 

Truli Media Group, Inc. (&#8220;Truli OK&#8221;), formerly known as SA Recovery Corp., was incorporated on July 28, 2008 in the State of Oklahoma. On June 13, 2012, the company entered into a Reorganization Agreement (the &#8220;Reorganization Agreement&#34;) with Truli Media Group, LLC, a Delaware Limited Liability Company (&#8220;Truli LLC&#8221;) and SA Recovery Merger Subsidiary, Inc., pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger. Under the terms of the agreement and plan of merger, all of Truli LLC&#8217;s membership interests were exchanged for shares of the Truli OK&#8217;s common stock, or, at the time, approximately 74% of the fully diluted issued and outstanding common stock of Truli OK. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the Reorganization Agreement, as part of the transaction the members of and other designees of Truli LLC acquired a controlling interest in Truli OK. The company was a publicly registered corporation with nominal operations immediately prior to the merger. For accounting purposes, Truli LLC was the surviving entity. 

&#160; 

On March 17, 2015 (&#8220;Effective Date&#8221;), Truli OK effected a merger with its newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary, Truli Media Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (&#8220;TMG&#8221;, &#8220;Truli&#8221; or, the &#8220;Company&#8221;) for the purposes of changing its state of incorporation to Delaware (the &#8220;Merger&#8221;). On the Effective Date, Truli OK also completed a reverse stock split as described below. Prior to the Merger, Truli OK was the sole stockholder of TMG. Upon completion of the Merger, Truli became the surviving entity. The Merger was effected through an agreement and plan of merger (&#8220;Merger Agreement&#8221;). 

&#160; 

The Merger, including the Merger Agreement, was approved by the board of directors of the Truli OK and a majority of the outstanding capital stock pursuant to a written consent of the stockholders. 

&#160; 

A certificate of merger was filed with both the Oklahoma Secretary of State and the Delaware Secretary of State on February 27, 2015. As a result of the Merger, the Company is subject to the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of TMG and shall be further governed by the Delaware General Corporation Law.

&#160;

&#160; 

On the Effective Date, every fifty shares of Truli OK&#8217;s issued and outstanding common stock (&#8220;Common Stock&#8221;) was converted into one share of TMG common stock (&#8220;TMG Stock&#8221;) (the &#8220;Stock Split&#8221;). Every option and right to acquire Truli OK&#8217;s Common Stock and every outstanding warrant or right outstanding to purchase Truli OK&#8217;s Common Stock was automatically converted into options, warrants and rights to purchase TMG Stock whereby each option, warrant or right to purchase fifty shares of Common Stock was converted into an option, warrant or right to purchase one share of TMG Stock at 5,000% of the applicable exercise, conversion or strike price of such converted securities. The stockholders of the Company received no fractional shares of TMG and instead had every fractional share, option, warrant or right to purchase TMG Stock rounded up to the next whole number. Additionally, all debts and obligations of Truli OK were assumed by TMG. 

&#160; 

All references to common stock, share and per share amounts have been retroactively restated to reflect the 1:50 reverse stock split as if it had taken place as of the beginning of the earliest period presented. 

&#160; 

Business of the Company 

&#160; 

Truli serves as a collaborative digital platform for members of the faith and family community worldwide, allowing them to share and deepen their faith and family values together. Truli invites ministries from various religious denominations to upload their messages to the Truli platform, at no cost. Our goal is to have an ever expanding library from these participating ministries, centralizing, serving and extending the Christian and family values message to a greater audience than previously done before. This platform delivers all types of media content to Internet accessible devices such as computers and an assortment of digital mobile devices such as tablets and smart phones. Currently, there are roughly 12,000 videos in its library, with faith-based content currently representing roughly 40% of the Truli Platform with roughly 60% of the platform representing family entertainment such as feature films &#8220;G&#8221; and &#8220;PG&#8221; rated, music videos, children&#8217;s programming, sports, education, etc. Truli also currently streams 8 Christian Network Television channels on its website. The Truli platform is also available in the Spanish language on its platform which includes roughly 4,500 items in its library. &#160; 

&#160; 

Strategy and Plan of Operation 

&#160; 

Truli&#8217;s goal is to sign up as many ministries as possible throughout the United States and abroad. Truli is affiliated with over two hundred fifty ministries and churches, and allows them to deliver their content through the Truli platform. We hope to attract ministries to join our platform by potentially providing benefits to them including (i) expanded dissemination of their message regardless of size, budget or location, (ii) direct user feedback from our consumers, and (iii) organization of their sermons and content as well as general technological advances to augment traditional places of worship. 

&#160; 

Truli consumers have access to free content as well as certain Pay-per-View content on the interactive digital platform from which we hope to eventually derive revenue. In the event we are able to raise sufficient capital, and our platform gains significant traffic, we plan to sell advertising space on our website. We additionally plan to sell faith based merchandise through our website once we are financially able to do so. We also have created a &#8220;donation&#8221; section of our website whereby we will receive 15% of donations given to ministries and churches. 

&#160; 

Truli also will allow partners to monetize their content through our platform by letting them set purchase prices for their content, and allowing them to receive money though the &#8220;donation&#8221; section of our website. 

&#160; 

We have currently not generated any revenue from these business strategies and there can be no assurances that we will do so in the future. 

&#160; 

Marketing 

&#160; 

Due to our current lack of capital, we have halted any current marketing. As a result we currently market in a very limited capacity, primarily through press releases. In the event that we are able to access capital in the future, we would create a marketing campaign including, (i) direct marketing to ministries outlining the benefits of our platform to their ministry, (ii) presence at trade shows and conferences including the National Religious Broadcasters Convention which networks thousands of Christian community members and business people and the international Christian Retailers Show which is the largest Christian retailer gathering in the world, and (iii) other types of marketing including but not limited to social media, press exposure, brand building at various seminars, viral and social strategies as well as the utilization of networks, bloggers, newsletters, direct calling and radio. If we are able to raise sufficient capital we also plan on developing technology to create mobile phone applications related to our content.

&#160;

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

We face significant competition from integrated online media companies, social networking sites, traditional print and broadcast media, search engines, and various e-commerce sites. Our competitors include many well-known and fully funded news and information websites and content providers. Several of our competitors offer an integrated variety of Internet products, advertising services, technologies, online services and/or content that may compete for the attention of our users, advertisers, developers, and publishers. We may also in the future, more directly compete with these companies to obtain agreements with third parties to promote or distribute our services. In addition, we compete with social media and networking sites which are attracting an increasing share of users, users&#8217; online time and online advertising dollars. 

&#160; 

Financial 

&#160; 

To date, we have devoted a substantial portion of our efforts and financial resources to creating and marketing our online platform. As a result, since our inception in 2011, we have generated no revenue and have funded our operations principally through private sales of debt and equity securities and through advances made by our Chief Executive Officer. We have never generated any revenue and, as of March 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $5,316,667. We expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future and expect to generate no revenue for the foreseeable future. 

&#160; 

Our cash and cash equivalents balance at March 31, 2016 was $13,245, representing 100% of total assets. Based on our current expected level of operating expenditures, we are currently uncertain if we will be able to fund our operations until our next year end. This period could be shortened if there are any significant increases in spending that were not anticipated or other unforeseen events. Currently we are dependent upon working capital advances provided by our Chief Executive Officer. We need to raise additional cash through the private or public sales of equity or debt securities, collaborative arrangements, or a combination thereof, to continue to fund operations and the development of our website and digital platform. There is no assurance that such financing will be available to us when needed to allow us to continue our operations or if available, on terms acceptable to us. If we do not raise sufficient funds in a timely manner, we may be forced to curtail operations, delay or stop developing or marketing our products, or cease operations altogether, or file for bankruptcy. We currently do not have commitments for future funding of cash from any source. 

&#160; 

We have incurred indebtedness in the aggregate of $2,087,782 in principal and interest as of March 31, 2016. Unless we are able to restructure some or all of this debt, and raise sufficient capital to fund our continued development, our current operations do not generate any revenue to pay these obligations. Accordingly, there can be no assurances that we will be able to pay these or other obligations which we may incur in the future and it is unlikely we will be able to continue as a going concern. 

&#160; 

Our Chief Executive Officer, vice-president and certain of our consultants are currently not being paid. In the event financing is not obtained, we may pursue further cost cutting measures. These events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

&#160; 

The independent registered public accounting firm&#8217;s report on our March 31, 2016 consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report states that our difficulty in generating sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations and sustain operations raise substantial doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustment that might result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

Employees 

&#160; 

As of June 15, 2016, we have two total employees with one full-time employee, our Founder and Chief Executive Officer Michael Solomon, who has forgone payment for the fiscal year. We also employ 2 part-time consultants who are not currently being paid by Truli on a consistent basis. While we have not experienced any work disruptions or stoppages we have to consider our relationships with certain consultants tenuous as a result of certain non-payments.
