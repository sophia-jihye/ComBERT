 ITEM I. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

GENERAL 

&#160; 

Village Super Market, Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221; or &#8220;Village&#8221;) was founded in 1937. Village operates a chain of 29 ShopRite supermarkets, eighteen of which are located in northern New Jersey, eight in southern New Jersey, two in Maryland and one in northeastern Pennsylvania. The Company is a member of Wakefern Food Corporation ("Wakefern"), the nation's largest retailer-owned food cooperative and owner of the ShopRite name. This relationship provides Village many of the economies of scale in purchasing, distribution, private label products, advanced retail technology, marketing and advertising associated with chains of greater size and geographic coverage. 

&#160; 

Village seeks to generate high sales volume by offering a wide variety of high quality products at consistently low prices with superior customer service. During fiscal 2016 , sales per store were $56,376 &#32;and sales per average square foot of selling space were $1,208 . The Company gives ongoing attention to the d&#233;cor and format of its stores and tailors each store's product mix to the preferences of the local community. Village competes by using low pricing, superior customer service, and a broad range of consistently available quality products, including ShopRite private labeled products. The ShopRite Price Plus card also strengthens customer loyalty. 

&#160; 

The remodel and expansion of the Stirling, New Jersey store to 68,000 sq. ft. was completed in October 2015. On April 30, 2014, Village opened a 59,000 sq. ft. store in Union, New Jersey that replaced our existing 40,000 sq. ft. store in Union. On November 6, 2013, Village opened a 77,000 sq. ft. store in Hanover Township, New Jersey that serves the greater Morristown area and replaced the 40,000 sq. ft. Morris Plains store.

These larger store sizes enable the Company&#8217;s stores to provide a &#8220;one-stop&#8221; shopping experience and to feature expanded higher margin specialty departments such as an on-site bakery, an expanded delicatessen, a variety of natural and organic foods, ethnic and international foods, prepared foods and pharmacies. Many of our stores emphasize a Power Alley, which features high margin, fresh, convenience offerings in an area within the store that provides quick customer entry and exit for those customers shopping for today's lunch or dinner. Certain of our stores include the Village Food Garden concept, featuring a restaurant style kitchen and several kiosks offering a wide variety of store prepared specialty foods for both take-home and in-store dining. 

&#160; 

Village also has on-site registered dieticians in fifteen stores that provide customers with free, private consultations on healthy meals and proper nutrition, as well as leading health related events both in store and in the community as part of the Live Right with ShopRite program. Expanded services such as a culinary classroom, fitness studio and a learning and childcare center have been incorporated into certain new and expanded stores. 

&#160; 

We have thirteen &#32;stores that offer ShopRite from Home covering most of the communities served by our stores. ShopRite from Home is an online ordering system that provides for in-store pickup or home delivery. Customers can browse our circular, create and edit shopping lists and use ShopRite from Home through shoprite.com or on their smart phones or tablets through the ShopRite app.

A variety of factors affect the profitability of each of the Company's stores, including competition, size, access and parking, lease terms, management supervision, and the strength of the ShopRite trademark in the local community. Village continually evaluates individual stores to determine if they should be closed, remodeled or replaced. 

&#160; 

DEVELOPMENT AND EXPANSION 

&#160; 

The Company has an ongoing program to upgrade and expand its supermarket chain. This program has included store remodels as well as the opening or acquisition of additional stores. When remodeling, Village has sought, whenever possible, to increase the amount of selling space in its stores. 

&#160; 

Village has budgeted $25 million &#32;for capital expenditures for fiscal 2017. Planned expenditures include the beginning of construction of a new store in the Bronx, New York, one major remodel, several smaller remodels and certain energy efficient lighting projects. 

&#160; 

In fiscal 2016, Village completed the expansion and remodel of the Stirling, New Jersey store, substantially completed one major remodel and completed several smaller remodels. 

In fiscal 2015, Village completed a substantial portion of the expansion and remodel of the Stirling, New Jersey store and completed several smaller remodels. 

In fiscal 2014, Village completed the construction of a replacement store in Union, New Jersey, and a replacement store in Hanover Township, New Jersey that serves the greater Morristown area and replaced the Morris Plains, New Jersey store. 

&#160; 

In fiscal 2013, Village began construction of the replacement store in Hanover Township, New Jersey and completed three major remodels. 

&#160; 

In fiscal 2012, Village completed several smaller remodels and the installation of solar panels on one store. In addition, on January 29, 2012, Village acquired the store fixtures, lease and other assets of the ShopRite in Old Bridge, New Jersey. 

&#160; 

Additional store remodels and sites for new stores are in various stages of development. Village will also consider additional acquisitions should appropriate opportunities arise. 

&#160; 

WAKEFERN FOOD CORPORATION 

&#160; 

The Company is the second largest member of Wakefern and owns 13.2% &#32;of Wakefern&#8217;s outstanding stock as of July 30, 2016 . Wakefern, which was organized in 1946, is the nation&#8217;s largest retailer-owned food cooperative. Wakefern and its 49 &#32;shareholder members operate 336 &#32;supermarkets and other retail formats, including 94 &#32;stores operated by Wakefern. Only Wakefern and its members are entitled to use the ShopRite name and trademark, and to participate in ShopRite advertising and promotional programs. 

The principal benefits to the Company from its relationship with Wakefern are the use of the ShopRite name and trademark, volume purchasing, ShopRite private label products, distribution and warehousing economies of scale, ShopRite advertising and promotional programs (including the ShopRite Price Plus card) and the development of advanced retail technology. The Company believes that the ShopRite name is widely recognized by its customers and is a factor in their decisions about where to shop. ShopRite private label products accounted for approximately 11.8% &#32;of sales in fiscal 2016 . 

&#160; 

Wakefern distributes as a "patronage dividend" to each of its stockholders a share of substantially all of its earnings in proportion to the dollar volume of purchases by the stockholder from Wakefern during each fiscal year. 

&#160; 

While Wakefern has a substantial professional staff, it operates as a member owned cooperative. Executives of most members make contributions of time to the business of Wakefern. Executives of the Company spend a significant amount of their time working on various Wakefern committees, which oversee and direct Wakefern purchasing, merchandising and other programs. In addition, Nicholas Sumas, the Company&#8217;s Chief Marketing Officer, is a member of the Wakefern Board of Directors. 

&#160; 

Most of the Company's advertising is developed and placed by Wakefern's professional advertising staff. Wakefern is responsible for all television, radio and major newspaper advertisements. Wakefern bills its members using various formulas which allocate advertising costs in accordance with the estimated proportional benefits to each member from such advertising. The Company also places Wakefern developed materials with local newspapers. In addition, Wakefern and its affiliates provide the Company with other services including liability and property insurance, supplies, certain equipment purchasing, coupon processing, certain financial accounting applications, retail technology support, including shoprite.com and the ShopRite smart phone app, and other store services. 

&#160; 

Wakefern operates warehouses and distribution facilities in Elizabeth, Keasbey, Whitehouse, Dayton, Newark and Jamesburg, New Jersey and Gouldsboro and Breinigsville, Pennsylvania. The Company and all other members of Wakefern are parties to the Wakefern Stockholders' Agreement which provides for certain commitments by, and restrictions on, all shareholders of Wakefern. This agreement extends until ten years from the date that stockholders representing 75% of Wakefern sales notify Wakefern that those stockholders request the Wakefern Stockholders' Agreement be terminated. Each member is obligated to purchase from Wakefern a minimum of 85% of its requirements for products offered by Wakefern. If this purchase obligation is not met, the member is required to pay Wakefern's profit contribution shortfall attributable to this failure. The Company fulfilled this obligation in fiscal 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 . This agreement also requires that in the event of unapproved changes in control of the Company or a sale of the Company or of individual Company stores, except to a qualified successor, the Company in such cases must pay Wakefern an amount equal to the annual profit contribution shortfall attributable to the sale of a store or change in control. No payments are required if the volume lost by a shareholder as a result of the sale of a store is replaced by such shareholder by increased volume in existing or new stores. A "qualified successor" must be, or agree to become, a member of Wakefern, and may not own or operate any supermarkets, other than ShopRite supermarkets, in the states of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine or the District of Columbia, or own or operate more than 25 non-ShopRite supermarkets in any other locations in the United States. 

&#160; 

Wakefern, under circumstances specified in its bylaws, may refuse to sell merchandise to, and may repurchase the Wakefern stock of, any member. Such circumstances include a member's bankruptcy filing, certain unapproved transfers by a member of its supermarket business or its capital stock in Wakefern, unapproved acquisition by a member of certain supermarket or grocery wholesale supply businesses, the material breach by a member of any provision of the bylaws of Wakefern or any agreement with Wakefern, or a failure to fulfill financial obligations to Wakefern. 

&#160; 

Any material change in Wakefern's method of operation or a termination or material modification of the Company's relationship with Wakefern following termination of the above agreements, or otherwise, might have an adverse impact on the conduct of the Company's business and could involve additional expense for the Company. The failure of any Wakefern member to fulfill its obligations under these agreements or a member's insolvency or withdrawal from Wakefern could result in increased costs to remaining members. 

&#160; 

Wakefern does not prescribe geographical franchise areas to its members. The specific locations at which the Company, other members of Wakefern, or Wakefern itself, may open new units under the ShopRite, PriceRite and The Fresh Grocer names are, however, subject to the approval of Wakefern's Site Development Committee. This committee is composed of persons who are not employees or members of Wakefern. Committee decisions to deny a site application may be appealed to the Wakefern Board of Directors. Wakefern assists its members in their site selection by providing appropriate demographic data, volume projections and estimates of the impact of the proposed store on existing member supermarkets in the area. 

&#160; 

Each of Wakefern's members is required to make capital contributions to Wakefern based on the number of stores operated by that member and the purchases from Wakefern generated by those stores. As additional stores are opened or acquired by a member, additional capital must be contributed by it to Wakefern. The Company&#8217;s investment in Wakefern and affiliates was $26,467 &#32;at July 30, 2016 . The total amount of debt outstanding from all capital pledges to Wakefern is $718 &#32;at July 30, 2016 . The maximum per store capital contribution increased from $875 &#32;to $900 &#32;in fiscal 2016 , resulting in an additional $717 &#32;capital pledge, which was paid in fiscal 2016 . 

As required by the Wakefern bylaws, the Company&#8217;s investment in Wakefern is pledged to Wakefern to secure the Company&#8217;s obligations to Wakefern. In addition, five members of the Sumas family have guaranteed the Company&#8217;s obligations to Wakefern. These personal guarantees are required of any 5% shareholder of the Company who is active in the operation of the Company. Wakefern does not own any securities of the Company or its subsidiaries. The Company&#8217;s investment in Wakefern entitles the Company to enough votes to elect one member to the Wakefern Board of Directors due to cumulative voting rights. 

&#160; 

TECHNOLOGY 

&#160; 

The Company considers automation and information technology important to its operations and competitive position. Electronic payment options are offered at all checkout locations. In recent years, we have upgraded our communication network, which is used for secure, reliable, high speed processing of electronic payments and transmission of data. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s commitment to advanced point of sale and communication systems enables it to participate in Price Plus, ShopRite&#8217;s preferred customer program. Customers receive electronic discounts by presenting a scannable Price Plus card. This technology also enables Village to offer continuity programs, focus on target marketing initiatives and to attach digital coupons directly to a customer's Price Plus card. 

&#160; 

Wakefern and Village have responded to customers' increased use of the internet by creating a smart phone app and shoprite.com to provide weekly advertising and other shopping information. On-line shopping is available in thirteen &#32;stores, with store pick-up and delivery options servicing our current market. 

&#160; 

Eighteen stores use self-checkout systems to provide improved customer service, especially during peak periods, and reduce operating costs. RFID readers are installed in all checkout lanes to enable contactless payment options for customers to quicken checkout times. Certain in-store department records are computerized, including the records of all pharmacy departments. In all stores, meat, seafood, delicatessen, and bakery prices are maintained on computer for automatic weighing and pricing. 

&#160; 

Village utilizes a computer generated ordering system, which is designed to reduce inventory levels and out of stock conditions, enhance shelf space utilization, and reduce labor costs. This system is also utilized to reduce the cost of taking periodic inventories. The Company utilizes a direct store delivery system, consisting of personal computers and advanced hand held scanners, for product not purchased through Wakefern to provide equivalent cost and retail price control over these products. 

&#160; 

Village seeks to design its stores to use energy efficiently, including recycling waste heat generated by refrigeration equipment for heating and other purposes. Most stores utilize computerized energy management systems. The Company has solar panels on the roof of two stores, reducing both carbon emissions and energy costs. 

&#160; 

The Company has installed computer based training systems in all stores to assist in the training of associates. Village utilizes a time and attendance system and labor scheduling system to improve scheduling and reduce labor. Automated cash handling systems are utilized in the store back office to improve accuracy and reduce costs. 

&#160; 

Village uses digital surveillance systems that are integrated with the cashier monitoring systems in all stores to aid shrink reduction, increase productivity and assist in accident investigations. These systems include electronic monitoring of the bottom of carts to reduce shrink. 

&#160; 

The Company utilizes a division of Wakefern for data processing services, including financial accounting support. 

&#160; 

COMPETITION 

&#160; 

The supermarket industry is highly competitive and characterized by narrow profit margins. The Company competes directly with multiple retail formats both in-store and online, including national, regional and local supermarket chains as well as warehouse clubs, supercenters, drug stores, discount general merchandise stores, fast food chains, restaurants, dollar stores and convenience stores. 

&#160; 

Some of the Company's principal competitors include Stop &#38; Shop, Acme, Kings, Wal-Mart, Target, Wegmans, Whole Foods, Costco, BJ&#8217;s, Giant, Safeway, Weis and Foodtown. Some of these competitors have financial resources substantially greater than those of the Company, and some are non-union. 

SEASONALITY 

&#160; 

The majority of our revenues are generally not seasonal in nature. However, revenues tend to be higher during the major holidays throughout the year. 

LABOR 

&#160; 

As of July 30, 2016 , the Company employed approximately 6,544 &#32;persons with approximately 75% &#32;working part-time. Approximately 92% &#32;of the Company&#8217;s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Contracts with the Company&#8217;s seven unions have expiration dates between June 2015 and October 2020 . Approximately 13% &#32;of our associates are represented by unions whose contracts have expired or will expire within one year. Most of the Company&#8217;s competitors are similarly unionized. 

&#160; 

AVAILABLE INFORMATION 

&#160; 

As a member of the Wakefern cooperative, Village relies upon our customer focused website, shoprite.com, for interaction with customers and prospective employees. This website is maintained by Wakefern for the benefit of all ShopRite supermarkets, and therefore does not contain any financial information related to the Company. 

&#160; 

The Company will provide paper copies of the annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and press releases free of charge upon request to any shareholder. In addition, electronic copies of these filings can be obtained at sec.gov. 

&#160; 

REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s business requires various licenses and the registration of facilities with state and federal health and drug regulatory agencies. These licenses and registration requirements obligate the Company to observe certain rules and regulations, and a violation of these rules and regulations could result in a suspension or revocation of licenses or registrations and fines or penalties. In addition, most licenses require periodic renewals. The Company has not experienced material difficulties with respect to obtaining or retaining licenses and registrations.
