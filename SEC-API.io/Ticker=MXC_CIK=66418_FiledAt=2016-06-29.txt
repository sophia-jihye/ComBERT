 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

Mexco Energy Corporation, a Colorado corporation, is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the exploration, development and production of natural gas and crude oil properties located in the United States. Incorporated in April 1972 under the name Miller Oil Company, the Company changed its name to Mexco Energy Corporation effective April 30, 1980. At that time, the shareholders of the Company also approved amendments to the Articles of Incorporation resulting in a one-for-fifty reverse stock split of the Company&#8217;s common stock. 

&#160; 

Our total estimated proved reserves at March 31, 2016 were approximately 2.051 million barrels of oil equivalent (&#8220;Boe&#8221;) of which 53% was oil and natural gas liquids and 47% was natural gas, and our estimated present value of proved reserves was approximately $16 million based on estimated future net revenues excluding taxes discounted at 10% per annum, pricing and other assumptions set forth in &#8220;Item 2 &#8211; Properties&#8221; below. During fiscal 2016, we added proved reserves of 590,000 Boe through extensions and discoveries, subtracted 4,500 Boe through sales of oil and gas properties and had downward revisions of previous estimates of 136,000 Boe. Such revisions are a result of Security Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) rules which require such reserves to be developed within five years as well as decreased oil and natural gas prices. 

&#160; 

Nicholas C. Taylor beneficially owns approximately 45% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Mr. Taylor is also our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. As a result, Mr. Taylor has significant influence in matters voted on by our shareholders, including the election of our Board members. Mr. Taylor participates in all facets of our business and has a significant impact on both our business strategy and daily operations. 

&#160;

&#160;

Company Profile 

&#160; 

Since our inception, we have been engaged in acquiring and developing oil and gas properties and the exploration for and production of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids (&#8220;NGLs&#8221;) within the United States. We especially seek to acquire proved reserves that fit well with existing operations or in areas where Mexco has established production. Acquisitions preferably will contain most of their value in producing wells, behind pipe reserves and high quality proved undeveloped locations. Competition for the purchase of proved reserves is intense. Sellers often utilize a bid process to sell properties. This process usually intensifies the competition and makes it extremely difficult to acquire reserves without assuming significant price and production risks. We actively search for opportunities to acquire proved oil and gas properties. However, because the competition is intense, we cannot give any assurance that we will be successful in our efforts during fiscal 2017. 

&#160; 

While we own oil and gas properties in other states, the majority of our activities are centered in the Permian Basin of West Texas. The Company also owns producing properties and undeveloped acreage in thirteen states. We acquire interests in producing and non-producing oil and gas leases from landowners and leaseholders in areas considered favorable for oil and gas exploration, development and production. In addition, we may acquire oil and gas interests by joining in oil and gas drilling prospects generated by third parties. We may also employ a combination of the above methods of obtaining producing acreage and prospects. In recent years, we have placed primary emphasis on the evaluation and purchase of producing oil and gas properties, both working and royalty interests, and prospects that could have a potentially meaningful impact on our reserves. Most of the Company&#8217;s oil and gas interests are operated by others, however the Company operates several properties in which it owns an interest. 

&#160; 

From 1983 to 2016, Mexco Energy Corporation made approximately 80 acquisitions of producing oil and gas properties including royalties, overriding royalties, minerals and working interests both operated and non-operated plus the following most significant and recent acquisitions: 

&#160; 

1993-2010 Tabbs Bay Oil Company and Thompson Brothers Lumber Company, respectively dissolved in 1957 and 1947. Purchase covering thousands of acres located respectively in 19 counties of Texas, 3 parishes of Louisiana and one county in Arkansas and 8 counties of Texas, respectively consisting of various mineral, royalty and overriding royalty interests. &#160; 

1997 Forman Energy Corporation, purchase price of $1,591,000 consisting of primarily working interests in approximately 634 wells located in 12 states. &#160; &#160; 2010 Southwest Texas Disposal Corporation, purchase price $478,000 consisting of royalty interests in over 300 wells located in 60 counties and parishes of 6 states. &#160; &#160; 2012 TBO Oil and Gas, LLC, purchase price of $1,150,000 consisting of working interests in approximately 280 wells located in 16 counties of 3 states. &#160; &#160; 2014 Royalty interests, purchase price of $200,000 covering 43 wells in 12 counties of eight states. Of these oil and gas reserves, approximately 54% are in TX and 10% in LA. &#160; 

Royalty interests, purchase price $580,000 covering 580 wells in 87 counties of eight states. Approximately 90% of the net revenue from these royalties is produced by 157 wells located in the Barnett Shale of the Fort Worth Basin of Texas. Also included are interests in 423 wells in 8 states. 

&#160; 

Non-Operated working interests, purchase price $525,000 for 12.5% (approximately 10% net revenue interest). Eight wells now producing oil on 20-acre spacing at approximately 3,600 foot depth on the 190 acres in Pecos County, TX. The operator has agreed to pay all operating expenses of these interests. Mexco also receives 100% of the gross disposal fees paid by an adjacent operator for one disposal well located on these properties. 

&#160; 

Royalty and mineral interests, purchase price $1,000,000 covering approximately 1,800 wells in 27 counties of Texas. Of these oil and gas reserves, approximately 80% is natural gas and 20% oil. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Non-Operated working interests, purchase price $840,000 in 70 Natural gas producing wells located in 5 counties of Oklahoma. 

&#160; 

Industry Environment and Outlook 

&#160; 

Crude oil prices remained significantly depressed in fiscal 2016 and face continued downward pressure due to domestic and global supply and demand factors. The downward price pressure intensified in late 2015 and early 2016, with crude oil prices dropping below $23 per barrel in February 2016, a level not seen since 2003. Natural gas prices faced similar downward pressure, dropping below $1.50 per mcf in March 2016. 

&#160; 

In light of the challenges facing our industry and in response to these price declines, our primary business strategies for fiscal 2017 will include: (1) optimizing cash flows through operating efficiencies and cost reductions, (2) divesting of non-core assets, and (3) working to balance capital spending with cash flows to minimize new borrowings, reduce debt and maintain ample liquidity. 

&#160; 

See Part II, Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for discussion of our fiscal 2016 operating results and potential impact on fiscal 2017 operating results due to depressed commodity prices. 

&#160; 

Oil and Gas Operations 

&#160; 

As of March 31, 2016, oil constituted approximately 53% of our total proved reserves and approximately 67% of our revenues for fiscal 2016. Revenues from oil and gas royalty interests accounted for approximately 24% of our revenues for fiscal 2016. 

&#160; 

Mexco believes there is potential for horizontal drilling, multi-stage fracturing and production of oil and gas in a substantial number of properties containing approximately 1,150 wells in which Mexco holds an interest. These wells are located in the core area of the horizontal Wolfcamp multi-zone formation in Reagan, Upton, Midland, Martin, Glasscock and Andrews Counties in the Midland Basin of West Texas. Such interests vary from .125% to 7.68% working interest (.094% to 6.24% net revenue interest, respectively). 

&#160; 

In addition to these working interests, we also own various mineral and royalty interests in and around these core counties in the Midland Basin, a part of the Permian Basin of West Texas. 

&#160; 

There are two primary areas in which the Company is focused, 1) the Midland Basin located in the Eastern portion of the Permian Basin including Reagan, Upton, Midland, Martin, Howard, Glasscock and Crockett Counties, Texas and 2) the Delaware Basin located in the Western portion of the Permian Basin including Lea and Eddy Counties, New Mexico and Loving County, Texas. 

&#160; 

The Midland Basin properties, encompassing 71,477 gross acres, 285 net acres, 534 gross producing wells and 2.5 net wells account for approximately 42% of our discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves as of March 31, 2016. Of these discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves, approximately 32% are attributable to proven undeveloped reserves which will be developed through new drilling. For fiscal 2016, these properties accounted for 19% of our gross revenues and 24% of our net revenues. 

&#160; 

The Delaware Basin properties, encompassing 29,638 gross acres, 623 net acres, 458 gross producing wells and 5.2 net wells account for approximately 18% of our discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves as of March 31, 2016. Of these discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves, approximately 2% are attributable to proven undeveloped reserves which will be developed through new drilling. For fiscal 2016, these properties accounted for 24% of our gross revenues and 29% of our net revenues. 

&#160; 

Gomez Gas Field properties, encompassing 13,058 gross acres, 72 net acres, 26 gross wells and .13 net wells in Pecos County, Texas, account for approximately 3% of our discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves as of March 31, 2015. For fiscal 2016, these properties accounted for 3% of our gross revenues and 5% of our net revenues. All of these properties, except for one, are royalty interests. There is a potential for development of the horizontal Wolfcamp on these interests. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The Goldsmith North Field (San Andres formation) long-lived oil producing properties, encompassing 240 gross acres, 153 net acres, 3 gross wells in Ector County, Texas, account for 7.3% of our discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves as of March 31, 2016. Of these discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves, 7% are attributable to proven undeveloped reserves which will be developed through new drilling of 4 wells. For fiscal 2016, these properties consist of working interests and accounted for 3% of our gross revenues and .1% of our net revenues. 

&#160; 

In August 2013, Mexco assigned Pioneer Natural Resources Company a three year term leasehold interest in 417.33 net acres (837.33 gross acres) of undeveloped acreage located above and below the Pembrook Unit of Upton County, Texas and retained a 1% royalty. 

&#160; 

In November 2015, Mexco extended a six month option for which the Company received $112,000 for a three year assignment of a leasehold interest in 320 net acres (640 gross acres) in Upton County, Texas. The purchaser paid Mexco $2,000 per acre for a total of $640,000. Mexco also retained a 1% overriding royalty interest in this acreage. This acreage has the potential for horizontal development in multiple zones of the horizontal Wolfcamp formation centered in the southern Midland Basin. The purchaser advises that he has obtained rights to explore the balance of the undivided 640 acres from Apache Corporation and has been advised that Parsley Energy, Inc. plans to develop this property. 

&#160; 

Mexco believes its most important properties for future development by horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing area located in Midland, Reagan and Upton Counties, Texas of the Midland Basin. 

&#160; 

For more on these and other operations in this area see &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Liquidity and Capital Resources Commitments&#8221;. 

&#160; 

We own interests in and operate 13 producing wells and 1 water injection well. We own partial interests in an additional 6,461 producing wells all of which are located within the United States in the states of Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, Wyoming, Kansas, Colorado, Montana, Virginia and North Dakota. Additional information concerning these properties and our oil and gas reserves is provided below. 

&#160; 

The following table indicates our oil and gas production in each of the last five years: 

&#160; 

Year &#160; Oil(Bbls) &#160; &#160; Gas (Mcf) &#160; 2016 &#160; &#160; 38,930 &#160; &#160; &#160; 407,939 &#160; 2015 &#160; &#160; 29,557 &#160; &#160; &#160; 369,034 &#160; 2014 &#160; &#160; 27,186 &#160; &#160; &#160; 361,652 &#160; 2013 &#160; &#160; 23,260 &#160; &#160; &#160; 401,077 &#160; 2012 &#160; &#160; 19,442 &#160; &#160; &#160; 395,649 &#160; &#160; 

Competition and Markets 

&#160; 

The oil and gas industry is a highly competitive business. Competition for oil and gas reserve acquisitions is significant. We may compete with major oil and gas companies, other independent oil and gas companies and individual producers and operators, some of which have financial and personnel resources substantially in excess of those available to us. As a result, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage. Competitive factors include price, contract terms and types and quality of service, including pipeline distribution. The price for oil and gas is widely followed and is generally subject to worldwide market factors. Our ability to acquire and develop additional properties in the future will depend upon our ability to conduct operations, to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in this highly competitive environment in a timely manner. 

&#160; 

In addition, the oil and gas industry as a whole also competes with other industries in supplying the energy and fuel requirements of industrial, commercial and individual consumers. The price and availability of alternative energy sources could adversely affect our revenue. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Market factors affect the quantities of oil and natural gas production and the price we can obtain for the production from our oil and natural gas properties. Such factors include: the extent of domestic production; the level of imports of foreign oil and natural gas; the general level of market demand on a regional, national and worldwide basis; domestic and foreign economic conditions that determine levels of industrial production; political events in foreign oil-producing regions; and variations in governmental regulations including environmental, energy conservation and tax laws or the imposition of new regulatory requirements upon the oil and natural gas industry. 

&#160; 

The market for our oil, gas and natural gas liquids production depends on factors beyond our control including: domestic and foreign political conditions; the overall level of supply of and demand for oil, gas and natural gas liquids; the price of imports of oil and gas; weather conditions; the price and availability of alternative fuels; the proximity and capacity of gas pipelines and other transportation facilities; and overall economic conditions. 

&#160; 

Major Customers 

&#160; 

We made sales to the following companies that amounted to 10% or more of revenues for the year ended March 31: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#160; 2016 &#160; &#160; 2015 &#160; &#160; 2014 &#160; Holly Frontier Refining &#38; Marketing LLC &#160; &#160; 14 % &#160; &#160; 17 % &#160; &#160; 22 % Plains Marketing LP &#160; &#160; 18 % &#160; &#160; 8 % &#160; &#160; 8 % &#160; 

Because a ready market exists for oil and gas production, we do not believe the loss of any individual customer would have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. 

&#160; 

Regulation 

&#160; 

Our exploration, development, production and marketing operations are subject to various types of extensive rules and regulations by federal, state and local authorities. Numerous federal, state and local departments and agencies have issued rules and regulations binding on the oil and gas industry, some of which carry substantial penalties for noncompliance. State statutes and regulations require permits and bonds for drilling operations and reports concerning operations. Most states and some counties and municipalities in which we operate regulate the location of wells; the method of drilling and casing wells; the rates of production or &#8220;allowables&#8221;; the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled; the plugging and abandoning of wells; and notice to, and consultation with, surface owners and other third parties. The regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases its cost of doing business and, consequently, affects its profitability. Because these rules and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted, we are not able to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such laws. 

&#160; 

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (&#8220;FERC&#8221;) regulates under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, interstate natural gas transportation rates and service conditions, which affect the marketing of natural gas we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of such production. Since 1978, various laws have been enacted which have significantly altered the marketing and transportation of gas. These orders resulted in a fundamental restructuring of interstate pipeline sales and transportation services, including the unbundling by interstate pipelines of the sales, transportation, storage and other components of the city-gate sales, services such pipelines previously performed. 

&#160; 

Commencing in 1985, the FERC promulgated a series of orders, regulations and rule makings that significantly fostered competition in the business of transporting and marketing gas. Today, interstate pipeline companies are required to provide nondiscriminatory transportation services to producers, marketers and other shippers, regardless of whether such shippers are affiliated with an interstate pipeline company. FERC&#8217;s initiatives have led to the development of a competitive, unregulated, open access market for gas purchases and sales that permits all purchasers of gas to buy gas directly from third-party sellers other than pipelines. However, the natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated. Therefore, we cannot guarantee that the less stringent regulatory approach will continue indefinitely into the future, nor can we determine what effect, if any, future regulatory changes might have on our natural gas related activities. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Sales of crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at negotiated market prices. Nevertheless, Congress could reenact price controls in the future. The price we receive from the sale of these products is affected by the cost of transporting the products to market. The FERC regulates interstate crude oil pipeline transportation rates under the Interstate Commerce Act. In general, interstate crude oil pipeline rates must be cost-based, although many pipeline charges are today based on historical rates adjusted for inflation and other factors, and other charges may result from settlement rates agreed to by all shippers or market-based rates, which are permitted in certain circumstances. Intrastate crude oil pipeline transportation rates are subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions. Insofar as the interstate and intrastate transportation rates that we pay are generally applicable to all comparable shippers, we believe that the regulation of crude oil transportation rates will not affect our operations in a way that materially differs from the effect on the operations of our competitors who are similarly situated. Further, interstate and intrastate common carrier crude oil pipelines must provide service on an equitable basis. Under this standard, common carriers must offer service to all similarly situated shippers requesting service on the same terms and under the same rates. When crude oil pipelines operate at full capacity, access is governed by prorating provisions set forth in the pipelines&#8217; published tariffs. Accordingly, we believe that access to crude oil pipeline transportation services generally will be available to us to the same extent as to our similarly situated competitors. 

&#160; 

The State of Texas regulates the drilling for, and the production, gathering and sale of, oil and natural gas, including imposing severance taxes and requirements for obtaining drilling permits. Texas currently imposes a 4.6% severance tax on oil production and a 7.5% severance tax on natural gas production. States also regulate the method of developing new fields, the spacing and operation of wells and the prevention of waste of oil and natural gas resources. States may regulate rates of production and may establish maximum daily production allowables from oil and natural gas wells based on market demand or resource conservation, or both. 

&#160; 

States do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct economic regulation, but we cannot assure you that they will not do so in the future. The effect of these regulations may be to limit the amount of oil and natural gas that may be produced from our wells and to limit the number of wells or locations we can drill. The petroleum industry is also subject to compliance with various other federal, state and local regulations and laws. Some of those laws relate to resource conservation and equal employment opportunity. We do not believe that compliance with these laws will have a material adverse effect on us. 

&#160; 

Environmental Matters 

&#160; 

By nature of our oil and gas operations, we are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations controlling the generation, use, storage and discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. Numerous governmental departments issue rules and regulations to implement and enforce such laws, which are often difficult and costly to comply with and which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. These laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before drilling or production commences; restrict the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities; limit or prohibit construction or drilling activities on certain lands lying within protected areas; restrict the rate of oil and gas production; require remedial actions to prevent pollution from former operations; and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations. In addition, these laws and regulations may impose substantial liabilities and penalties for failure to comply with them or for any contamination resulting from our operations. We believe we are in compliance, in all material respects, with applicable environmental requirements. We do not believe costs relating to these laws and regulations have had a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition in the past. Public interest in the protection of the environment has increased dramatically in recent years. 

&#160; 

The trend of applying more expansive and stricter environmental legislation and regulations to the natural gas and oil industry could continue, resulting in increased costs of doing business and consequently affecting our profitability. To the extent laws are enacted or other governmental action is taken that restricts drilling or imposes more stringent and costly waste handling, disposal and cleanup requirements, our business and prospects could be adversely affected. 

&#160; 

The following are some of the existing laws, rules and regulations to which our business is subject: 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (&#8220;CERCLA&#8221;), also known as the &#8220;Superfund&#8221; law, imposes liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a &#8220;hazardous substance&#8221; into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the disposal site or the site where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to joint and several liabilities for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. We are able to control directly the operation of only those wells with respect to which we act as operator. Notwithstanding our lack of direct control over wells operated by others, the failure of an operator other than us to comply with applicable environmental regulations may, in certain circumstances, be attributed to us. We do not believe that we will be required to incur any material capital expenditures to comply with existing environmental requirements. 

&#160; 

The federal Clean Air Act (&#8220;CAA&#8221;), and state air pollution laws and regulations provide a framework for national, state and local efforts to protect air quality. The operations of oil and gas properties utilize equipment that emits air pollutants which may be subject to federal and state air pollution control laws. These laws require utilization of air emissions abatement equipment to achieve prescribed emissions limitations and ambient air quality standards, as well as operating permits for existing equipment and construction permits for new and modified equipment. Permits and related compliance obligations under the CAA, as well as changes to state implementation plans for controlling air emissions in regional non-attainment areas may require oil and natural gas exploration and production operators to incur future capital expenditures in connection with the addition or modification of existing air emission control equipment and strategies. 

&#160; 

In addition, some oil and natural gas facilities may be included within the categories of hazardous air pollutant sources, which are subject to increasing regulation under the CAA. Failure to comply with these requirements could subject a regulated entity to monetary penalties, injunctions, conditions or restrictions on operations and enforcement actions. On April 17, 2012, the EPA issued a final rule that established new source performance standards for volatile organic compounds, or VOCs, and sulfur dioxide, an air toxics standard for major sources of oil and natural gas production, and an air toxics standard for major sources of natural gas transmission and storage. These regulations apply to natural gas wells that are hydraulically fractured, or refractured, and to storage tanks and other equipment. Since January 1, 2015, all wells subject to the rule have been required to use &#8220;green completion&#8221; technology to limit emissions during well completion operations. 

&#160; 

Recent scientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases, commonly referred to as greenhouse gases (&#8220;GHGs&#8221;) and including carbon dioxide and methane, may be contributing to warming of the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere. These findings by the EPA allowed the agency to proceed with the adoption and implementation of regulations that would restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act. In September 2009, the EPA issued a GHG monitoring and reporting rule that requires certain parties, including participants in the oil and natural gas industry, to monitor and report their GHG emissions, including methane and carbon dioxide, to the EPA. 

&#160; 

The EPA&#8217;s finding, the GHG reporting rules, and the rules to regulate the emissions of GHGs may affect the outcome of other climate change lawsuits pending in U.S. federal courts in a manner unfavorable to our industry. In addition to the EPA&#8217;s actions to regulate GHGs, more than one-third of the states have begun taking action on their own to control and/or reduce emissions of GHGs. As a result of this continued regulatory focus, future GHG regulations of the oil and gas industry remain a possibility. Any of the climate change regulatory and legislative initiatives described above in areas in which we conduct business could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

&#160; 

The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (&#8220;Clean Water Act&#8221;) and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including produced waters and other oil and gas wastes, into waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or the applicable state agency. Although the costs to comply with such mandates under state or federal law may be significant, the entire industry will experience similar costs, and we do not believe that these costs will have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operations. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (&#8220;RCRA&#8221;) and analogous state laws govern the handling and disposal of hazardous and solid wastes. Wastes that are classified as hazardous under RCRA are subject to stringent handling, recordkeeping, disposal and reporting requirements. RCRA specifically excludes from the definition of hazardous waste &#8220;drilling fluids, produced waters, and other wastes associated with the exploration, development, or production of crude oil, natural gas or geothermal energy.&#8221; However, these wastes may be regulated by the EPA or state agencies as solid waste. Moreover, many ordinary industrial wastes, such as paint wastes, waste solvents, laboratory wastes and waste compressor oils, are regulated as hazardous wastes. Although the costs of managing hazardous waste may be significant, we do not expect to experience more burdensome costs than similarly situated companies. 

&#160; 

The Safe Drinking Water Act (&#8220;SDWA&#8221;) and the Underground Injection Control (&#8220;UIC&#8221;) program promulgated under the SDWA and state and local laws regulate the drilling and operation of salt water disposal (&#8220;SWD&#8221;) wells and the underground injection of waste substances produced from oil and gas operations. Underground injection is the subsurface placement of fluid through a well, such as the reinjection of brine produced and separated from oil and gas production. The EPA directly administers the UIC program in some states and in others it is delegated to the state for administering. Permits must be obtained before drilling SWD wells and casing integrity monitoring must be conducted periodically to ensure the casing is not leaking saltwater into groundwater. Contamination of groundwater by oil and natural gas drilling, production, and related operations may result in fines, penalties, and remediation costs. In addition, third party claims may be filed by landowners and other parties claiming damages for alternative water supplies, property damages, and bodily injury. We currently operate one underground injection well and own interests in various underground injection wells operated by others and failure to abide by their permits could subject us and those operators to civil and/or criminal enforcement. We are, and believe the other operators are as well, in compliance in all material respects with the requirements of applicable state underground injection control programs and permits. 

&#160; 

Hydraulic fracturing is an important common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons, particularly oil and natural gas, from tight formations, including shales. This technology involves the injection of fluids&#8212;usually consisting mostly of water but typically including small amounts of chemical additives&#8212;as well as sand into a well under high pressure in order to create fractures in the rock that allow oil or gas to flow more freely to the wellbore. Many newer wells would not be economical without the use of hydraulic fracturing to stimulate production from the well. We engage third parties to occasionally provide hydraulic fracturing or other well stimulation services to us in connection with many of the wells we operate. Hydraulic fracturing generally is exempt from regulation under the UIC program, and the hydraulic fracturing process is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions. 

&#160; 

For example, the Texas Legislature adopted new legislation requiring oil and gas operators to publicly disclose the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process, effective as of September 1, 2011. The Texas Railroad Commission has adopted rules and regulations implementing this legislation that apply to all wells for which the Railroad Commission issues an initial drilling permit after February 1, 2012. This law requires that the well operator disclose the list of chemical ingredients subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) for disclosure on an internet website and also file the list of chemicals with the Texas Railroad Commission with the well completion report. The total volume of water used to hydraulically fracture a well must also be disclosed to the public and filed with the Texas Railroad Commission. 

&#160; 

There has been increasing public controversy regarding hydraulic fracturing with regard to the use of fracturing fluids, impacts on drinking water supplies, use of water and the potential for impacts to surface water, groundwater and the environment generally. A number of lawsuits and enforcement actions have been initiated across the country implicating hydraulic fracturing practices. If new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such laws could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing to stimulate production from tight formations as well as make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater. In addition, if hydraulic fracturing is further regulated at the federal or state level, our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting and financial assurance requirements, more stringent construction specifications, increased monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations, plugging and abandonment requirements and also to attendant permitting delays and potential increases in costs. Such legislative changes could cause us to incur substantial compliance costs, and compliance or the consequences of any failure to comply by us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the impact on our business of newly enacted or potential federal or state legislation governing hydraulic fracturing. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

We believe that we are in compliance with all existing environmental laws and regulations applicable to our current operations and that our continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations, however we cannot assure you that the passage or application of more stringent laws or regulations in the future will not have an negative impact on our financial position or results of operation. We did not incur any material capital expenditures for remediation or pollution control activities for the year ended March 31, 2016. Additionally, as of the date of this report, we are not aware of any environmental issues or claims that will require material capital expenditures during fiscal 2017. 

&#160; 

Various state and federal statutes prohibit certain actions that adversely affect endangered or threatened species and their habitat, migratory birds, wetlands, and natural resources. These statutes include the Endangered Species Act and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act , as well as, the CWA and CERCLA. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service may designate critical habitat and suitable habitat areas that it believes are necessary for survival of threatened or endangered species. A critical habitat or suitable habitat designation could result in further material restrictions to federal land use and private land use and could delay or prohibit land access or development. 

&#160; 

Title to Properties 

&#160; 

As is customary in the oil and gas industry, only a preliminary title examination is conducted at the time properties believed to be suitable for drilling operations are acquired by us. Prior to the commencement of drilling operations, a thorough title examination of the drill site tract is conducted and curative work is performed with respect to significant defects, if any, before proceeding with operations. A thorough title examination has been performed with respect to substantially all leasehold producing properties currently owned by us. We believe the title to our leasehold properties is good and defensible in accordance with standards generally acceptable in the oil and gas industry subject to such exceptions that, in the opinion of counsel employed in the various areas in which we have conducted exploration activities, are not so material as to detract substantially from the use of such properties. 

&#160; 

The leasehold properties we own are subject to royalty, overriding royalty and other outstanding interests customary in the industry. The properties may be subject to burdens such as liens incident to operating agreements and current taxes, development obligations under oil and gas leases and other encumbrances, easements and restrictions. We do not believe any of these burdens will materially interfere with the use of these properties. 

&#160; 

Substantially all of our properties are currently mortgaged under a deed of trust to secure funding through a revolving line of credit. 

&#160; 

Insurance 

&#160; 

Our operations are subject to all the risks inherent in the exploration for and development and production of oil and gas including blowouts, fires and other casualties. We maintain insurance coverage customary for operations of a similar nature, but losses could arise from uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage.
