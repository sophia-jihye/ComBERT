Our Business 

&#160; 

We are in the business of acquiring, licensing and marketing patents and technology to create sustainable energy for our energy customers. Our mission is to lead a revolution in transforming global energy into a clean, affordable, and sustainable infrastructure that promotes socio-economic upliftment. 

&#160; 

We recently entered into an asset purchase agreement and amendment thereto (the &#8220;Purchase Agreement&#8221;), and acquired substantially all of the assets of CleanSpark Holdings, LLC. As a result of the Purchase Agreement and the acquisition of the assets, we have taken over the CleanSpark business as another opportunity in the energy sector, along with our existing Gasifier business. We believe that that synergies created from these businesses will strengthen our overall capacity to obtain financing, increase our customer base, open new distribution channels and increase our competitive strength in the energy market, all to the ultimate benefit of our shareholders. 

&#160; 

Our Flex Power System Business 

&#160; 

Integral to CleanSpark&#8217;s business is the Flex Power System (the &#8220;System&#8221;), which we acquired in the acquisition of the assets. The System provides secure, sustainable energy with significant cost savings for its energy customers. The System allows customers to efficiently manage renewable energy generation, other distributed energy generation technologies including waste to energy, energy storage systems, and consumption. By having autonomous control over the facets of energy usage and energy storage, customers are able to reduce their dependency on utilities, thereby keeping energy costs relatively constant over time. The overall aim is to transform energy consumers into energy producers by supplying power that anticipates their routine instead of interrupting it. 

&#160; 

Around the world, the aging grid is becoming unstable and unreliable due to increases in loads and lack of new large-scale generation facilities. This inherent instability is compounded by the push to integrate a growing number and variety of renewable but intermittent energy generators and advanced technologies into outdated electrical systems. Simultaneously, defense installations, industrial complexes, communities, and campuses across the world are turning to virtual power plants, distributed energy resources (DERs), energy storage systems (ESSs), and microgrids as a means to decrease their reliance from the grid, utilize cleaner power, and enhance energy security and surety. 

&#160; 

The convergence of these factors has created a &#8220;perfect storm&#8221; in the power supply optimization and energy management arena. Efficiently building and operating DERs, ESSs, the macrogrid, and microgrids of tomorrow, while maximizing the use of sustainable energy to produce affordable, stable, predictable, and reliable power on a large scale, is a significant opportunity that first-movers can leverage to capture a large share of this emerging global industry. 

&#160; 

A microgrid is comprised if any number of generation, energy storage, and smart distribution assets that serve a single or multiple loads, both connected to the grid and &#8220;islanded.&#8221; In the past, microgrids have consisted or off-grid generators organized with controls to provide power where utility lines cannot run. Today, modern microgrids integrate renewable energy generation systems (REGS), DERs, with advanced ESSs and interoperate with the local utility grid. Advanced autonomous cyber-secure microgrids controls relay information between intelligent hardware and localized hybrid-cloud infrastructure to make decisions in real-time that deliver optimum power where it is needed, when it is needed. 

&#160; 

Our System is an integrated Distributed Energy Resource Management System (DERMS) including microgrid control functionality that seamlessly integrates all forms of energy generation with DERS, ESS, and control of facility loads to provide energy security for the entire system, or a subset of critical circuits, in real time free of cyber threats. Able to interoperate with the local utility grid, the System brings users the ability to choose when to buy or sell power to and from the grid and participate in the developing wholesale ancillary services markets, enabling what we believe is the most cost effective power solution that exists on the current market. 

&#160; 

Our System is ideal for commercial, industrial, mining, defense, campus and community users and ranges in size from 4KW to 10MW and beyond and can deliver power at or below the current cost of utility power over the lifetime of the System. 

&#160; 

Our services consist of intelligent solar monitoring solutions, microgid design and engineering, project development consulting services, System installation and consulting, and turn-key microgrid implementation services. The work is performed under fixed price bid contracts, negotiated price contracts, fully financed power purchase agreements, or energy services agreements such as Microgrid as a Service (MaaS). 

&#160; 

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

mPulse Software Suite 

&#160; 

Our System utilizes our mPulse Energy Operating Platform software suite, which is broken down into three core components: &#8220;Receptor&#8221; monitoring solution, &#8220;FractalNode&#8221; Microgrid Controller, and &#8220;Cortex&#8221; Microgrid Operations Center. The Receptor line of monitoring solutions allows users to monitor energy supply and demand with nearly no additional hardware. The FractalNode Controller allows users to employ control and energy management capabilities utilizing CleanSpark&#8217;s FractalGrid systems architecture for Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) optimization and microgrid functionality. Cortex Microgrid Operation Centers simplify portfolio customer&#8217;s fleet management and allow users to access aggregated data of multiple systems while offering drill down capability and streamlining Operations and Maintenance (O&#38;M) functions. 

&#160; 

We recently hired a software systems engineer company to assist us with an upgrade of our existing software system. We will also be hiring an internal team of software developers in January of 2017. Our existing system (Version 1.0) works well, but integrates a number of coding languages and requires some custom engineering for each client implementation. Our upgraded software (Version 2.0) is expected to provide a more streamlined, maintainable, self-configuring, and scalable solution for our clients and allow us to more quickly and profitability implement our solution across multiple and rapidly increasing customer sites. We are developing a solution that can be implemented with either basic or advanced features to meet the needs of our customers and will be launching the features across our platform upon completion. We expect the Version 2 improvements upon Version 1 software features to be completed as outlined below: 

&#160; 

Phase 1: Version 2 Smart Solar Monitoring Solution &#8211; January 2017 

Phase 2: Version 2 Solar + Storage Solution &#8211; March 2017 

Phase 3: Version 2 Full Microgrid platform &#8211; April 2017 

Phase 4: Version 2 Utility Dispatchable Microgrid platform &#8211; May 2017 

&#160; 

MicroGrid Development Projects 

&#160; 

The California Energy Commission (CEC) awarded a grant to Harper Construction Company, Inc. in July 2013 to support a microgrid technology demonstration project. CleanSpark was subcontracted to provided design, development, integration, and installation services for the FractalGrid at the School of Infantry in the 52 Area of Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton. The Project was subsequently transferred to CleanSpark for consideration and an agreement to indemnify Harper Construction for all future responsibilities of maintenance, operations and warranty. 

&#160; 

The project included integration of our Version 1.0 proprietary software and controls platform with a variety of energy storage technologies. The system utilizes solar energy generated by pre-existing existing fixed-tilt solar photovoltaic panels and fifteen dual axis tracking concentrated photovoltaic units. Our distributed controls combine the generation with energy storage technologies to create four separate microgrids that self-align together to create a larger microgrid that ties directly into the larger utility grid at the 12kV level, allowing the base to consume energy from the most reliable, affordable source at any given time. The system provides a 100% renewable and sustainable solution to energy security. 

&#160; 

In the event of an outage or other energy surety threat, the software can autonomously separate the microgrids from the utility and the controls operate them independently in &#8220;island&#8221; mode, without interrupting service to critical circuits. Once energy from the grid is stabilized, our platform reconnects the microgrid to the utility. Each individual fractal microgrid can work independently or in concert as the larger 1.1MW FractalGrid, sharing data and energy throughout the group to improve efficiency, protect critical circuits, manage supply and demand, and allow for maintenance or repairs, as needed. The entire installation provides the Marine Corps and Department of the Navy with reliable energy security with built in cyber defense. 

&#160; 

Since the CEC Grant described above, we have begun the first and second stages of a follow-on implementation at the Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton which is composed of a $75,000 engineering and design contract. The contract has been expanded through exercise of a contract option to engage us for a $60,000 optimization and control logic development that may result in an additional contract option for $2,362,472 for construction, integration and commissioning of the designed and optimized System configuration. We expect the prime contractor to exercise these options. We anticipate the requirement of $500,000 to $750,000 in project financing, line of credit or similar funding to complete this project. As of the date of this filing we have completed billings of $75,000 in relation to the engineering and design contract and $36,593 related to the optimization and control logic development contract. 

&#160; 

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

This project is an example of the far reaching capabilities of our System and the variety of applications that are available as plug and play solutions. We are pursuing additional microgrid projects and anticipate the need for additional short-term project line of credit or other similar financing of up to $750,000 over the next twelve months to effectively execute on these proposals. 

&#160; 

Our Gasifier Business 

&#160; 

Integral to our existing business is the Gasifier. We own Patent Nos. 9,359,567, 8,518,133 8,105,401 and 8,347,829 protecting our gasification technology and process for using feedstock comprising gaseous fuel. Our technology converts any organic material into SynGas. SynGas can be used as clean, renewable, environmentally friendly, warming fuel for power plants, motor vehicles, and as feedstock for the generation of DME (Di-Methyl Ether). DME is the premier energy carrier and offers a range of important benefits: 

&#160; 

&#8226; Simple and low cost of production 

&#8226; An environmentally-benign propellant and coolant 

&#8226; Clean-burning and high energy efficiency 

&#8226; Lower transportation and distribution costs 

&#8226; Easily converted into other fuels and chemicals 

&#160; 

Our Gasifier converts the following materials into clean, reusable, renewable, and affordable energy: 

&#160; 

&#8226; Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) 

&#8226; Municipal sewage sludge 

&#8226; Food and cooking waste 

&#8226; Petroleum sludge and oily wastes 

&#8226; Animal manures 

&#8226; Cellulosic and non-cellulosic biomass 

&#8226; Energy crops 

&#8226; Scrap tires 

&#8226; Coal 

&#160; 

The process involves the grinding, drying, separating, mixing, and then pelletizing of solid waste. These pellets constitute the feedstock for the Gasifier. Gasifying the pellets produces SynGas. SynGas can be converted into multiple forms of energy including motor vehicle and jet fuels. The SynGas produced is so clean that it generally does not require hot-gas cleanup. SynGas is mostly hydrogen and carbon monoxide. Hydrogen and carbon monoxide are primary building blocks for fuels and chemicals. SynGas is a clean burning fuel suitable for use in duel-fuel diesel engines, gas turbines, and steam boilers. 

&#160; 

We believe that our process will turn the world&#8217;s waste problem into an abundant, renewable resource of energy. Our production can be adapted to the specific energy requirements of a given area. Communities are expected to benefit from the countless options created including inexpensive green electric power for homes, clean-burning fuel for garbage trucks, street maintenance equipment, or for resale to other municipalities. Because of the modular nature of the components intrinsic to the process, the plant could provide one energy source, then be converted to provide a different energy product. Our facility could produce additional electric power during the peak demand part of the day and produce fuels during the rest of the day. 

&#160; 

Our market segmentation is vast as we expect to apply our technology to anything that is carbon based. The markets for which we have focused our efforts include: the electric utility market, municipal waste, processing plants, the refining sector, stranded natural gas fields, and Canadian oil sands. 

&#160; 

We have begun pursuing opportunities to utilize the assets and intellectual properties purchased. We aim to further develop these technologies in order to pursue licensing, manufacturing and direct sales agreements for our Gasifier technology. 

&#160; 

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The technologies and prototype will begin undergoing clinical lab testing to further establish its capability of producing large volumes of clean, renewable energy from any carbon compound (Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) &#160; , Coal, Sewage Sludge) into clean Synthesis Gas. Our Gasifier is still under development and a commercially viable Gasifier is not expected to be sellable until the fourth quarter of 2017. In December of 2014, we executed an agreement with Combustion Resources, LLC to independently test our production model prototype. Combustion was engaged to independently test the Gasifer's performance and certify the results of its performance. Combustion Resources completed the initial stages of testing. Upon completion of the testing an initial project report was published outlining the results and suggested improvements. We are preparing the suggested improvements and anticipate that the cost of these improvements will be between $50,000 and $75,000. Upon completion of the improvement we will conduct an extended test run with an independent third party. We believe the results of these independent tests will provide the results needed to prove its commercial viability, at which time we would begin to actively market our Gasifier units. 

&#160; 

We have not engaged in any significant negotiations to sell our Gasifier products to any major customers. Once completed, we intend to distribute our products through advertisements and sales calls on potential customers with demonstrations of how the products work. We anticipate the need for a project financing partner, which we have not yet identified to support manufacturing and at least $250,000 in financing to support the required sales activities. The failure to acquire customers to generate revenues will negatively affect our financial performance and anticipate the need for at least $500,000 in financing over the next twelve months to execute on our business plans. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

We face significant competition in the alternative energy and microgrid markets. Some of our competitors have substantially larger financial and other resources. Factors that affect our ability to further test a commercially viable Gasifier and upgrade our System include available funds, available information and our standards established for projected return on investment. 

&#160; 

Our Flex Power System is set up to compete against larger companies. The Flex Power System is an integrated DERMS and microgrid control platform that seamlessly integrates energy generation with energy storage devices and controls facility loads to provide energy security in real time. The system is able to interoperate with the local utility grid and allows users the ability to obtain the most cost effective power for a facility. The System is technology agnostic and can incorporate into multiple vendors and manufacturers products and legacy systems. The Flex Power System is ideal for commercial, industrial, mining, defense, campus and community users ranging from 4 kw to 10 MW and beyond and can deliver power at or below the current cost of utility power. All of these attributes contribute to our ability to compete with the larger, more established competitors that typically rely on their own manufactured products and hardware solutions to enable proprietary controls that provide similar functionality. By requiring replacement of existing hardware with compatible hardware, and being limited to single-vendor solutions, system deployment costs of single-vendor solutions with limited ability for legacy asset integration typically result in higher costs when compared to the Flex Power System. 

&#160; 

DERMS with Microgrid control technologies are new to the market and can be deployed in various formats. Seven technologies that are predominantly used in commercial applications and/or have been extensively studied are: 

&#160; 

&#8226; Locus (Power monitoring) 

&#8226; GridBridge (Power monitoring) 

&#8226; Siemens (Intelligence and Automation) 

&#8226; Schnider Electric (Intelligence and automation) 

&#8226; ABB (Intelligence and Automation) 

&#8226; General Electric (Intelligence and Automation) 

&#8226; Hitachi (Intelligence and Automation) 

&#8226; Spirae (Intelligence and automation and Project Proposal Tool) 

&#8226; Energy Toolbase (Project Design Tool) 

&#8226; Homer (Project Design Tool) 

&#8226; Growing Labs Inc. (Project Design Tool and Intelligence/Automation) 

&#160; 

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

These current technologies of our competitors have a number of inherent potential shortfalls: 

&#160; 

&#8226; Operational sensitivity to specific hardware solutions potentially increasing the cost of implementations. 

&#8226; Non-automated systems require constant monitoring increasing operating costs. 

&#160; 

The principal advantages of our System are: 

&#160; 

&#8226; Technology agnostic approach allows customers to leverage aged legacy systems reducing implementation costs. 

&#8226; The automated process is user friendly and does not require highly qualified engineers to operate. 

&#8226; We believe our project optimization tool is more accurate than alternative options on the market due to inclusion of current costing, confirmed and validated operational performance data of ESSs instead of specified performance, state/federa/local incentives, and comparative rate structure engine. 

&#160; 

Our Gasifier system is set up to compete against larger gasification projects. Our modular concept allows for parallel processing so a facility could be easily expanded or reduced without risk or changing the basic structure by simply adding or removing module units; it also allows for multiple end product processing, producing electricity, ethanol, and fuels simultaneously, and for universal parts which reduces maintenance costs. This design factor solves repair and maintenance problems by simply shutting down the unit(s) to be repaired and bringing the reserve unit(s) online. All of these attributes contribute to our ability to compete with the larger, more established competitors that have large systems that require significant downtime for maintenance and repair. 

&#160; 

Gasification technologies can incorporate any one of a number of Gasifiers. Eight gasification technologies that are predominantly used in commercial applications and/or have been extensively studied are: 

&#160; 

&#8226; Texaco Entrained Flow (Downflow) Gasifier 

&#8226; E-Gas Entrained Flow (Upflow) Gasifier 

&#8226; Shell Entrained Flow (Upflow) Gasifier 

&#8226; KRW Fluidized-Bed Gasifier 

&#8226; Kellogg Transport Reactor Gasifier 

&#8226; Lurgi Dry Ash Gasifier 

&#8226; British Gas/Lurgi Fixed Bed Gasifier 

&#8226; Plasma Gasification 

&#160; 

These current technologies of our competitors have a number of inherent problems: 

&#160; 

&#8226; Large footprint plants and high operating costs. 

&#8226; Operational sensitivity to properties of different feedstock especially moisture content. 

&#8226; Tendency to caking and bridging. 

&#8226; Produces a dirty gas, expensive to clean or only suitable for low efficiency conversion in a steam-boiler turbine generator (10% electrical efficiency). 

&#8226; Inefficient usage of created energy to power plasma conversion. 

&#160; 

The principal advantages of our Gasifier are: 

&#160; 

&#8226; Modular concept allows for parallel processing so a facility could be easily expanded or reduced without risk or changing the basic structure by simply adding or removing module units; it also allows for multiple end product processing, producing electricity, ethanol, and fuels simultaneously, and for universal parts, which reduces maintenance costs. 

&#8226; The one stage process is very simple and does not require highly qualified engineers to operate because of the automation. 

&#8226; The direct heat transfer of the gases to the material being gasified is efficient, and as a natural consequence of the process, the product gas is stripped of its impurities, eliminating the costly hot gas clean up associated with other Gasifiers. 

&#8226; Pollutant absorbing binder aids in efficiency, cracking hydrocarbons acting as a catalyst, and absorbs the pollutants, oxidizes carbon eliminating water vapor and all but 5 &#8211; 10% carbon dioxide, which in the Company&#8217;s estimation will eliminate the need for carbon sequestration. 

&#8226; Ash by product makes an excellent road and cement aggregate. 

&#8226; Process is nearly 100% environmentally friendly. 

&#8226; Any and all liquid and solid organic wastes can be utilized and disposed of, producing no residual wastes. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

In relation to our Gasifier business, we own the following patents: Patent No. 9,359,567 &#8216;Gasification Method Using Feedstock Comprising Gaseous Fuels&#8217;; Patent No. 8,518,133 &#8216;Parallel Path, Downdraft Gasifier Apparatus and Method&#8217;; and Patent No. 8,105,401 &#8216;Parallel Path, Downdraft Gasifier Apparatus and Method.&#8217; 

&#160; 

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

On April 26, 2016, we entered into Stock Purchase Agreement with James Harper to acquire an additional patent as represented in an Assignment of even date. Specifically, the Agreement granted us the United States Patent No. 8,347,829 issued January 8, 2013 by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The Assignment transfers the patent and all rights associated therewith to us. Through this Assignment, the Company is now the sole owner of the patent, which is an invention entitled Electrolytic Reactor and Related Methods for Supplementing the Air Intake of an Internal Combustion Engine. The Company anticipates integrating this technology, in whole or in part, into its downdraft gasification system, enabling the capture and conversion of process byproducts into incremental energy. 

&#160; 

In relation to our microgrid business, we intend to file for patent protection on our System. We recently hired a software engineering company to assist with improvements and upgrades to our technology and we will also be hiring an internal team of software developers in January 2017. The ability of our staff and outside consultants to improve the system will likely affect our ability to apply for patent protection. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain a patent on our System. 

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental quality and pollution control. It is anticipated that, absent the occurrence of an extraordinary event, compliance with existing federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations concerning the protection of the environment and human health will not have a material effect upon us, our capital expenditures, or earnings. We cannot predict what effect additional regulation or legislation, enforcement policies thereunder and claims for damages for injuries to property, employees, other persons and the environment resulting from our operations. Our operations are subject to environmental regulation by state and federal authorities including the Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;). This regulation has not increased the cost of planning, designing and operating to date. Although we believe that compliance with environmental regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our operations or results of these operations, there can be no assurance that significant costs and liabilities, including criminal penalties, will not be incurred. Moreover, it is possible that other developments, including stricter environmental laws and regulations, and claims for damages for injuries to property or persons resulting from our activities could result in substantial costs and liabilities. 

&#160; 

In the conduct of our activities our operations will be subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (&#8220;OSHA&#8221;) and comparable state statutes. The OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and similar state statutes require us to organize information about hazardous materials used, released or produced in its operations. Certain of this information must be provided to employees, state and local governmental authorities and local citizens. We are also subject to the requirements and reporting set forth in OSHA workplace standards. 

&#160; 

Other than the above regulations and maintaining our good standing in the State of Nevada, complying with applicable local business licensing requirements, complying with all state and federal tax requirements, preparing our periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and complying with other applicable securities laws, rules, and regulations, we do not believe that existing or probably governmental regulations will have a material effect on our operations. We do not currently require the approval of any governmental agency or affiliated program for our operations. 

&#160; 

Employees, Consultants and Contractors 

&#160; 

We currently have no employees, but instead contract the services of consultants in the various areas of expertise as required. The way in which our business currently operates is as follows: 

&#160; 

Our Chief Executive Officer, S. Matthew Schultz, currently manages our day-to-day operations. He is responsible for the negotiation of contracts, oversees the design, marketing and implementation of the products and processes, and manages licenses, patents, and other intangible assets. In addition to daily management tasks, Mr. Schultz also researches financing and potential investors. 

&#160; 

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Our CFO, Zachary K. Bradford, is responsible for implementing our strategic goals and objectives. He is also in charge of managing our financial risks, financial planning, accounting records, SEC filings, reviewing financial data, reporting financial performance, preparing budgets, and monitoring expenditures and costs. 

&#160; 

Our COO, Bryan Huber, is responsible for implementing and overseeing our general operations and research and development activities. In addition, he is responsible for determining the feasibility and marketability of our technology and future technologies that we may acquire. 

&#160; 

The amount of time devoted to us currently by officers is due to the limited operations and resources we have. However, we feel the time devoted to operations is enough to cover our current operational requirements. 

&#160;
