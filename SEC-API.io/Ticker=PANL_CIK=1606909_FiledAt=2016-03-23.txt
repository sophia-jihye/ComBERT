 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Introduction 

&#160; 

Pangaea Logistics Solutions Ltd. and its subsidiaries (collectively, &#8220;Pangaea&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is a provider of seaborne drybulk transportation services. Pangaea utilizes its logistics expertise to service a broad base of industrial customers who require the transportation of a wide variety of drybulk cargoes, including grains, coal, iron ore, pig iron, hot briquetted iron, bauxite, alumina, cement clinker, dolomite and limestone. The Company addresses the transportation needs of its customers by undertaking a comprehensive set of services and activities, including cargo loading, cargo discharge, vessel chartering, voyage planning, and technical vessel management. 

&#160; 

Completed Mergers 

&#160; 

On April 30, 2014 the Company (formerly known as Quartet Holdco Ltd.), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the &#8220;Merger Agreement&#8221;) with Quartet Merger Corp. (&#8220;Quartet&#8221;), Quartet Merger Sub Ltd. (&#8220;Merger Sub&#8221;), Bulk Partners (Bermuda), Ltd. (at the time, Pangaea Logistics Solutions Ltd., now known as Bulk Partners (Bermuda), Ltd. &#8220;Bulk Partners&#8221;, or &#8220;Former Pangaea&#8221;), and the security holders of Bulk Partners (&#8220;Signing Holders&#8221;), which contemplated (i) Quartet merging with and into the Company, with the Company surviving such merger as the publicly-traded entity and (ii) Merger Sub merging with and into Bulk Partners with Bulk Partners surviving such merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (collectively, the &#8220;Mergers&#8221;). 

&#160; 

On September 29, 2014, Quartet held a special meeting in lieu of its annual meeting of stockholders, at which time the Quartet stockholders considered and adopted, among other matters, the Merger Agreement and the Mergers. On September 26, 2014, Bulk Partners&#8217; Board of Directors, acting by unanimous written consent, approved the Merger Agreement and the Mergers. On October 1, 2014, the parties consummated the Mergers. 

&#160; 

In the merger, holders of 8,840,014 shares of Quartet common stock sold in its initial public offering (&#8220;public shares&#8221;) exercised their rights to convert those shares to cash at a conversion price of approximately $10.20 per share, or an aggregate of approximately $90.1 million. As a result of the number of public shares converted into cash, the Quartet initial stockholders forfeited 1,739,062 shares (the &#8220;Forfeited Shares&#8221;) of Quartet common stock immediately prior to the Closing. Upon the Closing, the former security holders of Quartet were issued an aggregate of 3,130,844 common shares of the Company, including 1,026,813 common shares of the Registrant issued in exchange for Quartet&#8217;s then outstanding rights. 

&#160; 

In accordance with the terms of the convertible redeemable preferred stock of Former Pangaea, upon the Closing, 105,670 convertible redeemable preferred shares were converted into 115,352 common shares of Former Pangaea. The Signing Holders received 29,411,765 shares of the Company in exchange for their Former Pangaea securities and an additional 1,739,062 Forfeited Shares, or 31,150,827 shares in aggregate. 

&#160; 

Further, in connection with the Mergers, Quartet entered into agreements with certain third-party advisors pursuant to which such parties agreed to accept shares of the Company in lieu of cash for certain amounts owed to them, resulting in the issuance of an aggregate of 291,953 common shares. Additionally, 420,000 unit purchase options of Quartet were converted into 123,356 common shares of the Company, for a total of 415,309 issued to third-party advisors. 

The Company is a holding company incorporated under the laws of Bermuda as an exempted company on April 29, 2014. Bulk Partners, which following the Mergers is wholly owned by the Company, is a holding company that was incorporated under the laws of Bermuda as an exempted company on June 17, 2008 by three individuals who are collectively referred to as the &#8220;Founders.&#8221; The Company and its subsidiaries provide seaborne drybulk transportation services. 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015 , there are 36,503,837 &#32;common shares of the Company issued and outstanding where the Signing Holders own approximately 85.4% of the common shares, the Quartet stockholders own approximately 3.7% of the common shares, and the Advisors to the Mergers own approximately 1.1% of the common shares. 

Business 

&#160; 

The Company utilizes its logistics expertise to service a broad base of industrial customers who require the transportation of a wide variety of drybulk cargoes, including grains, pig iron, hot briquetted iron, bauxite, alumina, cement clinker, dolomite and limestone. The Company derives substantially all of its revenue from contracts of affreightment, also known as COAs, voyage charters, and time charters. In particular, the Company has historically focused on backhaul routes. Backhaul routes or ballast legs, position vessels for discharge in loading areas. Backhaul routes allow us to reduce ballast days and instead, earn revenues at times and on routes that are typically traveled without paying cargo. 

&#160; 

Contracts of affreightment (&#8220;COAs&#8221;), are contracts to transport multiple shipments of cargo during the term of the contract between specified load and discharge ports, at a fixed or variable price per metric ton of cargo. Voyage charters are revenue streams under which a vessel carries a shipment of cargo for a customer on a specified route for a fixed price per metric ton of cargo.Time charters are agreements during which the vessel is dedicated solely to the charterer for the term of the agreement. A majority of the Company&#8217;s revenue is from COAs and voyage charters, as our focus is on transporting cargo for our customers. The Company&#8217;s COAs typically extend for a period of one to five years, although some extend for longer periods. A time charter may vary from a single trip to longer-term charters, whenever we determine such use to be in our commercial interest. The length of a voyage depends on the number of load and discharge ports, the time spent in such ports and the distance between the ports. The Company attempts, through selecting COAs and voyage contracts on what would normally be backhaul or ballast legs, to enhance vessel utilization and its profitability because these contracts and charters position vessels at or near loading areas where spot cargoes are typically obtained. This reduces ballast time and expense as a percentage of the vessel&#8217;s total revenue and increases expected earnings for the vessel. 

&#160; 

The Company uses a mix of owned and chartered-in motor vessels ("m/v") to transport more than 18.3 million deadweight tons (&#8220;dwt&#8221;) of cargo to more than 100 ports around the world, averaging over 40 vessels in service during 2015 . The majority of our fleet is chartered-in on short-term charters of less than 9 months. The Company believes that these shorter-term charters afford us more flexibility to match our variable costs to our customers&#8217; service requirements, allowing us to respond to changes in market demand and limiting our exposure to changes in prevailing charter rates. In addition to the Company&#8217;s chartered-in fleet, we currently have interests in 14 dry bulk carriers and have orders for the construction of two additional vessels. These vessels are and will be used to serve the Company&#8217;s customers&#8217; cargo transportation needs. The Company believes that a combination of owned and chartered-in vessels helps it to more efficiently match its customer demand than it could with an entirely owned fleet or an entirely chartered-in fleet. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s Ice-Class 1A vessels are technically managed by a third-party manager with extensive expertise managing these vessel types and with ice pilotage. The technical management of the remainder of the Company&#8217;s owned fleet is performed in-house. The technical management for the Company&#8217;s chartered-in vessels is performed by each respective ship owner. 

&#160; 

Active risk management is an important part of our business model. The Company believes its active risk management allows it to reduce the sensitivity of its revenues to market fluctuations and helps it to secure its long-term profitability. We manage our market risk primarily through chartering in vessels for periods of less than 9 months on average. We further manage our market exposure through a portfolio approach based upon owned vessels, chartered-in vessels, COAs, voyage charters, and time charters. The Company tries to identify routes and ports for efficient bunkering to minimize its fuel expense. The Company also seeks to hedge a portion of its exposure to changes in the price of marine fuels, or bunkers and to fluctuating future freight rates through forward freight agreements. We have also entered into interest rate swap agreements to fix a portion of our interest rate exposure. 

Business Strategy 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s principal business objectives are to profitably grow its business and increase shareholder value. The Company expects to achieve these objectives through the following strategies: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Focus on increasing strategic COAs. The Company intends to increase its COA business, in particular, COAs for cargo discharge in traditional loading areas, by leveraging its relationships with existing customers and attracting new customers. The Company believes that its dedication to solving its customer&#8217;s transportation problems, reputation and experience in carrying a wide range of cargoes and transiting less common routes and ports increases its likelihood of securing strategic COAs. 

&#8226; 

Expand capacity and flexibility by increasing its owned fleet. The Company is continually looking to acquire additional high-quality vessels suited for its business strategy, the needs of its customers and growth opportunities the Company identifies. The Company plans to increase its controlled fleet (the vessels that the Company owns or have an ownership interest in) from 14 to 16 by the beginning of 2017. The current fleet includes four Ice-Class 1A Panamax newbuildings 

delivered between September 2014 and January 2016. The Company has shipbuilding contracts for the construction of two Ice-Class 1C Ultramax newbuildings scheduled for delivery in January 2017. The Company believes that its experience as a reliable and serious counterparty in the purchase and sale market for second-hand vessels positions it as a candidate for acquisition of high quality vessels. 

&#8226; 

Expand operations in Southeast Asia and the Middle East. The Company intends to expand its operations and presence in Southeast Asia and the Middle East to better access customers in these high growth regions. The Company believes that expanding its network of offices will allow it to meet more regularly with existing and potential customers and increase its shipping days as a result. The Company facilitates this through its office in Singapore. 

&#8226; 

Increase backhaul focus and fleet efficiency. The Company continues to focus on backhaul cargoes, including backhaul cargoes associated with COAs, to reduce ballast days and increase expected earnings for well-positioned vessels. In addition, the Company intends to continue to charter in vessels for periods of less than nine months, on average, to permit it to match its variable costs to demand. The Company believes that increased vessel utilization and positioning efficiency will enhance its profitability. 

&#8226; 

Maintain moderate balance sheet leverage. In the future, the Company expects to incur additional indebtedness to expand its fleet and operations. The Company expects to repay existing and future debt from time to time with cash flow from operations or from the net proceeds of asset sales or future security issuances. The Company intends to limit the amount of indebtedness relative to its assets and cash flow and will seek to maintain indebtedness at levels lower than many publicly traded drybulk ship owning companies to reduce risks associated with high leverage. 

Competitive Strengths 

&#160; 

The Company believes that it possesses a number of competitive strengths in its industry, including: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Expertise in niche markets and routes. The Company has developed expertise and a major presence in selected niche markets and less commoditized routes, especially the Baltic Sea in winter, the Northern Sea Route between Europe and Asia in summer, and the trade route between Jamaica and the United States, as well as selected ports, particularly in Newfoundland and Baffin Island. The Company believes that there is less competition to carry &#8220;minor,&#8221; as compared to traditional &#8220;major,&#8221; bulk cargoes, and, similarly, there is less competition on less commoditized routes. The Company believes that its experience in carrying a wide range of cargoes and transiting less common routes and ports increases its likelihood of securing higher rates and margins than those available for more commoditized cargoes and routes. The Company believes it operates assets well suited to certain of these routes, including its Japanese built ice-1A classed Panamax vessels and Korean built ice-1A classed Handymax vessels. The majority of its fleet is chartered in and the Company selects these vessels to match the cargo and port characteristics of their nominated voyages. The Company has experience operating in all regularly operating dry bulk loading and discharge ports globally. 

&#8226; 

Enhanced vessel utilization and profitability through strategic backhaul and triangulation methods. The Company enhances vessel utilization and profitability through selecting COAs and other contracts to carry cargo on what would normally be backhaul or ballast legs. In contrast to the typical practice of incurring charter hire and bunker costs to position an empty vessel in a port or area where cargo is normally loaded, the Company instead actively works with its customers to secure cargoes for discharge in loading areas. The Company&#8217;s practice allows it to position vessels for loading at lower costs than it would bear if it positioned such vessels by traveling unladen or if the Company chartered in vessels in a loading area. The Company believes that this focus on backhaul cargoes permits them to benefit from ballast bonuses that are paid to position vessels for fronthaul cargoes or, alternatively, to collect a premium for delivering ships that are in position for fronthaul cargoes. 

&#8226; 

Strong relationships with major industrial customers. The Company has developed strong commercial relationships with a number of major industrial customers. These customer relationships are based upon the Company&#8217;s industry reputation and specific history of service to the customer. The Company believes that these relationships help it generate recurring business with such customers which, in some cases, are formalized through contracts for repeat business. The Company also believes that these relationships can help create new opportunities. Although many of these relationships have extended over a period of years, there is no assurance that such relationships or business will continue in the future. Repeat customers, measured as having shipping days in three or more years of the trailing four years, represented nearly 59% of its total shipping days for the trailing four year period ended December 31, 2015 &#32;and 54% of its total shipping days for the trailing four year period ended December 31, 2014 . In addition, the Company believes that its familiarity with local regulations and market conditions at its routinely serviced ports, particularly in Newfoundland and Jamaica, provides it with a strong competitive advantage and allows it to attract new customers and secure recurring business. 

&#8226; 

Strong Alignment and Transparency. The Company observes that many publicly traded shipping companies rely on service providers affiliated with senior management or dominant shareholders for fundamental activities. Beyond the operational benefits to its customers of integrated commercial and technical management, the Company believes that its shareholders are benefited by its strategy of performing many of those activities in-house. Related to these efforts to maximize alignment of interest, the Company believes that the associated transparency of ownership and authority will be attractive to current and prospective shareholders. Consistent with the foregoing, the Company&#8217;s only related party transactions with senior management are principal and interest obligations for cash loaned to the Company by management, on terms approved by third parties not affiliated with management. 

&#8226; 

Experienced management team. The day-to-day operations of a transportation logistics services company requires close coordination among customers, land-based transportation providers and port authorities around the world. Its efficient operation depends on the experience and expertise of management at all levels, from vessel acquisition and financing strategy to oversight of vessel technical operations and cargo loading and discharge. The Company has a management team of senior executive officers and key employees with extensive experience and relationships in the commercial, technical, and financial areas of the drybulk shipping industry. Members of its management team and key employees have on average over 26 years of shipping experience. 

&#8226; 

Risk-management discipline. The Company believes its risk management allows it to reduce the sensitivity of its earnings to market changes and lower the risk of losses. The Company manages its risks primarily through short-term charter-in agreements of less than nine months, on average, FFAs, fuel hedges and modest leverage. The Company believes that shorter-term charters permit it to adjust its variable costs to match demand more rapidly than if it chartered in those vessels for longer periods. The Company may choose to manage the risks of higher rates for certain future voyages by purchasing and selling FFAs to limit the impact of changes in chartering rates. Similarly, the Company may choose to manage the risks of increasing fuel costs through bunker hedging transactions in order to limit the impact of changes in fuel prices on voyage results. Finally, the Company believes that its expected income related to COAs is sufficient to satisfy obligations related to its owned fleet. 

Management 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s management team consists of senior executive officers and key employees with decades of experience in the commercial, technical, management and financial areas of the logistics and shipping industries. The Company&#8217;s co-founder and Chief Executive Officer, Edward Coll, has over 37 years of experience in the drybulk shipping industry. Other members of its management team and key employees, Anthony Laura, Claus Boggild, Mads Boye Petersen, Peter Koken, Robert Seward, Fotis Doussopoulos, and Gianni Del Signore, have an average of more than 26 years of experience in the shipping industry. The Company believes its management team is well respected in the drybulk sector of the shipping industry and, over the years, has developed strong commercial relationships with industrial customers and lenders. The Company believes that the experience, reputation and background of its management team will continue to be key factors in its success. 

&#160; 

The Company provides logistics transportation services and commercially manages its fleet primarily from offices in Newport, Rhode Island and Copenhagen, Denmark and Singapore. Logistics services and commercial management include identifying cargo for transportation, voyage planning, managing relationships, identifying vessels to charter in, and operating such vessels. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s Ice-Class 1A vessels are technically managed by a third-party manager with extensive expertise managing these vessel types and with ice pilotage. The technical management of the remainder of the Company&#8217;s owned fleet is performed in-house. The Company&#8217;s technical management personnel have experience in the complexities of oceangoing vessel operations, including the supervision of maintenance, repairs, improvements, drydocking and crewing. The technical management for the Company&#8217;s chartered-in vessels is performed by each respective ship owner. 

&#160; 

Operations and Assets 

&#160; 

The Company is a service business and its customers use its services because they believe the Company adds and creates value for them. To add value, the Company works with its customers to provide a range of logistics services beyond the traditional loading, carriage and discharge of cargoes. For example, the Company works with certain customers to review their contractual delivery terms and conditions, permitting those customers to reduce costs and risks while accelerating payments. As another example, one of its customers is heavily dependent upon a port that was insufficiently supported by port pilots for the approach to port. To permit a large expansion of its services for this client, the Company formed a separate pilots association to increase the number of available pilots and improve access to the port. As a result of efforts such as these, in some cases the Company is the de facto transportation department for certain clients. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s core offering is the safe, reliable, and timely loading, carriage, and discharge of cargoes for customers. This offering requires identifying customers, agreeing on the terms of service, selecting a vessel to undertake the voyage, working with port personnel to load and discharge cargo, and documenting the transfers of title upon loading or discharge of the cargo. As a result, the Company spends significant time and resources to identify and retain customers and source potential cargoes in its areas of operation. To further expand its customer base and potential cargoes, the Company has developed expertise in servicing ports and routes subject to severe ice conditions, including the Baltic Sea and the Northern Sea Route. The Company&#8217;s subsidiary, Nordic Bulk Carriers A/S (&#8220;NBC&#8221;), is an adviser to the European Commission on Arctic maritime issues. 

&#160; 

To support its services, the Company operates a fleet of 14 owned or partially owned vessels. As of March 23, 2016 , these vessels and the vessels currently under construction are described in the table below:

&#160; 

(1) 

This vessel is time-chartered to Nordic Bulk Carriers A/S (&#8220;NBC&#8221;), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nordic Bulk Holding ApS (&#8220;NBH&#8221;). 

(2) 

This vessel is operated by the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Phoenix Bulk Carriers (BVI) Ltd. (&#8220;PBC&#8221;). 

The Company owns its vessels through separate wholly-owned subsidiaries and through joint venture entities with other owners, which the Company consolidates as variable interest entities in its consolidated financial statements. 

The Company&#8217;s owns one-third of Nordic Bulk Holding Company Ltd., (&#8220;NBHC&#8221;), a corporation that was duly organized under the laws of Bermuda in October 2012. Bulk Orion Ltd. (&#8220;Bulk Orion&#8221;), Bulk Odyssey Ltd. (&#8220;Bulk Odyssey&#8221;), Bulk Nordic Oshima Ltd. (&#8220;Bulk Oshima&#8221;), Bulk Nordic Olympic Ltd. (&#8220;Bulk Olympic&#8221;), Bulk Nordic Odin Ltd. (&#8220;Bulk Odin&#8221;) and Bulk Nordic Oasis Ltd. (&#8220;Bulk Oasis&#8221;) are companies that were organized under the laws of Bermuda for the purpose of owning Ice Class 1A Panamax vessels and are all owned by NBHC. The m/v Nordic Orion (&#8220;Orion&#8221;), the m/v Nordic Odyssey (&#8220;Odyssey&#8221;), the m/v Nordic Oshima (&#8220;Oshima&#8221;), the m/v Nordic Olympic (&#8220;Olympic&#8221;), the m/v Nordic Odin (&#8220;Odin&#8221;) and the m/v Nordic Oasis (&#8220;Oasis&#8221;) are owned by these entities. All of these vessels are chartered to NBC at fixed rates. 

&#160; 

The Company owns 50% of Nordic Bulk Ventures Holding Company Ltd., (&#8220;BVH&#8221;), a corporation that was duly organized under the laws of Bermuda. BVH was established in August 2013 for the purpose of owning Bulk Nordic Five Ltd. (&#8220;Five&#8221;) and Bulk Nordic Six Ltd. (&#8220;Six&#8221;). Five and Six are corporations that were duly organized under the laws of Bermuda in November 2013 for the purpose of owning ultramax newbuildings to be delivered early in 2017. 

&#160; 

In addition to its owned fleet, the Company operates chartered-in Panamax, Supramax, Handymax and Handysize drybulk carriers. On average, over the past three years, the Company has owned or employed a fleet of approximately 35 &#8211; 50 vessels at 

any one time. In 2015, the Company owned interests in an average of 14 vessels and chartered in an additional 196 for one or more voyages. In 2014, the Company owned interests in an average of 13 vessels and chartered in an additional 203 for one or more voyages. The Company generally charters in third-party vessels for periods of less than six months and, in most cases, less than nine months. Chartered-in contracts are negotiated through brokers, who are paid commission on a percentage basis. The Company believes that shorter-term charters afford it flexibility to match its variable costs to its customers&#8217; service requirements. The Company also believes that this combination of owned and chartered-in vessels helps it to more efficiently match its customer demand than the Company could with only owned vessels or an entirely chartered-in fleet. The Company does not charter-in any vessels under speculative arrangements.

Crewing and Employees 

&#160; 

Each of its vessels is crewed with 23-25 independently contracted officers and crew members and on certain vessels, directly contracted officers. Its technical managers are responsible for locating, contracting and retaining qualified officers for its vessels. The crewing agencies handle each crew member&#8217;s training, travel and payroll, and ensure that all the crew members on its vessels 

have the qualifications and licenses required to comply with international regulations and shipping conventions. The Company typically has more crew members on board than are required by the country of the vessel&#8217;s flag in order to allow for the performance of routine maintenance duties. 

&#160; 

As of March 23, 2016 , the Company employed 72 shore-based personnel and had approximately 336 independently contracted seagoing personnel on its owned vessels. The shore-based personnel are employed in the United States, Athens, Copenhagen, Brazil and Singapore. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The Company operates in markets that are highly competitive and based primarily on supply and demand for ocean transport of drybulk commodities. The Company competes for COAs on the basis of service, price, route history, size, age and condition of the vessel and for charters on the basis of service, price, vessel availability, size, age and condition of the vessel, as well as on its reputation as an owner and operator. The Company principally competes with owners and operators of Panamax, Supramax and Handymax vessels. 

&#160; 

Seasonality 

&#160; 

Demand for vessel capacity has historically exhibited seasonal variations and, as a result, fluctuations in charter rates. This seasonality may result in quarter-to-quarter volatility in its operating results. The dry bulk carrier market is typically stronger in the fall and winter months in anticipation of increased consumption of coal and other raw materials in the northern hemisphere during the winter months. In addition, unpredictable weather patterns in these months tend to disrupt vessel scheduling and supplies of certain commodities. 

&#160; 

Permits and Authorizations 

&#160; 

The Company is required by various governmental and quasi-governmental agencies to obtain certain permits and certificates with respect to its vessels. The kinds of permits and certificates required depend upon several factors, including the commodity transported, the waters in which the vessel operates, the nationality of the vessel&#8217;s crew and the age of the vessel. The Company has been able to obtain all permits and certificates currently required to permit its vessels to operate. Additional laws and regulations, environmental or otherwise, may be adopted which could limit its ability to do business or increase the cost of doing business. 

&#160; 

Environmental and Other Regulations 

&#160; 

Government regulation significantly affects the ownership and operation of its vessels. The Company is subject to international conventions and treaties, national, state and local laws and regulations in force in the countries in which its vessels may operate or are registered relating to safety and health and environmental protection including the storage, handling, emission, transportation and discharge of hazardous and non-hazardous materials, and the remediation of contamination and liability for damage to natural resources. Compliance with such laws, regulations and other requirements entails significant expense, including vessel modifications and implementation of certain operating procedures. 

&#160; 

A variety of government and private entities subject the Company&#8217;s vessels to both scheduled and unscheduled inspections. These entities include the local port authorities (such as the U.S. Coast Guard, harbor master or equivalent), classification societies, flag state administrations (countries of registry) and charterers, particularly terminal operators. Certain of these entities require them to obtain permits, certificates or approvals for the operation of its vessels. Failure to maintain necessary permits, certificates or approvals could require it to incur substantial costs or temporarily suspend the operation of one or more of its vessels. 

&#160; 

The Company believes that the heightened level of environmental and quality concerns among insurance underwriters, regulators and charterers is leading to greater inspection and safety requirements on all vessels and may accelerate the scrapping of older vessels throughout the dry bulk shipping industry. Increasing environmental concerns have created a demand for vessels that conform to the stricter environmental standards. The Company is required to maintain operating standards for all of its vessels that emphasize operational safety, quality maintenance, continuous training of its officers and crews and compliance with United States and international regulations. The Company believes that the operation of its vessels is in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that its vessels have all material permits, certificates or other approvals necessary for the conduct of its operations as of the date of this Form 10-K. However, because such laws and regulations are frequently changed and may impose increasingly strict requirements, the Company cannot predict the ultimate cost of complying with these requirements, or the impact of these requirements on the resale value or useful lives of its vessels. In addition, a future serious marine incident that results in significant oil pollution or otherwise causes significant adverse environmental impact could result in additional legislation or regulation that could negatively affect the Company&#8217;s profitability. 

&#160; 

The laws and regulations discussed below may not constitute a comprehensive list of all such laws and regulations that are applicable to the operation of its vessels. 

&#160; 

International Maritime Organization 

&#160; 

The United Nations&#8217; International Maritime Organization, or the IMO, has adopted the International Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978 relating thereto (collectively referred to as MARPOL 73/78 and herein as &#8220;MARPOL&#8221;). MARPOL entered into force on October 2, 1983. It has been adopted by over 150 nations, including many of the jurisdictions in which the Company's vessels operate. MARPOL sets forth pollution-prevention requirements applicable to drybulk carriers, among other vessels, and is broken into six Annexes, each of which regulates a different source of pollution. Annex I relates to oil leakage or spilling; Annexes II and III relate to harmful substances carried, in bulk, in liquid or packaged form, respectively; and Annexes IV and V relate to sewage and garbage management, respectively. Annex VI, separately adopted by the IMO in September of 1997, relates to air emissions. 

&#160; 

Air Emissions 

&#160; 

In September of 1997, the IMO adopted Annex VI to MARPOL to address air pollution. Effective May 2005, Annex VI sets limits on nitrogen oxide emissions from ships whose diesel engines were constructed (or underwent major conversions) on or after January 1, 2000. It also prohibits &#8220;deliberate emissions&#8221; of &#8220;ozone depleting substances,&#8221; defined to include certain halons and chlorofluorocarbons. Deliberate emissions are not limited to times when the ship is at sea; they can for example include discharges occurring in the course of the ship&#8217;s repair and maintenance. Emissions of &#8220;volatile organic compounds&#8221; from certain tankers, and the shipboard incineration (from incinerators installed after January 1, 2000) of certain substances (such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)) are also prohibited. Annex VI also includes a global cap on the sulfur content of fuel oil (see below). 

&#160; 

The IMO&#8217;s Marine Environment Protection Committee, or MEPC, adopted amendments to Annex VI on October 10, 2008, which amendments were entered into force on July 1, 2010. The Amended Annex VI seeks to further reduce air pollution by, among other things, implementing a progressive reduction of the amount of sulphur contained in any fuel oil used onboard ships. As of January 1, 2012, the Amended Annex VI required that fuel oil contain no more than 3.50% sulfur (from the current cap of 4.50%). By January 1, 2020, sulfur content must not exceed 0.50%, subject to a feasibility review to be completed no later than 2018. 

&#160; 

Beginning January 1, 2015, ships operating within an emission control area ("ECA") were not permitted to use fuel with sulfur content in excess of 0.1% (from 1.0%). Amended Annex VI establishes procedures for designating new ECAs. Currently, the Baltic Sea and the North Sea have been so designated. Effective August 1, 2012, certain coastal areas of North America were designated ECAs, and effective January 1, 2014, applicable areas of the United States Caribbean Sea adjacent to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands were designated ECAs. Ocean-going vessels in these areas are subject to stringent emissions controls, which may cause the Company to incur additional costs. If other ECAs are approved by the IMO or other new or more stringent requirements relating to emissions from marine diesel engines or port operations by vessels are adopted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the "EPA"), or the states where the Company operates, compliance with these regulations could entail significant capital expenditures or otherwise increase the costs of operations. 

&#160; 

As of January 1, 2013, MARPOL made certain measures relating to energy efficiency for ships mandatory. It makes the Energy Efficiency Design Index, or EEDI, applicable to new ships and the Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan, or SEEMP, applicable to all ships. 

&#160; 

Amended Annex VI also establishes tiers of stringent nitrogen oxide emissions standards for new marine engines, depending on their date of installation. The promulgated equivalent (and in some senses stricter) emissions standards in late 2009. 

&#160; 

Safety Management System Requirements 

&#160; 

The IMO also adopted the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, or SOLAS, and the International Convention on Load Lines, or the LL Convention, which impose a variety of standards that regulate the design and operational features of ships. The IMO periodically revises the SOLAS and LL Convention standards. May 2012 SOLAS amendments entered into force as of January 1, 2014. 

&#160; 

The operation of the Company&#8217;s ships is also affected by the requirements set forth in Chapter IX of SOLAS, which sets forth the IMO&#8217;s International Management Code for the Safe Operation of Ships and Pollution Prevention, or the ISM Code. The ISM Code requires ship owners and ship managers to develop and maintain an extensive Safety Management System ("SMS"), that 

includes the adoption of a safety and environmental protection policy setting forth instructions and procedures for safe operation and describing procedures for dealing with emergencies. The Company relies upon the safety management system that the Company and its technical managers have developed for compliance with the ISM Code. The failure of a ship owner to comply with the ISM Code may subject such party to increased liability, may decrease available insurance coverage for the affected vessels and may result in a denial of access to, or detention in, certain ports. As of the date of this filing, each of its vessels is ISM code-certified. 

&#160; 

The ISM Code requires that vessel operators obtain a safety management certificate, or SMC, for each vessel they operate. This certificate evidences compliance by a vessel&#8217;s operators with the ISM Code requirements for an SMS. No vessel can obtain an SMC under the ISM Code unless its manager has been awarded a document of compliance, or DOC, issued in most instances by the vessel's flag state. The Company&#8217;s appointed ship managers have obtained documents of compliance for their offices and safety management certificates for all of its vessels for which the certificates are required by the IMO. The document of compliance, or the DOC, and ship management certificate, or the SMC, are renewed as required. 

&#160; 

The IMO continues to review and introduce new regulations. It is impossible to predict what additional regulations, if any, may be passed by the IMO and what effect, if any, such regulations might have on the Company&#8217;s operations. 

&#160; 

Pollution Control and Liability Requirements 

&#160; 

The IMO has negotiated international conventions that impose liability for pollution in international waters and the territorial waters of the signatories to such conventions. For example, the IMO adopted the International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships&#8217; Ballast Water and Sediments, or the BWM Convention, in February 2004. The BWM Convention's implementing regulations call for a phased introduction of mandatory ballast water exchange requirements, to be replaced in time with mandatory concentration limits. The BWM Convention will not enter into force until 12 months after it has been adopted by 30 states, the combined merchant fleets of which represent not less than 35% of the gross tonnage of the world&#8217;s merchant shipping tonnage. Ratification of the Ballast Water Management (BWM) Convention by 47 countries, including Morocco, Indonesia and Ghana during November 2015 has brought the convention closer to meeting the requirements for entry into force, but whether the requirement for parties to hold 35% of the world&#8217;s tonnage has been met is still being calculated. 

Upon entry into force of the BWM Convention, mid-ocean ballast exchange would be mandatory for its vessels. The cost of compliance could increase for ocean carriers, and these costs may be material. The Company&#8217;s vessels would be required to be equipped with a ballast water treatment system that meets mandatory concentration limits not later than the first intermediate or renewal survey, whichever occurs first, after the anniversary date of delivery of the vessel in 2014, for vessels with ballast water capacity of 1500 &#8211; 5000 cubic meters, or after such date in 2016, for vessels with ballast water capacity of greater than 5000 cubic meters. If mid-ocean ballast exchange or ballast water treatment requirements become mandatory, the cost of compliance could increase for ocean carriers. Although the Company does not believe the costs of compliance with mandatory mid-ocean ballast exchange would be material, it is difficult to predict the overall impact of such a requirement on its operations. 

&#160; 

The IMO adopted the International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage, or the Bunker Convention, to impose strict liability on ship owners for pollution damage in jurisdictional waters of ratifying states caused by discharges of bunker fuel. The Bunker Convention requires registered owners of ships over 1,000 gross tons to maintain insurance for pollution damage in an amount equal to the limits of liability under the applicable national or international limitation regime (but not exceeding the amount calculated in accordance with the Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims of 1976, as amended). With respect to non-ratifying states, liability for spills or releases of oil carried as fuel in ship&#8217;s bunkers typically is determined by the national or other domestic laws in the jurisdiction where the events or damages occur. 

&#160; 

In March 2006, the IMO amended Annex I to MARPOL, including a new regulation relating to oil fuel tank protection, which became effective August 1, 2007. The new regulation applies to various ships delivered on or after August 1, 2010. It includes requirements for the protected location of the fuel tanks, performance standards for accidental oil fuel outflow, a tank capacity limit and certain other maintenance, inspection and engineering standards. 

&#160; 

Noncompliance with the ISM Code or other IMO regulations may subject the Company to increased liability, lead to decreases in available insurance coverage for affected vessels or result in the denial of access to, or detention in, some ports. As of the date of this report, each of the Company&#8217;s vessels is ISM Code certified. However, there can be no assurance that such certificate will be maintained. 

International Code for Ships Operating in Polar Waters 

&#160; 

The IMO in November 2014 adopted the International Code for Ships Operating in Polar Waters (the &#8220;Polar Code&#8221;), and related amendments to the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (&#8220;SOLAS&#8221;) to make it mandatory. 

&#160; 

The expected date of entry into force of the SOLAS amendments is January 1, 2017, under the tacit acceptance procedure. It will apply to new ships constructed after that date. Ships constructed before January 1, 2017 will be required to meet the relevant requirements of the Polar Code by the first intermediate or renewal survey, whichever occurs first, after January 1, 2018. 

&#160; 

The Polar Code will be mandatory under both SOLAS and MARPOL because it contains both safety and environment related provisions. In October 2014, IMO&#8217;s Marine Environment Protection Committee (&#8220;MEPC&#8221;) approved the necessary draft amendments to make the environmental provisions in the Polar Code mandatory under MARPOL. The MEPC adopted the Polar Code and associated MARPOL amendments in May 2015, with an entry-into-force date to be aligned with the SOLAS amendments. 

&#160; 

The U.S. Oil Pollution Act of 1990 and Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act 

&#160; 

The Oil Pollution Act of 1990, ("OPA"), established an extensive regulatory and liability regime for the protection and cleanup of the environment from oil spills. OPA affects all &#8220;owners and operators&#8221; whose vessels trade with the United States, its territories and possessions or whose vessels operate in United States waters, which includes the United States&#8217; territorial sea and its 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone around the United States. The United States has also enacted the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or CERCLA, which applies to the discharge of hazardous substances other than oil, whether on land or at sea. OPA and CERCLA both define &#8220;owner and operator&#8221; in the case of a vessel as any person owning, operating or chartering by demise, the vessel. Both OPA and CERCLA impact the Company&#8217;s operations. 

Under OPA, vessel owners and operators are &#8220;responsible parties&#8221; and are jointly, severally and strictly liable (unless the spill results solely from the act or omission of a third party, an act of God or an act of war) for all containment and clean-up costs and other damages arising from discharges or threatened discharges of oil from their vessels. OPA defines these other damages broadly to include: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

injury to, destruction or loss of, or loss of use of, natural resources and related assessment costs; 

&#8226; 

injury to, or economic losses resulting from, the destruction of real and personal property; 

&#8226; 

net loss of taxes, royalties, rents, fees or net profit revenues resulting from injury, destruction or loss of real or personal property, or natural resources; 

&#8226; 

loss of subsistence use of natural resources that are injured, destroyed or lost; 

&#8226; 

lost profits or impairment of earning capacity due to injury, destruction or loss of real or personal property or natural resources; and 

&#8226; 

net cost of increased or additional public services necessitated by removal activities following a discharge of oil, such as protection from fire, safety or health hazards, and loss of subsistence use of natural resources. 

OPA contains statutory caps on liability and damages; such caps do not apply to direct cleanup costs. Effective July 31, 2009, the U.S. Coast Guard adjusted the limits of OPA liability for non-tank vessels (e.g. drybulk) to the greater of $1,000 per gross ton or $854,400 (subject to periodic adjustment for inflation). These limits of liability do not apply if an incident was proximately caused by the violation of an applicable U.S. federal safety, construction or operating regulation by a responsible party (or its agent, employee or a person acting pursuant to a contractual relationship), or a responsible party&#8217;s gross negligence or willful misconduct. The limitation on liability similarly does not apply if the responsible party fails or refuses to (i) report the incident where the responsibility party knows or has reason to know of the incident; (ii) reasonably cooperate and assist as requested in connection with oil removal activities; or (iii) without sufficient cause, comply with an order issued under the Federal Water Pollution Act (Section 311 (c), (e)) or the Intervention on the High Seas Act. 

&#160; 

CERCLA contains a similar liability regime whereby owners and operators of vessels are liable for cleanup, removal and remedial costs, as well as damages for injury to, or destruction or loss of, natural resources, including the reasonable costs associated with assessing same, and health assessments or health effects studies. There is no liability if the discharge of a hazardous substance results solely from the act or omission of a third party, an act of God or an act of war. Liability under CERCLA is limited to the greater of $300 per gross ton or $5.0 million for vessels carrying a hazardous substance as cargo and the greater of $300 per gross 

ton or $500,000 for any other vessel. These limits do not apply (rendering the responsible person liable for the total cost of response and damages) if the release or threat of release of a hazardous substance resulted from willful misconduct or negligence, or the primary cause of the release was a violation of applicable safety, construction or operating standards or regulations. The limitation on liability also does not apply if the responsible person fails or refused to provide all reasonable cooperation and assistance as requested in connection with response activities where the vessel is subject to OPA. 

&#160; 

OPA and CERCLA both require owners and operators of vessels to establish and maintain with the U.S. Coast Guard evidence of financial responsibility sufficient to meet the maximum amount of liability to which the particular responsible person may be subject. Vessel owners and operators may satisfy their financial responsibility obligations by providing a proof of insurance, a surety bond, qualification as a self-insurer or a guarantee. 

&#160; 

The 2010 Deepwater Horizon &#32;oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico may also result in additional regulatory initiatives or statutes, including the raising of liability caps under OPA. Compliance with any new requirements of OPA may substantially impact the Company&#8217;s cost of operations or require it to incur additional expenses to comply with any new regulatory initiatives or statutes. Additional legislation or regulations applicable to the operation of its vessels that may be implemented in the future could adversely affect its business. 

&#160; 

The Company currently maintains pollution liability coverage insurance in the amount of $1.0 billion per incident for each of the Company&#8217;s vessels. If the damages from a catastrophic spill were to exceed the Company&#8217;s insurance coverage it could have an adverse effect on its business and results of operation. 

&#160; 

OPA specifically permits individual states to impose their own liability regimes with regard to oil pollution incidents occurring within their boundaries, provided they accept, at a minimum, the levels of liability established under OPA and some states have enacted legislation providing for unlimited liability for oil spills. In some cases, states which have enacted such legislation have not yet issued implementing regulations defining vessel owners&#8217; responsibilities under these laws. The Company intends to comply with all applicable state regulations in the ports where its vessels call. The Company believes that it is in substantial compliance with all applicable existing state requirements. In addition, the Company intends to comply with all future applicable state regulations in the ports where its vessels call. 

&#160; 

Other Environmental Initiatives 

&#160; 

The U.S. Clean Water Act, or CWA, prohibits the discharge of oil, hazardous substances and ballast water in U.S. navigable waters unless authorized by a duly-issued permit or exemption, and imposes strict liability in the form of penalties for any unauthorized discharges. The CWA also imposes substantial liability for the costs of removal, remediation and damages, and complements the remedies available under OPA and CERCLA. Furthermore, many U.S. states that border a navigable waterway have enacted environmental pollution laws that impose strict liability on a person for removal costs and damages resulting from a discharge of oil or a release of a hazardous substance. These laws may be more stringent than U.S. federal law. 

&#160; 

The EPA regulates the discharge of ballast water and other substances in U.S. waters under the CWA. EPA regulations require vessels 79 feet in length or longer (other than commercial fishing and recreational vessels) to comply with a Vessel General Permit (the "VGP"), authorizing ballast water discharges and other discharges incidental to the operation of vessels. The VGP imposes technology and water-quality based effluent limits for certain types of discharges and establishes specific inspection, monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements to ensure the effluent limits are met. On March 28, 2013, the EPA re-issued the VGP for another five years, which took effect December 19, 2013. The 2013 VGP contains numeric ballast water discharge limits for most vessels to reduce the risk of invasive species in US waters, more stringent requirements for exhaust gas scrubbers and the use of environmentally acceptable lubricants. 

&#160; 

U.S. Coast Guard regulations adopted under the U.S. National Invasive Species Act, or NISA, also impose mandatory ballast water management practices for all vessels equipped with ballast water tanks entering or operating in U.S. waters. As of June 21, 2012, the U.S. Coast Guard implemented revised regulations on ballast water management by establishing standards on the allowable concentration of living organisms in ballast water discharged from ships in U.S. waters. The revised ballast water standards are consistent with those adopted by the IMO in 2004. Compliance with the EPA and the U.S. Coast Guard regulations requires the installation of a U.S. Coast Guard approved ballast water management system by the first scheduled drydocking after January 1, 2016. On September 10, 2015, the U.S Coast Guard issued new guidance that simplifies and clarifies the process by which vessels can seek extensions to come into compliance with the standards. 

&#160; 

European Union Regulations 

&#160; 

In October 2009, the European Union amended a directive to impose criminal sanctions for illicit ship-source discharges of polluting substances, including minor discharges, if committed with intent, recklessly or with serious negligence and the discharges, individually or in the aggregate, result in deterioration of the quality of water. Aiding and abetting the discharge of a polluting substance may also lead to criminal penalties. Member States were required to enact laws or regulations to comply with the directive by the end of 2010. Criminal liability for pollution may result in substantial penalties or fines and increased civil liability claims. The directive applies to all types of vessels, irrespective of their flag, but certain exceptions apply to warships or where human safety or that of the ship is in danger. 

The European Union has adopted several regulations and directives requiring, among other things, more frequent inspections of high-risk ships, as determined by type, age, and flag as well as the number of times the ship has been detained. The European Union also adopted and then extended a ban on substandard ships and enacted a minimum ban period and a definitive ban for repeated offenses. The regulation also provided the European Union with greater authority and control over classification societies, by imposing more requirements on classification societies and providing for fines or penalty payments for organizations that failed to comply. 

&#160; 

With effect from January 1, 2010, Directive 2005/33/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of July 6, 2005, amending Directive 1999/32/EC came into force. The objective of the directive is to reduce emission of sulfur dioxide and particulate matter caused by the combustion of certain petroleum derived fuels. 

The directive imposes limits on the sulfur content of such fuels as a condition of their use within a Member State territory. The maximum sulfur content for marine fuels used by inland waterway vessels and ships at berth in ports in EU countries after January 1, 2010, is 0.1% by mass. As of January 1, 2015, all vessels operating within ECAs, worldwide must comply with 0.1% sulfur requirements. Currently, the only grade of fuel meeting 0.1% sulfur content requirement is low sulfur marine gas oil, or LSMGO. As of July 1, 2010, the reduction of applicable sulfur content limits in the North Sea, the Baltic Sea and the English Channel Sulfur Control Areas is 0.1%. The Company does not expect that it will be required to modify any of its vessels to meet any of the foregoing low sulfur fuel requirements. On July 15, 2011, the European Commission also adopted a proposal for an amendment to Directive 1999/32/EC which would align requirements with those imposed by the revised MARPOL Annex VI which introduced stricter sulfur limits. 

&#160; 

Greenhouse Gas Regulation 

&#160; 

In July 2011, MEPC adopted two new sets of mandatory requirements to address greenhouse gas emissions from ships, which entered into force in January 2013. Currently operating ships will be required to develop Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plans, and minimum energy efficiency levels per capacity mile, outlined in the Energy Efficiency Design Index, will apply to new ships. These requirements could cause the Company to incur additional compliance costs. The European Union has indicated that it intends to propose an expansion of the existing European Union emissions trading scheme to include emissions of greenhouse gases from marine vessels, and in January 2012 the European Commission launched a public consultation on possible measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from ships. In the United States, the EPA has issued a finding that greenhouse gases endanger the public health and safety and has adopted regulations to limit greenhouse gas emissions from certain mobile sources and large stationary sources. Although the mobile source emissions regulations do not apply to greenhouse gas emissions from vessels, such regulation of vessels is foreseeable, and the EPA has in recent years received petitions from the California Attorney General and various environmental groups seeking such regulation. Any passage of climate control legislation or other regulatory initiatives by the IMO, European Union, the U.S. or other countries where the Company operates, or any treaty adopted at the international level to succeed the Kyoto Protocol, that restrict emissions of greenhouse gases could require the Company to make significant financial expenditures which the Company cannot predict with certainty at this time. 

&#160; 

Vessel Security Regulations 

&#160; 

Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 in the United States, there have been a variety of initiatives intended to enhance vessel security such as the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002, or MTSA. To implement certain portions of the MTSA, in July 2003, the U.S. Coast Guard issued regulations requiring the implementation of certain security requirements aboard vessels operating in waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. The regulations also impose requirements on certain ports and facilities, some of which are regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or the EPA. 

&#160; 

Similarly, in December 2002, amendments to SOLAS created a new chapter of the convention dealing specifically with maritime security. The new Chapter V became effective in July 2004 and imposes various detailed security obligations on vessels and port authorities, and mandates compliance with the International Ship and Port Facilities Security Code, or the ISPS Code. The ISPS 

Code is designed to enhance the security of ports and ships against terrorism. To trade internationally, a vessel must attain an International Ship Security Certificate, or ISSC, from a recognized security organization approved by the vessel&#8217;s flag state. Among the various requirements are: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

on-board installation of automatic identification systems to provide a means for the automatic transmission of safety-related information from among similarly equipped ships and shore stations, including information on a ship&#8217;s identity, position, course, speed and navigational status; 

&#8226; 

on-board installation of ship security alert systems, which do not sound on the vessel but only alert the authorities on shore; 

&#8226; 

the development of vessel security plans; 

&#8226; 

ship identification number to be permanently marked on a vessel&#8217;s hull; 

&#8226; 

a continuous synopsis record kept onboard showing a vessel&#8217;s history including the name of the ship, the state whose flag the ship is entitled to fly, the date on which the ship was registered with that state, the ship&#8217;s identification number, the port at which the ship is registered and the name of the registered owner(s) and their registered address; and 

&#8226; 

compliance with flag state security certification requirements. 

Ships operating without a valid certificate may be detained at port until it obtains an ISSC, or it may be expelled from port, or refused entry at port. 

&#160; 

Furthermore, additional security measures could be required in the future which could have a significant financial impact on the Company. The U.S. Coast Guard regulations, intended to be aligned with international maritime security standards, exempt non-U.S. vessels from MTSA vessel security measures, provided such vessels have on board a valid ISSC that attests to the vessel's compliance with SOLAS security requirements and the ISPS Code. 

&#160; 

The Company intends to implement the various security measures addressed by MTSA, SOLAS and the ISPS Code, and the Company intends that its fleet will comply with applicable security requirements. The Company has implemented the various security measures addressed by the MTSA, SOLAS and the ISPS Code. 

International Labor Organization 

&#160; 

The International Labor Organization (ILO) is a specialized agency of the UN with headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. The ILO has adopted the Maritime Labor Convention 2006, or MLC 2006. A Maritime Labor Certificate and a Declaration of Maritime Labor Compliance is required to ensure compliance with the MLC 2006 for all ships above 500 gross tons in international trade. The MLC 2006 entered into force on August 20, 2013, at which time all of the Company&#8217;s vessels were in full compliance with its requirements. 

&#160; 

Inspection by Classification Societies 

&#160; 

Every oceangoing vessel must be &#8220;classed&#8221; by a classification society. The classification society certifies that the vessel is &#8220;in class,&#8221; signifying that the vessel has been built and maintained in accordance with the rules of the classification society and complies with applicable rules and regulations of the vessel's country of registry and the international conventions of which that country is a member. In addition, where surveys are required by international conventions and corresponding laws and ordinances of a flag state, the classification society will undertake them on application or by official order, acting on behalf of the authorities concerned. 

&#160; 

The classification society also undertakes, as requested, other surveys that may be required by the vessel's flag state. These surveys are subject to agreements made with the vessel owner and/or to the regulations of the country concerned. 

&#160; 

For maintenance of the class certification, annual, intermediate and special surveys of hull and machinery, including the electrical plant, and any special equipment, are required to be performed as follows: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Annual Surveys: For seagoing ships, annual surveys are conducted within three months, before or after each anniversary of the class period indicated in the certificate. 

&#8226; 

Intermediate Surveys: Extended surveys are referred to as intermediate surveys and are typically conducted two and one-half years after commissioning, and two and one-half years after each class renewal. Intermediate surveys are to be carried out at or between the occasion of the second or third annual survey. 

&#8226; 

Class Renewal Surveys: Class renewal surveys, also known as special surveys, are carried out at the intervals indicated by the character of classification for the hull. At the special survey, the vessel is thoroughly examined, including audio-gauging to determine the thickness of the steel structures. If the steel thickness is found to be less than class requirements, the classification society would prescribe steel renewals which require drydocking of the vessel. The classification society may grant a one-year grace period for completion of the special survey. Substantial costs may be incurred for steel renewal in order to pass a special survey if the vessel experiences excessive wear and tear. In lieu of the special survey every four or five years, depending on whether a grace period was granted, a shipowner has the option of arranging with the classification society for the vessel&#8217;s hull or machinery to be on a continuous survey cycle, in which case every part of the vessel would be surveyed on a continuous five-year cycle. This process is referred to as continuous class renewal. 

All areas subject to survey, as defined by the classification society, are required to be surveyed at least once per class period unless shorter intervals between surveys are prescribed elsewhere. The period between two subsequent surveys of each area must not exceed five years. 

&#160; 

Most vessels undergo regulatory inspection of the underwater parts every 30 to 36 months. If any defects are found, the classification surveyor will issue a recommendation which must be rectified by the ship owner within prescribed time limits. 

The Company expects to perform five special surveys in 2016 at an aggregate total cost of approximately $4.5 million. The Company expects to perform three intermediate surveys in 2017 at an aggregate total cost of approximately $1.1 million. The Company estimates that offhire related to the surveys and related repair work is ten to twenty days, depending on the size and condition of the vessel. 

&#160; 

Most insurance underwriters make it a condition for insurance coverage that a vessel be certified as &#8220;in class&#8221; by a classification society which is a member of the International Association of Classification Societies. All of the Company&#8217;s vessels are certified by Det Norske Veritas, Nippon Kaiji Kiokai or Bureau Veritas. All new and second-hand vessels that the Company purchases must be certified prior to delivery under its standard purchase contracts, referred to as the memorandum of agreement. Certification of second-hand vessels must be verified by a Class Maintenance Certificate issued within 72 hours prior to delivery. If the vessel is not certified on the date of closing, the Company has the option to cancel the agreement on the basis of Seller&#8217;s default, and not take delivery of the vessel. 

&#160; 

Risk of Loss and Insurance 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

The operation of any dry bulk vessel includes risks such as mechanical failure, collision, property loss, cargo loss or damage, and business interruption due to political circumstances in foreign countries, hostilities and labor strikes. In addition, there is an inherent possibility of marine disaster, including oil spills (e.g. fuel oil) and other environmental incidents, and the liabilities arising from owning and operating vessels in international trade. OPA, which imposes virtually unlimited liability for certain oil pollution accidents upon owners, operators and demise charterers of vessels trading in the United States exclusive economic zone, has made liability insurance more expensive for ship owners and operators trading in the U.S. market. 

&#160; 

The Company maintains hull and machinery insurance, war risks insurance, protection and indemnity cover and freight, demurrage and defense cover for its owned fleet at amounts it believe address the normal risks of its operations. The Company may not be able to maintain this level of coverage throughout a vessel&#8217;s useful life. Furthermore, while the Company believes that its current insurance coverage is adequate, not all risks can be insured, and there can be no guarantee that any specific claim will be paid, or that the Company will always be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at reasonable rates. 

&#160; 

Hull &#38; Machinery and War Risks Insurance 

&#160; 

The Company maintains marine hull and machinery and war risks insurances, which cover the risk of actual or constructive total loss, for all of its vessels. Vessels are insured for their fair market value, at a minimum, with a deductible of $100,000 per vessel per incident. 

&#160; 

Protection and Indemnity Insurance 

&#160; 

Protection and indemnity insurance is a form of mutual indemnity insurance provided by mutual protection and indemnity associations, or P&#38;I Associations, which insure the Company&#8217;s third party liabilities in connection with its shipping activities. This includes third-party liability and other related expenses resulting from the injury, illness or death of crew, passengers and other third parties, the loss or damage to cargo, claims arising from collisions with other vessels, damage to other third-party property, pollution arising from oil or other substances and salvage, towing and other related costs, including wreck removal. Subject to the &#8220;capping&#8221; discussed below, the Company&#8217;s coverage, except for pollution, is unlimited. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s current protection and indemnity insurance coverage for pollution is $1.0 billion per vessel per incident. The thirteen P&#38;I Associations that comprise the International Group insure approximately 90% of the world&#8217;s commercial tonnage and have entered into a pooling agreement to reinsure each association&#8217;s liabilities. As a member of a P&#38;I Association, which is a member of the International Group, the Company is subject to calls payable to the associations based on the group&#8217;s claim records as well as the claim records of all other members of the individual associations and members of the pool of P&#38;I Associations comprising the International Group. 

Amendments to the Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims, or LLMC, went into effect on June 8, 2015. The amendments alter the limits of liability for loss of life or personal injury claims and property claims against ship-owners. 

&#160; 

Exchange Controls 

&#160; 

The Company is an exempted company organized under the Bermuda Companies Act. The Bermuda Companies Act differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to United States companies and their stockholders. However, a general permission issued by the Bermuda Monetary Authority, ("BMA"), results in the Company&#8217;s common shares being freely transferable among persons who are residents and non-residents of Bermuda. Each shareholder, whether a resident or non-resident of Bermuda, is entitled to one vote for each share of stock held by the shareholder. 

The Company's common shares are listed on NASDAQ under the symbol "PANL". 

&#160; 

Although the Company is incorporated in Bermuda, the Company is classified as a non-resident of Bermuda for exchange control purposes by the BMA. Other than transferring Bermuda Dollars out of Bermuda, there are no restrictions on its ability to transfer funds into and out of Bermuda or to pay dividends in currency other than Bermuda Dollars to U.S. residents (or other non-residents of Bermuda) who are holders of its common shares. 

&#160; 

In accordance with Bermuda law, share certificates may be issued only in the names of corporations, individuals or legal persons. In the case of an applicant acting in a special capacity (for example, as an executor or trustee), certificates may, at the request of the applicant, record the capacity in which the applicant is acting. Notwithstanding the recording of any such special capacity, the Company is not bound to investigate or incur any responsibility in respect of the proper administration of any such estate or trust. 

&#160; 

The Company will take no notice of any trust applicable to any of its shares or other securities whether or not the Company had notice of such trust. 

&#160; 

INDUSTRY AND MARKET CONDITIONS 

&#160; 

Market Overview 

&#160; 

Ocean going vessels represent the most efficient and often the only means of transporting large volumes of dry cargo over long distances. Dry bulk cargo includes both major and lesser commodities such as coal, iron ore, grain, bauxite, cement clinker, and limestone. Dry bulk trade is influenced by the underlying demand for the dry bulk commodities which in turn is influenced by the global economic activity. 

&#160; 

The world&#8217;s fleet of vessels dedicated to carrying dry bulk cargoes is generally divided into six major categories, based on a vessel&#8217;s cargo carrying capacity. These categories are: Handysize, Supramax, Panamax, Post Panamax, Capesize and Very Large Ore Carrier. Certain routes and geographies are less accessible to certain vessel sizes. For example, Panamax and Supramax vessels are the main dry bulk vessel types deployed in the Baltic due to draft restrictions. Similarly, the main dry bulk vessel size deployed on the Northern Sea Route (NSR) along the coast of Russia is Panamax. 

&#160; 

Dry bulk vessels are employed through a number of different chartering options. The most common are time charters, spot charters, and voyage charters. Historically, charter rates have been volatile as they are driven by the underlying balance between vessel supply and demand. Since 2011, rates have generally been low as a result of the excess of dry bulk carrier supply over the demand for dry bulk vessels. Ice class vessels, when operating in ice-bound areas, usually command a rate premium to conventional trades. 

&#160; 

Dry Bulk Shipping &#8212; the Main Participants 

&#160; 

In the dry bulk shipping industry there are multiple functions, with individual parties carrying out one or more of such functions. In general, the principal functions within dry bulk shipping are as follows: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Ship Owner or Registered Owner &#8212; Generally, this is an entity retaining the legal title of ownership over a vessel. 

&#8226; 

Ship Operator &#8212; Generally, this is an entity seeking to generate profit either through the chartering of ships (owned or chartered-in) to others, or from the transportation of cargoes. Entities focusing on the transportation of cargoes may engage in chartering of ships to other entities, but those companies focusing on chartering ships to other entities rarely act to carry cargoes for customers. 

&#8226; 

Shipmanager/Commercial Manager &#8212; This is an entity designated to be responsible for the day to day commercial management of the ship and the best contact for the ship regarding commercial matters, including post fixture responsibilities, such as laytime, demurrage, insurance and charter clauses. These companies undertake the activities of ship operators but, unlike a ship operator, they do not own or charter-in the vessels at their own risk. 

&#8226; 

Technical Manager &#8212; This is an entity specifically responsible for the technical operation and technical superintendence of a ship. This company may also be responsible for hiring, training and supervising ship officers and crew, and for all aspects of the day to day operation of the fleet, including repair work, spare parts inventory, re-engineering, surveys and dry-docking. 

&#8226; 

Cargo Owner &#8212; This is normally a producer (e.g., a miner), consumer (e.g., a steel mill) or trading house who requires transportation of cargo by a cargo focused ship operator. 

The Freight Market 

&#160; 

Dry bulk vessels are employed in the market through a number of different chartering options. The general terms typically found in these types of contracts are described below. 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Time Charter. A charter under which the vessel owner or operator is paid charterhire on a per-day basis for a specified period of time. Typically, the shipowner receives semi-monthly charterhire payments on a U.S. dollar-per-day basis and is responsible for providing the crew and paying vessel operating expenses, while the charterer is responsible for paying the voyage expenses and additional voyage insurance. The ship owner is also responsible for the vessel&#8217;s intermediate and special survey (heavy mandatory maintenance) costs. Under time charters, including trip time charters, the charterer pays all voyage expenses including port, canal and bunker (fuel) costs. 

&#8226; 

Trip Charter. A time charter for a trip to carry a specific cargo from a load port to a discharge port at a set daily rate. 

&#8226; 

Voyage Charter . A charter to carry a specific amount and type of cargo on a load-port to discharge-port basis, subject to various cargo handling terms. Most of these charters are of a single voyage nature, as trading patterns do not encourage round trip voyage trading. The ship operator receives payment based on a price per ton of cargo loaded on board the vessel. The ship operator is responsible for the payment of all voyage expenses, as well as the costs of owning or hiring the vessel. 

&#8226; 

Spot Charter. A spot charter generally refers to a voyage charter or a trip charter, which generally last from 10 days to three months. 

&#8226; 

Contract of Affreightment. A contract of affreightment, or COA, relates to the carriage of multiple cargoes over the same route and enables the service provider to nominate different vessels to perform the individual voyages. Essentially, it constitutes a series of voyage charters to carry a specified amount of cargo during the term of the CoA, which usually spans a number of months or years. Freight normally is agreed on a U.S. dollar-per-ton carried basis with bunker cost escalation or de-escalation adjustments. 

&#8226; 

Bareboat Charter. A bareboat charter involves the use of a vessel, usually over longer periods of time (several years). In this case, all voyage expenses and vessel operating expenses, including maintenance, crewing and insurance, are for paid by the charterer. The owner of the vessel receives monthly charterhire payments on a U.S. dollar per day basis and is responsible only for the payment of capital costs related to the vessel. A bareboat charter is also known as a &#8220;demise charter&#8221; or a &#8220;time charter by demise.&#8221; 

Charter Rates 

As noted above, the bulk carrier market operates at two levels &#8212; period and spot. The former sees the charter commitment and income stream fixed over a period. The latter sees ships regularly open for new business and so most frequently exposed to the immediate volatility of market sentiment. 

&#160; 

In the time charter market, rates vary depending on the length of the charter period and vessel specific factors such as age, speed, size and fuel consumption. In the voyage charter market, rates are influenced by cargo size, commodity, port dues and canal transit fees, as well as delivery and redelivery regions. In general, a larger cargo size is quoted at a lower rate per ton than a smaller cargo size. Routes with costly ports or canals generally command higher rates. Voyages loading from a port where vessels usually discharge cargo, or discharging at a port where vessels usually load cargo, are generally quoted at lower rates. These voyages are known as &#8220;backhaul&#8221; voyages. 

&#160; 

In some cases charters will include an additional payment known as a ballast bonus. A ballast bonus is a lump sum payment made to a shipowner or operator (by the charterer) as compensation for delivering a ship in a particular loading region of the world. For a ship to enter a loading region, an empty (ballast) leg may be required because there are no inbound cargoes. Normally the charterer will pay for this leg. The ballast bonus should reflect the cost of the empty ballast in terms of time and fuel. A typical fixture that involves a ballast bonus might be expressed as &#8220;freight hire of $10,000 per day, plus a ballast bonus of $100,000 lump sum&#8221;. 

&#160; 

Within the dry bulk shipping industry, the freight rate indices issued by the Baltic Exchange in London are the references most likely to be monitored. These references are based on actual charter hire rates under charters entered into by market participants as well as daily assessments provided to the Baltic Exchange by a panel of major shipbrokers. The Baltic Exchange, an independent organization comprised of shipbrokers, shipping companies and other shipping players, provides daily independent shipping market information and has created freight rate indices reflecting the average freight rates for the major bulk vessel trading routes. These indices include the Baltic Panamax Index, or BPI, the index with the longest history and, more recently, the Baltic Capesize Index, or BCI. 

&#160; 

Dry Bulk Trades Requiring Ice Class Tonnage 

&#160; 

Ice class vessels are required to serve ports accessed by routes crossing seasonal or year-round ice-covered oceans, lakes, seas or rivers. Ice class vessels are mainly deployed in the Baltic Sea, the Northern Sea Route (NSR) and the Great Lakes/St. Lawrence Seaway. These regions have experienced strong trade growth in dry bulk cargoes, driven in particular by increased mining activities supported by strong commodity demand in Asia, decreased level of ice, and technology advancement in shipping. However, the NSR experienced a steep drop in tons of cargo transported between Asia and Europe during 2014 and 2015, as low fuel prices made the NSR less attractive for ship-owners. Cargo traffic to and from Russian ports is expected to increase in the coming years, mainly representing supplies and cargo for new industrial projects.
