 Item 1. Business. 

&#160; 

General 

&#160;

Our company, Discovery Energy Corp., was incorporated under the laws of the state of Nevada on May 24, 2006 under the name &#34;Santos Resource Corp.&#34; Our current business plan is to explore for and produce oil and gas from a tract of land (the &#34; Prospect &#34;) covered by Petroleum Exploration License (PEL) 512 (the &#34; License &#34;) in the State of South Australia. We adopted this business plan near the end of our fiscal 2012, after having previously abandoned our initial business plan involving mining claims in Quebec, Canada and after we had been dormant from a business perspective for a period of time. In connection with the adoption of our current business plan, we had a change in control of our company, a change in our management, a change in our corporate name, and a change of our status from a &#8220;shell&#8221; company, as that term is defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

&#160;

We made significant strides in our business plan during our fiscal 2013, including the formal grant of the License after the satisfaction of a number of significant preconditions. During our fiscal 2014, we focused our efforts on completing a major capital raising transaction or procuring one or more major joint venture partners to further our business plan. We continued these efforts throughout our fiscal 2015 and 2016.

&#160;

Beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 a significant decline in the price of oil has affected the oil and gas industry worldwide. This decline began in June 2014 when the price of Brent oil was above US$110 per barrel and continued to a low of US$27 per barrel in January of 2016. Since then prices have recovered somewhat with the recent Nymex Futures trading near US$45 per barrel. While the effect of this price drop has worldwide implications, we believe that it has not affected the oil and gas industry in Australia as adversely as it has in other parts of the world. However, current oil prices will make our ability to complete a capital raising transaction or procure a joint venture partner more difficult. Although we believe that we will continue to be challenged by low oil prices for the near future, we are not currently in a position to determine the full extent of that impact. As a result of the decline in oil prices we have been and are making changes to our ongoing business strategy to best position ourselves for when the markets improve.

&#160;

Although we are continuing efforts to complete a major capital raising transaction, we are shifting our emphasis away from a single capital raising transaction that would meet our financial needs for an extended period of time. Our new emphasis will be on obtaining sufficient funds for us to complete the second year of our work commitment and positioning ourselves to exploit commercially the Prospect at the appropriate time in the future. This shift in strategy will minimize the dilution to shareholders and is partly due to depressed energy prices which presently do not justify efforts to produce hydrocarbons and that presently have made more difficult capital raising transactions under acceptable terms. Our strategy will be to position ourselves to begin the development of the Prospect after energy prices have recovered sufficiently. Part of our posturing includes the following:

&#160;

* Efforts to procure purchase/off-take contracts for our hydrocarbons once we are in a production mode. &#160;

&#160; * Efforts to procure one or more joint venture partners to undertake jointly 3D seismic surveys at reduced costs to all parties, which surveys will satisfy in part our License work commitment &#160;

&#160; * Efforts to procure one or more joint venture partners that would drill wells on the Prospect, which wells will satisfy in part our License work commitment &#160;

&#160; * Efforts to procure funds at a minimum level so that we are able to satisfy our financial obligations and at even greater levels so that we are able to pursue our business plan in the manner that we prefer &#160;

&#160; 1 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The results of our efforts are at various stages, although none of them has resulted in any binding definitive agreements at this time. While we are guardedly optimistic that these efforts will be successful, we have no assurance of this.

&#160;

Our fiscal 2016 did have several positive developments. One such development was an extension of our year two of the five-year work commitment relating to the License from April 26, 2016 to April 26, 2017. The one-year extension of the work commitment allows us additional time to pursue capital raising transactions or procure a major joint venture partner, and perhaps benefit from a recovery in the price of oil. Moreover, one benefit of lower oil and gas prices is that the costs of third party service providers (such as seismic firms and contract drillers) have declined significantly as well, creating a more favorable business environment when we are able to take advantage of it.

&#160;

Moreover, on May 27, 2016, we completed a debt financing transaction that provides to us funds to commence our 3D seismic survey and complete a significant portion of it, while also providing operating capital for a number of months. This financing is discussed in the section captioned &#8220;Recent Financing&#8221; below. We will continue to seek a major capital transaction on acceptable/attractive terms for the development of the Prospect. While we are seeking this transaction, we still have regular and ongoing payments and expenditures. These payments and expenditures and non-payment consequences (which could be materially adverse to our interests) are discussed in detail herein. So far we have been successful in satisfying or deferring the most important of these payments and expenditures, and we expect to continue to do so in the future. However, while we have been successful in this regard to date, we have no assurance that we will continue to be successful in this regard in the future. 

&#160;

In the remainder of this Report, Australian dollar amounts are prefaced by &#34;AU$&#34; while United States dollar amounts are prefaced simply by &#34;$&#34; or (when used in close proximity to Australian dollar amounts) by &#34;US$.&#34; When United States dollar amounts are given as equivalents of Australian dollar amounts, such United States dollar amounts are approximations only and not exact figures. During the past year, that exchange rate has varied from a low of US$1.00/AU$1.2312 to a high of US$1.00/AU$1.4562. At the close of our fiscal year on February 29, 2016 the exchange rate was US$1.00/AU$1.4006

&#160; 

Recent Financing 

&#160;

General . Effective May 27, 2016, we entered into a securities purchase agreement (the &#34; Securities Agreement &#34;) and related documentation with a certain investor (the &#8220; Investor&#8221; ) pursuant to which we sold the following securities:

&#160;

* a Senior Secured Convertible Debenture due May 27, 2021 having an original principal amount of $3,500,000 (singly a &#34; Debenture &#34; and collectively with any similar securities issued in the future, the &#34; Debentures &#34;), and &#160;

* warrants (the &#34; Warrants &#34;) to purchase up to a maximum of 13,125,000 shares (prior to any required adjustment) of our common stock (singly a &#34; Common Share &#34; and collectively the &#34; Common Shares &#34;) at an initial per-share exercise price of $0.20. &#160;

We received proceeds from the sale of these securities in the amount of $3,500,000. The use of these proceeds is limited to the payment of our and the Investor&#8217;s costs of the transaction (including legal fees), the funding of our 3D seismic survey with respect to our 584,651 gross acre oil and gas prospect in the State of South Australia and the interpretation of such seismic survey, and the payment of Company&#8217;s expenses associated with the seismic survey . The remainder of these proceeds may be used for general and administrative expenses with the Investor&#8217;s consent. We believe that these proceeds will be sufficient to finance our seismic survey required for our second year license work commitment of 100 km 2 . Moreover we believe that the remainder of these proceeds will be sufficient (provided the Investor&#8217;s consent is obtained) to finance all of our other business expenses through the end of October 2016, although we have no assurance of this. In the view of the preceding, we will need to raise more funds, and as discussed below, we are continuing efforts to sell more Debentures. Moreover, in the future we will need significant additional funds to undertake the development of our oil and gas prospect in Australia, and we will need to raise these funds to do this. We have no assurance that it will be able to raise these significant additional funds or the additional funds needed for our general operation.

&#160;

Under the terms of the Securities Agreement, we may sell additional Debentures having an original principal amount of up to $1,500,000. Any net proceeds from these additional Debentures will be used for the following purposes:

&#160;

* The payment of the debt that we owe to Liberty Petroleum Corporation &#160;

* The payment of the debt that we owe to members of management &#160;

* General and administrative expenses &#160;

If the full $1,500,000 of these additional Debentures is raised, we believe that the related net proceeds will be sufficient to pay the debts noted above and finance all of our business for the next year, although it has no assurance of this.

&#160;

The remainder of this Section contains descriptions of the legally operative documents governing our recent financing. These descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the actual documents that we have previously filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

&#160;

Per Rule 135c under the Securities Act of 1933, nothing contained herein shall be construed to be an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy, any of securities.

&#160;

Description of the Debentures. The material terms, provisions and conditions of the Debentures are as follows:

&#160;

* The aggregate original principal amount of the Debentures is $5,000,000. As of June 2, 2016, $3,500,000 of the Debentures has been sold. &#160;

* The Debentures bear interest at the rate of eight percent (8%) per annum, compounded quarterly. However, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a stipulated event of default, the Debentures will bear interest at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum. &#160;

* Interest need not be paid on the Debentures until the principal amount of the Debentures becomes due and payable. Instead, accrued interest is added to the outstanding principal amount of the Debentures quarterly. Nevertheless, we may elect to pay accrued interest in cash at the time that such interest would otherwise be added to the outstanding principal amount of the Debentures. &#160;

* The principal amount of and accrued interest on the Debentures are due and payable in a single balloon payment on or before May 27, 2021. &#160;

* We are not entitled to prepay the Debentures prior to their maturity. &#160;

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

* The Debentures are convertible, in whole or in part, into Common Shares at the option of Holder, at any time and from time to time. The conversion price for the Debentures is $0.16, subject to certain adjustments that are believed to be customary in transactions of this nature. If all of the Debentures were converted at this conversion price, 21,875,000 shares of Common Shares would be issued, which would constitute approximately 13.5% of the outstanding Common Shares after the conversion, considered on a fully diluted basis. We are subject to certain liabilities and liquidated damages for our failure to honor timely a conversion of the Debentures, and these liabilities and liquidated damages are believed to be customary in transactions of this nature. &#160;

* The holders of the Debentures are entitled to have them redeemed completely or partially upon certain events (such as a change of control transaction involving us or the sale of a material portion of our assets) at a redemption price equal to 120% of the then outstanding principal amount of the Debenture and 100% of accrued and unpaid interest on the outstanding principal amount of this Debenture, plus all liquidated damages and other amounts due hereunder in respect of the Debenture. &#160;

* The Debentures feature negative operating covenants, events of defaults and remedies upon such events of defaults that are believed to be customary in transactions of this nature. One of the remedies upon an event of default is the Debenture holder&#8217;s ability to accelerate the maturity of the Debenture such that all amounts owing under the Debenture would become immediately due and payable. The Debenture holder would then be able to resort to the collateral securing the Debentures, if we did not pay the amount outstanding, which is likely to be the case. &#160;

* The Debentures are secured by virtually all of our assets owned directly or indirectly but for the License, which is held by our Australian subsidiary, Discovery Energy SA Pty Limited (the &#8220; Subsidiary &#8221;). &#160;

Material Terms and Provisions of the Security Documents. The security documents relating to the Debenture (the &#8220; Security Documents &#8221;) include the following:

&#160;

* a Specific Security Agreement (Shares) executed by us in favor of Investor pursuant to which we pledged all of our shares in the Subsidiary, to secure the Debentures &#160;

* a Security Agreement executed by the Subsidiary in favor of Investor pursuant to which the Subsidiary pledged all of our assets (other than the License) to secure the foregoing Deed of Guarantee and Indemnity &#160;

* a Deed of Guarantee and Indemnity executed by the Subsidiary in favor of Investor pursuant to which the Subsidiary guarantees the Debentures &#160; 

In addition to the Security Documents listed above, we have agreed to enter into Deposit Account Control Agreements before the end of June 2016 in favor of Investor to perfect Investor&#8217;s security interests in our cash on deposit.

&#160;

The Security Documents contain agreements, representations, warranties, events of default and remedies that are believed to be customary in transactions of this nature. The essential effect of the Security Documents is that, if we default on or experiences an event of default with respect to the Debentures, the holders of the Debentures could exercise the rights of a secured creditor, which could result in the partial or total loss of nearly all of our assets, in which case our business could cease and all or substantially all of stockholders' equity could be lost. For more information about this, see the Risk Factors captioned &#8220; THE EXERCISE OF SECURED CREDITOR RIGHTS COULD RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT OR COMPLETE LOSS TO US &#8221; herein.

&#160; 

Description of the Warrants . The material terms, provisions and conditions of the Warrants are as follows:

&#160;

* The aggregate number of Common Shares to be purchased pursuant to exercises of the Warrants is 13,125,000. &#160;

* The initial per-share exercise price of the Warrants is $0.20, and is subject to certain adjustments that are generally believed to be customary in transactions of this nature. Subject to certain exceptions, the exercise price of the Warrants involves possible adjustments downward to the price of any Common Shares or their equivalents sold by us during the term of the Warrants for less than the then applicable exercise price of the Warrants. Upon the adjustment of the exercise price, the number of shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants is proportionately adjusted so the aggregate exercise price of the Warrants remains unchanged. If all of the Warrants were exercised, 13,125,000 shares of Common Shares would be issued, which would constitute approximately 8.56% of the outstanding Common Shares after the exercise, considered on a fully diluted basis. &#160;

* The Warrants are currently exercisable and remain so until their expiration date of May 27, 2019 . &#160;

* We are subject to certain liabilities and liquidated damages for our failure to honor timely an exercise of the Warrants, and these liabilities and liquidated damages are believed to be customary in transactions of this nature. &#160; 

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Other Material Terms and Provisions of the Securities Agreement. Certain material terms, provisions and conditions of the Securities Agreement that are not described elsewhere herein are as follows:

&#160;

* The Securities Agreement basically contains representations, warranties, indemnities, events of default and remedies that are believed to be customary in transactions of this nature. &#160;

* Subject to certain exceptions, the Securities Agreement provides for a right of first offer in favor of the holders of the Debentures to purchase any proposed new debt or equity to be issued by us up to an aggregate amount of $20,000,000 at an issuance price or a conversion price of $0.20 per Common Share. This right of first offer must be made to the holders of the Debentures before the proposed securities are offered to other persons. Exceptions to this right of first offer include (a) raises of capital not exceeding $2,000,000 at offering prices not less than the conversion price of the Debenture in certain cases or the exercise price of the Warrants in all other cases, (b) issuances meeting certain specifications pursuant to employee incentive plans, (c) issuances meeting certain specifications in connection with mergers and acquisitions transactions and (d) issuances of up to 1,400,000 Common Shares to employees or vendors as permitted under the terms of the Debentures. &#160;

* The Securities Agreement provides that the Investor may have elected to our Board of Directors one nominee, and once the Investor has provided an aggregate amount of $20,000,000 of additional funds pursuant to right of first offer described above, the Investor may have elected to our Board of Directors an additional two nominees. The Investor has not exercised the right to nominate or have one director elected. &#160;

* The Securities Agreement contains the following material agreements that are believed to be customary in transactions of this nature: &#160;

* Agreements regarding the transferability and transfer of the Debentures, the Common Shares into which they can be converted, the Warrants, and the Common Shares that can be acquired upon their exercise. &#160;

* Agreements regarding our obligation to make filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220; SEC &#8221;) so that the securities described immediately above can be legally resold. &#160;

* Agreements regarding the use of the proceeds from our sale of the Debentures. See the section captioned &#8220;General&#8221; above for a discussion of the use of these proceeds. &#160;

* Agreements regarding the reservation of Common Shares to be issued upon conversions of the Debenture and exercises of the Warrants. &#160;

* Agreements prohibiting the sale of Company securities having conversion prices, exercise prices or exchange rates tied to the trading prices of the Common Shares. &#160; 

Material Terms and Provisions of Other Related Agreements - Registration Rights Agreement . We entered into a Registration Rights Agreement in favor of Investor pursuant to which we agreed to register with the SEC the resale of the Common Shares into which the Debentures can be converted and the Common Shares that can be acquired upon the exercise of the Warrants. Certain material terms, provisions and conditions of the Registration Rights Agreement are as follows:

&#160;

* The Investor has the right, at any time six months after the issuance of the Debentures, to require us to register with the SEC the resale of the Common Shares into which Debentures can be converted, the Common Shares that can be acquired upon the exercise of the Warrants and possibly other Common Shares, which should be minimal if any. This preceding right is generally referred to as &#8220;demand&#8221; registration rights. &#160;

* We have the obligation to file a registration statement to effect the registration within certain periods of time, and the obligation to cause such registration statement to become effective within certain other periods of time. We will be liable for stipulated monetary damages if it fails in these obligations. The size of these damages is significant, although they are believed to be customary. Once a registration statement is declared effective, we must maintain it effective and current until the registered Common Shares are sold or become eligible to be sold pursuant to pursuant to an exemption under certain circumstances, which we believe will never occur. Thus, we believe that it will be required to maintain the registration statement effective and current indefinitely after it becomes effective. &#160;

* In addition to the Investor&#8217;s &#8220;demand&#8221; registration rights, the Investor has &#8220;piggyback&#8221; registration rights whereby it can participate (without a demand) in any registration that we propose with certain exceptions. &#160;

* The Registration Rights Agreement contains other agreements and indemnities that are believed to be customary in transactions of this nature. &#160;

Description of Prospect &#8211; Petroleum Exploration License (PEL) 512 

&#160;

Geology of the Cooper and Eromanga Basins 

&#160;

Granted on October 26, 2012, the License accords to us a 100% working interest (82% net revenue interest) in the Prospect. The Prospect covers 584,651 gross acres in the State of South Australia that overlays portions of geological systems commonly referred to as the Cooper and Eromanga Basins. This geologic system, which covers the northeast corner of South Australia and the southwest corner of Queensland State (see location map below), is the most prolific producing onshore region in Australia.

&#160;

Cooper Basin Location Map 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The Cooper Basin is comprised of 32 million acres. It developed in late Carboniferous Period to the early Permian Period, and features a maximum thickness of sediments of about 9,000 feet. This basin is divided into several depo-centers by faulted anticlinal trends. The Permian Period formations within the Cooper Basin are characterized by alternating fluvial sandstones/floodplain siltstones. Overlaying the Permian Period are Triassic Period formations characterized by fluvial/floodplain sediments. The Eromanga Basin is comprised of 250 million acres, which developed as an interior sag over the central and eastern region of Australia during the Jurassic and Cretaceous Periods. In the south, the depo-centers coincide with underlying Cooper Basin synclines. The younger Eromanga Basin covers the entire Cooper Basin. The geological characteristics of these two basins cause them in effect to form a basin system that for many purposes can best be thought of in terms of a single geological phenomenon rather than two.

&#160;

Historical Production of Hydrocarbons from the Cooper and Eromanga Basins 

&#160;

In South Australia where the Prospect is located, hydrocarbons were first produced in 1963 when the Gidgealpa 2 discovery well was completed. The prolific Moomba gas field was discovered in 1966. The first commercial oil was discovered in 1970 in the Tirrawarra oil field. To date this localized system has produced more than 103 oil fields and 165 gas fields.

&#160;

A Basin wide assessment by the South Australia Government&#8217;s Department for Manufacturing, Innovation, Trade, Resources and Energy (&#8220; DMITRE &#8221;) estimates two trillion barrels of oil has been generated from Permian Source Rocks. Industry estimates suggest that 640 million barrels (stock tank oil initially in place) are still in place and that the estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) for the South Australia Cooper basin is approximately 200 million barrels. Through August of 2015, exploration and development drilling in the South Australia portion of the Copper/Eromanga Basins has consisted of more than 3,040 exploration, appraisal and development wells. (Source: PEPS database &#8211; August 2015)

&#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Cumulative production in the Basins is estimated at 5.3 trillion cubic feet of natural gas since 1970, more than 175 million barrels (&#8220; mmbo &#8221;) of crude oil, over 80 million barrels oil equivalent of condensate production (&#8220; mmboe &#8221;) since 1983 and LPG production of 82 mmboe since 1984. (Source: DMITRE - June 2015) While natural gas production and associated liquids at the giant Moomba gas field have been in decline, crude oil production has seen a resurgence largely due to the award of new exploration licenses under the South Australia Government bid process, greater drilling activity fueled by higher oil prices, and the use of new 3D seismic data, which has resulted in higher exploration and development drilling success rates.

&#160;

Since the early 1980s, the Western Flank area of the Cooper Basin on which the Prospect sits has produced in excess of 30 million barrels of oil. Drilling activity has recently increased in licensed areas bordering or in close proximity to the Prospect. Wells in the areas adjacent to the Prospect are vertical or near vertical and do not require lateral drilling or &#8220;fracing&#8221; for commercial completion.

&#160;

The Prospect 

&#160;

The Prospect comprises 584,651 gross acres overlaying portions of the Cooper and Eromanga basins. The Prospect is located in what is generally referred to as the Western Oil Flank of the Cooper Basin and is directly adjacent to PRL permits 85-104 and 151-172 (previously known as on PEL 92 and PEL 91) operated by Beach Energy.

&#160;

The PEL 512 Lycium area ( Area A ~4,000 Acres) is the smallest portion of the Prospect, the PEL 512 South area ( Area B ~181,000 acres) is the next largest portion of the Prospect, and the PEL 512 West area ( Area C ~400,000 acres) is the largest portion of the Prospect. The Permit and Recent Drilling Activity Map set forth below indicates the three areas of the Prospect in black outline and labelled A, B, and C. The Permit and Recent Drilling Activity Map below also indicates the locations of nearby producing oil and gas fields, and new oil discoveries since 2011. (Source: PEPS database &#8211; March 2016)

&#160;

&#160;

During the late 1980s and again during 2005 and 2006, various operators drilled 10 wells in the southeast corner of Area B . Reports filed with the South Australian government indicate that some of these wells exhibited &#34;oil shows&#34; but none were completed as commercial producers. Previous operators also conducted extensive seismic surveying on the licensed area and produced 5,153 km of 2D and 141 sq. km of 3D seismic data, which we acquired with the License.

&#160;

The use of 3D seismic interpretation and control combined with a greater understanding of the geology and producing formations has been a critical factor in the increase of recent exploration drilling success rates.

&#160;

The Prospect features ready access to markets via existing infrastructure including short haul trucking and expanding pipeline capacity, which includes an 18,000 barrels per day main Trunk Line running from the Moomba Processing Facility to the Lycium Hub, just offset the Prospect&#8217;s border.

&#160;

Since 2012 we have assembled a significant technical database consisting of geological, geophysical and engineering data, well logs, completion reports, drilling reports, research reports, production data, raw and processed 2D/3D seismic data, maps and other related materials. Our initial technical focus was on evaluating the potential of the Prospect&#8217;s Area B . We engaged Apex Engineering based in Calgary, Alberta on March 21, 2012 to complete an NI 51-101 compliant report, which resulted in the identification of over 110 seismic generated leads over approximately 30% of the approximately 585,000 acre block. This was complimented by the reinterpretation of 5,153 km of 2D seismic and the reprocessing and reinterpretation of 141 sq. km of 3D seismic over the Lake Hope area in the eastern portion of the Prospect&#8217;s Area B by Hardin International Processing, Inc. and Bell &#38; Murphy and Associates, LLC, both located in Dallas, Texas.

&#160;

The ongoing technical assessment has also defined several drill-ready prospects in the Lake Hope 3D area of Area B . Subject to the availability of funds, we plan to conduct a minimum 100 sq. km 3D seismic program during 2015 work program in the western portion of Area B , which is directly on trend and in close proximity with the historic production and recent discoveries on Beach Energy&#8217;s operated PEL 92 to the North.

&#160;

The South Australia Government approved an Associated Activities Licence (AAL) in early 2013 to construct a 30 km rig access road thru the western corner of Area B and into the adjoining PEL 112. This block is operated by Terra Nova, which completed the Mulka 3D seismic survey in September 2012 and subsequently drilled the Wolverine #1 well in May/June 2013. The road provides us direct access to the area proposed and reduces costs for the planned 3D seismic program.

&#160; 

Recent Exploration of and Production from the Cooper and Eromanga Basins 

&#160;

A total of 168 gas fields and 123 oil fields have been discovered and brought online since 1963. Total conventional wells drilled: 739 exploration, 505 appraisal and 975 development wells. Since January 2002 through to November 2014, the explorers in the Cooper Basin have drilled 234 exploration wells and 127 appraisal/development wells. Most have targeted oil, however both oil and gas have been discovered. The new entrants found new pools in 105 of these wells (51% technical success rate) and 92 were cased and suspended as future producers (49% commercial success rate). (Source: DMITRE Cooper Basin Factsheet&#8211; May 2015)

&#160;

Raw gas production commenced from the Cooper Basin in 1969 and from the Otway Basin in 1991. At July 31, 2015, 100 gas fields on stream with a total of 633 gas wells were on stream in the Cooper Basin. A combined total of 61.42 PJ of sales gas was sold in 2014-15 financial year period to AGL, the Natural Gas Authority of South Australia, Santos Direct, Origin and Qenos Pty Ltd. Ex-field natural gas prices in South Australia are freely negotiated between buyer and seller. The first crude oil production began in December 1982 from the Strzelecki Field. At July 31, 2015, Santos, Beach Energy and Senex Energy had 80 oil fields on stream with a total of 294 oil wells on stream.

&#160;

Cooper Basin production for the year ending June 2015 totaled 61.42 PJ of gas (including some ethane), 1,758,365 kL (11,059,767 bbls) of oil, 162,605 t of LPG and 189,770 kL of condensate. The oil includes 1,186,351 kL (7,461,908 bbls) of oil from the discovery wells predominately in the Western Oil Flank (Source: Government of SA, Department of State Development &#8211; April 2016)

&#160;

In the licensed areas immediately adjacent to the Prospect the operator reported as of December 31, 2015 oil production of 2,420 kboe which was 8.2% lower than the prior corresponding period. Natural field decline in the Western Flank, which produced at record levels in FY14, was partially offset by lower than expected decline at the Bauer Field and higher production in PRLs 136 to 150 (formerly PEL 104 / 111). Western Flank net oil production averaged 9,848 bopd, with tie-in of wells, infrastructure upgrades and development, appraisal and exploration drilling to continue in the second half. (Source: Beach Energy Half Yearly Report &#8211; December 31, 2015)

&#160;

During the half year ended December 31, 2015, the operator for PRLs 85 to 104 (formerly PEL 92 - Beach 75%, Cooper 25%) reported Oil production decreased 19.7% to 622 kbbl (net) due to natural field decline, which was partially offset by production commencing from the Rincon Field. The merge and re-processing of the Neritus, Modiolus and Calpurnus 3D seismic surveys is near completion, with interpretation to be undertaken through Q3 FY15. Results will help define Western Flank exploration and appraisal drilling targets. (Source: Beach Energy Half Yearly Report &#8211; December 31, 2015)

&#160;

During the half year ended December 31, 2015, the operator for PRLs 151 to 172 (formerly PEL 91 - Beach 40%, Drillsearch 60%) reported that following record levels of production in FY14, oil production for the period decreased 11.4% to 831 kbbl (net), mainly due to natural field decline in the Bauer Field. Production from the Bauer Field has stabilized at current levels following expansion of processing capacity to 50,000 barrels of fluid per day and the recent tie-in of the Bauer-12 to -15 development wells. Activity for Q3 FY15 to maintain high production levels includes tie-in of the Bauer-16 to -19 development wells, drilling of the four-well development pad in the north of the Bauer Field and ongoing infrastructure upgrades (including fluid handling capacity increases and flowline de-bottlenecking).

&#160;

New oil discoveries at Balgowan-1 and Burners-1 were cased and suspended as future Namur Sandstone and McKinlay Member producers. These discoveries confirmed the extension of the oil fairway to the north-east of recent discoveries in PEL 91 and brought a new focus on other prospects in this northern area of the permit. Balgowan-1 resulted in the addition of gross 1P, 2P and 3P oil reserves of 87 kbbl, 345 kbbl and 1,530 kbbl, respectively1, and is expected online by the end of FY15. Burners-1 was cased and suspended and will be considered for tie-in to facilities in FY16. Overall exploration drilling success was 40%, with three wells plugged and abandoned.

&#160;

Acquisition of the Solidus 3D seismic survey was completed over 492 km2 of prospective acreage to the north of the Bauer Field. Processing and interpretation is expected to be completed by the end of Q2 FY16. Results will help define Western Flank exploration and appraisal drilling targets.

Terms of the License 

&#160;

On October 26, 2012, Discovery Energy SA Pty Ltd, our Australian subsidiary (the &#34; Subsidiary &#34;), received the formal grant of the License from the South Australian Minister for Mineral Resources and Energy. The License is a &#34;Petroleum Exploration Licence&#34; regarding all regulated resources (including petroleum and any other substance that naturally occurs in association with petroleum) relating to the 584,651 gross acres comprising the Prospect land, provided, however, that the License does not permit using the Prospect land as a source of geothermal energy or a natural reservoir for the purpose of gas storage. The term of the License is for five years, with two further, five-year renewal terms, subject to the provisions of the South Australian Petroleum and Geothermal Energy Act 2000.

&#160;

The License is subject to a five-year work commitment that is described in &#8220;Item 1. Business - Plan of Operation - Proposed Initial Activities.&#8221; Failure to comply with the work program requirements could lead to the cancellation of the License.

&#160;

The License requires that, prior to commencing any fieldwork, the Subsidiary post a minimum security deposit of AU$50,000 (approximately US$38,100). Moreover, the License requires the Subsidiary to maintain insurance of the types and amounts of coverage that management believes are reasonable and customary, and are the industry standard throughout Australia.

&#160;

The License requires the Subsidiary to pay certain fees and production payments to the native titleholders in accordance with the native title agreement and a similar agreement discussed immediately below. The License contains provisions regarding environmental matters and liabilities that management also believes are reasonable and customary, and are the industry standard throughout Australia.

&#160;

In addition to the preceding, the person who in effect transferred and sold the License to us was allowed to retain a 7.0% royalty interest relating to the Prospect.

&#160;

&#160; 10 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Native Title Agreement 

&#160; 

As a precondition to the issuance of the License, on September 3, 2012 the Subsidiary entered into an agreement (the &#34; Native Title Agreement &#34;) with (a) the State of South Australia, (b) representatives of the Dieri Native Title Holders (the &#34; Native Title Holders &#34;) on behalf of the Native Title Holders, and (c) the Dieri Aboriginal Corporation (the &#34; Association &#34;). The Native Title Holders have certain historic rights on the lands covered by the License.

&#160;

The term of the Native Title Agreement commenced upon its execution, and it will terminate on the completion of the operations proposed or which may be undertaken by the Subsidiary in connection with the License and all subsequent licenses resulting from the License. By entering into the Native Title Agreement, the Native Title Holders agreed to the grant of the License and all subsequent licenses to the Subsidiary, and they also covenanted not to lodge or make any objection to any grant of licenses to the Subsidiary in respect of the License area unless the Subsidiary is in breach of an essential term under the Native Title Agreement. The Native Title Agreement provides that it will not terminate in the event of a breach of a payment obligation, but the parties may avail themselves of all other remedies available at law, which would involve recourse to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Commonwealth of Australia and the State of South Australia. Recourse for breach of operational obligations of the Subsidiary in favor of the Native Title Holders and the Association would be subject to the stipulated dispute resolution procedure involving negotiation and mediation before any party may commence court proceedings or arbitration.

&#160;

In consideration of the Native Title Holders' entering into the Native Title Agreement, the Subsidiary remitted to them a one-time payment in the amount of AUS$75,000 (or US$80,377 based on the exchange rate charged to us in late November 2012 when the payment was made). Moreover, throughout the term of the License, the Subsidiary is obligated to pay to the State of South Australia for the benefit of the Native Title Holders production payments in amounts equal to 1% of the value at the wellhead of petroleum produced and sold from the lands covered by the License. Furthermore, for facilitating the administration of this Native Title Agreement, the Subsidiary will pay in advance to the Association an annual fee comprising 12% of a maximum administration fee (the &#34; Maximum Administration Fee &#34;), which is AUS$150,000 (or approximately US$107,100 based on exchange rates in on February 29, 2016) (subject to adjustment for inflation). This 12% payment will be made for each year of the first five-year term of the License. After the first five-year term of the License, the payment will be four percent 4% of the Maximum Administration Fee for each year of the second and third five-year terms of the License. The Administrative Fee is not payable during times when the License is suspended, which is currently the case, as discussed below.

&#160;

The Subsidiary has virtually unlimited ability to assign and transfer (partially or entirely) its rights in the Native Title Agreement, provided certain procedural requirements are met. This ability should enhance the Subsidiary's ability to procure an industry joint venture partner.

&#160;

The Native Title Agreement features extensive provisions governing aboriginal heritage protection in connection with the Subsidiary's activities relating to the License. Management believes that these provisions (as well as the other provisions of the Native Title Agreement) are reasonable and customary, and are the industry standard throughout Australia. Under the Native Title Agreement, the Native Title Holders authorize the Subsidiary to enter upon the License area at all times and to commence and proceed with petroleum operations, and, while the provisions governing aboriginal heritage protection could adversely affect operational strategy and could increase costs, the Native Title Holders and the Association covenant that they will not interfere with the conduct of those operations; will actively support the Subsidiary in procuring all approvals, consents and other entitlements and rights as are necessary to support the interests of the Subsidiary in furthering the project; will refrain from doing any act which would impeded or prevent the Subsidiary from exercising or enjoying any of the rights granted or consented to under the Native Title Agreement; and will observe all applicable laws in performing their obligations under the Native Title Agreement.

&#160;

In connection with the entry into the Native Title Agreement, the Subsidiary entered into a similar agreement with other Aboriginal native titleholders and claimants with respect to a comparatively small amount of land also covered by the License. For all practical purposes, the terms of this additional agreement are the same as those contained in the Native Title Agreement. Payments made under this second agreement will reduce payments under the Native Title Agreement on a dollar-for-dollar basis, so that each of the two groups of native title holders and claimants will receive payments proportionately based on the amount of land that their respective claims represent relative to the total area covered by the License.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Plan of Operation 

&#160;

General 

&#160;

We intend to engage primarily in the exploration and development of oil and gas on the Prospect in an effort to develop oil and gas reserves. Our principal products will be crude oil and natural gas. Our development strategy will be directed in the multi-pay target areas of South Australia, with principal focus on the prolific Cooper/Eromanga Basin, towards initiating and rapidly expanding production rates and proving up significant reserves primarily through exploratory drilling. Our mission will be to generate superior returns for our stockholders by working with industry partners, suppliers and the community to build a focused exploration and production company with strong development assets in the oil and gas sector.

&#160;

In the right circumstances, we might assume the entire risk of the drilling and development of the Prospect. More likely, we will determine that the drilling and development of the Prospect can be more effectively pursued by inviting industry participants to share the risk and the reward of the Prospect by financing some or all of the costs of drilling wells. Such arrangements are frequently referred to as &#34;farm-outs.&#34; In such cases, we may retain a carried working interest or a reversionary interest, and we may be required to finance all or a portion of our proportional interest in the Prospect. Although this approach will reduce our potential return should the drilling operations prove successful, it will also reduce our risk and financial commitment to a particular prospect. Prospective participants regarding possible &#34;farm-out&#34; arrangements have already approached us.

&#160;

There can be no assurance that we will be successful in our exploratory and production activities. The oil and gas business involves numerous risks, the principal ones of which are listed in &#34;Item 1A. Risk Factors - RISKS RELATING TO OUR INDUSTRY - PARTICIPANTS IN THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY ARE SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS RISKS.&#34; As we become more involved in the oil and gas exploration and production business, we will give more detail information regarding these risks.

&#160;

Although our primary focus is on the exploration and development of the Prospect, we have received information about, and have had discussion regarding possible acquisition of or participation in, other oil or gas opportunities. None of these discussions has led to any agreement in principle. Nevertheless, given an attractive opportunity and our ability to consummate the same, we could acquire one or more other crude oil and natural gas properties, or participant in one or more other crude oil and natural gas opportunities.

&#160;

&#160; 12 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Proposed Initial Activities 

&#160;

We are in the initial phase of our plan of operation. To date we have not commenced any drilling or other exploration activities on the Prospect, and thus we do not have any estimates of oil and gas reserves. Consequently, we have not reported any reserve estimates to any governmental authority. We cannot assure anyone that we will find commercially producible amounts of oil and gas. Moreover, at the present time, we cannot finance the initial phase of our plan of operation solely through our own current resources. Therefore, we have undertaken certain financing activities described in &#34;Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources&#34; below. The success of the initial phase of our plan of operation depends upon our ability to obtain additional capital to acquire seismic data with respect to the Prospect, and to drill exploratory and developmental wells. We cannot assure anyone that we will obtain the necessary capital.

&#160;

The License is subject to a five-year work commitment. We have completed the first year of this work commitment and in this year we conducted geological and geophysical studies including interpretation of existing seismic data. In management&#8217;s view, the geotechnical work completed in year-one was sufficient to satisfy this requirement, and we filed our report in this connection with the South Australian government. We have received no comments from the government relating to this report.

&#160;

On May 19, 2014, the Company received notice from the Government of South Australia that this government had issued certain modifications to the License and suspended the License for a period of six months. Such a suspension functions like an extension. Under the amended License, the Company will be required to drill 7 exploratory wells rather than 12, as originally required. These required wells must be drilled in years 3, 4, and 5 (2, 2, and 3 wells, respectively). The amount of required 2D seismic was also reduced to 100 kilometers (in year 3) from 250 kilometers (in year 2) but the total 3D seismic work guaranteed increased to 500 square kilometers from 400 square kilometers. However, the 3D seismic survey requirement is spread over years 2, 3 and 4 (100, 200 and 200 sq. km. respectively). Subsequent to this modification and suspension, the Company received two additional six-month suspensions, one in February 2015 and one in July 2015, and a one-year suspension in February 2016. In view of these modifications and suspensions, the Company&#8217;s remaining work commitment involves the following:

&#160;

* Year 2 ending April 27, 2017 - Conduct a new 3D seismic survey totaling at least 100 kilometers. * Year 3 ending April 27, 2018 - Acquire new 2D seismic data totaling at least 100 kilometers, acquire 3D seismic data totaling at least 200 square kilometers and drill two wells. * Year 4 ending April 27, 2019 - Acquire new 3D seismic data totaling at least 200 square kilometers and drill two wells. * Year 5 ending April 27, 2020 - Drill three wells &#160;

The prices of the equipment and services that we must employ to fulfill the work commitment vary based on both local and international demand for such products by others involved in exploration for and production of oil and gas. The prevailing prices of the equipment and services can be subject to significant fluctuations. Until the significant decline in the price of oil that started in June 2014, high worldwide energy prices had resulted in growing demand for equipment and services, which led to higher prices being charged by suppliers and service providers. As a result of the significant decline in the price of oil, supplier and service provider prices have also declined significantly. We would like to take advantage of these lower costs. However, we have no assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funds in a timely manner to take advantage of this opportunity.

&#160;

&#160; 13 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Based on our research and technical analysis to date, we believe that the License work plan can be justified. Hence, the initial phase of our plan of operation involves (among other things) conducting 3D seismic surveys totaling 300 square kilometers (approximately 115 sq. miles), conducting a 2D seismic survey of 100 kilometers (approximately 62 miles) and drilling of at least two exploration wells. This activity will take place on the Prospect&#8217;s Area B and meets the near-term work requirements under the License. The Company is currently engaged in negotiations with seismic contractors to conduct at 3D survey of up to 200 square kilometers. It is anticipated that this survey will be completed by December 2016.

&#160;

We intend to seek a joint venture partner who or which might act as the operator to conduct seismic work and drill our wells. If we are unsuccessful in procuring such a partner, we will engage the services of a qualified seismic company to acquire additional 3D seismic data and once we have identified proposed drilling sites a third party contractor for drilling operations. Management foresees no problem in procuring the services of one or more qualified operators and drillers in connection with the initial phase of our plan of operation, although a considerable increase in drilling activities in the area of our properties could make difficult (and perhaps expensive) the procurement of operating and drilling services. In all cases, the operator will be responsible for all regulatory compliance regarding the well, including any necessary permitting for the well. In addition to regulatory compliance, the operator will be responsible for hiring the drilling contractor, geologist and petroleum engineer to make final decisions relative to the zones to be targeted, well design, and bore-hole drilling and logging. Should the well be successful, the operator would thereafter be responsible for completing the well, installing production facilities and interconnecting with gathering or transmission pipelines if economically appropriate. We expect to pay third party operators (i.e. not joint venture partner with us) commercially prevailing rates.

&#160;

The operator will be the caretaker of the well once production has commenced. Additionally, the operator will formulate and deliver to all interest owners an operating agreement establishing each participant's rights and obligations in that particular well based on the location of the well and the ownership. The operator will also be responsible for paying bills related to the well, billing working interest owners for their proportionate expenses in drilling and completing the well, and selling the production from the well. Unless each interest owner sells its production separately, the operator will collect sale proceeds from oil and gas purchasers, and, once a division order has been established and confirmed by the interest owners, the operator will issue the checks to each interest owner in accordance with its appropriate interest. The operator will not perform these functions when each interest owner sells its production separately, in which case the interest owners will undertake these activities separately. After production commences on a well, the operator also will be responsible for maintaining the well and the wellhead site during the entire term of the production or until such time as the operator has been replaced.

&#160;

The principal oil, natural gas and gas liquids transportation hub for the region of South Australia surrounding the Prospect is located in the vicinity of Moomba. This processing and transportation center is approximately 60 km (36 miles) due east of the Prospect's eastern boundary. Large diameter pipelines deliver oil and gas liquids from Moomba south to Port Bonython (Whyalla). Natural gas is also moved south to Adelaide or east to Sydney. A gas transmission pipeline also connects Moomba to Ballera, which is located northeastward in the State of Queensland. From Ballera gas can be moved to Brisbane and Gladstone, where a liquefied natural gas (LNG) project is under development. The Moomba treating and transportation facilities and the southward pipelines were developed and are operated by a producer consortium led by Santos Limited (no relation to us).

&#160;

We cannot accurately predict the costs of transporting our production until we locate our first successful well. The cost of installing infrastructure to deliver our production to Moomba or elsewhere will vary depending upon distance traversed, negotiated handling/treating fees, and pipeline tariffs.

&#160;

&#160; 14 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Markets and Marketing 

&#160; 

The petroleum industry has been characterized historically by crude oil and natural gas commodity prices that fluctuate (sometimes dramatically), and supplier costs can rise significantly during industry booms. For example, crude oil and natural gas prices increased to historical highs in 2008 and then declined significantly over the last two quarters of 2008. After this period, prices generally improved steadily with occasional reversals, without returning to historical highs, although they had generally been higher than pre-2007 levels. A several price decline started in June 2014 when the price of Brent oil was above $110 per barrel and has continued to date to remain at depressed level, with a recent public Brent quotes near $45 per barrel. Crude oil and gas prices and markets are likely to remain volatile in the future. Crude oil and natural gas are commodities and their prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand for oil and gas, market uncertainty, and a variety of additional factors beyond our control. Those factors include:

&#160;

* international political conditions (including wars and civil unrest, such as the recent unrest in the Middle East); * the domestic and foreign supply of oil and gas; * the level of consumer demand; * weather conditions; * domestic and foreign governmental regulations and other actions; * actions taken by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC); * the price and availability of alternative fuels; and * overall economic conditions. &#160;

Lower oil and natural gas prices may not only decrease our revenues on a per unit basis, but may also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas we can produce economically, if any. A sustained decline in oil and natural gas prices may materially affect our future business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and borrowing capacity, and may require a reduction in the carrying value of our oil and gas properties. While our revenues may increase if prevailing oil and gas prices increase significantly, exploration and production costs and acquisition costs for additional properties and reserves may also increase. We may or may not enter into hedging arrangements or use derivative financial instruments such as crude oil forward and swap contracts to hedge in whole or in part our risk associated with fluctuations in commodity prices.

&#160;

We do not expect to refine any of our production, although we may have to treat or process some of our production to meet the quality standards of purchasing or transportation companies. Instead, we expect that all or nearly all of our production will be sold to a relatively small number of customers. Production from our properties will be marketed consistent with industry practices. We do not now have any long-term sales contracts for any crude oil and natural gas production that we realize, but we expect that we will generally sell any production that we develop pursuant to these types of contracts. We do not believe that we will have any difficulty in entering into long-term sales contracts for our production, although there can be no assurance in this regard.

&#160;

The availability of a ready market for our production will depend upon a number of factors beyond our control, including the availability of other production in the Prospect&#8217;s region, the proximity and capacity of oil and gas pipelines, and fluctuations in supply and demand. Although the effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted or anticipated, we do not anticipate any unusual difficulty in contracting to sell our production of oil and gas to purchasers at prevailing market prices and under arrangements that are usual and customary in the industry. However, there can be no assurance that market, economic and regulatory factors will not in the future materially adversely affect our ability to sell our production.

&#160;

&#160; 15 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

We expect that most of the natural gas that we are able to find (if any) will be transported through gas gathering systems and gas pipelines that are not owned by us. The Prospect is in fairly close proximity to gas pipelines suitable for carrying our production. Transportation capacity on gas gathering systems and pipelines is occasionally limited and at times unavailable due to repairs or improvements being made to the facilities or due to use by other gas shippers with priority transportation agreements or who own or control the relevant pipeline. If transportation space is restricted or is unavailable, our cash flow could be adversely affected.

&#160;

Sales prices for oil and gas production are negotiated based on factors normally considered in the industry, such as the reported trading prices for oil and gas on local or international commodity exchanges, distance from the well to the pipeline, well pressure, estimated reserves, commodity quality and prevailing supply conditions. Historically, crude oil and natural gas market prices have experienced high volatility, which is a result of ever changing perceptions throughout the industry centered on supply and demand. We cannot predict the occurrence of events that may affect oil and gas prices or the degree to which such prices will be affected. However, the oil or gas prices realized by us should be equivalent to current market prices in the geographic region of the Prospect. Typically, oil prices in Australia reflect or are &#8220;benchmarked&#8221; against European commodity market trading settlement prices, namely Brent Crude. Recent price levels in this market have been at a premium to those settled in the United States, or (in other words) those &#8220;benchmarked&#8221; against West Texas Intermediate Crude. During certain periods, the differential has been substantial, although during the past few years the differential has been relatively modest.

&#160;

For the half year ending December 31, 2015, Beach Energy, a Cooper Basin producer reported an average realised Brent oil price of AU$101 per barrel down 22% from the previous corresponding period (PCP). As of May 4, 2016 WTI Crude Oil was priced at US$43.65 per barrel and Brent Crude Oil was priced at US$46.75 per barrel. We cannot predict the future level of the price differential between WTI Crude Oil and Brent Crude Oil or be assured that such differential will reflect a favorable premium for us in the future. (Sources: Beach Energy Half Yearly Report &#8211; December 31, 2015, Commodity prices - www.oil-price.net)

&#160;

We will strive to obtain the best price in the area of our production. Our revenues, profitability and future growth will depend substantially on prevailing prices for crude oil and natural gas. Decreases in the prices of oil and gas would likely adversely affect the carrying value of any proved reserves we are successful in establishing and our prospects, revenues, profitability and cash flow.

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160;

We expect to operate in the highly competitive areas of oil and gas exploration, development and production. We believe that the level of competition in these areas will continue into the future and may even intensify. In the areas of oil and gas exploration, development and production, competitive advantage is gained through superior capital investment decisions, technological innovation and costs management. Our competitors include major oil and gas firms and a large number of independent oil and gas companies. Because we expect to have control over acreage sufficient for our exploration and production efforts for the foreseeable future, we do not expect to compete for the acquisitions of properties for the exploration for oil and gas. However, we will compete for the equipment, services and labor required to operate and to develop our properties and to transport our production. Many of our competitors have substantially larger operating staffs and greater financial and other resources. In addition, larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of any changes in laws and regulations more easily than we can, which would adversely affect our competitive position. Moreover, most of our competitors have been operating for a much longer time than we, and have demonstrated the ability to operate through a number of industry cycles. The effect of the intense competition that we will face cannot now be determined.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Regulation 

&#160;

Our operations in South Australia and within the area of the Prospect are subject to the laws and regulations of the State of South Australia and the Commonwealth of Australia. The License was granted under the Petroleum and Geothermal Energy Act 2000 (SA) and our operations within and with respect to the License are governed by this Act and by the Petroleum and Geothermal Energy Regulations 2013 (SA). This legislation covers all phases of our operations including exploration, appraisal, development and production of oil and gas from the License area. Other legislation which we will be required to comply with at various stages of our operations include: Environment Protection Act 1993 (SA); Aboriginal Heritage Act 1988 (SA); Native Title (South Australia) Act 1994 (SA) and Native Title Act 1993 (Cth). As our oil and gas exploration and production operations in South Australia proceed, we will provide more detailed information regarding the material features and effects of these laws and regulations and such other legislation with which we will be required to comply.

&#160; 

Legal Proceedings 

&#160;

We are not now involved in any legal proceedings. There can be no assurance, however, that we will not in the future be involved in litigation incidental to the conduct of our business.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of the date of this filing, we had no employees. We expect that we will have no employees for the foreseeable future, although we expect to enter into consulting agreements with members of our management at some time in the future. The market for qualified oil and gas professionals and craftsmen can be very competitive during periods of strong commodity prices. We anticipate that we will be able to offer compensation and an interesting work environment that will enable us to attract employees to meet our labor needs.

&#160;

Facilities 

&#160;

We maintain our principal executive offices at One Riverway Drive, Suite 1700, Houston, Texas 77056 through an office rental package on essentially a month to month basis. Management believes that any needed additional or alternative office space can be readily obtained.
