 Item 1. Business 

OUR COMPANY 

General. Corporate Office Properties Trust (&#8220;COPT&#8221;) and subsidiaries (collectively, the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is a fully-integrated and self-managed real estate investment trust (&#8220;REIT&#8221;). Corporate Office Properties, L.P. (&#8220;COPLP&#8221;) and subsidiaries (collectively, the &#8220;Operating Partnership&#8221;) is the entity through which COPT, the sole general partner of COPLP, conducts almost all of its operations and owns almost all of its assets. Unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires, &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221; as used herein refer to each of the Company and the Operating Partnership. We own, manage, lease, develop and selectively acquire office and data center properties. The majority of our portfolio is in locations that support United States Government agencies and their contractors, most of whom are engaged in national security, defense and information technology (&#8220;IT&#8221;) related activities servicing what we believe are growing, durable priority missions (&#8220;Defense/IT Locations&#8221;). We also own a complementary portfolio of traditional office properties located in select urban/urban-like submarkets within our regional footprint with durable Class-A office fundamentals and characteristics, as well as other properties supporting general commercial office tenants (&#8220;Regional Office&#8221;). As of December 31, 2015 , our properties included the following: 

&#8226; 

177 &#32;operating office properties totaling 18.1 million &#32;square feet that were 92% &#32;occupied, including nine &#32;triple-net leased, single-tenant data center properties; 

&#8226; 

13 &#32;office properties under, or contractually committed for, construction or redevelopment that we estimate will total approximately 1.5 million &#32;square feet upon completion, including one partially operational property included above; 

&#8226; 

1,439 &#32;acres of land we control that we believe are potentially developable into approximately 17.6 million &#32;square feet; and 

&#8226; 

a wholesale data center with a critical load of 19.25 &#32;megawatts. 

COPLP owns real estate both directly and through subsidiary partnerships and limited liability companies (&#8220;LLCs&#8221;). In addition to owning real estate, COPLP also owns subsidiaries that provide real estate services such as property management and construction and development services primarily for our properties but also for third parties. Some of these services are performed by a taxable REIT subsidiary (&#8220;TRS&#8221;). 

Equity interests in COPLP are in the form of common and preferred units. As of December 31, 2015 , COPT owned 96.3% &#32;of the outstanding COPLP common units (&#8220;common units&#8221;) and 95.5% &#32;of the outstanding COPLP preferred units (&#8220;preferred units&#8221;); the remaining common and preferred units in COPLP were owned by third parties. Common units in COPLP not owned by COPT carry certain redemption rights. The number of common units in COPLP owned by COPT is equivalent to the number of outstanding common shares of beneficial interest (&#8220;common shares&#8221;) of COPT, and the entitlement of all COPLP common units to quarterly distributions and payments in liquidation is substantially the same as those of COPT common shareholders. Similarly, in the case of each series of preferred units in COPLP held by COPT, there is a series of preferred shares of beneficial interest (&#8220;preferred shares&#8221;) in COPT that is equivalent in number and carries substantially the same terms as such series of COPLP preferred units. COPT&#8217;s common shares are publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (&#8220;NYSE&#8221;) under the ticker symbol &#8220;OFC&#8221;. 

Because COPLP is managed by COPT, and COPT conducts substantially all of its operations through COPLP, we refer to COPT&#8217;s executive officers as COPLP&#8217;s executive officers, and although, as a partnership, COPLP does not have a board of trustees, we refer to COPT&#8217;s Board of Trustees as COPLP&#8217;s Board of Trustees. 

We believe that COPT is organized and has operated in a manner that satisfies the requirements for taxation as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and we intend to continue to operate COPT in such a manner. If COPT continues to qualify for taxation as a REIT, it generally will not be subject to Federal income tax on its taxable income (other than that of its TRS) that is distributed to its shareholders. A REIT is subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that it distribute to its shareholders at least 90% of its annual taxable income.

&#9702; 

two &#32;office properties in Northern Virgina totaling 665,000 &#32;square feet that secured a $150.0 million nonrecourse mortgage loan.

On February 10, 2016, our Board of Trustees appointed Stephen E. Budorick, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer since September 2011, to become our President and Chief Executive Officer effective May 12, 2016, the date of the Company&#8217;s 2016 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. On that date, Roger A. Waesche, Jr., our current President and Chief Executive Officer, will leave the Company to pursue other interests and he will not be nominated for reelection as a Trustee. The Board expects to appoint Mr. Budorick to our Board of Trustees after the 2016 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. 

Business and Growth Strategies 

Our primary goal is to deliver attractive and competitive total returns to our shareholders. This section sets forth key components of our business and growth strategies that we have in place to support this goal. &#32;&#32; 

Def ense/ IT Locations Strategy: We specialize in serving the unique requirements of tenants of our Defense/IT Locations. The majority of our properties are located adjacent to, or houses, United States Government agencies. Our customers in these properties are primarily United States Government agencies and their contractors engaged in activities servicing what we believe are high priority security, defense and IT missions. These tenants&#8217; missions generally pertain to knowledge-based 

activities (such as cyber security, research and development and other highly technical defense and security areas) rather than to force structure (troops) and weapon system production. A high percentage of our revenue ( 80.8% &#32;as of December 31, 2015) is concentrated in Defense/IT Locations, and we expect to maintain a high concentration through our: 

&#8226; 

properties&#8217; (existing buildings and developable land we control) proximity to defense installations and other knowledge-based government demand drivers, and our willingness to expand to new locations with similar proximities; 

&#8226; 

extensive experience in developing secured, specialized space, with the ability to satisfy the United States Government&#8217;s unique needs, including Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (&#8220;SCIF&#8221;) and Anti-Terrorism Force Protection (&#8220;ATFP&#8221;) requirements; 

&#8226; 

depth of knowledge, specialized skills and credentialed personnel in operating highly specialized space with security-oriented needs; 

&#8226; 

well-established relationships with United States Government agencies and their contractors; and 

&#8226; 

track record of providing service that exceeds customer expectations both in terms of the quality of the space we provide and our level of responsiveness to their needs. We believe that operating with such an emphasis on service enables us to be a landlord of choice with high quality tenants of these properties and contributes to high levels of customer loyalty and retention. 

Regional Office Strategy : While our primary focus pertains to Defense/IT Locations, we also own a portfolio of traditional office properties located in select urban/urban-like submarkets within our regional footprint with durable Class-A office fundamentals and characteristics, as well as other properties supporting general commercial office tenants. We believe that our Regional Office portfolio enables us to leverage our local expertise in a region into a second growth platform in a way that is complementary to our Defense/IT Locations strategy. Characteristics that we seek in Regional Office submarkets include: (1) mixed-use, lifestyle oriented locations with a robust high-end residential and retail base; (2) proximity to public transportation and major transportation routes; (3) educated workforce; and (4) diverse and growing employment base. We believe that these types of submarkets provide better overall quality and opportunity for long-term, sustained growth than other commercial office submarkets. 

Asset Management Strategy: &#32;We aggressively manage our portfolio to maximize the value and operating performance of each property through: (1) proactive property management and leasing; (2) achievement of operating efficiencies by increasing economies of scale and, where possible, aggregating vendor contracts to achieve volume pricing discounts; (3) renewing tenant leases and re-tenanting at increased rents where market conditions permit; and (4) redevelopment when we believe property conditions and market demand warrant. We may also seek to dispose of properties when they no longer meet our strategic objectives, or when capital markets and the circumstances pertaining to such holdings otherwise warrant, in order to maximize our return on invested capital and be better positioned for long-term growth. 

We also aim to develop and operate our properties in a manner that minimizes adverse impact on the environment by: (1) constructing new buildings designed to use resources with a high level of efficiency and low impact on human health and the environment during their life cycles through our participation in the U.S. Green Building Council&#8217;s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (&#8220;LEED&#8221;) program; (2) investing in energy systems and other equipment that reduce energy consumption and property operating costs; and (3) adopting select LEED Existing Building (&#8220;EB&#8221;) prerequisites for much of our portfolio, including guidelines pertaining to cleaning and recycling practices and energy reduction. In 2015, we participated for the first time in the GRESB (or Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark) survey, which is widely recognized for measuring the sustainability performance of real estate companies and funds, and earned an overall score of &#8220;Green Star,&#8221; which represents the highest quadrant of achievement from the survey. 

Property Development and Acquisition Strategy: &#32;We pursue property development and acquisition opportunities for properties that fit our Defense/IT Locations and Regional Office strategies and, as discussed above, have significant land holdings that we believe can help fuel future development of Defense/IT Locations in particular. We pursue development activities as market conditions and leasing opportunities support favorable risk-adjusted returns on investment, and therefore typically prefer properties to be significantly leased prior to commencing construction. We typically seek to make acquisitions at attractive yields and below replacement cost, or that otherwise meet our strategic objectives. We also seek to increase operating cash flow of certain acquisitions by repositioning the properties and capitalizing on existing below market leases and expansion opportunities. 

Capital Strategy: &#32;Our capital strategy is aimed at maintaining access to capital in the face of differing market conditions in the most cost-effective manner by: &#32;&#32; 

&#8226; 

maintaining an investment grade rating to enable us to use debt comprised of unsecured, primarily fixed-rate debt (including the effect of interest rate swaps) from public markets and banks; 

&#8226; 

using secured nonrecourse debt from institutional lenders and banks; 

&#8226; 

managing our debt by monitoring, among other things: (1) our total and secured debt levels relative to our overall capital structure; (2) the relationship of certain measures of earnings to our debt level and to certain capital costs; (3) the timing of debt maturities to ensure that maturities in any year do not exceed levels that we believe we can refinance; and (4) the relationship of our variable-rate debt to our total debt; 

&#8226; 

using equity raised through issuances of common and preferred shares, issuances of common and preferred units in COPLP and, to a lesser extent, joint venture structures for certain investments; 

&#8226; 

paying dividends at a level that at least enables us to maintain our REIT status; 

&#8226; 

recycling proceeds from property sales under our asset management strategy (discussed above) to fund our investment activities and to reduce overall debt; and 

&#8226; 

continuously evaluating the ability of our capital resources to accommodate our plans for future growth. 

Industry Segments 

We operate in two primary industries: commercial office properties and our wholesale data center. Effective in the quarter ended December 31, 2015, we changed the reportable segments that we use to review operating results and make decisions regarding segment performance and resource allocation. Given the changes in our portfolio resulting from development, acquisition and disposition activities, we made this change to better align our segments with our business strategy by contemplating the market characteristics of our properties. As of December 31, 2015 , our commercial office real estate operations included the following: Defense/IT Locations and Regional Office. Our segment reporting also included reporting for Defense/IT Locations sub-segments, which included the following: 

&#8226; 

Fort George G. Meade and the Baltimore/Washington Corridor (referred to herein as &#8220;Fort Meade/BW Corridor&#8221;); 

&#8226; 

Northern Virginia Defense I/T Locations; 

&#8226; 

Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas; 

&#8226; 

locations serving the U.S. Navy (referred to herein as &#8220;Navy Support Locations&#8221;). Properties in this segment as of December 31, 2015 were proximate to the Washington Navy Yard, the Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland and the Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division in Virginia; 

&#8226; 

Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama; and 

&#8226; 

data center shells, which are properties leased to tenants to be operated as data centers in which the tenants generally fund the costs for the power, fiber connectivity and data center infrastructure. Most of our data center shells as of December 31, 2015 were proximate to the MAE-East Corridor, a major center in the United States for interconnecting traffic between Internet service providers. 

As of December 31, 2015 , Defense/IT Locations comprised 146 &#32;of our office properties, or 79.6% &#32;of our square feet in operations, while Regional Office comprised 24 of our office properties, or 17.7% of our square feet in operations. Our wholesale data center, which is comprised of one property in Manassas, Virginia, is reported as a separate segment. 

For information relating to our segments, you should refer to Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements, which is included in a separate section at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K beginning on page F-1. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had 383 &#32;employees, none of whom were parties to collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our relations with our employees are good. 

Competition 

The commercial real estate market is highly competitive. Numerous commercial properties compete with us for tenants. Some of the properties competing with ours may be newer or in more desirable locations, or the competing properties&#8217; owners may be willing to accept lower rents than we are. We also compete with our own tenants, many of whom have the right to sublease their space. The competitive environment for leasing is affected considerably by a number of factors including, among other things, changes in economic conditions and supply of and demand for space. These factors may make it difficult for us to lease existing vacant space and space associated with future lease expirations at rental rates that are sufficient to meeting our short-term capital needs. 

We compete for the acquisition of commercial properties with many entities, including other publicly-traded commercial REITs. Competitors for such acquisitions may have substantially greater financial resources than ours. In addition, our competitors may be willing to accept lower returns on their investments or may be willing to incur higher leverage. If our 

competitors prevent us from buying properties that we have targeted for acquisition, we may not be able to meet our property acquisition goals. 

We also compete with many entities, including other publicly-traded commercial REITs, for capital. This competition could adversely affect our ability to raise capital we may need to fulfill our capital strategy.
