 Item 1. Business. 

General 

We are one of the world&#146;s largest snack companies with global net revenues of $29.6 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $7.3 billion in 2015. We manufacture and market delicious snack food and beverage products for consumers in 165 countries around the world. Our portfolio includes seven billion dollar brands&#151; Nabisco , Oreo and LU biscuits; Cadbury, Cadbury Dairy Milk and Milka chocolates; and Trident gum, as well as 51 brands that each generated annual revenues of $100 million or more in 2015. 

We are proud members of the NASDAQ 100 and Standard &#38; Poor&#146;s 500. Our Common Stock trades on The NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol &#147;MDLZ.&#148; We have been incorporated in the Commonwealth of Virginia since 2000. 

&#160;

We have been recognized for our ongoing economic, environmental and social contributions and this year were listed again on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (&#147;DJSI&#148;) &#150; World and North American Indices. The DJSI selects the top 10% of global companies and top 20% of North American companies based on an extensive review of financial and sustainability programs within each industry. We also participate in the Carbon Disclosure Project Climate and Water forums and continue to disclose and work to reduce our carbon and water footprints. We are committed to continue this and other related work in the areas of sustainable resources and agriculture, mindful snacking, community partnerships and safety of our products and people. 

Strategy 

We intend to leverage our core strengths, including our advantaged geographic footprint, market leadership positions and portfolio of iconic brands and innovation platforms, to achieve two primary goals: deliver top-tier financial performance and be a great place to work. Top-tier financial performance aims to achieve sustainable top- and bottom-line growth, driven by our transformation agenda, which includes focusing our portfolio, reducing costs and investing for growth. We plan to achieve these goals by executing five long-term strategies: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Unleash the Power of Our People. We believe that our two primary goals of delivering top-tier financial performance and being a great place to work are interdependent and that one is not fully achievable without the other. Being a great place to work enables us to recruit, retain and unleash the talents of great people. We remain focused on evolving our ways of working, our standards of leadership and the development opportunities available to our colleagues. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Transform Snacking . Driving growth is at the forefront of our long-term business strategies. By meeting the needs of consumers through innovation of our portfolio of products, we expect to grow and maintain our Power Brands and market-leading positions. Our global Power Brands continue to be a significant competitive advantage. Our Power Brands include global brands such as Oreo, LU and belVita biscuits; Milka , Cadbury Dairy Milk and Lacta chocolate; Halls candy; Trident gum; and Tang powdered beverages. Our brands enable us to fulfill consumer needs with a full range of snacking choices. Along with leveraging our global innovation platforms, we offer a full range of snacking choices that address the different needs of our consumers and quickly adapt successful products from one market to others. For example, in early 2015 we acquired Enjoy Life Foods, which creates allergen-free and better for you snacks such as Plentils gluten-free chips and Enjoy Life nut-free chocolate and seed &#38; fruit products. We are developing plans to expand this business within and outside of the North America region. 

In 2015, we also transformed our business portfolio following the deconsolidation of our coffee businesses. On July 2, 2015, we combined our global coffee business with D.E Master Blenders 1753 B.V. (&#147;DEMB&#148;) to form Jacobs Douwe Egberts (&#147;JDE&#148;), a new coffee venture in which we maintain a noncontrolling interest. Following the transactions, our snacks net revenues from biscuits, chocolate, gum and candy were approximately 85% of our 2015 net revenues excluding coffee net revenues. We will continue to have a significant stake in the coffee category, but holding our interest in the coffee venture as an investment will allow us to focus to a greater degree on our snacks portfolio and make operating and sales decisions that will help us to grow the snacks business. 

To strengthen how we support and leverage our snacks portfolio, we created a Chief Growth Officer role in 2014 to focus on top-line revenue growth opportunities. Beginning in January 2016, we also have a new Chief Commercial Officer. The Chief Commercial Officer is responsible for the execution of the Company&#146;s commercial plan with oversight over the global sales function and delivery of growth plans by the five regions. This structure will focus us further on pursuing and executing on opportunities through which we can drive the most attractive returns. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Revolutionize Selling. As part of our focus on growth around the world and particularly in emerging markets, we continue to invest heavily in our routes to market and sales capabilities across key markets, and we have made significant improvements in our marketing effectiveness and spending. In 2015, we acquired an 80% interest in a biscuit operation in Vietnam that expanded our routes to market in the Asia Pacific region. In recent years, we have also invested in expanding our brand presence across digital media and have placed increased focus on e-commerce. Effective spending on advertising and marketing fuels our brands and strengthens our growth strategies for the business. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Drive Efficiency to Fuel Growth. We manage our business through a virtuous cycle. To drive sales and earnings growth, we focus first on delivering high quality products that meet consumer needs. We expand our margins through leveraging lean and simple cost management programs within our integrated supply chain and through overhead discipline. We reinvest a portion of these savings to pursue additional targeted growth opportunities within our portfolio. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Protect the Well-being of Our Planet. We are committed to growing our business while protecting our planet and its people. We strive to enhance the well-being of the people who enjoy and make our products and to nurture communities where we live, work and grow the ingredients that go into our products. To accomplish these objectives, we focus on delivering safe, high-quality foods and maintaining a safe work environment for our employees. We work to protect resources, focusing on where we can have the greatest impact. We also make food that fits the way people eat today and provides balanced snacking choices. Our &#147;Call For Well-Being&#148; initiative focuses on four areas that we believe will have the greatest impact: sustainability, mindful snacking, safety and community partnerships. In each of these areas, we set clear goals and metrics. In 2015, we announced our &#147;Sustainability 2020&#148; goals, including reducing absolute carbon dioxide emissions; reducing deforestation within our agricultural supply chain; focusing water-reduction efforts in high-priority locations; reducing packaging material; and reducing total manufacturing waste. 

Reportable Segments 

Our operations and management structure are organized into five reportable operating segments: 

&#160; &#149; &#160; Latin America &#160; &#149; &#160; Asia Pacific &#160; &#149; &#160; Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa (&#147;EEMEA&#148;) &#160; &#149; &#160; Europe &#160; &#149; &#160; North America We manage our operations by region to leverage regional operating scale, manage different and changing business environments more effectively and pursue growth opportunities as they arise in our key markets. Our regional management teams have responsibility for the business, product categories and financial results in the regions. 

Historically, we have recorded income from equity method investments within our operating income as these investments operated as extensions of our base business. Beginning in the third quarter of 2015, to align with the accounting for our deconsolidated coffee business and related investment in JDE, we began to record the earnings from our equity method investments in after-tax equity method investment earnings outside of segment operating income. For the six months ended December 31, 2015, after-tax equity method investment net earnings were less than $1 million on a combined basis. Earnings from equity method investments through July 2, 2015 recorded within segment operating income were $49 million in Asia Pacific, $3 million in EEMEA and $4 million in North America. For the year ended December 31, 2014 these earnings were $98 million in Asia Pacific, $6 million in EEMEA and $9 million in North America. For the year ended December 31, 2013 these earnings were $99 million in Asia Pacific, $7 million in EEMEA and $1 million in North America. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#150; Principles of Consolidation , for additional information. 

In 2015, we also began to report stock-based compensation for our corporate employees, which was previously reported within our North America region, within general corporate expenses. We reclassified $32 million of corporate stock-based compensation expense out of the North America segment in 2015. 

Our segment net revenues for each of the last three years were:

Currency, the deconsolidation of our global coffee business and other items significantly affect the comparability of our consolidated and segment operating results from year to year. Please see Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a review of our operating results. 

Our brands span five product categories: 

&#160; &#149; &#160; Biscuits (including cookies, crackers and salted snacks) &#160; &#149; &#160; Chocolate &#160; &#149; &#160; Gum &#38; candy &#160; &#149; &#160; Beverages (including coffee through July 2, 2015 and powdered beverages) &#160; &#149; &#160; Cheese &#38; grocery During 2015, our segments contributed to our net revenues in these product categories as follows:

&#160; (1) On July 2, 2015, as part of the JDE coffee transactions, we deconsolidated our global coffee businesses primarily from our Europe, EEMEA and Asia Pacific segment beverage categories. Our 2015 net revenues reflect our coffee business through July 2, 2015. Refer to Note 2, Divestitures and Acquisitions &#150; Coffee Business Transactions , for more information. Within our product categories, the classes of products that contributed 10% or more to consolidated net revenues were:

&#160;

&#160; (1) During 2014, we realigned some of our products across product categories and as such, we reclassified the product category net revenues on a basis consistent with the 2015 presentation. We use segment operating income to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. We believe it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze segment performance and trends. For a definition and reconciliation of segment operating income to consolidated pre-tax earnings as well as other information on our segments, see Note 17, Segment Reporting . 

Our segment operating income for each of the last three years was:

Significant Divestitures and Acquisitions 

For information on our significant divestitures and acquisitions, please refer to Note 2, Divestitures and Acquisitions, and specifically, in connection with our global coffee business deconsolidation, see our discussion under Coffee Business Transactions . 

Customers 

No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our net revenues from continuing operations in 2015. Our five largest customers accounted for 17% and our ten largest customers accounted for 24% of net revenues from continuing operations in 2015. 

Seasonality 

Demand for our products is generally balanced over the first three quarters of the year and increases in the fourth quarter primarily because of holidays and other seasonal events. 

Competition 

We face competition in all aspects of our business. Competitors include large multi-national as well as numerous local and regional companies. Some competitors have different profit objectives than we do and therefore approach pricing and promotional decisions differently. We compete based on product quality, brand recognition and loyalty, service, product innovation, taste, convenience, the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences, effectiveness of sales and marketing, routes to market and distribution networks, promotional activity and price. Improving our market position or introducing a new product requires substantial research, development, advertising and promotional expenditures. We believe these investments lead to better products for the consumer and support our growth and market position. 

Distribution and Marketing 

Across our segments, we generally sell our products to supermarket chains, wholesalers, supercenters, club stores, mass merchandisers, distributors, convenience stores, gasoline stations, drug stores, value stores and other retail food outlets. We distribute our products through direct store delivery, company-owned and satellite warehouses, distribution centers and other facilities. We also use the services of independent sales offices and agents in some of our international locations. 

We also sell our products on a growing number of e-commerce platforms as consumer consumption patterns change (reflecting greater consumer time compression and technology use) and retail increasingly expands online. Within our digital and social marketing, we also create opportunities for consumers to easily find and buy our products online. We have built relationships with several retailers to develop customized programs that fit their and our formats and provide consumers additional personalized offerings from our snacks portfolio. 

We conduct marketing efforts through three principal sets of activities: (i) consumer marketing and advertising including on-air, print, outdoor, digital and social media and other product promotions; (ii) consumer sales incentives such as coupons and rebates; and (iii) trade promotions to support price features, displays and other merchandising of our products by our customers. 

&#160;

Raw Materials and Packaging 

We purchase and use large quantities of commodities, including cocoa, dairy, wheat, corn products, soybean and vegetable oils, sugar and other sweeteners and nuts. In addition, we purchase and use significant quantities of packaging materials to package our products and natural gas, fuels and electricity for our factories and warehouses. We regularly monitor worldwide supply, cost and currency trends related to these commodities so we can cost-effectively secure ingredients, packaging and energy sources required for production. 

A number of external factors such as weather conditions, commodity market conditions, currency fluctuations and governmental agricultural programs affect the cost and availability of raw materials and agricultural materials used in our products. We use hedging techniques to limit the impact of fluctuations in the cost of our principal raw materials. However, we cannot fully hedge against changes in commodity costs, and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs. 

While the costs of our principal raw materials fluctuate, we believe there will continue to be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they will generally remain available from numerous sources. For additional information on our commodity costs, refer to the Commodity Trends section within Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations . 

Intellectual Property 

Our intellectual property rights (including trademarks, patents, copyrights, registered designs, proprietary trade secrets, technology and know-how) are material to our business.

We own numerous trademarks and patents in many countries around the world. Depending on the country, trademarks remain valid for as long as they are in use or their registration status is maintained. Trademark registrations generally are for renewable, fixed terms. We also have patents for a number of current and potential products. Our patents cover inventions ranging from basic packaging techniques to processes relating to specific products and to the products themselves. Our issued patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent application filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage as determined by the patent office or courts in the country, and the availability of legal remedies in the country. While our patent portfolio is material to our business, the loss of one patent or a group of related patents would not have a material adverse effect on our business.

From time to time, we grant third parties licenses to use one or more of our trademarks in connection with the manufacture, sale or distribution of third party products. Similarly, we sell some products under brands we license from third parties. In our agreement with Kraft Foods Group, Inc. (&#147;Kraft Foods Group&#148;; which is now part of The Kraft Heinz Company), we each granted the other party various licenses to use certain of our and their respective intellectual property rights in named jurisdictions following the spin-off of our North American grocery business. 

Research and Development 

We pursue four objectives in research and development: product safety and quality, growth through new products, superior consumer satisfaction and reduced costs. Our innovation efforts focus on anticipating consumer demands and adapting quickly to changing market trends. Wellness products and healthy snacking are a significant focus of our current research and development initiatives. These initiatives aim to accelerate our growth and margins by addressing consumer needs and market trends and leveraging our global innovation platforms, Power Brands and breakthrough technologies. 

At December 31, 2015, we had approximately 2,450 scientists and engineers, of which approximately 1,900 are primarily focused on research and development and the remainder are primarily focused on quality assurance and regulatory affairs. Our major technology centers are located in: East Hanover, New Jersey; Whippany, New Jersey; Bournville, United Kingdom; Curitiba, Brazil; Paris, France; Melbourne, Australia; Mexico City, Mexico; Munich, Germany; Reading, United Kingdom; Thane, India; and Suzhou, China. Our research and development expense was $409 million in 2015, $455 million in 2014 and $471 million in 2013. Our total research and development expense was lower in 2015 primarily due to the deconsolidation of our global coffee business, currency and cost optimization initiatives.

Regulation 

Our food products and ingredients are subject to local, national and multi-national regulations related to labeling, packaging, pricing, marketing and advertising, privacy and related areas. In addition, various jurisdictions regulate our operations by licensing and inspecting our manufacturing plants and facilities, enforcing standards for selected food products, grading food products, and regulating trade practices related to the sale and pricing of our food products. Many of the food commodities we use in our operations are subject to government agricultural policy and intervention. These policies have substantial effects on prices and supplies and are subject to periodic governmental and administrative review. 

Examples of laws and regulations that affect our business include selective food taxes, nutritional labeling requirements and marketing restrictions in markets such as Europe and Latin America; Russian sanctions on the sourcing of raw materials from the European Union and potential labeling disclosure requirements for genetically modified ingredients in the United States. We will continue to monitor developments in laws and regulations. At this time, we do not expect the cost of complying with new laws and regulations will be material. Also refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#151;Currency Translation and Highly Inflationary Accounting , for additional information on government regulations and currency-related impacts on our operations in Argentina, Russia and other countries. 

Environmental Regulation 

Throughout the countries in which we do business, we are subject to local, national and multi-national environmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. We have programs across our business units designed to meet applicable environmental compliance requirements. In the United States, the laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (&#147;CERCLA&#148;). CERCLA imposes joint and several liability on each potentially responsible party. As of December 31, 2015, we had resolved the one active proceeding in the United States under a state equivalent of CERCLA related to our current operations. As of December 31, 2015, we accrued an immaterial amount for the remaining payments related to this resolution. Based on information currently available, we believe that our compliance with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our financial results. 

Employees 

We employed approximately 99,000 people worldwide at December 31, 2015 and approximately 104,000 at December 31, 2014. Approximately 5,000 employees transferred to JDE in connection with the global coffee business transactions, and we also added approximately 6,000 employees due to acquisitions in 2015. Employees represented by labor unions or workers&#146; councils represent approximately 65% of our 87,000 employees outside the United States and approximately 30% of our 12,000 U.S. employees. Our business units are subject to various local, national and multi-national laws and regulations relating to their relationships with their employees. In accordance with European Union requirements, we also have established a European Workers Council composed of management and elected members of our workforce. We believe we generally have good relationships with our employees and their representative organizations. 

Foreign Operations 

We generated 78.7% of our 2015 net revenues, 82.1% of our 2014 net revenues and 83.1% of our 2013 net revenues from continuing operations outside the United States. We sell our products to consumers in 165 countries. At December 31, 2015, we had operations in more than 80 countries and made our products at 156 manufacturing and processing facilities in 57 countries. Refer to Note 17, Segment Reporting, for additional information on our U.S. and non-U.S. operations. Refer to Item 2, Properties , for more information on our manufacturing and other facilities. Also, for a discussion of risks related to our operations outside the United States, see &#147;Risk Factors&#148; in Item 1A.
