OUR COMPANY 

Introduction 

We are a company focused on the technology markets. Presently we have one

operating subsidiary, of Wala, Inc. doing business as ArcMail Technology (ArcMail)

which was purchased on November 4, 2015. . ArcMail is in the business of providing

simple, secure and cost-effective email and enterprise archiving and management

solutions to businesses of all sizes across a wide range of vertical markets Revenues

consist entirely of revenues from the operation of our ArcMail subsidiary ($474,679

during the period November 4, 2015 through the year ended December 31, 2015). In

addition to ArcMail&#146;s operations, we had income from discontinued operations of

$627,384.

Our primary focus is the acquisition of additional technology companies. We

believe that the background of our management and of our Board of Directors in the

technology markets is a valuable resource that makes us a desirable business partner to

the companies that we are seeking to acquire. When we acquire a company, we work to

assume an active role in the development and growth of the company, providing both

strategic guidance and operational support. We provide strategic guidance to our partner

companies relating to, among other things, market positioning, business model and

product development, strategic capital expenditures, mergers and acquisitions and exit

opportunities. Additionally, we provide operational support to help our partner companies

manage day-to-day business and operational issues and implement best practices in the

areas of finance, sales and marketing, business development, human resources and legal

services. Once a company joins our partner company network, our collective expertise is

leveraged to help position that company to produce high-margin, recurring and

predictable earnings and generate long-term value for our stockholders.

Our current intention is to fund the purchase price of acquisitions through a

combination of the issuance of our common stock at closing and the issuance of common

stock purchase or common-stock warrants that would become exercisable only in the

event certain earn-out conditions are satisfied by the acquired company. In addition to

acquiring entire companies, we would also consider entering into joint ventures and

acquiring less than 100 percent of a target company.

Our Strategy to Grow the Company 

General 

We have an overall corporate business plan as a holding company to seek out and

acquire operating companies. Phase one of our strategy is complete. We established new

corporate headquarters and a website, expanded our board to include 3 outside

independent directors, set up periodic board meetings, engaged a sophisticated full

service law firm, engaged a new PCAOB registered auditing firm, engaged an investment

banking firm as advisors to assist in the analysis of target acquisitions, and become an

SEC reporting company. In addition, we are working on a daily basis towards our

strategy, identifying further acquisitions that will expand and or complement our existing

subsidiary.

Sources of Target Businesses 

We anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from

various sources, including our management team, investment bankers, venture capital

funds, private equity funds, leveraged buyout funds, management buyout funds,

consulting firms and other members of the financial community who will become aware

that we are seeking business partners via public relations and marketing efforts, direct

contact by management or other similar efforts, who may present solicited or unsolicited

proposals. Any finder or broker would only be paid a fee upon the completion of a

business combination. While we do not presently anticipate engaging the services of

professional firms that specialize in acquisitions on any formal basis, we may decide to

engage such firms in the future or we may be approached on an unsolicited basis. Our

officers and directors, as well as their affiliates, may also bring to our attention target

business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts. While our

officers and directors make no commitment as to the amount of time they will spend

trying to identify or investigate potential target businesses, they believe that the various

relationships they have developed over their careers together with their direct inquiry,

will generate a number of potential target businesses that will warrant further

investigation. In no event will we pay any of our existing officers, directors, special

advisors or stockholders or any entity with which they are affiliated any finder&#146;s fee or

other compensation for services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the

completion of a business combination. In addition, none of our officers, directors, special

advisors or existing stockholders will receive any finder&#146;s fee, consulting fees or any

similar fees from any person or entity in connection with any business combination

involving us other than any compensation or fees that may be received for any services

provided following such business combination.

Selecting Acquisition Targets 

Our management has virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying prospective

target business and diligently reviews all of the proposals we receive.

The criteria we look for in a potential acquisition include, but are not limited to,

the following:

Company Characteristics 

&#167; Established Company with proven track record 

o Company with history of strong operating and financial performance, or 

o Company undergoing a turnaround that demonstrates strong prospects for 

future growth

&#167; Strong Cash Flow Characteristics. 

o Cash flow neutral or positive, 

o Predictable recurring revenue stream, 

o High gross margins and 

o Low working capital and capital expenditure needs 

&#167; Strong Competitive Industry Position 

o Leading or niche market position, and/or 

o Strong channel relationships that promote barriers to entry 

&#167; Strong Management Team 

o Experienced, proven track record in delivering revenue and ability to 

execute, or

o A management team that can be complemented with our contacts and 

team

&#167; Diversified Customer and Supplier base 

&#167; Proprietary products or marketing position 

Industry Characteristics 

&#167; Non-cyclical 

&#167; Services Consumer or niche market 

&#167; Fragmented with potential for consolidation or growth 

&#167; Emerging markets 

Industries of Interest 

&#167; Real Estate Services 

&#167; Managed Security Services Providers (MSSP) 

&#167; IT Solutions Providers specializing in security and network technology 

products, services, and support

&#167; Internet 

o Cloud Computing 

o Security focused applications 

Investment Criteria 

&#167; Sales Volumes: $500 thousand to $30 million 

&#167; Cash Flow: Neutral or positive 

&#167; Structure: Controlled ownership. Closely held private company 

&#167; Geography: North America Investment size: $1 million to $5 Million 

&#167; Involvement: Board oversight 

&#167; Controlling Interest: Acquire 100% of controlling interest in target 

&#167; Marketing: 

o Target captures a particular segment of the market 

o Target has a focused strategic marketing plan. 

These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the

merits of a particular business combination will be based, to the extent relevant, on the

above factors as well as other considerations deemed relevant by our management in

effecting a business combination consistent with our business objective.

Diligence Process 

Upon receipt of a business plan, the procedure is for management to review the

business plan and determine if it satisfies the Company&#146;s acquisition criteria, and whether

the business plan should be rejected or pursued further. If the plan satisfies the

requirements, then Management meets with the target&#146;s management to determine if there

is a synergy that can work and to explore the business plan in greater detail. Generally

this occurs over several meetings and can take some time. Depending on the nature of the

business, management may enlist certain technical or industry consultants to meet with

the target and provide feedback and analysis. Management will also review the target&#146;s

financials. If the analysis suggests the target should be explored further Management will

present the opportunity to the BOD for approval to pursue the opportunity further. One or

two outside directors may meet with the target to make an independent assessment. If the

opportunity is approved for further exploration management will discuss potential

purchase structure with target&#146;s management to be sure that a meeting of the minds exists

for a potential deal. At this point management will request that our investment banking

advisors give their opinion of the industry, the market and potential financing options of

the deal. Often, the investment bankers will meet with target&#146;s management. The

investment banker&#146;s feedback is presented to the board and, if positive, the Board

analyzes the proposed financing structure, discusses effects of a transaction on the

Company as they relate to taxes, capitalization, stock value etc., engaging the necessary

outside consultants. If all appears positive a letter of intent is negotiated and executed,

additional diligence is conducted, and definitive transaction documents are negotiated

and executed.

Evaluation of the Target&#146;s Management 

We would condition any acquisition on the commitment of management of the

target business to remain in place post-closing. Following a business combination, we

may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the

target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional

managers, or that any such additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge

or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management. Although we intend to

closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the

desirability of effecting a business combination, we cannot assure you that our

assessment of the target business&#146;s management will prove to be correct.

Competition 

In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we may encounter

intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours. Many

of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and

effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors

possess greater technical, human and other resources than us and our financial resources

will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors, which

may limit our ability to compete in acquiring certain target businesses. This inherent

competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target

business.

Companies Currently Under Review 

We are constantly in the process of reviewing potential target companies.

Currently, we are not under contract to acquire any companies.

Our Partner Company 

Wala Inc. dba ArcMail Technology 

Products and Services 

ArcMail is a provider of enterprise information archiving solutions for businesses

of all sizes across a wide range of vertical markets. ArcMail offers a full array of email

and data archiving solutions with broad deployment options that support a wide range of

content types from various sources.

ArcMail&#146;s products and services are offered in a variety of deployment options

that include a turnkey appliance, a virtual machine (VM) software (VMware or MS

Hyper-V), a cloud/premise-based hybrid gateway (which can store information to a SAN,

NAS, or any cloud-based storage provider), and fully-hosted services in the cloud. Each

deployment option can support multiple data types from: most commercially available

mail servers, including all versions of MS Exchange, Linux variants, IBM Lotus Notes,

IBM Domino, and GroupWise among others; most cloud-based systems, including

Google Gmail, MS Office365, Google Apps, and Google Docs among others; and

Microsoft SharePoint, enterprise social media such as your corporate Twitter; and

Microsoft and Linux-based file systems.

Whether a customer wants their archive to reside behind the firewall, in the

cloud, or anywhere else, ArcMail offers products and services to fit that deployment

strategy. Whatever deployment option ArcMail&#146;s customers elect, their data is properly

organized and maintained, for e-Discovery, compliance, disaster recovery and for finding

that file that a CEO needs immediately. Customers discoverable information is being

archived using a compliant and secure solution that is scalable, dependable, and easy to

install, deploy, use, and maintain.

In addition to being an archiving solutions provider, ArcMail has created a sales

and support organization to help companies in search of expertise, information, and

supporting resources as they investigate their need and develop strategies for enterprise

information archiving. ArcMail recognizes that customers' needs are not met through a

"cookie cutter/one size fits all" approach. As an expert in the enterprise information

archiving market, ArcMail works in partnership with customers to ensure their archiving

solution is tailored to meet their unique situation and environment.

Competitive Comparison 

ArcMail&#146;s archiving solution is built on a simple and flexible design that gives

customers ownership and control over their data and offers a single comprehensive

solution for regulatory compliance, data retention and eDiscovery. ArcMail&#146;s primary

competitors include Barracuda Networks, Inc., MS Office365, and Google Vault.

ArcMail rarely encounters other competitors such as EMC, Symantec and Smarsh, as

they primarily focus on Fortune 500 and SME markets.

ArcMail competes effectively against its primary competitors by providing a simple and

scalable architecture, and world-class customer support. ArcMail&#146;s primary competitive

differentiation includes:

Support is provided at our U.S. headquarters by an experienced technical

team

Future Products and Services 

ArcMail&#146;s product strategy is to provide architectures and deployment capabilities

that address the widest possible segment of the archiving market. While ArcMail is not

attempting to be &#147;all things to all people&#148; per se, ArcMail, as a result of its differentiated

capabilities, is able to address a majority segment. We see the ArcMail platform

including appliance, hosted and virtual products and services as viable in both the near

and long term. Enterprise class customers will continue to see the appliance model as

preferential to a hosted platform in most cases. The SMB market, which is transitioning

to the cloud in significant numbers, will help our virtualized and hosted solutions

continue to gain ground.

Customers 

ArcMail currently has approximately 1,500 client accounts ranging from 50 active

email accounts to 5,000 active email accounts. Most of ArcMail&#146;s customers are in the

Northeast, South, and Central region of the country. The typical profile of our customers

are 100-5,000 email mailboxes/employees. ArcMail&#146;s customers are usually in regulated

industries or have e-discovery legal requests, H.R. audits, and/or regulatory compliance

issues. Their pain points will vary depending on the prospect you are speaking with. No

one Customer constitutes more than 5% of ArcMail&#146;s sales and the loss of any customer

will not have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s financial condition.

Expansion Summary 

ArcMail&#146;s objective is to be a market leader in the Enterprise Information

archiving industry. ArcMail currently has significant market share in the education and

local/County/State government industry sector. ArcMail is currently expanding its sales

and marketing initiatives to further penetrate the health care, financial services, insurance,

manufacturing, and transportation industry sectors. ArcMail has expanded its sales

channel overseas to such areas as New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Mexico and other

Latin American countries. ArcMail is also actively working to expand by providing

services to larger accounts in the SME enterprises with 5,000+ end users. ArcMail is also
