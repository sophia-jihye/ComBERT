On January 10, 2014, we formed a Canadian subsidiary BioLargo Water, Inc., wholly owned by Biolargo Water USA, Inc. 

&#160; 

Our Business 

&#160; 

We make life better by delivering simple and sustainable solutions to big problems. We create and refine intellectual property that forms a foundation from which to build and create break-through products and technology for licensure to commercial partners. Our products harness the power of iodine &#8211; &#8220;Nature&#39;s Best Solution&#8221; &#8211; to eliminate contaminants that threaten our water, our health and our quality of life. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

We invent, patent, prove and partner &#8211; to create best-of-class products and technology for commercialization as we build value for our shareholders and deliver benefits to our world. 

&#160; 

Invent &#8211; Three Platform Technologies 

&#160; 

We feature three patent protected platform technologies with diverse product opportunities across multiple industries &#8211; the AOS Filter, CupriDyne, and Isan. Each features the use of the all-natural iodine molecule. While they all use iodine, they are quite different in terms of the methods by which they exploit the use of iodine, the form and composition of iodine used, and therefore their function and value proposition can be quite different for each commercial application. 

&#160; 

AOS Filter 

&#160; 

The AOS Filter is our invention that combines iodine, water filter materials and electrolysis within a water filter device. Our filter generates extremely high oxidation potential in order to oxidize and break-down, or otherwise eliminate, soluble organic contaminants like acids, solvents, sulfurs, oil and gas by-products, and pharmaceutical by-products which are commonly found in all sorts of contaminated water. It also achieves extremely high rates of disinfection to eliminate infectious biological pathogens like salmonella, listeria and ecoli. 

&#160; 

Extremely high oxidation potential is the key. The term &#8216;oxidation potential&#8217; refers to the measure of the performance in which an oxidant is able to &#8216;break down&#8217; a material through, in simple terms, the addition of oxygen and the transfer of electrons. Two commonly understood examples of oxidation are, as salt air rusts a shipyard anchor, or as fire is able to dismantle wood and turn it into ash. The key to our AOS Filter is its ability to generate extremely high oxidation potential in a continuous flow device that attacks contaminants in water that flow through the AOS Filter. The extremely high oxidation potential enables the AOS Filter to achieve performance results that researchers at the University of Alberta refer to as, &#8216;unprecendented&#8217; . Our AOS Filter embodies a break-through in science which led to BioLargo&#39;s co-founding of an ongoing research chair to solve the contaminated water issues associated with the Canadian Oil Sands at the University of Alberta Department of Engineering with the top five oil companies in Canada, the regional water district, and various environmental agencies of the Canadian government. Our work is continually expanding into a number of commercial applications with a key focus on food processing, agriculture and oil and gas. We are also evaluating opportunities in the maritime industry, mining, storm drain recapture / recycling, and drinking water. It is an award-winning invention that is supported with science and engineering financial support and grants from various federal and provincial agencies in Canada. The financial support is expanding along with the work to develop commercially available designs. We believe the AOS Filter has an important and substantial commercial opportunity in every segment of the water treatment industry. 

&#160; &#160; 

CupriDyne&#174; 

&#160; 

Our CupriDyne formula is used to deliver iodine within products. It can be delivered in any physical form, and can be combined with other ingredients, like fragrances in our odor control products, and primitive surfactants in our stain and odor products. Additional ingredients can often be added without sacrificing its practical and safe antimicrobial functions as well its oxidation potential . Our product designs include liquids, sprays, gels, powders, coatings and absorbents. 

&#160; &#160; 

Safe and effective is the key. Each of our product designs delivers nature&#8217;s broadest spectrum and most potent disinfectant &#8211; iodine &#8211; safely and precisely to achieve effective broad-spectrum disinfection, unsurpassed odor and moisture control, and effective and gentle wound healing. Our primary ingredients, as well as reaction by-products, are &#8220;generally recognized as safe&#8221; (G.R.A.S) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as food additives in their basic forms. Its commercial product opportunities are diverse and we have an extensive menu of product designs in various stages of commercialization and licensure development, discussed in detail below in the &#8220;Commercial, Household and Personal Care Products&#8221; section. We specialize in delivering iodine, nature&#8217;s broadest spectrum and most potent disinfectant and essential nutrient, in safe, environmentally friendly, non-staining, non-toxic and effective product designs. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

CupriDyne is unique. The iodine most of us are familiar with, sold in pharmacies and used by hospitals, has severe limitations &#8211; it is considered toxic, causes staining, and contains a limited dose of the active oxidizing ingredient. Our CupriDyne technology, on the other hand, directly addresses many of these shortcomings &#8211; it delivers iodine&#8217;s oxidizing ingredient (&#8220;free iodine&#8221;) with precision, ranging from very small doses up to very large doses with more than 20 times the power of traditional iodine. We can deliver iodine so that it is both non-toxic and non-staining, thus extending its usefulness well beyond historical product applications. Our formulations expand the functionality of our products well beyond simple disinfection. 

&#160; 

Isan System 

&#160; 

The Isan System is an automated iodine dosing system. It is the winner of a Top 50 Water Technology Award by the Artemis Project and a Dupont Innovation Award. Precise dosing combined with a straight-forward &#8216;set-it-and-forget-it&#8217; automated computer controlled system is the key. The system features controlled measuring, flow control, dosing and iodine extraction/removal technology as well as an automatic tracking system that precisely delivers iodine in calibrated doses into a water steam or container of water. The Isan system has been proven to substantially reduce the incidence of fungal growth, spoilage, organisms and pathogens in water and on food. The system is able to operate at high flow rates. 

&#160; 

First developed in Australia, the Isan system was initially registered with the APVMA (Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority) and FSANZ (Food Standards Australia and New Zealand) in Australia and New Zealand. The system has meaningful use and commercial value in any industry that can benefit from a precise use of iodine in water, like; agriculture, food production and processing, manufacturing, industrial water processes, irrigation supply. 

&#160; 

Patent - an Expanding Intellectual Property Estate 

&#160; 

We have 16 patents issued and multiple pending. We believe these patents provide a foundation from which to continue building our patent portfolio and we have reasonable basis upon which to rely on our patent protections in the field of art in which we practice . We also rely on trade secrets and technical know-how to establish and maintain additional protection of our intellectual property. As our capital resources permit, we expect to expand our patent protection as we continue to refine our inventions as well as make new discoveries. See the detailed discussion below of our patent portfolio. 

&#160; 

Prove - a Continual Process 

&#160; 

We have invested time and money in a wide array of third party testing, side-by-side comparisons and third party verifications to support our most important technical claims. The basic attributes of iodine are well understood by science and industry. We have evidence and experience to substantiate the following bold claims:

Partner &#8211; a Smart Strategic Decision 

&#160; 

We seek to develop commercial partnerships with other companies who will partner with us and pay us for a negotiated contractual right to use our intellectual property (patents, formulas, designs, claims, know-how, secrets), in order to expand their business for their own commercial purposes. In those instances, we seek a reasonable deposit, a minimum commitment to volume, some territorial rights, and a percentage of sales for a mutually agreeable term and territory. We believe this licensing model will prove successful and meaningful for our company. 

&#160; 

We have chosen to focus on business opportunities that we believe have some combination of the following attributes: a compelling commercial advantage, our products out-perform competing products, market segments in which we have the talent and resources or opportunity to succeed in executing our business plans; and uses where we can identify a compelling cost savings or value offering to increase market share. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

We choose to pursue a licensing strategy for its obvious and well-understood high margins, potential for explosive revenue potential and capital conserving features. While this business model can also be highly dependent upon macro-economic factors like the relative stability of the national and international economy as well as cyclical nature of business, politics and climate for innovation and competing technical advances, we believe this is the most appropriate strategy for our company. We have learned from difficult and real life experience. When our commercial licensing partners are under financial pressure from macro-economic and political circumstances, including reorganizations, recapitalization, or consolidation, they hold on to capital and are less likely to take any risk for new product offerings. Timing is critically important. Companies facing circumstances beyond their management&#8217;s control are less likely to embrace any risk of innovation. Therefore, our time delays have negatively impacted our company by causing us to invest more capital, do more work, and advance our technology with nominal cash flow to support our work. However, while these delays have occurred and they were difficult, we have been able to maintain our operations, advance our scientific assets, build on our proven claims, refine our designs and we have continued to build a portfolio of both products and technology that we believe will ultimately enjoy meaningful commercial success. 

&#160; 

While we have waited out many of the uncertainties of the macro-economic marketplace, we have advanced our commercial purposes and made investments in various aspects of product design, marketing and distribution, but only at an early stage and small level. In those instances, we consider these efforts to be a prelude to an ultimate licensing strategy. This strategy has been slower than we prefer. However, it has created a substantial level of diversification and breadth of potential revenue streams that we believe can and will generate meaningful revenues as they find traction in the marketplace. As we improve our access to capital, strengthen our balance sheet and can begin to generate meaningful cash flow, we believe those commercial opportunities will generate revenue for years to come as our products find their way into the marketplace. 

&#160; 

In many situations, our potential licensing partners would prefer that we advance products all the way through proof of claim, manufacturing, market acceptance, well-established distribution and commercial success. While this is obvious, can be intriguing, and the relative benefits that would accrue to our valuation are clear, the risks of failure are equally high and this strategy would require substantially more capital than we have been able to secure during what many believe has been one of the most economically uncertain times in modern history. Therefore, we have chosen to invest our time and resources where we find leverage to move forward, knowing that our technical claims are proven, they are patented and that each product design has a high probability of success to find a partner and generate meaningful returns on our invested capital as our targeted licensing partners seek to deploy capital assets and begin taking advantage of our offering for their own commercial advancements. 

&#160; 

Although our technology has commercial applications within many industries, we are focusing our efforts in four areas: water treatment; industrial odor control applications; commercial, household and personal care products (&#8220;CHAPP&#8221;); and &#8220;advanced wound care.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Within these broad categories, we also narrow our product focus to exploit opportunities that we believe are of high-value to potential customers and that present commercially significant opportunities. 

&#160; 

We have a number of examples of strategic alliance or partnering initiatives whereby we are advancing both our science, our patents, our proof of claims, field trials and our commercial opportunities. There are a number of noteworthy examples: 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

The University of Alberta 

&#160; 

We are engaged in a cooperative research relationship with the University of Alberta and its researchers in Edmonton, Canada. The offices and lab of our Canadian subsidiary, and our staff researchers, are located within the University of Alberta research center at Discovery Place. We are able to utilize the extensive resources of the University and its researchers on a contract for hire basis as needed. We work closely with the Department of Agricultural, Food and Nutritional Science at the University of Alberta and its Department of Engineering, and partner with the University professors on government and industry sponsored financial awards and grants to support our ongoing research and development as we refine the AOS Filter in preparation of commercial pilots and commercial designs. Generally, the financial awards take on two common themes: first, science and engineering grants in which the University of Alberta is the primary recipient and contracting party with the grant agency to support work on and around our technology; and second, direct grants in which our Canadian subsidiary is the contracting party to support ongoing science and engineering to advance our AOS Filter towards commercialization, sometimes supporting the work of PhD students at the University. In both cases, the financial awards support much, but not all, of the research budget and related costs. Our research arrangement with the University has three high value propositions for BioLargo: (i) a depth of resources and talent to accomplish highly skilled work, (ii) financial aid to support research and development costs, and (iii) independent and credible validation of our technical claims. Grant revenue totaled $99,122 during the year ended December 31, 2015 

&#160; &#160; 

Clarion Water 

&#160; 

On August 18, 2014, we entered into a manufacturing and distribution license agreement for our Isan&#174; system with Clarion Water, a new operating division of InsulTech Manufacturing, LLC (www.insultech.com ), the latter of which has over 20 years of commercial success around the globe representing hundreds of millions in sales of technical products to Fortune 100 companies. 

&#160; 

Owned in equal parts by BioLargo, Inc. and Peter Holdings, Ltd. through a joint venture agreement, the Isan system leverages the power of iodine to provide the world&#8217;s most effective disinfection dosing systems. It has been referred to as one of the most important technical advancements in food safety in the past 20 years. It won a &#8216;top 50 water company award&#8217; by the Artemis Project in 2010 and a DuPont Innovation Award for its excellence in science and innovation in 2004. 

&#160; &#160; 

The Isan system delivers Iodine as a powerful, broad-spectrum biocide that is a logical replacement for chlorine in applications involving irrigation supply and post-harvest sanitation. Through its automated and precise dosing system, the Isan system can help increase the quality and shelf life of fruits, vegetables, and other produce, is effective against a host of bacteria and fungi, and helps producers conform to increasingly stringent food safety regulations such as the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP), which addresses food safety through the analysis and control of raw material hazards. 

&#160; 

The Isan system has been validated through early stage commercialization and comprehensive testing conducted in Australia and New Zealand. Clarion intends to leverage this early work and focus initial commercialization efforts on the vast opportunities for the technology in improving plant quality and shelf life as well as explore additional opportunities for use in select industrial applications. 

&#160; &#160; 

Per the terms of our license agreement, Clarion receives the exclusive global manufacturing and distribution rights to the Isan system and use of all historical data to support its commercial focus. Clarion will pay BioLargo royalties on revenue equal to 10% paid quarterly in arrears. As we jointly own the Isan System with Peter Holdings, Ltd., all royalties are shared equally with Peter Holdings. There are no minimum royalty payments for the first two years, but at year three (beginning July 1, 2016) the minimum royalties are $50,000 per quarter, at year four $75,000 per quarter, and at year five and onward $100,000 per quarter. The intellectual property subject to the license agreement includes all intellectual property related to the Isan System, including all patents, trademarks, proprietary knowledge, and other similar know-how or rights relating to or arising out of the Isan System or the patents related to the Isan System. The agreement contains other terms and conditions typically found in intellectual property license agreements. 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

BioLargo received a royalty advance of $100,000 upon execution of a letter of intent in February of 2014, which will be applied to royalties received during the first two years of the agreement. Of this advance, $45,000 was paid to Peter Holdings under our joint venture agreement. BioLargo retains certain marketing rights to help develop clients for Clarion. 

&#160; &#160; 

In February of 2015, Clarion Water introduced the new and improved Isan System at the world&#39;s largest agricultural trade show, the World AG Expo, as part of its commercial launch into the U.S. market. 

&#160; 

Since licensing the technology from BioLargo last August, Clarion has completed a comprehensive technical and engineering update to the Isan System, featuring a new automated touch screen user interface, enhanced security, enhanced control features for increased monitoring and sensing, and adding automated functionality providing users unmatched flexibility, reliability and control over this state-of-the-art disinfectant delivery system, and begun commercial trials. In 2015, it filed application with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which application is pending as of the date of this report. 

&#160; 

Downeast Logistics 

&#160; 

In late 2013, we entered into a cooperative selling and distribution agreement with Downeast Logistics, a certified &#8220;Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business&#8221; (SDVOSB), as our distribution partner to facilitate our first order to the US Government. Downeast has been instrumental in developing ongoing sales to the United States Military. We have six products with National Stocking Numbers. In March 2015 we secured a $150,000 &#8220;Indefinite Delivery Purchase Order&#8221; (IDPO) for the purchase of our Specimen Transport Solidifier pouches by the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency (DLA). The purchase order allows the DLA to purchase the product at agreed-upon prices for the following 12 months. In exchange, the company is awarded the contract to be the exclusive supplier of the designated product under the IDPO. During the period of the contract, approximately $30,000 in product was ordered. 

&#160; 

In March 2016 two of our product lines (consisting of 9 SKUs) of Nature&#8217;s Best Science products were awarded a five year U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) supply contract, under schedule 65IIA for medical equipment and supplies. The award opens up access to these products through &#8220;GSA Advantage&#8221;, the online shopping and ordering system that provides government agencies access to thousands of contractors and millions of supplies (products) and services. We intend to apply for inclusion of additional existing and future products into GSA Advantage. 

&#160; 

Downeast Logistics has operated for more than thirteen years, and will continue to offer our products through multiple channels of the US Government. Its designation as a SDVOSB places Downeast Logistics within a group of highly sought after vendors to the US government. Odor-No-More has registered, and is in the process of registering, itself as well as its products with several procurement agencies of the US Government. 

&#160;

Independent Sales Representatives 

&#160; 

We have a number of independent representatives developing selling channels for our odor control products. We are in customer trials for our smoke-odor eliminating products. The response has been excellent and we have received the highest marks for performance that is superior to the competing products. We continue to support these selling efforts with samples, training, selling materials and competitive bulk pricing. While we cannot predict the timing or outcome of these efforts, we are confident in our products&#8217; ability to outperform the competition. 

&#160;

Industrial Odor Control - Cupridyne Clean 

&#160; 

During 2015 we were invited by a number of potential customers to design a product for the industrial odor control industry segment and to begin trials for our &#8220;Cupridyne Clean&#8221; product for use as a cleaning and odor control product in large scale operations. We soon discovered multiple opportunities to serve the waste handling industry, waste-water treatment facilities, waste to energy conversion operations, materials recovery facilities, food processing operations, and livestock production facilities with Cupridyne Clean. We are highly encouraged by this early work, the response from customers and the welcome response from new prospects from industry. Since 2015, we have and continue to refine the product design, its claims and marketing and selling plans. Our product web site can be seen at www.cupridyne.com. Based on our test marketing and trials, we believe that many industries that must contend with odors that include, ammonia, fatty acids, sulfur, or mercaptans are dissatisfied with the current competing odor control products, place a high value on odor control solutions that actually work and are anxious to test and trial new products like our Cupridyne Clean as they search for a solution to these common and troublesome odor problems. We have been told by prospective customers and experts from these markets that effective odor control for these prospective customer groups is in among the top on a list of priorities in their daily operations and their commitment to serve their local communities where they operate. We intend to further develop our products, refine our free trial program that can be combined with a highly motivated customer service and sales program to help break open this market. We plan to attend industry conferences, join trade associations, advertise, and recruit leaders from these industries to help us refine, focus and break through to commercial success. While the success of these efforts cannot be assured, we are confident and highly encouraged to focus and invest time, energy, staff and capital in this area as resources permit. 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Multinationals and Mid-Level Industry Participants 

&#160; 

We began discussions with a number of multi-nationals as well as regional companies in 2014 that are continuing. This list expanded in 2015 and was highlighted by our technical symposium held in August 2015 where we had more than 30 attendees representing industry, academia and funding agencies. We have entered into technical non-disclosure agreements with a wide variety of companies to evaluate our AOS Filter and discuss potential strategic alliances. Many of these continue to monitor our technical progress and have expressed interest in the technology and potential strategic alliances as we finalize our commercially ready design. The claims we have put forth are well received. The focus of discussions in most cases has moved from efficacy, which is accepted, to a business case discussion relative to capital and time to market and the potential return on investment. While these discussions are ongoing, we continue to advance our science and proven claims. We are highly encouraged that our AOS Filter has an important role in commerce. 

&#160; 

We believe there are a number of potential partners interested in working with us to exploit the commercial opportunities associated with the AOS Filter technology. These opportunities are limited by common and obvious limitations, capital, the relative state of development and market readiness and, adoption rates in the marketplace. Given the significant value offerings, namely enhanced performance and lower cost, we believe we will be able to find industry partners to assist in commercialization of the AOS Filter and are committed to pursue success in these markets. 

&#160; 

Commercial, Household and Personal Care Products 

&#160; 

CHAPP includes broad product categories and many opportunities for the application of our technology. It is defined by the ability to utilize similar, if not identical, consumption products in multiple market segments. Detergents, single use absorbents, wipes, products that provide odor or disinfection control, and stain removal all fall within this category. Packaging ranges from consumer sizes of a few ounces to bulk packaging for commercial or industrial use. We are currently marketing products in this category under four brands &#8211; Odor-No-More, Nature&#8217;s Best Solution, Deodorall, and NBS - direct to consumers, through retail stores, and most recently, to the U.S. Government. 

&#160; 

We are continuing our efforts to generate &#8220;private label&#8221; clients. We have fulfilled some small orders for various products that we produced under a third party&#8217;s private brand. We are meeting with new potential customers for private label opportunities. We also are in discussions with potential strategic alliance partners to provide large scale manufacturing and distribution should we secure orders for the private label business opportunities. We have a few opportunities that could expand to become large customers for our company. Success in these markets is highly dependent upon the willingness of the potential partners to invest in product support to continue marketing and expanding customer awareness. 

&#160; 

Our sales in the CHAPP product category are nominal. Product development, sales, and marketing require significant financial resources that we currently do not have. As such, our progress in this area has been slower than we had hoped. We are marketing the technology for licensure to established companies in this industry segment, as the opportunities present themselves through our various independent agents and our key industry contacts, and we are continuing to expand our proof of claims and product designs for various odor and moisture control applications. 

&#160; 

Advanced Wound Care &#8211; Clyra Medical Technologies Subsidiary 

&#160; 

In 2012 we formed a subsidiary Clyra Medical Technologies, Inc. (&#8220;Clyra&#8221;) to commercialize our technology in the medical products industry, with an initial focus on advanced wound care. Our advanced wound care products combine broad-spectrum antimicrobial capabilities with iodine&#8217;s natural and well-understood metabolic pathway to promote healing. Our products are highly differentiated by the gentle nature in which they can perform. We believe these benefits, along with reduced product costs as compared with other antimicrobials, give our products a competitive advantage in the marketplace. 

&#160; &#160; 

In December 2015, we completed a financing transaction through which $750,000 was invested into Clyra in exchange for preferred stock comprising 40% of the total issued and outstanding shares. (See Part II, Item 5, for additional information.) The investor committed to fund a $5,000,000 operating line of credit once Clyra&#8217;s initial products receive FDA approval. (Details regarding this transaction are below.) 

&#160;

With new funding in place, Clyra re-initiated product development and testing for its wound gel and wound cleaner products with experts and well established contract manufacturing companies from industry. It intends to apply for FDA 510(k) approval for these two products to be sold into the advanced wound care industry. While no assurances can be made about the ultimate success any FDA applications once filed, given the forward looking nature of such events, Clyra has retained and engaged a team of experts in the area to guide it through the process. Given the timing of the FDA process, and the requirement for approval before product can be sold, we do not anticipate product sales until 2017. In the interim, we will continue to refine our products, their roll out, marketing, and distribution plans. A U.S. patent was recently issued for these products under development and we intend to continue expanding patent coverage as we refine our products, as available. We are also evaluating potential product designs where our current product designs can be used or slightly modified/ enhanced to create new products for new medial related markets like dental, veterinary medicine, over the counter applications and the like. 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

Stock Purchase Agreement &#8211; Clyra Medical 

&#160; 

On December 30, 2015, Clyra sold 9,830 shares of its Series A Preferred Stock (&#8220;Preferred Shares&#8221;) to Sanatio Capital, LLC (&#8220;Sanatio&#8221;) for $750,000. Sanatio is beneficially owned by Jack B. Strommen. This sale was made in reliance on the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(2) of the Securities Exchange Act and Regulation D promulgated thereunder as not involving a public offering of securities. As a result of the sale, Sanatio owns 40% of Clyra&#8217;s issued and outstanding shares, BioLargo owns 54%, and the remainder is owned by management. 

&#160;

As set forth in Clyra&#8217;s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, Preferred Shares accrue an annual dividend of 8% for a period of five years. Although the dividends begin to accrue immediately, Clyra has no obligation to declare a dividend until a product of the company has received a premarket approval by the United States Federal Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;), or for which a premarket notification pursuant to form 510(k) has been submitted and for which the FDA has given written clearance to market the product in the United States (either, &#8220;FDA Approval&#8221;). After FDA Approval, annually on December 20, and unless prohibited by California law governing distributions to shareholders, Clyra is required to declare and pay any accruing dividends to holders of Preferred Shares then accrued but unpaid. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Holders of Preferred Shares are entitled to preferential payments in the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the company, in an amount equal to any accrued and unpaid dividends. After such preference, any remaining assets are distributed pro-rata between holders of Clyra common stock and Preferred Shares as if the Preferred Shares had converted to common stock. Holders of Preferred Shares may convert the shares to common stock initially on a one-to-one basis. The conversion formula is subject to change in the event Clyra sells stock at a lower price than the price paid by Sanatio. 

&#160; 

In addition to the $750,000 investment, once Clyra receives FDA Approval for a product, Sanatio has agreed to provide Clyra a $5,000,000 credit facility for operating, warehouse, inventory and costs necessary to rapidly expand sales (&#8220;Line of Credit&#8221;). Terms of the Line of Credit are to be negotiated in good faith, be commercially reasonable and mutually agreeable to the parties. Should Sanatio fail to provide the Line of Credit, BioLargo has the right to do so under similar terms and conditions offered to Sanatio, and neither Clyra nor any of its shareholders, affiliates, successors or assigns will have any recourse or remedies against Sanatio for failing to provide the line of credit. If either BioLargo or entity not affiliated with Sanatio provides the Line of Credit (either directly, through an affiliate, or third party), Clyra shall issue such lender a warrant to purchase an amount of Clyra common stock equal to 10% of Clyra&#39;s capital stock on a fully-diluted basis, at an exercise price equal to the fair market value of Clyra&#8217;s common stock on the date of issuance, as determined by its board of directors in good faith. 

&#160; 

Clyra Shareholder Agreement 

&#160; 

BioLargo, Santatio, and other Clyra shareholders entered into an agreement whereby the parties agreed to elect a three-member board of directors, consisting of Clyra&#8217;s president, BioLargo&#8217;s president, and a Sanatio representative, who shall initially be Mr. Strommen. The shareholders also agreed to restrict the sale of any stock in the company unless all holders of Preferred Shares are allowed to participate in such transaction and the consideration received pursuant to such transaction is allocated among the parties thereto in the manner specified in its articles of incorporation in effect immediately prior to the sale. 

&#160; 

Amendment to Clyra License Agreement 

&#160; 

By agreement dated December 30, 2015, BioLargo and Clyra amended (the &#8220;Amendment&#8221;) the December 17, 2012 License Agreement (&#8220;License Agreement&#8221;) by which BioLargo licensed to Clyra the exclusive world-wide right to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, and import products for use within the field of human wound care (as defined in the agreement), expandable to include other medical products. The Amendment changes the events that trigger Clyra&#8217;s obligation to begin the $50,000 monthly &#8220;initial license fee&#8221; payments such that no such payments are due until both (i) a Clyra product has received FDA approval and (ii) the company has generated $4,000,000 in gross annual revenue. Additionally, the Amendment updated the licensed patents to include recently issued European patents, confirmed that the Sanatio investment transaction wasn&#8217;t a &#8220;default&#8221; under the License Agreement, and that Sanatio was made an express third party beneficiary of the agreement. 

&#160; 

Investors&#8217; Rights Agreement 

&#160; 

BioLargo entered into an &#8220;investors&#8217; rights agreements&#8221; with Sanatio and Strommen whereby BioLargo committed to file a Form S-1 or S-3 registration statement by September 15, 2016 for all registrable securities issued to investors in connection with BioLargo&#8217;s 2015 Unit Offering, and an additional 1,000,000 shares of BioLargo common stock that may be issued to Sanatio or Strommen in the future. The agreement also provides Sanatio and Strommen &#8220;piggy back&#8221; registration rights. 

&#160; 

Additionally, BioLargo granted to Strommen a &#8220;right of first refusal&#8221; to purchase its holdings in Clyra should it choose to sell those holdings, and a right of &#8220;co-sale&#8221; in the event such shares are sold to a third party. 

&#160; 

Strommen Consulting Agreement 

&#160; 

In addition to the foregoing, Clyra entered into a consulting agreement with Beach House Consulting, LLC, through which Jack B. Strommen will be providing consulting services to the company. Mr. Strommen is a founder and leader of PD Instore (www.pdinstore.com), works with some of the world&#8217;s leading retailers, and has overseen many national ground-breaking marketing rollouts and initiatives. Mr. Strommen will be assisting the company in its sales and marketing activities once it has FDA Approval on a product, at which point the agreement provides that Mr. Strommen is to receive $23,437.50 per month for a period of four years. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

We regard our intellectual property as critical to our ultimate success. Our goal is to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our products and technologies in geographic areas of commercial interest, and to protect our trade secrets and proprietary information through laws and contractual arrangements. 

&#160; 

Our Chief Science Officer, Mr. Kenneth R. Code, has been involved in the research and development of the BioLargo technology since 1997. He has participated in the Canadian Federal Scientific Research and Experimental Development program and he was instrumental in the discovery, preparation and filing of the first BioLargo technology patents. He has worked with manufacturers, distributors and suppliers in a wide variety of industries to gain a full appreciation of the potential applications and the methodologies applicable to our BioLargo technology for their manufacture and performance. He continues to research methods and applications to continue to expand the potential uses of our BioLargo technology as well as work to uncover new discoveries that may provide addition commercial applications to help solve real world problems in the field of disinfection. 

&#160; 

In 2014 and 2015, we continued improving our technology and creating new uses of our technology through further research and development efforts. During that time, we filed two U.S. patent applications, each comprised of multiple individual claims, and received notice of allowance or were granted five patents by the USPTO. Our technology also includes know-how and trade secrets, which, together with our intellectual property, contribute to our expertise in product design, manufacturing, product claims, safety features and competitive positioning of products that feature our BioLargo technology. 

&#160; 

During 2016 we plan to continue to advance our proof of claims, inventions and patent filings. 

&#160; 

We incurred $642,923 in 2014 and $684,554 in 2015 in expense related to our research and development activities. Our research and development expenditures over the next 12 months could vary significantly and will depend upon our access to capital. Although we are actively pursuing such financing, no such commitment is yet in place. We would invest any such funds primarily on continued testing of our BioLargo technology in certain applications and the development of additional production methods for use of our BioLargo technology in certain applications. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

We believe that our suite of intellectual property covers the presently targeted major areas of focus for our licensing strategy. The description of our intellectual property, as present, is as follows: 

&#160; &#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

Pending Patent Applications 

&#160; &#160;

In addition to these applications, we have filed patent applications in multiple foreign countries, including the European Union, pursuant to the PCT, and other provisional applications. Subject to adequate financing, we intend to continue to expand and enhance our suite of intellectual property through ongoing focus on product development, new intellectual property development and patent applications, and further third-party testing and validations for specific areas of focus for commercial exploitation. We currently anticipate that additional patent applications will be filed during the next 12 months with the USPTO and the PCT, although we are uncertain of the cost of such patent filings, which will depend upon the number of such applications prepared and filed. The expense associated with seeking patent rights in multiple foreign countries is expensive, and will require substantial ongoing capital resources. However we cannot give any assurance that adequate capital will be available. Without adequate capital resources, we will be forced to abandon patent applications and irrevocably lose rights to our technologies.
