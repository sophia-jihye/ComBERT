 ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; Overview 

&#160; NuZee Inc. is the operating company that manages a portfolio of branded consumer packaged goods. The Company was incorporated in July 2011 as Havana Furnishings, Inc. (&#8220;Havana&#8221;) under the laws of the State of Nevada. From the date of incorporation through April 2013, the Company was a development stage company engaged in the business of selling public restaurant and bar furnishings and accessories from Asia to retailer customers at wholesale prices on the internet. In April 2013, the Company's sole officer decided that it was not economically feasible to continue with the Company&#8217;s business plan and began to seek other companies for potential merger. 

&#160;

On April 19, 2013, the Company completed a merger with NuZee Co., Ltd. a California corporation (&#8220;NuZee-CA&#8221;) wherein NuZee Co., Ltd. became a wholly owned subsidiary of Havana. Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, each of the 33,733,333 outstanding shares of NuZee-CA common stock was converted into one share of the Company&#8217;s common stock. In addition, upon the closing of the Merger, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to change its name from Havana Furnishings, Inc. to NuZee, Inc. NuZee-CA was established in 2011 as an importer and distributor of natural spring water and skincare products as well as energy drinks. 

&#160;

Up until September 30, 2013, our primary business was the distribution of natural and organic products produced by 3 rd parties. These legacy product lines which included New Zealand bottled spring water, natural and organic skincare from New Zealand as well as the Torque TM energy drinks were phased out and/or discontinued in 2014 as the Company believed its best near and long term success was to focus resources on our own product line of functional beverages which will enable the Company to control, develop, manufacture and promote its brands from the United States. 

&#160;

During the 2013 fiscal year we began researching and investigating the viability of a new product platform for functional beverages, and started producing our first family of functional beverages in early 2014. These products are considered healthy alternatives, with all natural ingredients and provide an added wellness benefit when compared to the traditional non-fortified version of the same beverage. 

As a result, NuZee mission is to be a good-for-you company focused on building beverage brands that offer functional and nutritional benefits. 

Our operational approach has and will remain to develop and manufacture our products under strict guidelines for good manufacturing and food safety practices before releasing our products to the market. We own our formulas and work with experts in beverage, nutrition and flavoring sciences to ensure our products not only taste delicious but are also good-for-you using quality and natural ingredients with proven clinical research to support the functional efficacy. We are using multiple manufacturing partners, known in the industry as co-packers, to scale our manufacturing capabilities. 

We sell our products directly to consumers through our website portal (in final development) as well as through affiliate online stores and retailers. 

Market Opportunity 

As an emerging company in the functional beverage sector we are participating in a large growing market with historical sales of more than $16 billion with anticipated growth of 3% per year through 2016 according to research by Datamonitor. NuZee&#8217;s products fall within the nutraceutical drink portion of the functional beverage market which accounts for approximately 6% or $1 billion in the United States annually.

Principal Products 

After careful study and research conducted in 2014 the Company determined its first functional beverage will be a line of single-serve gourmet coffees. Our decision was based on numerous factors including the market for coffee and its continued growth, the ability to serve a cup of coffee quickly and conveniently as well as the ability for precise dosage of our active ingredients in pre-portioned packs. Our knowhow is tied to our formula, process and use of natural flavoring to mask the undesired off-notes produced by the added functional ingredient(s) such that the original beverage is preserved and there are no deficiencies in the taste and aroma profile. We also started our Lotus Cup line, which is a gourmet pour-over coffee. The name changed from Lotus Cup to Drip Cup in 2015, with our first cup being the Nude Cup Gourmet pour-Over. We have now extended the Drip Cup line to also include the functional varietals: Lean, Think and Relax Cup.

&#160;

The Company made Coffee Blenders TM available in the first quarter of 2014. We believe Coffee Blenders to be the first line of gourmet specialty grade coffee offered in convenient K-Cups using only natural ingredients with clinically supported branded nutraceuticals. In 2015, the Drip Cup emerged and quickly gained popularity within the coffee industry. 

&#160;

Each Coffee Blenders K-cup and Drip Cup will include a total of 11 grams of coffee plus natural ingredients and come in retail packaging of 10 K-Cup packs and/or Drip Cup pouches per box. 

&#160;

The single serve cups are compatible with Keurig K-Cup brewers and systems. Keurig is owned by Green Mountain Coffee Rosters (NASDAQ: GMCR). A key consideration in launching Coffee Blenders in K-Cup formats was due to the patent protection surrounding the K-Cups expiring in late 2012. This enables 3rd party companies to produce K-Cup compatible packs for an existing installed base of brewers totaling more than 16 million units according to GMCR company filings and reports. 

&#160;

We initially launched three functional varieties called Lean (for weight loss), Think (for cognitive performance) and Relax (for stress reduction). We have now launched four more products, growing our Coffee Blenders product family to a total of seven products. The current family of products all utilize GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe) ingredients that are also supported by clinical studies using the exact strengthen and dosage recommended by our ingredient partner&#8217;s claims and research. Based on market feedback we anticipate introducing another set of functions in the second half of 2016. 

Our Strategy 

Our objective is to be a profitable, leading provider of functional beverages and gourmet pour-over coffees. Elements of our business strategy for 2016 include: 

&#160;

Secure additional working capital to support growth and development of NuZee, Inc. sales and support operations Build onto our existing product and brand awareness through marketing and communication programs Build an enthusiast and loyal base of consumers for Coffee Blenders Expand family of functional coffees to include new functions and flavors Expand distribution across retail, online and affiliate channels Contract with multiple manufacturing partners to scale production as required Work alongside with other roasters, nation wide, and co-pack their roasts into our Drip Cups Build portfolio of formulas for functional beverages Explore new beverage platforms beyond coffee, we are looking at a tea line specifically 9

&#160;

Customers 

Our customers range from B2B multi-store retail chains to wholesale distributors that deliver to both chain and independent stores regionally. We also sell to office and home delivery services that deliver coffee and water to homes and businesses locally. Another portion of our business is online sales through our own B2C site through organic as well as paid marketing campaigns through our affiliate network along with sales stemming from online retail accounts like Amazon.com 

Sales 

In 2015 Coffee Blenders secured a vendor number with Safeway Eastern and also signed a contract with Club Marketing, which deals with some of the nations largest retail chains. In addition, our product SKU&#8217;s were approved and setup by KeHE and we have also emerged into the Korean market for our Drip Cup line. 

As an emerging consumer brand that has been on the market for over a year we believe that a significant amount of capital will be required to generate additional sales and help support the current accounts that we currently have. Our sales approach will be implemented in 4 stages: 

1. Build Awareness and Consideration 

2. Generate Trial 

3. Drive Initial Sales 

4. Drive Repeat Sales 

&#160;

We anticipate the need to spend more than one million in brand marketing, sampling and test advertising (stages #1 and #2) in 2016. We will use what we learn from our advertising campaigns to determine the optimal cost of acquisition in order to scale the business appropriately. Our main focus for 2016 will be reaching out to key accounts through national and regional trade shows to acquire new B2B commercial business. We also plan to implement an inside sales force to incubate and curate new accounts. We plan to expand our affiliate network and online advertising as well as cross promoting via social media to drive our B2C sales through our www.coffeeblenders.com domain. 

&#160;

At this time most of the products sold will be under the &#8220;Coffee Blenders&#8221; and &#8220;NuZee&#8221; trademarks. We are currently working to expand our production capabilities at our headquarters facility in Vista, CA to attract other companies that are interested in producing similar products to produce at our facility. Our co-packing service is intended to increase market awareness and to help positon our company as the leader in the U.S. for the pour over drip pouch coffee market. 

&#160;

&#160;

Manufacturing 

We have a primary manufacturing facility in Vista, California located at 2865 Scott St Suite 101 used for the production of our Drip Cup line. 

&#160;

We also partner with three third party manufacturers to manufacture finished products. We have agreements in place with suppliers and partners for all components required to deliver a finished Coffee Blenders product. Currently, the Company has not made any long-term commitments to any suppliers or production partners that will burden or impair the Company&#8217;s ability to operate. 

&#160;

We currently purchase our nutraceuticals, Svetol (green coffee bean extract) and Cereboost (American Ginseng extract), from Naturex, Inc. (&#8220;Naturex&#8221;) Pursuant to license agreements with Naturex, in order to maintain our license, we are required to purchase an annual minimum amount of product. 

&#160;

We purchase coffee from Intazza located in Murietta, California on a purchase order basis. 

&#160;

All of the raw products (ground coffee and nutraceuticals) are sent to Global Health Trax (&#8220;GHT&#8221;) for mixing into our proprietary blends. We do not have a written agreement with GHT. Rather, all services performed by GHT are on a purchase order basis. After GHT mixes our coffees, the final product is shipped to our co-packer Intelligent Blends, or our other co-packer Cafejo, for packaging into single-serving containers commonly known as &#8220;K cups&#8221; and boxed for retail sales. 

&#160;

GHT also ships the blended coffee to our location for packing into our new proprietary single serve consumer product: Drip Cup. 

&#160;

Purchasing of packaging material is well diversified among three separate suppliers: Fleetwood Fibre, Landsberg and Peak Packaging. We conduct business with these vendors on a purchase order basis. 

&#160;

Machinery for production at our Vista location comes from some of the most respected vendors in the industry: Air compression equipment comes from Kaeser Compressor, manufactured in Germany with a local sales and support office in Los Angeles. Nitrogen generation equipment is manufactured by On-Site Gas Systems, and our Drip Cup production happens on the leading Japanese manufacturer of package in package machines from NASA Corporation. Nitrogen and air compression machinery is capable of handling expansion as the company expands as well to minimize any ongoing capital expenditures for machinery. 

Research and Development 

&#160;

We focus our research and development efforts on developing innovative functional beverages that not only taste delicious but also include a health-wellness benefit. 

&#160;

Over the course of the last fiscal year NuZee has maintained a modest R&#38;D budget. With the advent of the functional beverage focus the Company plans to invest more to secure unique flavor and formula profiles but anticipates the out of pocket expense will not be significant as the Company has agreements with flavor and formula design partners to waive development fees in exchange for purchasing the flavorings and ingredients. The Company has contracted products from Blue California and Naturex (Paris Stock Exchange: NRX) both global natural specialty ingredient suppliers who are providing assistance in ingredient identification, testing, marketing support, and clinical studies to accelerate our development efforts. 

&#160;

In 2013, our product development initiatives included: 

&#160;

$15,000 developing a raw ingredient selection, blending and flavoring for Coffee Blenders; 

&#160;

&#160;

For 2014, our research and development initiatives were concentrated on the following projects: 

Continued development of our Coffee Blenders series with new functions and ingredients. Research of instant coffee with micro-grounds for stick packs. Development of functional beverages beyond coffee such as teas or hot chocolate &#160;

For 2015, our research and development initiatives include: 

Functional coffee beverages Drip Cup coffees &#160;

For 2016, our research and development initiatives will be concentrated on the following : 

1. &#160; Drip Cup coffee on sales and marketing extension 

2. &#160; Other functional beverages within the K-Cup industry 

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

In 2013 and 2014, NuZee filed for trademark registrations in the United States on several marks it intends to use in the beverage industry and is in the process of submitting additional related trademark applications. To date, the trademark, &#8220;Coffee Blenders,&#8221; has been registered. The Company intends to continue growing its trademark portfolio in the United States with other related slogans and brands as those products come closer to launch. The Company further intends to expand its brand protections outside of the United States in line with its prospective international growth. 

NuZee intends to aggressively protect, police and assert its intellectual property rights, including product designs, proprietary product research and concepts as well as its trademark portfolio. Although asserting NuZee&#8217;s rights may result in a substantial cost to the Company, NuZee&#8217;s management strongly believes that the protection of our intellectual property rights is a key component of our operating strategy. As a result of our company&#8217;s continuing R&#38;D efforts, the Company may decide to seek additional protection, if applicable, relating to its formulas, process know-how and proprietary flavors. 

In exiting the Torque energy supplement product businesses NuZee plans to cease using and may abandon its registered TORQ and TORQ WRENCH trademarks acquired from the HydroPouch Corporation. The Company also plans to not pursue or contest the use of NuZee as a product brand in association with water and skincare product as we exit those businesses. 

Competition 

The beverage industry in general and the coffee sector in particular is extremely competitive. The principal areas of competition include pricing, packaging, development of new products and flavors, and marketing campaigns. Our Coffee Blenders product is competing directly with Green Mountain brands and licensed brands as well as 3 rd party coffees in K-Cups&#174;. While there are more than 200 varieties of K-Cup coffees to choose from there are few, if any functional coffees dedicated to weight-loss, stress reduction or cognitive performance. Green Mountain brands have enjoyed broad, well-established national distribution through well-funded advertising, and product awareness. In addition, companies and brands manufacturing these products generally have far greater financial, marketing, and distribution resources than we do. 

Important factors that will affect our ability to compete successfully include taste and functional delivery of our product, trade and consumer promotions, the development of new, unique functions in new and various packaging formats, attractive and unique promotions, branded product advertising, pricing, and the success of our distribution network. 

&#160;

We will also be competing to secure distributors who will agree to market our product over those of our competitors, provide stable and reliable distribution, and secure adequate shelf space in retail outlets and search placement in online stores. 

Our Coffee Blender product will compete generally with all hot liquid refreshments, including specialty coffees and teas as well as nutraceutical beverages such as BulletProof Coffee, Green Mountain Wellness Coffee, Organo Gold Herbal Coffee, Nuvia Trim Coffee, South Beach Java, Javita, and NatureGift Instant Coffee as well as the natural ingredients found in pills and powders. 

As a result, we continue to look for significant niche markets where our close attention to customer requirements and superior performance are valued. 

Employees 

As of September 30, 2015, we had a total of 3 full-time employees. All employees are located in San Diego. 

At September 30, 2015, we had a total of two consultants, one performing management support and financial/accounting support. 

&#160;

Our operations are overseen directly by management that engages our employees to carry on our business. Our management oversees all responsibilities in the areas of corporate administration, product development, marketing, and research. We intend to expand our current management to retain other skilled directors, officers, and employees with experience relevant to our business focus. Our management&#8217;s relationships will provide the foundation through which we expect to grow our business in the future. We believe that the skill-set of our core management team will be a primary asset in the development of our brands and trademarks. 

We have never had a work stoppage, and none of our employees are represented by a labor organization or under any collective bargaining arrangements. We believe our relationships with our employees are good.
