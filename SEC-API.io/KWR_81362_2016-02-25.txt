 Item 1. Business. 

General Description 

Quaker develops, produces, and markets a broad range of formulated chemical specialty products and offers chemical management services (&#8220;CMS&#8221;) for various heavy industrial and manufacturing applications in a global portfolio throughout its four regions: the North America region, the Europe, Middle East and Africa (&#8220;EMEA&#8221;) region, the Asia/Pacific region and the South America region. The principal products and services in Quaker&#8217;s global portfolio include: (i) rolling lubricants (used by manufacturers of steel in the hot and cold rolling of steel and by manufacturers of aluminum in the hot rolling of aluminum); (ii) corrosion preventives (used by steel and metalworking customers to protect metal during manufacture, storage, and shipment); (iii) metal finishing compounds (used to prepare metal surfaces for special treatments such as galvanizing and tin plating and to prepare metal for further processing); (iv) machining and grinding compounds (used by metalworking customers in cutting, shaping, and grinding metal parts which require special treatment to enable them to tolerate the manufacturing process, achieve closer tolerance, and improve tool life); (v) forming compounds (used to facilitate the drawing and extrusion of metal products); (vi) bio-lubricants (mainly used in machinery in the forestry and construction industries); (vii) hydraulic fluids (used by steel, metalworking, and other customers to operate hydraulic equipment); (viii) chemical milling maskants for the aerospace industry; (ix) temporary and permanent coatings for metal and concrete products; (x) construction products, such as flexible sealants and protective coatings, for various applications; (xi) specialty greases; (xii) die casting lubricants; and (xiii) programs to provide CMS. Individual product lines representing more than 10% of consolidated revenues for any of the past three years are as follows:

A substantial portion of Quaker&#8217;s sales worldwide are made directly through its own employees and its CMS programs with the balance being handled through distributors and agents. Quaker employees visit the plants of customers regularly, actually work on site, and, through training and experience, identify production needs which can be resolved or alleviated either by adapting Quaker&#8217;s existing products or by applying new formulations developed in Quaker&#8217;s laboratories. Quaker relies less on the use of advertising, and more heavily upon its reputation in the markets which it serves. Generally, separate manufacturing facilities of a single customer are served by different personnel. 

As part of the Company&#8217;s CMS, certain third-party product sales to customers are managed by the Company. Where the Company acts as principal, revenues are recognized on a gross reporting basis at the selling price negotiated with its customers. Where the Company acts as an agent, such revenue is recorded using the net reporting method as service revenues at the amount of the administrative fee earned by the Company for ordering the goods. Third-party products transferred under arrangements resulting in net reporting revenue totaled $48.6 million, $46.8 million and $41.6 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 

The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the terms of the underlying agreements, when title and risk of loss have been transferred, when collectability is reasonably assured, and when pricing is fixed or determinable. This generally occurs for product sales when products are shipped to customers; for consignment-type arrangements, upon usage by the customer; and for services, when they are performed. Related to other income generation, Quaker receives license fees and royalties and includes them in other income when the amounts are recognized in accordance with their agreed-upon terms, when performance obligations are satisfied, when the amount is fixed or determinable, and when collectability is reasonably assured. 

During 2015, the Company expanded its business through the July 2015 acquisition of Verkol S.A. (&#8220;Verkol&#8221;) for approximately $26.0 million, net of cash acquired and a post-closing adjustment settled in January 2016. Verkol is a leading specialty grease and other lubricants manufacturer based in northern Spain. Verkol is a market leader with world-class grease manufacturing capabilities and state-of-the-art research and development facilities, selling products into industrial end markets with a particular strength serving the steel industry. Also, Verkol brings a unique technology in continuous casting products that will provide the Company with cross-selling opportunities to its global steel customer base. 

Competition 

The chemical specialty industry comprises a number of companies of similar size as well as companies larger and smaller than Quaker. Quaker cannot readily determine its precise position in every industry it serves. Based on information available to Quaker, however, it is estimated that Quaker holds a leading global position (among a group in excess of 25 other suppliers) in the market for process fluids to produce sheet steel. It is also believed that Quaker holds significant global positions in the markets for process fluids in portions of the automotive and industrial markets. The offerings of many of our competitors differ from those of Quaker; some offer a broad portfolio of fluids, including general lubricants, while others have a more specialized product range. All competitors 

&#160; 

provide different levels of technical services to individual customers. Competition in the industry is based primarily on the ability to provide products that meet the needs of the customer, render technical services and laboratory assistance to the customer and, to a lesser extent, on price. 

Major Customers and Markets 

In 2015, Quaker&#8217;s five largest customers (each composed of multiple subsidiaries or divisions with semi-autonomous purchasing authority) accounted for approximately 18% of our consolidated net sales, with the largest customer (Arcelor-Mittal Group) accounting for approximately 8% of our consolidated net sales. A significant portion of Quaker&#8217;s revenues are realized from the sale of process fluids and services to manufacturers of steel, automobiles, aircraft, appliances, and durable goods, and, therefore, Quaker is subject to the same business cycles as those experienced by these manufacturers and their customers. Quaker&#8217;s financial performance is generally correlated to the volume of global production within the industries it serves, rather than discretely related to financial performance in such industries. Furthermore, steel customers typically have limited manufacturing locations compared to metalworking customers and generally use higher volumes of products at a single location. 

Raw Materials 

Quaker uses over 1,000 various raw materials including mineral oils and derivatives, animal fats and derivatives, vegetable oils and derivatives, ethylene derivatives, solvents, surface active agents, and a wide variety of other organic and inorganic compounds. In 2015, three raw material groups (mineral oils and derivatives, animal fats and derivatives, and vegetable oils and derivatives) each accounted for approximately 10% or more of the total cost of Quaker&#8217;s raw material purchases. The price of mineral oil and its derivatives can be affected by the price of crude oil and industry refining capacity. In addition, animal fat and vegetable oil prices are impacted by biodiesel consumption which is affected by the price of crude oil. Accordingly, significant fluctuations in the price of crude oil could have a material effect upon certain products used in the Company&#8217;s business. Many of the raw materials used by Quaker are &#8220;commodity&#8221; chemicals which can have volatile prices. Accordingly, Quaker&#8217;s earnings could be affected by market changes in raw material prices. Reference is made to the disclosure contained in Item 7A of this Report. 

Patents and Trademarks 

Quaker has a limited number of patents and patent applications, including patents issued, applied for, or acquired in the United States and in various foreign countries, some of which may prove to be material to its business. Principal reliance is placed upon Quaker&#8217;s proprietary formulae and the application of its skills and experience to meet customer needs. Quaker&#8217;s products are identified by trademarks that are registered throughout its marketed area. 

Research and Development&#8212;Laboratories 

Quaker&#8217;s research and development laboratories are directed primarily toward applied research and development since the nature of Quaker&#8217;s business requires continual modification and improvement of formulations to provide chemical specialties to satisfy customer requirements. Quaker maintains quality control laboratory facilities in each of its manufacturing locations. In addition, Quaker maintains facilities in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania; Santa Fe Springs, California; Batavia, New York; Aurora, Illinois; Dayton, Ohio; Uithoorn, The Netherlands; Karlshamn, Sweden; Navarra, Spain; Rio de Janiero, Brazil; and Qingpu, China that, in addition to quality control, are devoted primarily to applied research and development. 

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses during 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $22.1 million, $22.1 million and $21.6 million, respectively. 

Most of Quaker&#8217;s subsidiaries and associated companies also have laboratory facilities. Although not as complete as the laboratories mentioned above, these facilities are generally sufficient for the requirements of the customers being served. If problems are encountered which cannot be resolved by local laboratories, such problems are generally referred to the laboratory staff in Conshohocken, Santa Fe Springs, Uithoorn or Qingpu. 

Regulatory Matters 

In order to facilitate compliance with applicable federal, state, and local statutes and regulations relating to occupational health and safety and protection of the environment, the Company has an ongoing program of site assessment for the purpose of identifying capital expenditures or other actions that may be necessary to comply with such requirements. The program includes periodic inspections of each facility by Quaker and/or independent experts, as well as ongoing inspections and training by on-site personnel. Such inspections address operational matters, record keeping, reporting requirements and capital improvements. Capital expenditures directed solely or primarily to regulatory compliance amounted to approximately $2.3 million, $0.8 million and $0.6 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In 2016, the Company expects to incur approximately $2.1 million for capital expenditures directed primarily to regulatory compliance. 

Number of Employees 

On December 31, 2015, Quaker&#8217;s consolidated companies had approximately 2,040 full-time employees of whom approximately 630 were employed by the parent company and its U.S. subsidiaries and approximately 1,410 were employed by its non-U.S. subsidiaries. Associated companies of Quaker (in which it owns less than 50% and has significant influence) employed approximately 70 people on December 31, 2015. 

&#160; 

Company Segmentation 

The Company&#8217;s reportable operating segments evidence the structure of the Company&#8217;s internal organization, the method by which the Company&#8217;s resources are allocated and the manner by which the Company assesses its performance. The Company&#8217;s reportable operating segments are organized by geography as follows: North America, EMEA, Asia/Pacific and South America. See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. 

Non-U.S. Activities 

Since significant revenues and earnings are generated by non-U.S. operations, Quaker&#8217;s financial results are affected by currency fluctuations, particularly between the U.S. dollar and the euro, the Brazilian real, the Mexican peso, the Chinese renminbi and the Indian rupee, and the impact of those currency fluctuations on the underlying economies. Incorporated by reference is (i) the foreign exchange risk information contained in Item 7A of this Report, (ii) the geographic information in Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report and (iii) information regarding risks attendant to foreign operations included in Item 1A of this Report.

Factors that May Affect Our Future Results 

(Cautionary Statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) 

Certain information included in this Report and other materials filed or to be filed by Quaker with the SEC (as well as information included in oral statements or other written statements made or to be made by us) contain or may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations about future events. These forward-looking statements include statements with respect to our beliefs, plans, objectives, goals, expectations, anticipations, intentions, financial condition, results of operations, future performance, and business, including: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

&#160; 

statements relating to our business strategy; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

&#160; 

our current and future results and plans; and 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

&#160; 

statements that include the words &#8220;may,&#8221; &#8220;could,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;would,&#8221; &#8220;believe,&#8221; &#8220;expect,&#8221; &#8220;anticipate,&#8221; &#8220;estimate,&#8221; &#8220;intend,&#8221; &#8220;plan&#8221; or similar expressions. 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

Such statements include information relating to current and future business activities, operational matters, capital spending, and financing sources. From time to time, oral or written forward-looking statements are also included in Quaker&#8217;s periodic reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, press releases, and other materials released to, or statements made to, the public. 

Any or all of the forward-looking statements in this Report, in Quaker&#8217;s Annual Report to Shareholders for 2015 and in any other public statements we make may turn out to be wrong. This can occur as a result of inaccurate assumptions or as a consequence of known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors discussed in this Report will be important in determining our future performance. Consequently, actual results may differ materially from those that might be anticipated from our forward-looking statements. 

We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. However, any further disclosures made on related subjects in Quaker&#8217;s subsequent reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K and other related filings should be consulted. Our forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions about us and our operations that are subject to change based on various important factors, some of which are beyond our control. A major risk is that the demand for the Company&#8217;s products and services is largely derived from the demand for its customers&#8217; products, which subjects the Company to uncertainties related to downturns in a customer&#8217;s business and unanticipated customer production shutdowns. Other major risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, significant increases in raw material costs, customer financial stability, worldwide economic and political conditions, foreign currency fluctuations, future terrorist attacks and other acts of violence, each of which is discussed in greater detail in Item 1A of this Report. Furthermore, the Company is subject to the same business cycles as those experienced by steel, automobile, aircraft, appliance, and durable goods manufacturers. These risks, uncertainties, and possible inaccurate assumptions relevant to our business could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results. Other factors beyond those discussed in this Report could also adversely affect us. Therefore, we caution you not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. This discussion is provided as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
