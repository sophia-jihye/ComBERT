&#160; 

Middlefield Banc Corp . Incorporated in 1988 under the Ohio General Corporation Law, Middlefield Banc Corp. (&#8220;Company&#8221;) is a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. The Company&#8217;s subsidiaries are: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

1. 

The Middlefield Banking Company (&#8220;MBC&#8221;), an Ohio-chartered commercial bank that began operations in 1901. MBC engages in a general commercial banking business in northeastern and central Ohio. The principal executive office is located at 15985 East High Street, Middlefield, Ohio 44062-0035, and its telephone number is (440) 632-1666. 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 2. EMORECO Inc., an Ohio asset resolution corporation headquartered in Middlefield, Ohio. EMORECO engages in the resolution and disposition of troubled assets in central Ohio. The principal executive office is located at 15985 East High Street, Middlefield, Ohio 44062-0035, and its telephone number is (440) 632-1666. &#160;

The Middlefield Banking Company MBC was chartered under Ohio law in 1901. MBC offers customers a broad range of banking services including checking, savings, negotiable order of withdrawal (&#8220;NOW&#8221;) accounts, money market accounts, time certificates of deposit, commercial loans, real estate loans, a variety of consumer loans, safe deposit facilities, and travelers&#8217; checks. MBC offers online banking and bill payment services to individuals and online cash management services to business customers through its website at www.middlefieldbank.com. 

&#160; 

Engaged in general commercial banking in northeastern and central Ohio, MBC offers these services principally to small and medium-sized businesses, professionals, small business owners, and retail customers. MBC has developed a marketing program to attract and retain consumer accounts and to match banking services and facilities with the needs of customers. 

&#160; 

MBC&#8217;s loan products include operational and working capital loans, loans to finance capital purchases, term business loans, residential construction loans, selected guaranteed or subsidized loan programs for small businesses, professional loans, residential and mortgage loans, and consumer installment loans to purchase automobiles, boats, make home improvements, and other personal expenditures. Although the bank makes agricultural loans, it currently has no significant agricultural loans. 

&#160; 

EMORECO Organized in 2009 as an Ohio corporation under the name EMORECO, Inc. and wholly owned by the Company, the purpose of the asset resolution subsidiary is to maintain, manage, and dispose of nonperforming loans and other real estate owned (&#8220;OREO&#8221;) acquired by the subsidiary bank as the result of borrower default on real estate-secured loans. At December 31, 2015, EMORECO&#8217;s assets consist of one nonperforming loan and five OR EO properties. According to Federal law governing bank holding companies, the real estate must be disposed of within two years of acquisition, although limited extensions may be granted by the Federal Reserve Bank. Per federal law, a holding company subsidiary has limited real estate investment powers. EMORECO may only manage and maintain property and may not improve or develop property without advance approval of the Federal Reserve Bank. 

&#160; 

Market Area MBC&#8217;s market area in northeastern Ohio consists principally of Geauga, Portage, Lake, Trumbull, and Ashtabula Counties. Benefitting from the area&#8217;s proximity to Cleveland and Warren, population and income levels have maintained steady growth over the years. MBC&#8217;s two central Ohio branches are located in Dublin and Westerville in Franklin County, north of Columbus.

Lending &#8212; Loan Portfolio Composition and Activity . The Bank makes residential and commercial mortgage, home equity, secured and unsecured consumer installment, commercial and industrial, and real estate construction loans for owner-occupied and rental properties. The Bank&#8217;s Credit Policy aspires to a loan composition mix consisting of approximately 40% to 50% consumer purpose transactions including residential real estate loans, home equity loans and other consumer loans. The Policy is also designed to provide for 35% to 40% of total loans as business purpose commercial loans and business and consumer credit card accounts of up to 5% of total loans. 

&#160; 

Although Ohio law imposes no material restrictions on the types of loans the Bank may make, real estate-based lending has historically been the primary focus. For prudential reasons, we avoid lending on the security of real estate located outside our market area. Ohio law does restrict the amount of loans an Ohio-chartered bank may make, generally limiting credit to any single borrower to less than 15% of capital. An additional margin of 10% of capital is allowed for loans fully secured by readily marketable collateral. This 15% legal lending limit has not been a material restriction on lending. We can accommodate loan volumes exceeding the legal lending limit by selling loan participations to other banks. As of December 31, 2015, MBC&#8217;s 15%-of-capital limit on loans to a single borrower was approximately $10.9 million. 

&#160; 

The Bank offers specialized loans for business and commercial customers, including equipment and inventory financing, real estate construction loans and Small Business Administration loans for qualified businesses. A substantial portion of the Bank&#8217;s commercial loans are designated as real estate loans for regulatory reporting purposes because they are secured by mortgages on real property. Loans of that type may be made for purposes of financing commercial activities, such as accounts receivable, equipment purchases and leasing, but they are secured by real estate to provide the Bank with an extra measure of security. Although these loans might be secured in whole or in part by real estate, they are treated in the discussions to follow as commercial and industrial loans. The Bank&#8217;s consumer installment loans include secured and unsecured loans to individual borrowers for a variety of purposes, including personal, home improvements, revolving credit lines, autos, boats, and recreational vehicles. 

&#160; 

The following table shows on a consolidated basis the composition of the loan portfolio in dollar amounts and in percentages along with a reconciliation to loans receivable, net.

Residential Mortgage Loans A significant portion of the Bank&#8217;s lending consists of origination of conventional loans secured by 1-4 family real estate located in Franklin, Geauga, Portage, Trumbull, and Ashtabula Counties. Residential mortgage loans approximated $232.5 million or 43.6% of the Bank&#8217;s total loan portfolio at December 31, 2015. 

&#160; 

The Bank makes loans of up to 80% of the value of the real estate and improvements securing a loan (&#8220;LTV&#8221; ratio) on 1-4 family real estate. The Bank generally does not lend in excess of the lower of 80% of the appraised value or sales price of the property. The Bank offers residential real estate loans with terms of up to 30 years.

Approximately 94.9% of the portfolio of conventional mortgage loans secured by 1-4 family real estate at December 31, 2015 is adjustable rate. Generally, the Bank originates fixed-rate, single-family mortgage loans in conformity with Freddie Mac guidelines, so as to permit their being sold to Freddie Mac. These loans are sold with servicing rights retained, and are sold in furtherance of the Bank&#8217;s goal of better matching the maturities and interest rate sensitivity of its assets and liabilities. The Bank generally retains responsibility for collecting and remitting loan payments, inspecting the properties, making certain insurance and tax payments on behalf of borrowers and otherwise servicing the loans it sells and receives a fee for performing these services. Sales of loans also provide funds for additional lending and other purposes. 

&#160; 

The Bank&#8217;s home equity Credit Policy generally allows for a loan of up to 85% of a property&#8217;s appraised value, less the principal balance of the outstanding first mortgage loan. The Bank&#8217;s home equity loans generally have terms of 20 years. 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015, residential mortgage loans of approximately $4.1 million were over 90 days delinquent or nonaccruing on that date, representing 1.8% of the residential mortgage loan portfolio. At December 31, 2014, residential mortgage loans of approximately $5.3 million were over 90 days delinquent or nonaccruing on that date, representing 2.3% of the residential mortgage loan portfolio.

commercial real estate loans 

&#160; 

Commercial real estate loans include commercial properties occupied by the proprietor of the business conducted on the premises, and income-producing or farm properties. Although the Bank makes agricultural loans, it currently does not have a significant amount of agricultural loans. T he primary risks of commercial real estate loans are loss of income of the owner or occupier of the property and the inability of the market to sustain rent levels. Although commercial and commercial real estate loans generally bear more risk than single-family residential mortgage loans, they tend to be higher yielding, have shorter terms and provide for interest-rate adjustments. Accordingly, commercial and commercial real estate loans enhance a lender&#8217;s interest rate risk management and, in management&#8217;s opinion, promote more rapid asset and income growth than a loan portfolio composed strictly of residential real estate mortgage loans. 

&#160; 

Although a risk of nonpayment exists for all loans, certain specific risks are associated with various kinds of loans. One of the primary risks associated with commercial loans is the possibility that the commercial borrower will not generate income sufficient to repay the loan. The Bank&#8217;s Credit Policy provides that commercial loan applications must be supported by documentation indicating cash flow sufficient for the borrower to service the proposed loan. Financial statements or tax returns for at least three years must be submitted, and annual reviews are required for business purpose relationships of $1,000,000 or more. Ongoing financial information is generally required for any commercial credit where the exposure is $250,000 or more. 

&#160; 

The fair value of collateral for collateralized commercial loans must exceed the Bank&#8217;s exposure. For this purpose fair value is determined by independent appraisal or by the loan officer&#8217;s estimate employing guidelines established by the Credit Policy. Loans not secured by real estate generally have terms of five years or fewer, unless guaranteed by the U.S. Small Business Administration or other governmental agency, and term loans secured by collateral having a useful life exceeding five years may have longer terms. The Bank&#8217;s Credit Policy allows for terms of up to 15 years for loans secured by commercial real estate, and one year for business lines of credit. The maximum LTV ratio for commercial real estate loans is 80% of the appraised value or cost, whichever is less. 

&#160; 

Real estate is commonly a material component of collateral for the Bank&#8217;s loans, including commercial loans. Although the expected source of repayment is generally the operations of the borrower&#8217;s business or personal income, real estate collateral provides an additional measure of security. Risks associated with loans secured by real estate include fluctuating land values, changing local economic conditions, changes in tax policies, and a concentration of loans within a limited geographic area. 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015 commercial and commercial real estate loans totaled $274.2 million, or 51.4% of the Bank&#8217;s total loan portfolio. At December 31, 2015, commercial and commercial real estate loans of approximately $3.3 million were over 90 days delinquent or nonaccruing on that date, and represented 1.2% of the commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolios. At December 31, 2014, commercial and commercial real estate loans totaled $225.6 million, or 47.9% of the Bank&#8217;s total loan portfolio. At December 31, 2014, commercial and commercial real estate loans of approximately $1.4 million were over 90 days delinquent or nonaccruing on that date, and represented 0.6% of the commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolios. 

&#160; 

Real Estate Construction &#160; 

&#160; 

The Bank originates several different types of loans that it categorizes as construction loans, including: 

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; residential construction loans to borrowers who will occupy the premises upon completion of construction, &#160; &#8226; residential construction loans to builders, &#160; &#8226; commercial construction loans, and &#160; &#8226; real estate acquisition and development loans. &#160;

Because of the complex nature of construction lending, these loans are generally recognized as having a higher degree of risk than other forms of real estate lending. The Bank&#8217;s fixed-rate and adjustable-rate construction loans do not provide for the same interest rate terms on the construction loan and on the permanent mortgage loan that follows completion of the construction phase of the loan. It is the norm for the Bank to make residential construction loans without an existing written commitment for permanent financing. The Bank&#8217;s Credit Policy provides that the Bank may make construction loans with terms of up to one year, with a maximum LTV ratio for residential construction of 80%. The Bank also offers residential construction-to-permanent loans that have a twelve-month construction period followed by 30 years of permanent financing. 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015, real estate construction loans totaled $22.1 million, or 4.1% of the Bank&#8217;s total loan portfolio. Real estate construction loans of approximately $0.1 million were over 90 days delinquent or nonaccruing on that date, representing 0.6% of the real estate construction loan portfolio. At December 31, 2014, real estate construction loans totaled $30.3 million, or 6.4% of the Bank&#8217;s total loan portfolio. Real estate construction loans of approximately $0.6 million were over 90 days delinquent or nonaccruing on that date, representing 1.9% of the real estate construction loan portfolio. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Consumer Installment Loans The Bank&#8217;s consumer installment loans include secured and unsecured loans to individual borrowers for a variety of purposes, including personal, home improvement, revolving credit lines, autos, boats, and recreational vehicles. The Bank does not currently do any indirect lending. Unsecured consumer loans carry significantly higher interest rates than secured loans. The Bank maintains a higher loan loss allowance for consumer loans, while maintaining strict credit guidelines when considering consumer loan applications. 

&#160;

According to the Bank&#8217;s Credit Policy, consumer loans secured by collateral other than real estate generally may have terms of up to five years, and unsecured consumer loans may have terms up to three years. Real estate security generally is required for consumer loans having terms exceeding five years. 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015, the Bank had approximately $4.9 million in its consumer installment loan portfolio, representing 0.9% of total loans. At December 31, 2014, the Bank had approximately $4.6 million in its consumer installment loan portfolio, representing 1.0% of total loans. At December 31, 2014, 0.1% of consumer installment loans were over 90 days delinquent or nonaccruing. 

&#160; 

Loan Solicitation and Processing Loan originations are developed from a number of sources, including continuing business with depositors, other borrowers and real estate builders, solicitations by Bank personnel and walk-in customers. 

&#160; 

When a loan request is made, the Bank reviews the application, credit bureau reports, property appraisals or evaluations, financial information, verifications of income, and other documentation concerning the creditworthiness of the borrower, as applicable to each loan type. The Bank&#8217;s underwriting guidelines are set by senior management and approved by the Board of Directors. The Credit Policy specifies each individual officer&#8217;s loan approval authority. Loans exceeding an individual officer&#8217;s approval authority are submitted to an Officer&#8217;s Loan Committee, which has authority to approve loans up to $2,000,000. The Board of Directors&#8217; Loan Committee acts as an approval authority for exposures over $2,000,000 and up to $5,000,000. Loans exceeding $5,000,000 require approval from the full Board of Directors. 

&#160; 

Income from Lending Activities The Bank earns interest and fee income from its lending activities. Net of origination costs, loan origination fees are amortized over the life of a loan. The Bank also receives loan fees related to existing loans, including late charges. Income from loan origination and commitment fees and discounts varies with the volume and type of loans and commitments made and with competitive and economic conditions. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein contains a discussion of the manner in which loan fees and income are recognized for financial reporting purposes. 

&#160; 

Mortgage Banking Activity The Bank originates conventional loans secured by first lien mortgages on one-to-four family residential properties located within its market area for either portfolio or sale into the secondary market. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Bank recorded gains of $0.3 million on the sale of $17.6 million in loans receivable originated for sale. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Bank recorded gains of $0.2 million on the sale of $6.0 million in loans receivable originated for sale. The sold loans were sold on a servicing retained basis to Freddie Mac. 

&#160; 

In addition to interest earned on loans and income recognized on the sale of loans, the Bank receives fees for servicing loans that it has sold. Because the Bank has data processing capacity that will allow it to expand its portfolio of serviced loans without incurring significant incremental expenses, the Bank intends in the future to augment its portfolio of loans serviced by continuing to originate and sell such fixed-rate single-family residential mortgage loans with Freddie Mac while retaining servicing. 

&#160; 

Income from these activities will vary from period to period with the volume and type of loans originated and sold, which in turn is dependent on prevailing mortgage interest rates and their effect on the demand for loans in the Bank&#8217;s market area. 

&#160; 

Nonperforming Loans Late charges on residential mortgages and consumer loans are assessed if a payment is not received by the due date plus a grace period. When an advanced stage of delinquency appears on a single-family loan and if repayment cannot be expected within a reasonable time or a repayment agreement is not entered into, a required notice of foreclosure or repossession proceedings may be prepared by the Bank&#8217;s attorney and delivered to the borrower so that foreclosure proceedings may be initiated promptly, if necessary. The Bank also collects late charges on commercial loans. 

&#160; 

When the Bank acquires real estate through foreclosure, voluntary deed, or similar means, it is classified as OREO until it is sold. When property is acquired in this manner, it is recorded at the lower of cost (the unpaid principal balance at the date of acquisition) or fair value, less anticipated cost to sell. Any subsequent write-down is charged to expense. All costs incurred from the date of acquisition to maintain the property are expensed. OREO is appraised during the foreclosure process, before acquisition when possible. Losses are recognized for the amount by which the book value of the related mortgage loan exceeds the estimated net realizable value of the property. 

&#160; 

The Bank undertakes regular review of the loan portfolio to assess its risks, particularly the risks associated with the commercial loan portfolio. 

&#160; 

Classified Assets FDIC regulations governing classification of assets require nonmember commercial banks &#8212; including the Bank &#8212; to classify their own assets and to establish appropriate general and specific allowances for losses, subject to FDIC review. The regulations are designed to encourage management to evaluate assets on a case-by-case basis, discouraging automatic classifications. Under this classification system, problem assets of insured institutions are classified as &#8220;substandard,&#8221; &#8220;doubtful,&#8221; or &#8220;loss.&#8221; An asset is considered &#8220;substandard&#8221; if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as &#8220;doubtful&#8221; have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection of principal in full &#8212; on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values &#8212; highly questionable and improbable. Assets classified as &#8220;loss&#8221; are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted. Assets that do not expose the Bank to risk sufficient to warrant classification in one of the above categories, but that possess some weakness, are required to be designated &#8220;special mention&#8221; by management. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

When an insured institution classifies assets as either &#8220;substandard&#8221; or &#8220;doubtful,&#8221; it may establish allowances for loan losses in an amount deemed prudent by management. When an insured institution classifies assets as &#8220;loss,&#8221; it is required either to establish an allowance for losses equal to 100% of that portion of the assets so classified or to charge off that amount. An Ohio nonmember bank&#8217;s determination about classification of its assets and the amount of its allowances is subject to review by the FDIC, which may order the establishment of additional loss allowances. Management also employs an independent third party to semi-annually review and validate the internal loan review process and loan classifications. 

&#160; 

The Bank has experienced a decrease in substandard loans. Loans secured by residential real estate and commercial real estate account for $5.8 million and $8.0 million of the substandard loans, respectively. These amounts represent 88.8% of the Bank&#8217;s substandard loans. 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012, and 2011 consolidated classified loans were as follows:

&#160;

Other than those disclosed above, the Bank does not believe there are any loans classified for regulatory purposes as loss, doubtful, substandard, special mention or otherwise, which will result in losses or have a material impact on future operations, liquidity or capital reserves. We are not aware of any other information that causes us to have serious doubts as to the ability of borrowers in general to comply with repayment terms. 

&#160; 

Investments Investment securities provide a return on residual funds after lending activities. Investments may be in federal funds sold, corporate securities, U.S. Government and agency obligations, state and local government obligations and government-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities. The Bank generally does not invest in securities that are rated less than investment grade by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization. Ohio law prescribes the kinds of investments an Ohio-chartered bank may make. Permitted investments include local, state, and federal government securities, mortgage-backed securities, and securities of federal government agencies. An Ohio-chartered bank also may invest up to 10% of its assets in corporate debt and equity securities, or a higher percentage in certain circumstances. Ohio law also limits to 15% of capital the amount an Ohio-chartered bank may invest in the securities of any one issuer, other than local, state, and federal government and federal government agency issuers and mortgage-backed securities issuers. These provisions have not been a material constraint upon the Bank&#8217;s investment activities. 

&#160; 

All securities-related activity is reported to the Bank&#8217;s board of directors. General changes in investment strategy are required to be reviewed and approved by the board. Senior management can purchase and sell securities in accordance with the Bank&#8217;s stated investment policy. 

&#160; 

Management determines the appropriate classification of securities at the time of purchase. At this time the Bank has no securities that are classified as held to maturity. Securities to be held for indefinite periods and not intended to be held to maturity or on a long-term basis are classified as available for sale. Available-for-sale securities are reflected on the balance sheet at their fair value.

Expected maturities of investment securities could differ from contractual maturities because the borrower, or issuer, could have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. The average yields in the above table are not calculated on a tax-equivalent basis. 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, the Bank also held 18,872 shares of $100 par value Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati stock, which is a restricted security. FHLB stock represents an equity interest in the FHLB, but it does not have a readily determinable market value. The stock can be sold at its par value only, and only to the FHLB or to another member institution. Member institutions are required to maintain a minimum stock investment in the FHLB, based on total assets, total mortgages, and total mortgage-backed securities. The Bank&#8217;s minimum investment in FHLB stock at December 31, 2015 was $1.9 million. 

&#160; 

Sources of Funds &#8212; Deposit Accounts Deposit accounts are a major source of funds for the Bank. The Bank offers a number of deposit products to attract both commercial and regular consumer checking and savings customers, including regular and money market savings accounts, NOW accounts, and a variety of fixed-maturity, fixed-rate certificates with maturities ranging from 3 to 60 months. These accounts earn interest at rates established by management based on competitive market factors and management&#8217;s desire to increase certain types or maturities of deposit liabilities. The Bank also provides travelers&#8217; checks, official checks, money orders, ATM services, and IRA accounts.

Borrowings Deposits and repayment of loan principal are the Bank&#8217;s primary sources of funds for lending activities and other general business purposes. However, when the supply of funds cannot satisfy the demand for loans or general business purposes, the Bank&#8217;s su bsidiary bank can obtain funds from the FHLB of Cincinnati. Interest and principal are payable monthly, and the line of credit is secured by a pledge collateral agreement. At December 31, 2015, MBC had $26.7 million of FHLB borrowings outstanding. The Company&#8217;s subsidiary bank also has access to credit through the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and other funding sources.

Supervision and Regulation 

&#160; 

The following discussion of bank supervision and regulation is qualified in its entirety by reference to the statutory and regulatory provisions discussed. Changes in applicable law or in the policies of various regulatory authorities could materially affect th e business and prospects of the Company. 

&#160; 

The Company is a bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. As such, the Company is subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, acting primarily through the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. The Company is required to file annual reports and other information with the Federal Reserve. The bank subsidiary is an Ohio-chartered commercial bank. As a state-chartered, nonmember bank, the bank is primarily regulated by the FDIC and by the Ohio Division of Financial Institutions. 

&#160; 

The Company and The Middlefield Banking Company are subject to federal banking laws, and the Company is also subject to Ohio bank law. These federal and state laws are intended to protect depositors, not stockholders. Federal and state laws applicable to holding companies and their financial institution subsidiaries regulate the range of permissible business activities, investments, reserves against deposits, capital levels, lending activities and practices, the nature and amount of collateral for loans, establishment of branches, mergers, dividends, and a variety of other important matters. The Bank is subject to detailed, complex, and sometimes overlapping federal and state statutes and regulations affecting routine banking operations. These statutes and regulations include but are not limited to state usury and consumer credit laws, the Truth-in-Lending Act and Regulation Z, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Savings Act, and the Community Reinvestment Act. The Bank must comply with Federal Reserve Board regulations requiring depository institutions to maintain reserves against their transaction accounts (principally NOW and regular checking accounts). Because required reserves are commonly maintained in the form of vault cash or in a noninterest-bearing account (or pass-through account) at a Federal Reserve Bank, the effect of the reserve requirement is to reduce an institution&#8217;s earning assets. 

&#160;

The Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC have extensive authority to prevent and to remedy unsafe and unsound practices and violations of applicable laws and regulations by institutions and holding companies. The agencies may assess civil money penalties, issue cease-and-desist or removal orders, seek injunctions, and publicly disclose those actions. In addition, the Ohio Division of Financial Institutions possesses enforcement powers to address violations of Ohio banking law by Ohio-chartered banks. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Regulation of Bank Holding Companies &#8212; Bank and Bank Holding Company Acquisitions The Bank Holding Company Act requires every bank holding company to obtain approval of the Federal Reserve before &#8212; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

directly or indirectly acquiring ownership or control of any voting shares of another bank or bank holding company, if after the acquisition the acquiring company would own or control more than 5% of the shares of the other bank or bank holding company (unless the acquiring company already owns or controls a majority of the shares), &#160; &#8226; acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of another bank, or &#160; &#8226; merging or consolidating with another bank holding company. &#160;

The Federal Reserve will not approve an acquisition, merger, or consolidation that would have a substantially anticompetitive result, unless the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed by a greater public interest in satisfying the convenience and needs of the community to be served. The Federal Reserve also considers capital adequacy and other financial and managerial factors in its review of acquisitions and mergers. 

&#160; 

Additionally, the Bank Holding Company Act, the Change in Bank Control Act and the Federal Reserve Board&#8217;s Regulation Y require advance approval of the Federal Reserve to acquire &#8220;control&#8221; of a bank holding company. Control is conclusively presumed to exist if an individual or company acquires 25% or more of a class of voting securities of the bank holding company. If the holding company has securities registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as the Company does, or if no other person owns a greater percentage of the class of voting securities, control is presumed to exist if a person acquires 10% or more, but less than 25%, of any class of voting securities. Approval of the Ohio Division of Financial Institutions is also necessary to acquire control of an Ohio-chartered bank. 

&#160; 

Nonbanking Activities With some exceptions, the Bank Holding Company Act generally prohibits a bank holding company from acquiring or retaining direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company that is not a bank or bank holding company, or from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks, or providing services for its subsidiaries. The principal exceptions to these prohibitions involve nonbank activities that, by statute or by Federal Reserve Board regulation or order, are held to be closely related to the business of banking or of managing or controlling banks. In making its determination that a particular activity is closely related to the business of banking, the Federal Reserve considers whether the performance of the activities by a bank holding company can be expected to produce benefits to the public &#8212; such as greater convenience, increased competition, or gains in efficiency in resources &#8212; that will outweigh the risks of possible adverse effects such as decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest, or unsound banking practices. Some of the activities determined by Federal Reserve Board regulation to be closely related to the business of banking are: making or servicing loans or leases; engaging in insurance and discount brokerage activities; owning thrift institutions; performing data processing services; acting as a fiduciary or investment or financial advisor; and making investments in corporations or projects designed primarily to promote community welfare. 

&#160; 

Financial Holding Companies On November 12, 1999 the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act became law, repealing much of the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act&#8217;s separation of the commercial and investment banking industries. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act expands the range of nonbanking activities a bank holding company may engage in, while preserving existing authority for bank holding companies to engage in activities that are closely related to banking. The new legislation creates a new category of holding company called a &#8220;financial holding company.&#8221; Financial holding companies may engage in any activity that is &#8212; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#8226; financial in nature or incidental to that financial activity, or 

&#160;

&#8226; complementary to a financial activity and that does not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally. 

&#160; 

Activities that are financial in nature include &#8212; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#8226; acting as principal, agent, or broker for insurance, 

&#160;

&#8226; underwriting, dealing in, or making a market in securities, and 

&#160;

&#8226; providing financial and investment advice. 

&#160;

The Federal Reserve Board and the Secretary of the Treasury have authority to decide that other activities are also financial in nature or incidental to financial activity, taking into account changes in technology, changes in the banking marketplace, competition for banking services, and so on. The Company is engaged solely in activities that were permissible for a bank holding company before enactment of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Federal Reserve Board rules require that all of the depository institution subsidiaries of a financial holding company be and remain well capitalized and well managed. If all depository institution subsidiaries of a financial holding company do not remain well capitalized and well managed, the financial holding company must enter into an agreement acceptable to the Federal Reserve Board, undertaking to comply with all capital and management requirements within 180 days. In the meantime the financial holding company may not use its expanded authority to engage in nonbanking activities without Federal Reserve Board approval and the Federal Reserve may impose other limitations on the holding company&#8217;s or affiliates&#8217; activities. If a financial holding company fails to restore the well-capitalized and well-managed status of a depository institution subsidiary, the Federal Reserve may order divestiture of the subsidiary. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Holding Company Capital and Source of Strength The Federal Reserve considers the adequacy of a bank holding company&#8217;s capital on essentially the same risk-adjusted basis as capital adequacy is determined by the FDIC at the bank subsidiary level. It is also Federal Reserve Board policy that bank holding companies serve as a source of strength for their subsidiary banking institutions. 

&#160; 

Under Bank Holding Company Act section 5(e), the Federal Reserve Board may require a bank holding company to terminate any activity or relinquish control of a nonbank subsidiary if the Federal Reserve Board determines that the activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of a subsidiary bank. And with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991&#8217;s addition of the prompt corrective action provisions to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, section 38(f)(2)(I) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act now provides that a federal bank regulatory authority may require a bank holding company to divest itself of an undercapitalized bank subsidiary if the agency determines that divestiture will improve the bank&#8217;s financial condition and prospects. 

&#160;

&#160;

Capital &#8212; Risk-Based Capital Requirements The Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC employ similar risk-based capital guidelines in their examination and regulation of bank holding companies and financial institutions. If capital falls below the minimum levels established by the guidelines, the bank holding company or bank may be denied approval to acquire or establish additional banks or nonbank businesses or to open new facilities. Failure to satisfy capital guidelines could subject a banking institution to a variety of restrictions or enforcement actions by federal bank regulatory authorities, including the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC and a prohibition on the acceptance of brokered deposits. 

&#160; 

A bank&#8217;s capital hedges its risk exposure, absorbing losses that can be predicted as well as losses that cannot be predicted. According to the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council&#8217;s explanation of the capital component of the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System, commonly known as the &#8220;CAMELS&#8221; rating system, a rating system employed by the Federal bank regulatory agencies, a financial institution must &#8220;maintain capital commensurate with the nature and extent of risks to the institution and the ability of management to identify, measure, monitor, and control these risks. The effect of credit, market, and other risks on the institution&#8217;s financial condition should be considered when evaluating the adequacy of capital.&#8221; Under Basel III, the Bank is required to maintain a minimum common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6%, a total capital ratio of 8%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. Basel III also established a &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221; of 2.5% above the new regulatory minimum capital requirements, which must consist entirely of common equity Tier 1 capital and will be phased in beginning in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increase by that amount each year until fully implemented in January 2019. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a common equity Tier 1 ratio to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. These ratios are absolute minimums. In practice, banks are expected to operate with more than the absolute minimum capital. The FDIC may establish greater minimum capital requirements for specific institutions. 

&#160; 

The FDIC also employs a market risk component in its calculation of capital requirements for nonmember banks. The market risk component could require additional capital for general or specific market risk of trading portfolios of debt and equity securities and other investments or assets. The FDIC&#8217;s evaluation of an institution&#8217;s capital adequacy takes account of a variety of other factors as well, including interest rate risks to which the institution is subject, the level and quality of an institution&#8217;s earnings, loan and investment portfolio characteristics and risks, risks arising from the conduct of nontraditional activities, and a variety of other factors. 

&#160; 

Accordingly, the FDIC&#8217;s final supervisory judgment concerning an institution&#8217;s capital adequacy could differ significantly from the conclusions that might be derived from the absolute level of an institution&#8217;s risk-based capital ratios. Therefore, institutions generally are expected to maintain risk-based capital ratios that exceed the minimum ratios discussed above. This is particularly true for institutions contemplating significant expansion plans and institutions that are subject to high or inordinate levels of risk. Moreover, although the FDIC does not impose explicit capital requirements on holding companies of institutions regulated by the FDIC, the FDIC can take account of the degree of leverage and risks at the holding company level. If the FDIC determines that the holding company (or another affiliate of the institution regulated by the FDIC) has an excessive degree of leverage or is subject to inordinate risks, the FDIC may require the subsidiary institution(s) to maintain additional capital or the FDIC may impose limitations on the subsidiary institution&#8217;s ability to support its weaker affiliates or holding company. 

&#160; 

The banking agencies have also established a minimum leverage ratio of 3%, which represents Tier 1 capital as a percentage of total assets, less intangibles. However, for bank holding companies and financial institutions seeking to expand and for all but the most highly rated banks and bank holding companies, the banking agencies expect an additional cushion of at least 100 to 200 basis points. At December 31, 2015, the Company was in compliance with all regulatory capital requirements. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Prompt Corrective Action . To resolve the problems of undercapitalized institutions and to prevent a recurrence of the banking crisis of the 1980s and early 1990s, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 established a system known as &#8220;prompt corrective action.&#8221; Under the prompt corrective action provisions and implementing regulations, every institution is classified into one of five categories, depending on its total risk-based capital ratio, its Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, its leverage ratio, and subjective factors. The categories are &#8220;well capitalized,&#8221; &#8220;adequately capitalized,&#8221; &#8220;undercapitalized,&#8221; &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; and &#8220;critically undercapitalized.&#8221; To be considered well capitalized for purposes of the prompt corrective action rules, a bank must maintain total risk-based capital of 10.0% or greater, Tier 1 risk-based capital of 8.0% or greater, common equity Tier 1 capital of 6.5%, and leverage capital of 5.0% or greater. An institution with a capital level that might qualify for well capitalized or adequately capitalized status may nevertheless be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if its primary federal banking supervisory authority determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or practice warrants that treatment. 

&#160;

A financial institution&#8217;s operations can be significantly affected by its capital classification under the prompt corrective action rules. For example, an institution that is not well capitalized generally is prohibited from accepting brokered deposits and offering interest rates on deposits higher than the prevailing rate in its market without advance regulatory approval, which can have an adverse effect on the bank&#8217;s liquidity. At each successively lower capital category, an insured depository institution is subject to additional restrictions. Undercapitalized institutions are required to take specified actions to increase their capital or otherwise decrease the risks to the federal deposit insurance funds. A bank holding company must guarantee that a subsidiary bank that adopts a capital restoration plan will satisfy its plan obligations. Any capital loans made by a bank holding company to a subsidiary bank are subordinated to the claims of depositors in the bank and to certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank. If bankruptcy of a bank holding company occurs, any commitment by the bank holding company to a Federal banking regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank would be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and would be entitled to priority of payment. Bank regulatory agencies generally are required to appoint a receiver or conservator shortly after an institution becomes critically undercapitalized. 

&#160;

&#160;

New Capital Rules On July 9, 2013, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule that will revise their risk-based capital requirements and the method for calculating risk-weighted assets to make them consistent with agreements that were reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rule applies to all depository institutions, top-tier bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $500 million or more and top-tier savings and loan holding companies. 

&#160; 

The rule establishes a new common equity Tier 1 minimum capital requirement (4.5% of risk-weighted assets), increases the minimum Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets requirement (from 4.0% to 6.0% of risk-weighted assets) and assigns a higher risk weight (150%) to exposures that are more than 90 days past due or are on nonaccrual status and to certain commercial real estate facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property. 

&#160; 

The rule also includes changes in what constitutes regulatory capital, some of which are subject to a two-year transition period. These changes include the phasing-out of certain instruments as qualifying capital. In addition, Tier 2 capital is no longer limited to the amount of Tier 1 capital included in total capital. Mortgage servicing rights, certain deferred tax assets and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries over designated percentages of common stock will be required to be deducted from capital, subject to a two-year transition period. Finally, Tier 1 capital will include accumulated other comprehensive income (which includes all unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt and equity securities), subject to a two-year transition period. In the first quarter of 2015 the Company permanently opted out of the inclusion of accumulated other comprehensive income in its capital calculation in an effort to reduce the impact of market volatility on its regulatory capital levels. 

&#160; 

The new capital requirements also include changes in the risk-weights of assets to better reflect credit risk and other risk exposures. These include a 150% risk weight (up from 100%) for certain high volatility commercial real estate acquisition, development and construction loans and nonresidential mortgage loans that are 90 day past due or otherwise on nonaccrual status; a 20% (up from 0%) credit conversion factor for the unused portion of a commitment with an original maturity of one year or less that is not unconditionally cancellable; a 250% risk weight (up from 100%) for mortgage servicing and deferred tax assets that are not deducted from capital; and increased risk-weights (from 0% to up to 600%) for equity exposures. 

&#160; 

Finally, the rule limits capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the banking organization does not hold a &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221; consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. 

&#160; 

The final rule became effective for the bank on January 1, 2015. The capital conservation buffer requirement will be phased in beginning January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets increasing each year until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019.

Limits on Dividends and Other Payments The Company&#8217;s ability to obtain funds for the payment of dividends and for other cash requirements depends on the amount of dividends that may be paid to it by the bank. Ohio bank law and FDIC policy are consistent, providing that banks generally may rely solely on current earnings for the payment of dividends. Under Ohio Revised Code section 1107.15(B) a dividend may be declared from surplus, meaning additional paid-in capital, with the approval of ( x ) the Ohio Superintendent of Financial Institutions and ( y ) the holders of two thirds of the bank&#8217;s outstanding shares. Superintendent approval is also necessary for payment of a dividend if the total of all cash dividends in a year exceeds the sum of ( x ) net income for the year and ( y ) retained net income for the two preceding years. Relying on 12 U.S.C. 1818(b), the FDIC may restrict a bank&#8217;s ability to pay a dividend if the FDIC has reasonable cause to believe that the dividend would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice. A bank&#8217;s ability to pay dividends may be affected also by the FDIC&#8217;s capital maintenance requirements and prompt corrective action rules. A bank may not pay a dividend if the bank is undercapitalized or if payment would cause the bank to become undercapitalized. 

&#160; 

A 1985 policy statement of the Federal Reserve Board declares that a bank holding company should not pay cash dividends on common stock unless the organization&#8217;s net income for the past year is sufficient to fully fund the dividends and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the organization&#8217;s capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition. Until the third anniversary of the January 20, 2014 merger of Emerald Bank into The Middlefield Banking Company, The Middlefield Banking Company cannot pay a dividend to Middlefield Banc Corp. without advance approval of the Ohio Division of Financial Institutions. 

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Act The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (&#8220;DFA&#8221;) became law on July 21, 2010. The DFA includes corporate governance and executive compensation reforms, new registration requirements for hedge fund and private equity fund advisers, increased regulation of over-the-counter derivatives and asset-backed securities, and new rules for credit rating agencies. The DFA includes these provisions &#8211; 

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; Title X establishes an independent Federal regulatory body within the Federal Reserve System. Dedicated exclusively to consumer protection and known as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, thi s regulatory body has responsibility for most consumer protection laws, with rulemaking, supervisory, examination, and enforcement authority. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; section 171 restricts the amount of trust preferred securities that may be considered Tier 1 capital. For depository institution holding companies with total assets of less than $15 billion, trust preferred securities issued before May 19, 2010 may continue to be included in Tier 1 capital, but future issuances of trust preferred securities will no longer be eligible for treatment as Tier 1 capital. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; under section 334 the FDIC&#8217;s minimum reserve ratio is to be increased from 1.15% to 1.35%, with the goal of attaining that 1.35% level by September 30, 2020; however, financial institutions with assets of less than $10 billion are exempt from the cost of the increase. The DFA also removes the upper limit on the designated reserve ratio, which was formerly capped at 1.5%, removing the upper limit on the size of the insurance fund as a consequence. The DFA gives the FDIC much greater discretion to manage its insurance fund reserves, including where to set the insurance fund&#8217;s designated reserve ratio. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; the deposit insurance cover limit is increased to $250,000 by section 335. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; section 627 repeals the longstanding prohibition against financial institutions paying interest on checking accounts. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; section 331 changes the way deposit insurance premiums are calculated by the FDIC as well. That is, deposit insurance premiums are calculated based upon an institution&#8217;s so-called assessment base. Until the DFA became law, the assessment base consisted of an institution&#8217;s deposit liabilities. Section 331, however, makes clear that the assessment base shall now be the difference between total assets and tangible equity. In other words, the assessment base will take account of all liabilities, not merely deposit liabilities. This change is likely to have a greater impact on large banks, which tend to rely on a variety of funding sources, than on community banks, which tend to rely primarily on deposit funding. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency&#8217;s ability to preempt state consumer protection laws is constrained by section 1044, and because of section 1042 state attorneys general have greater authority to enforce state consumer protection laws against national banks and their operating subsidiaries. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; section 604 requires the Federal bank regulatory agencies to take into account the risks to the stability of the U.S. banking or financial system associated with approval of an application for acquisition of a bank, for acquisition of a nonbank company, or for a bank merger transaction. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; section 619 implements the so-called &#8220;Volcker rule,&#8221; prohibiting a banking entity from engaging in proprietary trading or from sponsoring or investing in a hedge fund or private equity fund. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; imposing a 5% risk retention requirement on securitizers of asset-backed securities, section 941 could have an impact on financial institutions that originate mortgages for sale into the secondary market. &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The DFA could affect the profitability of community banking, require changes in the business practices of community banking organizations, lead to more stringent capital and liquidity requirements, and otherwise adversely affect the community banking business. 

&#160; 

The DFA creates a new, independent federal agency called the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which has rulemaking, supervisory, and enforcement powers under specific federal consumer financial protection laws, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Truth in Lending Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, Fair Debt Collection Act, and Consumer Financial Privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. In addition to giving the CFPB responsibility for these specific statutes, the DFA grants to the CFPB broad authority to prohibit the offering by banks of consumer financial products or engaging in acts or practices that the CFPB considers to be unfair, deceptive, or abusive. The CFPB has examination and primary enforcement authority over depository institutions with $10 billion or more in assets, not smaller institutions. However, smaller institutions are subject to CFPB rules. In addition, the standards established by the CFPB for large institutions are likely to be applied in practice to smaller institutions as well. The DFA does not prevent states from adopting consumer protection laws and standards that are more stringent than those adopted at the federal level and, in certain circumstances, permits state attorneys general to enforce compliance with both the state and federal laws and regulations. 

&#160; 

Implementing section 1411 of the DFA, in 2013 the CFPB amended Regulation Z under the Truth in Lending Act, adding a rule that mortgage lenders must make a reasonable and good faith determination that a consumer being granted mortgage credit has the ability to repay the loan according to its terms. Under this new rule, referred to as the &#8220;ability-to-repay&#8221; rule, mortgage lenders may determine the consumer&#8217;s ability to repay in one of two ways. The first alternative involves assessment of eight underwriting factors, including the loan applicant&#8217;s current or reasonably expected income or assets, current employment status, monthly payment for the credit applied for, monthly payment on any simultaneous loan being made to the applicant, monthly payment for mortgage-related obligations, current debt obligations, alimony, and child support, monthly debt-to-income ratio or residual income, and credit history. The second alternative involves origination of a so-called &#8220;qualified mortgage,&#8221; meaning a mortgage with terms that are consistent with minimum standards established by the CFPB, which currently include a maximum 43% debt-to-income ratio for the borrower (although the 43% minimum debt-to-income ratio does not apply if the loan is eligible to be purchased, insured, or guaranteed by FNMA, FHLMC, HUD, or the VA). In general terms, a qualified mortgage is one with a term of 30 years or less, with substantially equal regular periodic payments (although adjustable-rate mortgages can be qualified mortgages), with total points and fees of 3% of the loan amount or less, and without negative amortization or interest-only payments or balloon payments. 

&#160; 

A lender originating a qualified mortgage is protected against a legal claim that the lender failed to comply with the ability-to-repay rule. A mortgage with an interest rate exceeding the prime rate by 1.5 percentage points or more (3.5 percentage points for subordinate-lien loans such as home equity loans) is referred to in the CFPB rule as a higher-priced mortgage loan, but is more commonly known as a subprime loan. A subprime loan can be a qualified mortgage, but the lender making a subprime qualified mortgage has less protection under the ability-to-repay rule than a lender making a prime qualified mortgage. A lender originating a mortgage that is not a qualified mortgage is exposed to a potential claim that the lender did not comply with the ability-to-repay rules, which could require the lender to pay damages to the borrower, including but not necessarily limited to the sum of all finance charges and fees paid by the borrower (a lender originating a subprime qualified mortgage bears this risk to a degree as well). The borrower&#8217;s claim also could impair the lender&#8217;s ability to enforce the loan terms or foreclose on the real estate collateral. Because of these potential risks, a qualified mortgage might have more value in the secondary mortgage market and might be easier for a lender to sell into the secondary mortgage market than a mortgage that is not a qualified mortgage. 

&#160; 

Although we believe the majority of our mortgage originations will be prime qualified mortgages, the ability-to-repay rule creates a new basis for challenge by regulators and by consumers. In addition, the CFPB&#8217;s mission is consumer protection, not lender safety and soundness, and for that reason the CFPB wrote the ability-to-repay rule with the goal of preventing consumers from being steered by lenders into expensive and unsustainable borrowing, rather than with the goal of assuring actual loan repayment. Accordingly, typical credit-quality features such as LTV standards are not part of the ability-to-repay rule, and it will not necessarily be the case that qualified mortgages have a higher probability or history of repayment than other mortgages. Compliance with the ability-to-repay rules has increased community banks&#8217; compliance costs, including our own, and will potentially adversely affect the profitability of routine residential mortgage lending. In addition, for the mortgage lending industry the ability-to-repay rule creates a bias in favor of qualified mortgages, which because of factors such as a minimum 43% debt-to-income ratio could have unintended adverse effects, such as reducing community bank lending to low- and moderate-income borrowers and communities. 

&#160;

In addition to ability to repay, the DFA imposes a risk-retention requirement on mortgage lenders selling loans into the secondary mortgage market. With some exceptions a mortgage lender selling a loan into the secondary mortgage market must retain ownership of at least 5% of the loan, the assumption being that if mortgage lenders remain exposed to credit risk they will not knowingly make loans that fail to satisfy ordinary and reasonable standards of creditworthiness. A qualified mortgage for purposes of the ability-to-repay rule is also exempt from the risk-retention requirement, allowing a mortgage lender to sell 100% of a qualified mortgage rather than only 95%. The exemption of qualified mortgages from the risk-retention requirement is likely to contribute to the regulatory bias in favor of qualified mortgages and against other forms of mortgage lending. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 The goals of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act enacted in 2002 are to increase corporate responsibility, to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies, and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures made under the securities laws. The changes are intended to allow shareholders to monitor the performance of companies and directors more easily and efficiently. 

&#160; 

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act generally applies to all companies that file periodic reports with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Act has an impact on a wide variety of corporate governance and disclosure issues, including the composition of audit committees, certification of financial statements by the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer, forfeiture of bonuses and profits made by directors and senior officers in the 12-month period covered by restated financial statements, a prohibition on insider trading during pension plan black-out periods, disclosure of off-balance sheet transactions, a prohibition on personal loans to directors and officers (excluding Federally insured financial institutions), expedited filing requirements for stock transaction reports by officers and directors, the formation of a public accounting oversight board, auditor independence, and various increased criminal penalties for violations of securities laws. 

&#160; 

Deposit Insurance The premium that banks pay for deposit insurance is based upon a risk classification system established by the FDIC. Banks with higher levels of capital and a low degree of supervisory concern are assessed lower premiums than banks with lower levels of capital or a higher degree of supervisory concern. 

&#160; 

Interstate Banking and Branching Section 613 of the DFA amends the interstate branching provisions of the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994. The expanded de novo branching authority of the DFA authorizes a state or national bank to open a de novo branch in another state if the law of the state where the branch is to be located would permit a state bank chartered by that state to open the branch. Section 607 of the DFA also increases the approval threshold for interstate bank acquisitions, providing that a bank holding company must be well capitalized and well managed as a condition to approval of an interstate bank acquisition, rather than being merely adequately capitalized and adequately managed, and that an acquiring bank must be and remain well capitalized and well managed as a condition to approval of an interstate bank merger. 

&#160; 

Transactions with Affiliates Although The Middlefield Banking Company is not a member bank of t he Federal Reserve System, it is required by the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to comply with section 23A and section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act &#8212; pertaining to transactions with affiliates &#8212; as if it were a member bank. These statutes are intended to protect banks from abuse in financial transactions with affiliates, preventing federally insured deposits from being diverted to support the activities of unregulated entities engaged in nonbanking businesses. An affiliate of a bank includes any company or entity that controls or is under common control with the bank. Generally, section 23A and section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act &#8212; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#8226; 

limit the extent to which a bank or its subsidiaries may lend to or engage in various other kinds of transactions with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10% of the institution&#8217;s capital and surplus, limiting the aggregate of covered transactions with all affiliates to 20% of capital and surplus,

&#160; &#8226; impose restrictions on investments by a subsidiary bank in the stock or securities of its holding company, &#160; &#8226; require that affiliate transactions be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the institution or subsidiary, as those provided to a non-affiliate, and &#160; &#8226; Impose strict collateral requirements on loans or extensions of credit by a bank to an affiliate &#160;

The Bank&#8217;s authority to extend credit to insiders &#8212; meaning executive officers, directors and greater than 10% stockholders &#8212; or to entities those persons control, is subject to section 22(g) and section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O of the Federal Reserve Board. Among other things, these laws require insider loans to be made on terms substantially similar to those offered to unaffiliated individuals, place limits on the amount of loans a bank may make to insiders based in part on the Bank&#8217;s capital position, and require that specified approval procedures be followed. Loans to an individual insider may not exceed the legal limit on loans to any one borrower, which in general terms is 15% of capital but can be higher in some circumstances. And the aggregate of all loans to all insiders may not exceed the Bank&#8217;s unimpaired capital and surplus. Insider loans exceeding the greater of 5% of capital or $25,000 must be approved in advance by a majority of the board, with any &#8220;interested&#8221; director not participating in the voting. Lastly, loans to executive officers are subject to special limitations. Executive officers may borrow in unlimited amounts to finance their children&#8217;s education or to finance the purchase or improvement of their residence, and they may borrow no more than $100,000 for most other purposes. Loans to executive officers exceeding $100,000 may be allowed if the loan is fully secured by government securities or a segregated deposit account. A violation of these restrictions could result in the assessment of substantial civil monetary penalties, the imposition of a cease-and-desist order or other regulatory sanctions. 

&#160;

&#160;

Banking agency guidance for commercial real estate lending In December 2006 the FDIC and other Federal banking agencies issued final guidance on sound risk management practices for concentrations in commercial real estate lending, including acquisition and development lending, construction lending, and other land loans, which recent experience has shown can be particularly high-risk lending. 

&#160;

The commercial real estate risk management guidance does not impose rigid limits on commercial real estate lending but does create a much sharper supervisory focus on the risk management practices of banks with concentrations in commercial real estate lending. According to the guidance, an institution that has experienced rapid growth in commercial real estate lending, has notable exposure to a specific type of commercial real estate, or is approaching or exceeds the following supervisory criteria may be identified for further supervisory analysis of the level and nature of its commercial real estate concentration risk &#8211; 

&#160;

&#160; - total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land represent 100% or more of the institution&#8217;s total capital, or &#160; - total commercial real estate loans represent 300% or more of the institution&#8217;s total capital and the outstanding balance of the institution&#8217;s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased by 50% or more during the prior 36 months. &#160;

These measures are intended merely to enable the banking agencies to quickly identify institutions that could have an excessive commercial real estate lending concentration, potentially requiring close supervision to ensure that the institutions have sound risk management practices in place. Conversely, these measures do not imply that banks are authorized by the December 2006 guidance to accumulate a commercial real estate lending concentration up to the 100% and 300% thresholds. 

&#160; 

Corporate Governance and Compensation The Federal banking agencies jointly published their final Guidance on Sound Incentive Compensation Policies in June of 2010. The goal of the guidance is to enable financial organizations to manage the safety and soundness risks of incentive compensation arrangements and to assist banks and bank holding companies with identification of improperly-structured compensation arrangements. To ensure that incentive compensation arrangements do not encourage employees to take excessive risks that undermine safety and soundness, the incentive compensation guidance sets forth these key principles &#8211; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#8226; 

incentive compensation arrangements should provide employees incentives that appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose the organization to imprudent risk,

&#160; &#8226; these arrangements should be compatible with effective controls and risk management, and &#160; &#8226; these arrangements should be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the board of directors. &#160;

To implement the interagency guidance, a financial organization must regularly review incentive compensation arrangements for all executive and non-executive employees who, either individually or as part of a group, have the ability to expose the organization to material amounts of risk, also reviewing the risk-management, control, and corporate governance processes related to these arrangements. The organization must immediately correct any identified deficiencies in compensation arrangements or processes that are inconsistent with safety and soundness. 

&#160; 

In addition to numerous provisions that affect the business of banks and bank holding companies, the DFA includes in Title IX a number of provisions affecting corporate governance and executive compensation, for example the requirements that stockholders be given the opportunity to consider and vote upon executive compensation disclosed in a company&#8217;s annual meeting proxy statement, that a company&#8217;s compensation committee be comprised entirely of independent directors and that the committee have stated minimum authorities, that company policy provide for recovery of excess incentive compensation after an accounting restatement, and that stockholders have the ability to designate director nominees for inclusion in a company&#8217;s annual meeting proxy statement. Section 956 also provides for adoption of incentive compensation guidelines jointly by the Federal banking agencies and the SEC, the National Credit Union Administration, and the Federal Housing Finance Agency. 

&#160; 

Community Reinvestment Act Under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 and implementing regulations of the banking agencies, a financial institution has a continuing and affirmative obligation &#8212; consistent with safe and sound operation &#8212; to address the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions, nor does it limit an institution&#8217;s discretion to develop the types of products and services it believes are best suited to its particular community. The CRA requires that bank regulatory agencies conduct regular CRA examinations and provide written evaluations of institutions&#8217; CRA performance. The CRA also requires that an institution&#8217;s CRA performance rating be made public. CRA performance evaluations are based on a four-tiered rating system: Outstanding, Satisfactory, Needs to Improve and Substantial Noncompliance. 

&#160; 

Although CRA examinations occur on a regular basis, CRA performance evaluations have been used principally in the evaluation of regulatory applications submitted by an institution. CRA performance evaluations are considered in evaluating applications for such things as mergers, acquisitions, and applications to open branches. 

&#160;

MBC&#8217;s CRA performance evaluation dated December 2, 2013 states that MBC&#8217;s CRA rating is &#8220;Satisfactory.&#8221;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Federal Home Loan Bank The Federal Home Loan Bank serves as a credit source for their members. As a member of the FHLB of Cincinnati, MBC is required to maintain an investment in the capital stock of the FHLB of Cincinnati in an amount calculated by reference to the FHLB member bank&#8217;s amount of loans, and or &#8220;advances,&#8221; from the FHLB. 

&#160; 

Each FHLB is required to establish standards of community investment or service that its members must maintain for continued access to long-term advances from the FHLB. The standards take into account a member&#8217;s performance under the Community Reinvestment Act and its record of lending to first-time home buyers. 

&#160; 

Anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism legislation The Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 requires financial institutions to maintain records and report transactions to prevent the financial institutions from being used to hide money derived from criminal activity and tax evasion. The Bank Secrecy Act establishes (a) record keeping requirements to assist government enforcement agencies with tracing financial transactions and flow of funds, (b) reporting requirements for Suspicious Activity Reports and Currency Transaction Reports to assist government enforcement agencies with detecting patterns of criminal activity, (c) enforcement provisions authorizing criminal and civil penalties for illegal activities and violations of the Bank Secrecy Act and its implementing regulations, and (d) safe harbor provisions that protect financial institutions from civil liability for their cooperative efforts. 

&#160; 

The Treasury&#8217;s Office of Foreign Asset Control administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions against targeted foreign countries, entities, and individuals based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals. As a result, financial institutions must scrutinize transactions to ensure that they do not represent obligations of or ownership interests in entities owned or controlled by sanctioned targets. 

&#160; 

Signed into law on October 26, 2001, the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 is omnibus legislation enhancing the powers of domestic law enforcement organizations to resist the international terrorist threat to United States security. Title III of the legislation, the International Money Laundering Abatement and Financial Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001, most directly affects the financial services industry, enhancing the Federal government&#8217;s ability to fight money laundering through monitoring of currency transactions and suspicious financial activities. The Act has significant implications for depository institutions and other businesses involved in the transfer of money &#8211; 

&#160; 

&#160; - 

a financial institution must establish due diligence policies, procedures, and controls reasonably designed to detect and report money laundering through correspondent accounts and private banking accounts, 

&#160; 

&#160; - 

no bank may establish, maintain, administer, or manage a correspondent account in the United States for a foreign shell bank, 

&#160; 

&#160; - 

financial institutions must abide by Treasury Department regulations encouraging financial institutions, their regulatory authorities, and law enforcement authorities to share information about individuals, entities, and organizations engaged in or suspected of engaging in terrorist acts or money laundering activities, 

&#160; 

&#160; - 

financial institutions must follow Treasury Department regulations setting forth minimum standards regarding customer identification. These regulations require financial institutions to implement reasonable procedures for verifying the identity of any person seeking to open an account, maintain records of the information used to verify the person&#8217;s identity, and consult lists of known or suspected terrorists and terrorist organizations provided to the financial institution by government agencies, 

&#160; 

&#160; - 

every financial institution must establish anti-money laundering programs, including the development of internal policies and procedures, designation of a compliance officer, employee training, and an independent audit function. 

&#160; 

Consumer protection laws and regulations . The Middlefield Banking Company is subject to regular examination by the FDIC to ensure compliance with statutes and regulations applicable to the bank&#8217;s business, including consumer protection statutes and implementing regulations, some of which are discussed below. Violations of any of these laws may result in fines, reimbursements, and other related penalties. 

&#160; 

Equal Credit Opportunity Act . The Equal Credit Opportunity Act generally prohibits discrimination in any credit transaction, whether for consumer or business purposes, on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age (except in limited circumstances), receipt of income from public assistance programs, or good faith exercise of any rights under the Consumer Credit Protection Act. 

&#160; 

Truth in Lending Act . The Truth in Lending Act is designed to ensure that credit terms are disclosed in a meaningful way so that consumers may compare credit terms more readily and knowledgeably.

Monetary Policy The earnings of financial institutions are affected by the policies of regulatory authorities, including monetary policy of the Federal Reserve Board. An important function of the Federal Reserve System is regulation of aggregate national credit and money supply. The Federal Reserve Board accomplishes these goals with measures such as open market transactions in securities, establishment of the discount rate on bank borrowings, and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits. These methods are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distribution of financial institutions&#8217; loans, investments and deposits, and they also affect interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits. Monetary policy is influenced by many factors, including inflation, unemployment, short-term and long-term changes in the international trade balance, and fiscal policies of the United States government. Federal Reserve Board monetary policy has had a significant effect on the operating results of financial institutions in the past, and it can be expected to influence operating results in the future.
