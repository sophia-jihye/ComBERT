 ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS. 

1. Organizational History 

The Company was formed as a limited liability company under the laws of the State of New York on June 17, 2005 as &#8220;Vycor Medical LLC&#8221;. On August 14, 2007, we converted into a Delaware corporation and changed our name to &#8220;Vycor Medical, Inc.&#8221;. The Company&#8217;s listing went effective on February 2009 and on November 29, 2010 Vycor completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of NovaVision, Inc. (&#8220;NovaVision&#8221;) and on January 4, 2012 Vycor, through its wholly-owned NovaVision subsidiary, completed the acquisition of all the shares of Sight Science Limited (&#8220;Sight Science&#8221;), a previous competitor to NovaVision. 

2. Overview of Business 

Vycor is dedicated to providing the medical community with innovative and superior surgical and therapeutic solutions and operates two distinct business units within the medical industry. Vycor Medical designs, develops and markets medical devices for use in neurosurgery. NovaVision provides non-invasive rehabilitation therapies for those who have vision disorders resulting from neurological brain damage such as that caused by a stroke. 

Both businesses adopt a minimally or non-invasive approach. Both technologies have strong sales growth potential, address large potential markets and have the requisite regulatory approvals. The Company has 46 issued or allowed patents and a further 13 pending. The Company leverages joint resources across the divisions to operate in a cost-efficient manner. 

In addition to our existing products and products in development we actively seek acquisition, joint venture and in-licensing opportunities in the medical device field which we believe are complementary, can benefit from our existing infrastructure and will add shareholder value.

Vycor Medical 

Introduction 

Vycor Medical designs, develops and markets medical devices for use in neurosurgery. Vycor Medical&#8217;s ViewSite Brain Access System (&#8220;VBAS&#8221;) is a next generation retraction and access system that was fully commercialized in early 2010 and is the first significant technological change to brain tissue retraction in over 50 years in contrast to significant development in most other neuro-surgical technologies. Vycor Medical is ISO 13485:2003 compliant, and VBAS has U.S. FDA 510(k) clearance and CE Marking for Europe (Class III) for brain and spine surgeries, full regulatory approvals in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Korea and Japan and is seeking or has partial regulatory approvals in India, Russia, Taiwan and Vietnam. 

Vycor Medical&#8217;s Products 

VBAS 

To access a surgical site in the brain, a surgeon usually needs to remove part of the skull (craniotomy) and then make an entry incision in the outer protective brain tissue (corticotomy); the soft brain tissue is then parted (retracted) to access the targeted site. The current standard of care, the blade retractor, utilizes a metal blade retractor to pull the tissue apart; to maintain the opening the blades are attached to a head frame and parting tension is applied to the tissue. In a typical procedure 2 or more blades are used. 

Many clinical studies have shown that retractors can cause excessive pressure on brain tissues, resulting in damage and a prolonged patient recovery. The incidence of contusions (tissue injuries) or infarctions (blockage of blood supply) from brain retraction is as great as 5-10%. 

Vycor&#8217;s VBAS is a significant improvement over current technologies for accessing regions within the brain. A disposable product that can be used with microscopic, endoscopic and neuro-navigation systems (IGS), the VBAS includes an introducer and working channel. Available in multiple sizes, the current series consists of 12 disposable products, offered in four different port (working channel) diameters of 12mm, 17mm, 21mm, and 28 mm and a choice of three lengths: 3cm, 5cm, and 7cm; two new sizes with diameters of 6mm and lengths of 5cm and 7cm were introduced in March 2016. The surgeon makes a smaller corticotomy, inserts the clear, elliptical-shaped VBAS introducer through the brain tissue, removes the introducer and is left with a clear hollow working channel to provide access to the precise location desired for surgery. 

VBAS&#8217; clinical advantages are supported by a number of leading peer-reviewed articles (see Peer Review and Other Clinical Studies) . Clinical benefits cited include: minimally invasive shape and less invasive procedure; resultant reduction of pressure on the brain; improved visual field; improved working channel; and more accurate target access. Management also believes, from anecdotal surgeon feedback, that although a disposable product VBAS offers potential cost savings from shorter operating theater time and reduced post-operative recovery time. 

The Market For Vycor Medical&#8217;s VBAS Product 

VBAS is used for craniotomy procedures. Based on statistics from the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS), management estimates 700,000 such procedures are performed in the US annually. Of this, management believe approximately 200,000 (28 percent) are addressable by the VBAS range currently, with another 125,000 (total of 325,000 or 46 percent) addressable by an expanded future range. Management estimates, for the global market, there exists a current addressable market of approximately 1,000,000 procedures with another 600,000 addressable by an expanded VBAS range. 

Competition 

The VBAS device is both a brain access system and a retractor and is therefore unique with no direct competitors. Competitive manufacturers of brain retractors include Cardinal Health (V. Mueller line), Aesculap, Integra Life Science and Codman (Division of Johnson &#38; Johnson). Nico Corporation has a brain access device specifically designed to work with its Myriad resection and suction product. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Sales and Marketing 

Domestic 

According to the American Board of Neurological Surgery (ABNS), there are approximately 3,500 neurosurgeons in the US, providing a well-defined target audience. Vycor Medical&#8217;s sales channels are to stocking regional distributors and direct to hospitals through independent representatives, all of whom have existing relationships with neurosurgeons and provide an experienced and efficient distribution infrastructure without the need for a large and costly dedicated Vycor regional sales team. The distributors and representatives are supported by Vycor Medical Sales, Marketing and Customer Service. 

Vycor Medical has found that the learning curve is only 1-2 cases for surgeons, who like the simplicity of design and ease of use after trialing the product. However, Hospital Administration is required to approve the purchase of a new product and sometimes even a trial or evaluation of the product in the hospital by the neurosurgeon and this is one of the key barriers to the speed of adoption as this process can take several months. 

International Sales 

Vycor Medical utilizes select medical device distributors with experience in neurosurgical devices in their countries or regions. Vycor Medical has regulatory approvals for VBAS in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe (Class III), Korea and Japan and is seeking or has partial regulatory approvals in India, Russia, Taiwan and Vietnam with distribution agreements in place or being sought. 

Peer Review and Other Clinical Studies 

The publication of clinical papers in neurosurgery journals by surgeon-users of VBAS regarding their experiences with the products (peer review papers), and the publication of other clinical data, is important for Vycor Medical. Such papers continue to evidence the clinical superiority of VBAS, which in turn drives its adoption and accelerates the hospital approval process, which in turn drives revenues. To date the Company has already had 9 Peer Reviewed published and 4 other clinical papers, including the following during 2015: 

&#9679; 

&#8220;Endoscopic hematoma evacuation in patients with spontaneous supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage&#8221;. Published in the Journal of the Chinese Medical Association, Feb 2015. By Wei-Hsin Wang, Yi-Chieh Hung, Sanford P.C. Hsu, Chun-Fu Lin, Hsin-Hung Chen, Yang-Hsin Shih, Cheng-Chia Lee of the Taipei Veterans General Hospital, and National Yang-Ming University School of Medicine. Taipei, Taiwan Conclusion: &#8220;With the introduction of the minimally invasive techniques and the evolution of the neuro-endoscope and hemostatic agents the median operative time and blood loss have been significantly decreased. Although the hematoma evacuation rates were similar between the endoscope (90%) and craniotomy (85%) groups, the median intensive care unit stay was decreased from 11 days to 6 days due to reduced surgical invasiveness. In addition, several series have reported a lower rate of rebleeding, morbidity and mortality in endoscopic hematoma evacuation surgery than in traditional craniotomy. The main reasons were less adjacent tissue injury, less blood loss, and less operation time. True minimally invasive surgery includes not only a minimal wound size but also minimal brain tissue trauma during the surgery&#8221;. 

&#9679; 

&#8220;Rigid endoscopic resection of deep-seated or intraventricular brain tumors&#8221;, by Yukinori Akiyama, Masahiko Wanibuchi, Takeshi Mikami, Yoshifumi Horita, of the Dept of Neurosurgery, Sapporo Medical University, School of Medicine, Hokkaido Japan. Published in Neurological Research, Mar 2015. Conclusion: Strong retraction may cause significant brain and vascular damage; tubular retractors can help minimize retraction injury. The rigid endoscopic technique using a thick tubular sheath [VBAS] provides an alternative medial approach that improves visualization and increases working space. We believe that this technique [rigid endoscope resection through a sheath] is a safer, more reliable, and less invasive method for the treatment of deep-seated brain tumors. 

&#9679; 

&#8220;3D Endoscope Transcallosal Approach to the Third Ventricle&#8221; by Alireza Shoakazemi, Alexander I. Evins, Justin C. Burrell, Philip E. Stieg and Antonio Bernardo of the Weill Cornell Medical Center. Published in The Journal of Neurosurgery, Mar 2015. Conclusion: A transtubular approach [utilizing VBAS] to the third ventricle is feasible and facilitates blunt dissection of the corpus callosum that may minimize retraction injury. This technique also provides an added degree of safety by limiting the free range of instrumental movement. The combination of 3D endoscopic visualization with a clear plastic retractor facilitates safe and direct monitoring of the surgical corridor. 

&#9679; 

&#8220;Microsurgical resection for lateral ventricular meningiomas with neuronavigation and tubular retractor&#8221;. Published in the China J Neurosurgery, April 2015. By Xiong Tao, Wanggou Siyi, Chen Xiaoyu, Peng Zefeng, Liu Qing, Yan Xianrui, Li Xuejun, Dpartment of Neurosurgery , Xiangya Hospital, Central South University; Changsha, China. Conclusion: The study&#8217;s objective was to study the microsurgical modality for lateral ventrical meningiomas with neuronavigation and tubular retractor system [VBAS] and evaluate its long term outcome. The study concluded that the use of neuronavigation and the VBAS does not reduce the ability to achieve total tumor resection but did have a positive post operative impact through reduced intra operative brain trauma and reduced intra operative complications. The study concluded that it led to an improvement in post-operative quality of life. 

&#9679; 

&#8220;Exoscope-Assisted Surgery for Deep-Seated Intraparenchymal Tumor&#8221;. Published in the Jpn J Neurosurg April 2015. Hideo Osada, M.D., Kimihiro Nagatani, M.D., Terushige Toyooka, M.D. Kojiro Wada, M.D., Naoki Otani, M.D., Arata Tomiyama, M.D., Satoshi Tomura, M.D., Hideaki Ueno, M.D., and Kentaro Mori, M.D of the Department of Neurosurgery, National Defense Medical College and Department of Neurosurgery, Kuki General Hospital. Conclusion: &#8220;The exoscope can provide a long working distance and a clear view from outside the operation field, so combined use with the ViewSite is very promising for surgery of deep-seated tumors&#8221;. 

&#9679; 

&#8220;Use of a Minimally Invasive Retractor System for Retrieval of Intracranial Fragments in Wartime Trauma&#8221;. Published in the World Neurosurgery, May 2015. George N. Rymarczuk, Laurence Davidson, Meryl A. Severson, Rocco A. Armonda of the Walter Reed Army Medical Center and the National Naval Medical Center Conclusion: &#8220;Wartime penetrating brain injury can result in deep-seated shrapnel, bullets and bone, posing risk of secondary injury. It has been recommended that aggressive removal of fragments be avoided. The goal of this study it to report our technique of minimally invasive removal of deep-seated fragments using a tubular retractor system [VBAS]. The authors feel that this technique offers a valid and safe option for treatment of patients that have incurred penetrating brain injuries and that have retained foreign bodies under circumstances in which removal is desirable&#8221;. In all cases the fragment was successfully removed. No patient had worsening of their neurological condition following surgery. The study concluded, &#8220;With this series of 6 service-members the authors have shown that VBAS can be used to successfully remove deep-seated foreign bodies from injuries sustained in war. Deep parenchymal and intraventricular fragments can be safely removed using a tubular retractor system [VBAS]&#8221; 

&#9679; 

&#8220;Single-Port Endoscopic Technique for the Treatement of Primary Intracerebral Hemorrhage&#8221; poster presented at the VII World Congress of Neuroendoscopy held in Mexico, November 2015. By Juan Antonio Ponce-Gomez M.D. Luis Alverto Ortega-Porcayo M.D. Victor Alcocer-Barradas M.D. Juan Barges-Coll M.D. Juan Luis Gomez Amador M.D.Department of Neurological Surgery, National Institute of Neurology and Neurosurgery &#8220;Manuel Velasco Suarez&#8221; Mexico City, Mexico. In a retrospective study done three different treatments were compared; medical management and observation, hematoma drainage through a single port [VBAS] with endoscopic assistance and finally drainage through a conventional crainiotomy. 64 patients were analysed 28 patients underwent medical treatment, 24 patients conventional crainiotomy and 12 patients were treated with the VBAS. Main risk in all cases was hypertension. The study showed that complete drainage using the VBAS was achieved in 83.3% of cases and that the average stay in hospital was 8 days which was statistically significantly shorter than the other two groups. Mortality after 6 months was also statistically significantly better than the medical treatment group. Conclusion: Treatment using the endoscope and VBAS offers lower morbidity and fewer days of hospital stay in the management of primary supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage.

Vycor Growth Strategy 

Vycor Medical&#8217;s growth strategy is centered around: 

1. Increasing U.S. market penetration through broader hospital coverage and targeted direct physician marketing. 

Vycor Medical&#8217;s sales and marketing strategy is to penetrate a well defined target market of 4,500 neurosurgeons by trade shows, significantly increased direct marketing with VBAS samples and existing clinical data, and through its existing distributors which it is continually evaluating and upgrading as well as adding additional distributors in regions where it has little to no presence. In marketing to these hospitals and surgeons, Vycor Medical leads with those neurosurgical procedures where VBAS&#8217; competitive advantages are most easily understood &#8211; deep seated tumors and other complicated deep procedures. The focus is both on adding new hospitals and expanding to additional surgeons in hospitals where VBAS is already approved and to expand usage to a broader range of procedures. Vycor Medical prioritizes its attention on teaching hospitals, which not only carry out more relevant procedures but also provide a natural way to drive adoption through the conversion of new surgeons. 

2. Provision of more Clinical and Scientific Data supporting the products superiority over the current standard of care blade retractors and to demonstrate the products potential for cost savings. Clinical and scientific data (in the form of peer reviewed articles, clinical studies and other reports and case studies) are critical in driving adoption, and in turn revenues, further and faster by demonstrating VBAS' superiority as a minimally invasive access system which helps VBAS move further up the hospital cost/benefit curve. To date the Company has already had 9 Peer Reviewed studies and 4 other clinical papers and anticipates further studies to be published. 

3. International Market Growth 

Vycor Medical utilizes select medical device distributors with experience in neurosurgical devices in their countries or regions. VBAS has full regulatory approvals in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe (EU &#8211; Class III), Korea, Japan and Taiwan and is seeking or has partial regulatory approvals in India, Russia and Vietnam. Vycor Medical is actively pursuing new distribution agreements in the countries where it does not have any in place. 

4 . New Product Development 

New Product Development is targeted at both driving the use of its existing VBAS product range through ancillaries that will facilitate the product&#8217;s use and through new product extensions to broaden VBAS applicability to procedures currently not addressed by the existing product line. 

Vycor Medical has a current product pipeline aimed at expanding the applicable procedures it addresses by extending its VBAS range and at increasing the compatibility of its current VBAS range. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Vycor Medical released two new smaller VBAS devices (the "VBAS Mini") in March 2016, and is in the advanced stages of development on a new set of VBAS devices that will be integrated with selected Image Guided Systems. Management strongly believes that the existing VBAS rigid structure lends itself well to being incorporated into the increasing trend of IGS surgery. 

NovaVision, Inc. 

Introduction 

NovaVision provides non-invasive, computer-based rehabilitation targeted at a substantial and largely un-addressed market of people who have lost their sight as a result of stroke, Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) or other neurological brain damage. NovaVision addresses a significant target market, estimated at approximately $2 billion in each of the U.S. and the EU and over $13 billion globally. 

NovaVision has a family of therapies that both restore and compensate for lost vision: 

&#9679; 

Restoration of vision: NovaVision&#8217;s VRT and Sight Science&#8217;s Neuro-Eye Therapy (NeET), aim to improve visual sensitivity in a persons blind area. VRT delivers a series of light stimuli along the border of the patient&#8217;s visual field loss. These programmed light sequences stimulate the border zone between the &#8220;seeing&#8221; and &#8220;blind&#8221; visual fields, repetitively challenging the visual cortex in the border zone with multiple stimuli over the course of time. NeET targets deep within the blind area by repeated stimulation, allowing patients to detect objects within the blind field. 

&#9679; 

Compensation and re-training: Normal eye movements are also affected after brain injury adding to the problems of blindness. NeuroEyeCoach provides a complementary therapy to VRT and NeET, which re-trains a patient to move their eyes, re-integrate left and right vision and to make the most of their remaining visual field. 

&#160; 

VRT and NeuroEyeCoach, provided in the US in an Internet-delivered suite since June 2015 and in Europe since December 2015, are therefore highly complementary and ensure broad benefits to NovaVision's patients. 

NovaVision also has models of VRT and NeuroEyeCoach for physicians and rehabilitation clinics, as well as VIDIT, a diagnostic program that enables therapists to perform high resolution visual field tests in less than ten minutes. 

NovaVision operates in the US through our wholly-owned subsidiary, NovaVision, Inc., in Germany through our wholly-owned subsidiary, NovaVision GmbH and in the UK through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Sight Science Limited. 

NovaVision&#8217;s VRT is the only medical device aimed at the restoration of vision lost as a result of neurological damage which has FDA 510(k) clearance to be marketed in the U.S; and NeuroEyeCoach is registered in the US as a Class I 510(k) exempt device. VRT, NEC and NeET have CE Marking for the EU. NovaVision has 35 granted and 3 pending patents worldwide. 

NovaVision&#8217;s Products 

VRT and NeET 

VRT and NeET are aimed at those suffering from vision loss resulting from neurological brain damage such as stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI). It is estimated that approximately 30% experience a visual field disorder (or which approximately 20% permanently), reducing mobility and other activities of daily living. 

Both VRT and NeET work on the basis that repeated stimulation of the blind or transition areas by either bright patches of light (VRT) or specific spatial patterns (NeET) can lead to increases in sensitivity of the blind areas. Patient progress after VRT appears to be initiated at the blind and sighted borders whereas NeET results in changes deep within the blind field. Both therapies are able to demonstrate improvements in both visual sensitivity and activities of daily living. 

VRT and NeET are patient-specific diagnostic and therapeutic platforms with extensive clinical data supporting their ability to increase a patient&#8217;s visual field. The diagnostic algorithm first maps the visual field and defines the areas of defect in patients suffering vision loss. The therapeutic algorithm is then specifically designed for each patient based upon the results of the diagnostic program. The therapies are delivered through a computer device in the patient&#8217;s home and are generally performed over a six month period, twice a day for approximately an hour total, five to six days a week. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

With VRT therapy, the patient first focuses on a fixation point on a display screen. Then, a series of light stimuli are presented along the border of the patient&#8217;s visual field loss. These programmed light sequences stimulate the border zone between the &#8220;seeing&#8221; and &#8220;blind&#8221; visual fields, repetitively challenging the visual cortex in the border zone with thousands of stimuli over the course of the therapy. With NeET, the patient responds to the images that appear on the screen, initially in the border area of the patient&#8217;s visual field loss and over time deeper within the damaged field of vision. 

NeuroEyeCoach 

NeuroEyeCoach is also a computer-based program providing eye-movement training to those who have suffered a visual field loss as a result of neurological damage. 

The program is supported by several decades of scientific findings and was developed as collaboration between NovaVision and Josef Zihl, a NovaVision Scientific Advisor who is a world thought leader in saccadic training and the pioneer of this computer based training technique. The program is designed to re-train the ability of a patient to scan the environment, re-integrate left and right vision and make the most of their remaining visual field. The therapy can be completed in two to four weeks to result in a meaningful improvement in the patients visual search performance resulting in improvements in their navigation and object finding skills. Given that NeuroEyeCoach addresses the patient&#8217;s difficulty with their eye movements and their ability to integrate visual information while VRT and NeET focuses on the restoration of lost vision the two therapy types are highly complementary. 

NeuroEyeCoach is provided by NovaVision in one Internet-delivered therapy suite with VRT, providing broad benefits to patients, and is also provided on a standalone basis; those suffering non-permanent defects or those otherwise unsuited to VRT can benefit from NeuroEyeCoach. The program is also provided as a clinic-based version to enable healthcare professionals to provide the therapy to patients under supervision. 

Vision Diagnostic (VIDIT) 

NovaVision VIDIT is a diagnostic system that enables therapists in rehabilitation centers and other clinics to perform high-resolution visual field tests to screen for central visual field deficits commonly associated with stroke or brain injury. As an undetected visual field deficit may adversely impact other rehabilitation modalities, early detection and treatment are critical steps towards improving overall patient care and this diagnostic is therefore a valuable tool for such centers and clinics. Tests take less than 10 minutes while the patient is in the facility&#8217;s care. 

The Market For NovaVision&#8217;s Therapies 

The market for NovaVision&#8217;s therapies comprises those suffering from vision loss resulting from neurological trauma such as Stroke and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates there are approximately 8 million Americans who have previously had a stroke incident, with 795,000 additional strokes occurring annually; adjusting for repeat strokes and deaths, there are 481,000 new stroke survivors each year. Additionally, approximately 5.3 million Americans live with the long-term effects of a TBI, with 275,000 hospitalizations each year. The most recent scientific research estimates that approximately 28.5% experience some visual impediment and 20.5% of these patients experience a permanent visual field deficit, reducing mobility and other activities of daily living. The target market for VRT and NeET is this 20.5% subset of patients who have suffered a permanent visual field deficit; NeuroEyeCoach addresses all 28.5% of patients who experience visual impediments. Management estimates that the addressable target market for its therapies is approximately 2.9 million people in the US, approximately 2.8 million people in Europe and approximately 12.9 million people throughout the rest of the world. 

Competition 

NovaVision provides restoration therapies (VRT and NeET) and compensation or saccadic therapies (NeuroEyeCoach) for those suffering vision loss as a result of neurological trauma. The other therapy type for this condition is substitution (optical aids such as prisms) and is not considered by NovaVision as competition. 

In restoration, competition has been reduced through NovaVision&#8217;s acquisition of Sight Science and really only leaves two small companies, Teltra and Visiontrainer in Germany. Within compensation, competitors include RevitalVision, PositScience, Dynavision and Rehacom. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Clinical Data 

VRT 

NovaVision has accumulated significant amounts of clinical data as a result of company-sponsored trials as well as studies conducted by independent third parties, of which some of the key findings can be summarized as: 

&#9679; 

Approximately 70% of patients experience positive outcome reflected by an increase in their visual field and studies have indicated an average increase of 4.9 degrees (Mueller I, et al., 2007; Romano JG, et al., 2008). 

&#9679; 

Elapsed time since injury does not seem to impact VRT and NeET therapies success. Therefore, a large historical backlog of patients can potentially be treated (Romano JG, et al., 2008). 

&#9679; 

Improvements are permanent and do not appear to be age or gender dependent. 

NeuroEyeCoach 

The PC-based treatment approach was originally developed by Prof. Zihl (1988, 1990) and has since been used with various modifications in 13 studies on a total of 551 patients with homonymous visual field loss and persistent visual disabilities. 

The main outcome is a significant improvement in visual search performance accompanied by more efficient oculomotor strategies, and a reduction in visual disability as assessed with standardized questionnaires and behavioral measures. The efficacy of this treatment approach for the improvement of visual overview and visual exploration is superior to practice with reading (Schuett et al., 2012), non-specific visual training (Roth et al., 2009), standard occupational therapy (M&#246;dden et al., 2012) or counseling with regards to coping strategies (Zihl, 2011). Importantly, time since brain injury (Zihl, 2011) and age of hemianopic patients (Schuett &#38; Zihl, 2012) d not play a significant role for the treatment effect. In conclusion, there is convincing scientific empirical evidence for the efficacy of the visual search treatment method. It is important to note that visual field borders do not change after the treatment, indicating that visual search training represents a compensatory technique and not a restorative approach; by addressing both compensation and restoration NovaVision is providing a broad solution to this large patient demographic.

NovaVision&#8217;s Growth Strategy 

Our strategic vision for NovaVision has been to develop and provide a clinically supported, affordable and scalable visual therapy solution offering broad benefits to those suffering visual impairment following neurological brain damage; and to offer solutions for both patients and physicians alike. VRT was, in effect, a prototype with a delivery and service model too costly to be affordable and scalable, and with 70% of patients experiencing significant positive outcome but 30% of patients therefore experiencing little to no improvement. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Our first steps were to build a world-class scientific advisory board and acquire Sight Science, the only credible competitor, from Prof. Arash Sahraie and the University of Aberdeen. Prof. Sahraie, Chair in Vision Sciences at the University, became our Chief Scientific Officer and led the advisory board made up of experts in the field from Harvard Medical School, Univ. of Miami Miller School of Medicine and the Max Planck Institute in Germany, to develop the strategy to deliver our vision: 

&#9679; 

Broadening Patient Benefits: the creation of NeuroEyeCoach . Two things happen when someone suffers from vision related disorders following a stroke or the like: there is a loss of visual field as well as difficulty with eye movement, affecting the ability to integrate visual information. NeuroEyeCoach addresses patients' difficulty with their eye movements and their ability to integrate visual information. While VRT addresses the restoration of lost vision, NeuroEyeCoach enables the patient to make the most of their remaining vision; the two therapies provided in a suite are therefore highly complementary and ensure broad benefits to NovaVision's patients. 

&#9679; 

Cost Effective and Affordable . Migrated therapy delivery from provided-hardware to internet-delivered onto patients' computers, significantly reducing cost without changing the therapy itself. Further cost reduction has been achieved through considerable business process streamlining. The Internet-delivered therapy suite was made commercially available in June 2015 in the US and in Europe in December 2015. 

&#9679; 

Scalable . NovaVision's therapy is now affordable, with broader benefits and truly scalable and deliverable to the mass market. 

NovaVision completed its development work and launched its Internet-based therapy suite in June 2015 in the US, and December 2015 in Europe, and is now positioned for the first time with the suite of therapies and product offerings to deliver on our strategic vision: to provide a clinically supported, affordable and scalable visual therapy solution offering broad benefits to those suffering visual impairment following neurological damage; and to offer solutions for both patients and physicians alike. 

For Patients: 

&#9679; 

VRT and NeuroEyeCoach Therapy Suite . NovaVision's two complementary therapies are offered in internet-delivered in a package for $900 in the US and equivalent pricing in Europe. 

&#9679; 

NeuroEyeCoach. For patients with visual impairments who are not suitable, for whatever reason, for VRT, we provide NeuroEyeCoach on its own for $450 in the US and equivalent pricing in Europe. 

For Physicians: 

&#9679; 

Vision Diagnostic (VIDIT). A diagnostic system that enables therapists to perform high-resolution visual field tests in less than 10 minutes to screen for visual field deficits as a result of neurological brain damage. NovaVision has received approval for and entered into an agreement to offer VIDIT throughout the 100+ network of HealthSouth rehabilitation centers in the U.S.; therapists are then able to refer patients to NovaVision. We are marketing this to the HealthSouth network as well as to other rehabilitation chains and centers.

NeuroEyeCoach Pro Center . Enables stroke rehabilitation and other centers to treat patients while in their care, both as in-patient and out-patient. NovaVision has entered into an additional agreement with HealthSouth to be able to offer NeuroEyeCoach Pro Center to the HealthSouth rehabilitation centers in the U.S. We are marketing this to the HealthSouth network as well as to other rehabilitation chains and centers. 

&#9679; 

NovaVision Pro Physician. Enables physicians to register patients in their clinic who complete our therapies at home, supported by NovaVision but monitored by the physician through a dedicated portal. 

We believe NovaVision's therapy and product offerings for patients and physicians are unique, and that we are now well placed to deliver value from this large potential market.

3. Other Matters 

Product Liability Insurance 

We presently have Product Liability insurance for both Vycor Medical and NovaVision. 

Government Regulations 

We are committed to an integrated total quality management system. We believe that we have completed the necessary procedures and Vycor Medical is certified to the ISO standards expected of medical device manufacturers as follows: 

ISO 13485:2003 Medical Devices &#8212; Quality Management Systems 

The certification of a quality management system to ISO 13485, specifically for medical devices, is advantageous and often essential for medical companies to export their products to the global market, as well as maintain and enter into certain agreements and business growth opportunities within the U.S. For example, Canada requires that medical device manufacturers marketing their products in Canada must have a quality system certified to ISO 13485:2003. The certification is also required for placement of branded devices into the European Union. 

Vycor Medical has the following certification/licensing: 

&#9679; 

Fully Quality Assurance System Directive 93/42/EEC for Medical Devices, Annex II (3) 

&#9679; 

EC Design-Examination Certificate Directive 93/42/EEC for Medical Devices, Annex II (4) 

&#9679; 

ISO 13485.2003 

Continuing Regulatory Requirements 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

quality system regulation, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process; 

&#9679; 

labeling regulations, which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or &#8220;off-label&#8221; uses and impose other restrictions on labeling; and 

&#9679; 

medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur. 

&#160; 

Vycor Medical&#8217;s products have been classified as Class II products by the FDA and cleared for marketing through the 510(k) process. NovaVision&#8217;s VRT product has been cleared as a Class U product through the 510(k) while its NeuroEyeCoach is registered as an exempt Class 1 device. 

After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include: 

&#160; 

Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, and failure to respond to requested corrective actions on an ongoing basis, can result in enforcement action by the FDA. 

&#160; 

Medical device laws are also in effect in many of the countries outside of the United States in which we do business. These laws range from comprehensive device approval and quality system requirements for some or all of our medical device products to simple requests for product data or certifications. The number and scope of these requirements are increasing. In June 1998, the European Union Medical Device Directive became effective, and all medical devices must meet the Medical Device Directive standards and receive CE mark certification. CE mark certification involves a comprehensive Quality System program, and submission of data on a product to the Notified Body in Europe. 

&#160; 

Vycor Medical has obtained the CE marking approval to allow for distribution of its VBAS products in Europe as a Class III device and has received HPB licensing approval for distribution in Canada as a Class II device. VBAS also has full regulatory or partial approvals in Australia, Brazil, China, Korea, Japan and Russia. NovaVison&#8217;s VRT, NeuroEyeCoach and Sight Science&#8217;s NeET have CE mark registrations as Class I devices in Europe.
