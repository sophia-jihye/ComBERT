The disclosures set forth in this item are qualified by Item 1A. Risk Factors, and the section captioned &#8220;Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements&#8221; in Item 7. &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; of this report and other cautionary statements set forth elsewhere in this report. 

&#160; 

General 

&#160;

Allegiance Bancshares, Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is a Texas corporation and registered bank holding company headquartered in Houston, Texas. Through the Company&#8217;s wholly-owned subsidiary, Allegiance Bank (the &#8220;Bank&#8221;), it provides a diversified range of commercial banking services primarily to Houston metropolitan area-based small to medium-sized businesses, professionals and individual customers. The Company believes the size, growth and increasing economic diversity of the Houston metropolitan area, when combined with the Company&#8217;s super-community banking strategy, provides the Company with excellent opportunities for long-term, sustainable growth. The Company&#8217;s super-community banking strategy, which is described in more detail below, is designed to foster strong customer relationships while benefitting from a platform and scale that is competitive with larger local and regional banks. The Company believes this strategy presents a significant market advantage when serving small to medium-sized business customers and further enables the Company to attract talented bankers.

&#160;

The Company currently operates 16 full-service banking locations in the Houston metropolitan area. The Company has experienced significant growth since it began banking operations in 2007, resulting from both organic growth, including de novo branching, and two whole-bank acquisitions. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had total assets of $2.08 billion, total loans of $1.67 billion, total deposits of $1.76 billion and total stockholders&#8217; equity of $258.5 million.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s Initial Public Offering 

&#160;

The Company consummated the underwritten initial public offering of its common stock in October 2015. The Company&#8217;s common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Market under the ticker symbol ABTX.

&#160;

Business Strategy 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s objective is to grow and strengthen its community banking franchise by deploying its super-community banking strategy and by pursuing select strategic acquisitions in the Houston metropolitan area. The Company is positioned to be a leading provider of personalized commercial banking services by emphasizing the strength and capabilities of local bank office management and by providing superior customer service. The Company has made the strategic decision to focus on the Houston metropolitan area because of the Company&#8217;s deep roots and experience operating through a variety of economic cycles in this large and vibrant market.

&#160;

Super-community banking strategy. The Company&#8217;s super-community banking strategy emphasizes community involvement by its directors, officers and employees, which allows the Company to be responsive in developing its products and services. The Company&#8217;s approach produces a clear competitive advantage by delivering an extraordinary customer experience and fostering a culture dedicated to achieving both superior external and internal service levels. Greater efficiency results from the Company&#8217;s focus on serving a select, but significant, portion of the overall banking market, and on the operational leverage that results from a market share driven by geographic concentration. The Company focuses on establishing personal relationships with customers through superior service, which is accomplished in part by empowering Company personnel to make certain business decisions at a local level in order to respond quickly to customers&#8217; needs. The Company emphasizes lending to and banking with small to medium-sized businesses, for which it believes loans can be priced on terms that are more attractive to the Company than would be achieved by lending to larger businesses. The Company operates full-service decentralized branches and employs lenders with strong underwriting credentials who are authorized to make loan and underwriting decisions up to prescribed limits at the branch level. The Company supports branch operations with a centralized credit approval process for larger credit relationships, loan operations, information technology, core data processing, accounting, finance, treasury and treasury management support, deposit operations and executive and board oversight.

&#160;

&#160;

The Company plans to continue to emphasize the super-community banking strategy to organically grow its presence in the Houston metropolitan area through:

&#160;

&#8226; increasing the productivity of existing bankers, as measured by loans, deposits and fee income per banker, while enhancing profitability by leveraging the Company&#8217;s existing operating platform;

&#160;

&#8226; focusing on local and individualized decision-making, allowing the Company to provide customers with rapid decisions on loan requests, which the Company believes allows it to effectively compete with larger financial institutions;

&#160;

&#8226; identifying and hiring additional seasoned bankers in the Company&#8217;s existing and target markets in the Houston metropolitan area who will thrive utilizing the Company&#8217;s super-community banking model, and opening additional branches where the Company is able to attract seasoned bankers; and

&#160;

&#8226; developing new products designed to serve the increasingly diversified Houston economy, while preserving the Company&#8217;s strong culture of risk management.

&#160;

Select strategic acquisitions. The Company intends to continue to expand its market position in the Houston metropolitan area through organic growth, including with the establishment of de novo branch locations, and through a disciplined acquisition strategy. The Company focuses on like-minded community banks with similar lending strategies to its own when evaluating acquisition opportunities. The Company believes that its management&#8217;s experience in assessing, executing and integrating target institutions will allow it to capitalize on acquisition opportunities. The following table summarizes, with preacquisition historical balances, the Company&#8217;s two acquisitions to date, both of which were Houston-based banks:

&#160;

&#160;

* On January 31, 2016, the Company completed the sale of two additional F&#38;M Bancshares branches acquired that were located in Central Texas and their related assets. See Item 7. &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Recent Developments.&#8221;

&#160; 

Competitive Strengths 

&#160; 

The Company believes that it is well positioned to execute its super-community banking strategy as a result of the following competitive strengths:

&#160;

&#8226; Experienced senior management team. The Company&#8217;s senior management team has a demonstrated track record of managing profitable organic growth, improving operating efficiencies, maintaining a strong risk management culture, implementing a community and service-focused approach to banking and successfully executing and integrating acquisitions. The Company&#8217;s board of directors has many years of combined experience in serving as directors and/or officers of financial institutions. The directors have a wide array of business experience and, as residents of the Company&#8217;s primary market area, participate in and support local community activities, which is a significant asset to the Company&#8217;s business development efforts and enables the Company to be responsive to the needs of its customers.

&#160;

&#8226; Scalable banking and operational platform designed to foster and accommodate significant growth. The Company has built a capable and knowledgeable staff by utilizing the extensive significant prior experience of the Company&#8217;s management team and employees. The Company has made significant investments in the technology and systems necessary to build a scalable corporate infrastructure with the capacity to support continued growth. The Company believes that its strong capital and asset quality position will allow it to grow and that the Company&#8217;s scalable operating platform will allow it to manage that growth effectively, resulting in greater efficiency and enhanced profitability.

&#160;

&#8226; Community-focused, full service customer relationships. The Company believes that its super-community banking strategy facilitates strong relationships with its customers. The Company is focused on delivering a wide variety of high-quality, relationship-driven commercial and community-oriented banking products and services tailored to meet the needs of small to medium-sized businesses, professionals and individuals in the Houston metropolitan area. The Company actively solicits the deposit business of its consumer and commercial loan customers and seeks to further leverage these relationships by cross-selling its products and services.

&#160;

&#160;

&#8226; Community Banking Services. Recent acquisitions of local financial institutions in the Houston metropolitan area by larger, more regionally focused competitors have led to a reduced number of locally-based competitors, and the Company believes this has created an underserved base of small to medium-sized businesses, professionals and individuals that are interested in banking with a company headquartered in, and with decision-making authority based in, the Houston metropolitan area. The Company seeks to develop comprehensive, long-term banking relationships with customers by cross-selling loans and core deposits, offering an array of products and services to support its loan and deposit activities while delivering high quality customer service. The Company&#8217;s products and services are tailored to address the needs of its targeted customers.

&#160;

&#8226; Focus on seasoned lenders . The Company believes its management team&#8217;s long-standing presence and experience in the Houston metropolitan area gives it valuable insight into the local market and the ability to successfully recruit talented lenders. The Company&#8217;s team of seasoned lenders has been the driver of its organic growth. The Company&#8217;s officer compensation structure, which includes equity grants, profit sharing and various incentive programs, motivates its lenders to increase the size of their loan and deposit portfolios and generate fee income while maintaining strong credit quality. The Company believes that its officer compensation programs attract talented lenders to the Company.

&#160;

&#8226; Disciplined underwriting and credit administration. The Company&#8217;s management, bankers, lending officers and credit administration team emphasize a strong culture of risk management that is supported by comprehensive policies and procedures for credit underwriting, funding and administration that enable the Company to maintain sound asset quality. The Company&#8217;s underwriting methodology emphasizes analysis of global cash flow coverage, loan to collateral value, and obtaining personal guaranties in all but a few well-secured cases. The Company&#8217;s tiered underwriting structure includes progressive levels of individual loan authority, concurrence authority and senior loan committee approval. The Company intends to continue to emphasize and adhere to these procedures and controls, which it believes has helped to minimize its level of loan charge-offs.

&#160;

&#8226; Focus on continual internal growth. Each banking location is operated as a separate profit center that maintains separate data with respect to its net interest income, efficiency ratio, deposit growth, loan growth and overall profitability. Bank Office Presidents and managers are accountable for performance in these areas and are compensated based on these performance metrics. The Company has centralized many of its critical operations, which are transparent to its customers, such as data and loan processing.

&#160;

&#8226; Diversified loan portfolio. The Company&#8217;s focus on loans to small to medium-sized businesses results in a more diversified portfolio of relatively smaller loan relationships, thus reducing the risks that result from a dependence on fewer but larger lending relationships. As of December 31, 2015, our average funded loan size was approximately $270 thousand. We do not lend directly to oil and gas exploration and production companies. As of December 31, 2015, 3.2% of our total loan portfolio is to customers in the oilfield services industry for whom the price of oil and gas has a significant operational or financial impact. Although the Company operates in the Houston metropolitan area, the Company believes that its lack of both direct lending to oil and gas exploration and production companies and reserve-based lending will reduce the effect to the Company&#8217;s business in the event of a prolonged period of lower oil and gas prices.

&#160; 

Lending Activities 

&#160; 

The Company offers a wide range of commercial and retail lending services, including commercial loans, mortgage loans, home equity loans, personal loans and automobile loans, among others, specifically designed for small to medium-sized businesses and companies, professionals and individuals generally located within Texas and primarily in the Houston metropolitan area. See Item 7. &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Loan Portfolio&#8221; for a more detailed discussion of the Company&#8217;s lending activities.

&#160;

Deposit Products 

&#160; 

Deposits are the Company&#8217;s principal source of funds for use in lending and other general banking purposes. The Company offers a variety of deposit products and services with the goal of attracting a wide variety of customers, with an emphasis on small to medium-sized businesses. The types of deposit accounts that the Company offers are typical of most commercial banks and consist of checking accounts, commercial accounts, savings accounts and other time deposits of various types, ranging from daily money market accounts to longer-term certificates of deposit. The Company actively pursues business checking accounts by offering its business customers competitive rates and convenient services such as telephone and online banking. The Company&#8217;s deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the &#8220;FDIC&#8221;) to the fullest extent permitted by law. See Item 7. &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Financial Condition&#8212;Deposits&#8221; for a more detailed discussion of the Company&#8217;s deposit products.

&#160;

&#160;

Other Banking Services 

&#160; 

The Company offers basic banking products and services that it believes are attractively priced, easily understood by its customers and convenient and readily accessible to the customer. In addition to banking during normal business hours, the Company offers extended drive-through hours, ATMs and banking by telephone, mail and Internet. The Company also provides debit card services, cash management services and wire transfer services and offers night depository, direct deposits, cashier&#8217;s checks, letters of credit and mobile deposits. The Company also offers safe deposit boxes, automated teller machines, drive-through services and 24-hour depository facilities. The Company has established relationships with correspondent banks and other independent financial institutions to provide other services requested by customers, including loan participations sold where the requested loan amount exceeds the lending limits in our lending policies. The Company offers customers convenient telephonic access to their accounts. The Company maintains an Internet banking website that allows customers to obtain account balances and transfer funds among accounts. The website also provides online bill payment and electronic delivery of customer statements.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160; 

The Company competes in the highly competitive commercial banking industry solely through the Bank and firmly believes that the Bank&#8217;s presence in the community and philosophy of personalized service enhances its ability to attract and retain customers. The Bank faces strong direct competition for deposit funds, lending opportunities, talented lenders, acquisition candidates and other financial-related services. The Company and the Bank compete with other commercial banks, thrifts and credit unions and other financial institutions.

&#160;

The Company competes for loans primarily with other commercial banks, savings banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, brokerage and investment banking firms, asset-based nonbank lenders and certain other nonfinancial entities, including retail stores that may maintain their own credit programs and certain governmental organizations, all of which are actively engaged in providing various types of loans and other financial services that may offer more favorable financing than the Company is able to offer. Although some of the Company&#8217;s competitors are situated locally, others have statewide or nationwide presence. The Company believes that it is able to compete with other financial institutions because of its experienced banking professionals, the range and quality of products that it offers, the Company&#8217;s responsive decision-making with respect to loans and its emphasis on customer service, establishing strong customer relationships and building customer loyalty that distinguishes the Company from its competitors.

&#160;

The Company relies heavily on the continued business its bankers generate and the efforts of its officers and directors to solicit and refer potential customers and the Company expects this reliance to continue for the foreseeable future. The Company believes that its market share in its geographic areas of operation is a reflection of the Company&#8217;s ability to compete with the larger banking franchises in its markets.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, the Company employed approximately 305 full time and 5 part time employees. None of the Company&#8217;s employees were represented by a collective bargaining unit or are party to a collective bargaining agreement. The Company believes that it has a good relationship with its employees.

&#160;

&#160; 

Regulation and Supervision 

&#160; 

The U.S. banking industry is highly regulated under federal and state law. These laws and regulations affect the operations and performance of the Company and its subsidiaries.

&#160;

Statutes, regulations and policies limit the activities in which the Company may engage and how it conducts certain permitted activities. Further, the bank regulatory system imposes reporting and information collection obligations. The Company incurs significant costs relating to compliance with these laws and regulations. Banking statutes, regulations and policies are continually under review by federal and state legislatures and regulatory agencies, and a change in them, including changes in how they are interpreted or implemented, could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business.

&#160;

&#160;

The material statutory and regulatory requirements that are applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries are summarized below. The description below is not intended to summarize all laws and regulations applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries, and is based upon the statutes, regulations, policies, interpretive letters and other written guidance that are in effect as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

&#160;

Bank and Bank Holding Company Regulation 

&#160; 

The Bank is a Texas-chartered banking association, the deposits of which are insured by the FDIC&#8217;s Deposit Insurance Fund up to applicable legal limits. The Bank is not a member of the Federal Reserve System; therefore, the Bank is subject to ongoing and comprehensive supervision, regulation, examination and enforcement by the Texas Department of Banking (the &#8220;TDB&#8221;) and the FDIC.

&#160;

Any entity that directly or indirectly controls a bank must be approved to become a bank holding company by the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the &#8220;BHC Act&#8221;). Bank holding companies are subject to regulation, examination, supervision and enforcement by the Federal Reserve under the BHC Act. The Federal Reserve&#8217;s jurisdiction also extends to any company that is directly or indirectly controlled by a bank holding company.

&#160;

As a bank holding company, the Company is subject to ongoing and comprehensive supervision, regulation, examination and enforcement by the Federal Reserve. As a bank holding company of a Texas state chartered bank, the Company is also subject to supervision, regulation, examination and enforcement by the TDB.

&#160;

Broad Supervision, Examination and Enforcement Powers 

&#160; 

A principal objective of the U.S. bank regulatory system is to protect depositors by ensuring the financial safety and soundness of banking organizations. To that end, the banking regulators have broad regulatory, examination and enforcement authority. The regulators regularly examine the operations of banking organizations. In addition, banking organizations are subject to periodic reporting requirements. Insured depository institutions with total assets of $500 million or more must submit annual audit reports prepared by independent auditors to federal and state regulators. In some instances, the audit report of the insured depository institution&#8217;s bank holding company can be used to satisfy this requirement. Auditors must receive examination reports, supervisory agreements and reports of enforcement actions.

&#160;

The regulators have various remedies available if they determine that the financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity or other aspects of a banking organization&#8217;s operations are unsatisfactory. The regulators may also take action if they determine that the banking organization or its management is violating or has violated any law or regulation. The regulators have the power to, among other things:

&#160;

&#8226; require affirmative actions to correct any violation or practice;

&#160;

&#8226; issue administrative orders that can be judicially enforced;

&#160;

&#8226; direct increases in capital;

&#160;

&#8226; direct the sale of subsidiaries or other assets;

&#160;

&#8226; limit dividends and distributions;

&#160;

&#8226; restrict growth;

&#160;

&#8226; assess civil monetary penalties;

&#160;

&#8226; remove officers and directors; and

&#160;

&#8226; terminate deposit insurance.

&#160;

Engaging in unsafe or unsound practices or failing to comply with applicable laws, regulations and supervisory agreements could subject us and our subsidiaries or their officers, directors and institution-affiliated parties to the remedies described above and other sanctions.

&#160;

&#160;

The Dodd-Frank Act 

&#160;

On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;) was signed into law. The Dodd-Frank Act is having a broad impact on the financial services industry, and imposes significant regulatory and compliance requirements, including the designation of certain financial companies as systemically important financial companies, enhanced oversight of credit rating agencies, the imposition of increased capital, leverage, and liquidity requirements, and numerous other provisions designed to improve supervision and oversight of, and strengthen safety and soundness within, the financial services sector.

&#160;

Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act established a new framework of authority to conduct systemic risk oversight within the financial system to be distributed among federal regulatory agencies, including the Financial Stability Oversight Council, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the &#8220;OCC&#8221;), and the FDIC.

&#160;

The following items provide a brief description of certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that are most relevant to the Company and the Bank.

&#160;

&#8226; Source of strength. Under Federal Reserve policy, bank holding companies have historically been required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of their banking subsidiaries, and the Dodd-Frank Act codified this policy as a statutory requirement. As a result of this requirement, in the future we could be required to provide financial assistance to the Bank should it experience financial distress.

&#160;

&#8226; Mortgage loan origination. The Dodd-Frank Act authorized the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the &#8220;CFPB&#8221;) to establish certain minimum standards for the origination of residential mortgages, including a determination of the borrower&#8217;s ability to repay a residential mortgage loan. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, financial institutions may not make a residential mortgage loan unless they make a &#8220;reasonable and good faith determination&#8221; that the consumer has a &#8220;reasonable ability&#8221; to repay the loan. The Dodd-Frank Act allows borrowers to raise certain defenses to foreclosure but provides a full or partial safe harbor from such defenses for loans that are &#8220;qualified mortgages.&#8221; The CFPB has promulgated final rules to, among other things, specify the types of income and assets that may be considered in the ability to repay determination, the permissible sources for verification and the required methods of calculating the loan&#8217;s monthly payments. The rules extend the requirement that creditors verify and document a borrower&#8217;s income and assets to include all information that creditors rely on in determining repayment ability. The rules also provide further examples of third party documents that may be relied on for such verification, such as government records and check cashing or funds transfer service receipts. The new rules became effective on January 10, 2014. The rules also define &#8220;qualified mortgages,&#8221; imposing both underwriting standards&#8212;for example, a borrower&#8217;s debt to income ratio may not exceed 43%&#8212;and limits on the terms of their loans. Points and fees are subject to a relatively stringent cap, and the terms include a wide array of payments that may be made in the course of closing a loan. Certain loans, including interest only loans and negative amortization loans, cannot be qualified mortgages.

&#160;

&#8226; Risk retention. On October 22, 2014, the OCC, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, the SEC, the Federal Housing Finance Agency and the Department of Housing and Urban Development issued a final rule in connection with the risk retention requirement mandated by Section 941 of the Dodd-Frank Act. The risk retention requirement generally requires a securitizer to retain no less than 5% of the credit risk in assets it sells into a securitization and prohibits a securitizer from directly or indirectly hedging or otherwise transferring the credit risk that the securitizer is required to retain, subject to limited exemptions. One significant exemption is for securities entirely collateralized by &#8220;qualified residential mortgages&#8221; (&#8220;QRMs&#8221;), which are loans deemed to have a lower risk of default. The rule defines QRMs to have the same meaning as the term &#8220;qualified mortgage,&#8221; as defined by the CFPB. In addition, the rule provides for reduced risk retention requirements for qualifying commercial loan, commercial real estate loan and auto loan securitizations.

&#160;

&#8226; Imposition of restrictions on certain activities. The Dodd-Frank Act imposes a new regulatory structure on the over-the-counter derivatives market, including requirements for clearing, exchange trading, capital, margin, reporting and record keeping. In addition, certain swaps and other derivatives activities are required to be &#8220;pushed out&#8221; of insured depository institutions and conducted in separately capitalized non-bank affiliates. The Dodd-Frank Act also requires certain persons to register as a &#8220;major swap participant,&#8221; &#8220;swap dealer,&#8221; &#8220;major security-based swap participant&#8221; or a &#8220;security-based swap dealer.&#8221; The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission has substantially completed adopting regulations to implement much of the new derivatives regulatory structure of the Dodd-Frank Act. The SEC and other U.S. regulators are still in the process of adopting regulations to implement the new derivatives regulatory structure of the Dodd-Frank Act. With regard to security-based swaps, it is anticipated that this further rulemaking will further clarify, among other things, reporting and recordkeeping obligations, margin and capital requirements, the scope of registration requirements, and what swaps are required to be centrally cleared and exchange-traded. Rules will also be issued to enhance the oversight of clearing and trading entities. As these remaining rules are implemented, new restrictions or limitations may affect our ability to manage certain risks in our business.

&#160;

&#8226; Expanded FDIC resolution authority. While insured depository institutions have long been subject to the FDIC&#8217;s resolution process, the Dodd-Frank Act creates a new mechanism for the FDIC to conduct the orderly liquidation of certain &#8220;covered financial companies,&#8221; including bank and thrift holding companies and systemically significant non-bank financial companies. Upon certain findings being made, the FDIC may be appointed receiver for a covered financial company, and would conduct an orderly liquidation of the entity. The FDIC liquidation process is modeled on the existing Federal Deposit Insurance Act and generally gives the FDIC more discretion than in the traditional bankruptcy context. The FDIC has issued final rules implementing the orderly liquidation authority.

&#160;

&#160;

&#8226; Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB, which is tasked with establishing and implementing rules and regulations under certain federal consumer protection laws with respect to the conduct of providers of certain consumer financial products and services. The CFPB has rulemaking authority over many of the statutes governing products and services offered to bank and thrift consumers. For banking organizations with assets of $10 billion or more, the CFPB has exclusive rule-making, examination, and primary enforcement authority under federal consumer financial laws. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and regulations that are stricter than those regulations promulgated by the CFPB. Compliance with any such new regulations would increase our cost of operations.

&#160;

&#8226; Deposit insurance. The Dodd-Frank Act made permanent the general $250 thousand deposit insurance limit for insured deposits. Amendments to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the &#8220;FDIA&#8221;) also revised the assessment base against which an insured depository institution&#8217;s deposit insurance premiums paid to the FDIC&#8217;s Deposit Insurance Fund will be calculated. Under the amendments, the assessment base is no longer the institution&#8217;s deposit base, but rather its average consolidated total assets less its average tangible equity. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act made changes to the minimum designated reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund, increasing the minimum from 1.15% to 1.35% of the estimated amount of total insured deposits, and eliminating the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds. Several of these provisions may impact the FDIC deposit insurance premiums paid by the Bank.

&#160;

&#8226; Transactions with affiliates and insiders. The Dodd-Frank Act generally enhanced the restrictions on transactions with affiliates under Section 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, including an expansion of the definition of &#8220;covered transactions&#8221; and clarification regarding the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered credit transactions must be satisfied. Insider transaction limitations are expanded through the strengthening of loan restrictions to insiders and the expansion of the types of transactions subject to the various limits, including derivatives transactions, repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements and securities lending or borrowing transactions. Restrictions are also placed on certain asset sales to and from an insider to an institution, including requirements that such sales be on market terms and, in certain circumstances, approved by the institution&#8217;s board of directors.

&#160;

&#8226; Corporate governance. The Dodd-Frank Act addresses many investor protections, corporate governance and executive compensation matters that will affect most U.S. publicly traded companies, including the Company. The Dodd-Frank Act (i) grants shareholders of U.S. publicly traded companies an advisory vote on executive compensation, (ii) enhances independence requirements for compensation committee members, (iii) requires companies listed on national securities exchanges to adopt incentive-based compensation clawback policies for executive officers and (iv) provides the SEC with authority to adopt proxy access rules that would allow shareholders of publicly traded companies to nominate candidates for election as a director and have those nominees included in a company&#8217;s proxy materials. For so long as we are an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of the provisions of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the &#8220;JOBS Act&#8221;) allowing us to not seek a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements.

&#160;

The requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act are in the process of being implemented and many of the requirements remain subject to regulations implemented over the course of several years. Given the uncertainty associated with the manner in which the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act will be implemented by the various regulatory agencies and through regulations, the full extent of the impact such requirements will have on our operations is unclear. The changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may impact the profitability of the Company&#8217;s business activities, require changes to certain of its business practices, impose upon the Company more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage requirements or otherwise adversely affect its business. These changes may also require the Company to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes necessary to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with the new requirements may negatively impact the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition.

&#160;

The Volcker Rule 

&#160; 

On December 10, 2013, the federal bank regulatory agencies, together with the SEC and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, adopted a final rule, commonly known as the &#8220;Volcker Rule,&#8221; under Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act that generally prohibits &#8220;banking entities&#8221; from engaging in &#8220;proprietary trading&#8221; and making investments and conducting certain other activities with &#8220;private equity funds and hedge funds.&#8221; Although the final rule provides some tiering of compliance and reporting obligations based on size, the fundamental prohibitions of the Volcker Rule apply to banking entities of any size, including us and the Bank. The final regulations became effective April 1, 2014; however, at the time the agencies released the final Volcker Rule, the Federal Reserve announced an extension of the conformance period for all banking entities until July 21, 2015.

&#160;

&#160;

In response to industry questions regarding the final Volcker Rule, the OCC, Federal Reserve, FDIC, SEC and CFTC issued a clarifying interim final rule on January 14, 2014, permitting banking entities to retain interests in certain collateralized debt obligations backed by trust preferred securities if the collateralized debt obligations meet certain requirements.

&#160;

We have reviewed the scope of the Volcker Rule and have determined that we do not have any activities or investments that meet the requirements of the rule at this time.

&#160;

Notice and Approval Requirements Related to Control 

&#160; 

Federal and state banking laws impose notice, application, approval or non-objection and ongoing regulatory requirements on any shareholder or other person that controls or seeks to acquire direct or indirect &#8220;control&#8221; of an FDIC-insured depository institution. These laws include the BHC Act, the Change in Bank Control Act and the Texas Banking Act. Among other things, these laws require regulatory filings by a shareholder or other person that seeks to acquire direct or indirect &#8220;control&#8221; of an FDIC-insured depository institution. The determination whether a person &#8220;controls&#8221; a depository institution or its holding company is based on all of the facts and circumstances surrounding the investment. As a general matter, a person is deemed to control a depository institution or other company if the person owns or controls 25% or more of any class of voting stock. Subject to rebuttal, a person may be presumed to control a depository institution or other company if the person owns or controls 10% or more of any class of voting stock and other regulatory criteria are met. Ownership by affiliated persons, or persons acting in concert, is typically aggregated for these purposes.

&#160;

In addition, except under limited circumstances, bank holding companies are prohibited from acquiring, without prior approval control of any other bank or bank holding company or all or substantially all the assets thereof; or more than 5% of the voting shares of a bank or bank holding company which is not already a subsidiary.

&#160;

Permissible Activities and Investments 

&#160; 

Banking laws generally restrict our ability to engage in, or acquire more than 5% of the voting shares of a company engaged in, activities other than those determined by the Federal Reserve to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Modernization Act of 1999 (the &#8220;GLB Act&#8221;) expanded the scope of permissible activities for a bank holding company that qualifies as a financial holding company. Under the regulations implementing the GLB Act, a financial holding company may engage in additional activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to a financial activity. Those activities include, among other activities, certain insurance and securities activities. Qualifications for becoming a financial holding company include, among other things, meeting certain specified capital standards and achieving certain management ratings in examinations. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, bank holding companies and their subsidiaries must be well-capitalized and well-managed in order for the bank holding company and its nonbank affiliates to engage in the expanded financial activities permissible only for a financial holding company.

&#160;

In addition, as a general matter, we must receive prior regulatory approval before establishing or acquiring a depository institution or, in certain cases, a non-bank entity.

&#160;

The Texas Constitution, as amended in 1986, provides that a Texas-chartered bank has the same rights and privileges that are or may be granted to national banks domiciled in Texas. To the extent that the Texas laws and regulations may have allowed state-chartered banks to engage in a broader range of activities than national banks, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (the &#8220;FDICIA&#8221;), has operated to limit this authority. The FDICIA provides that no state bank or subsidiary thereof may engage as a principal in any activity not permitted for national banks, unless the institution complies with applicable capital requirements and the FDIC determines that the activity poses no significant risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC. In general, statutory restrictions on the activities of banks are aimed at protecting the safety and soundness of depository institutions.

&#160;

Branching 

&#160; 

Texas law provides that a Texas-chartered bank can establish a branch anywhere in Texas provided that the branch is approved in advance by the TDB. The branch must also be approved by the FDIC. The regulators consider a number of factors, including financial history, capital adequacy, earnings prospects, character of management, needs of the community and consistency with corporate powers. The Dodd-Frank Act permits insured state banks to engage in de novo interstate branching if the laws of the state where the new branch is to be established would permit the establishment of the branch if it were chartered by such state.

&#160;

&#160;

Regulatory Capital Requirements and Capital Adequacy 

&#160;

The bank regulators view capital levels as important indicators of an institution&#8217;s financial soundness. As a general matter, FDIC-insured depository institutions and their holding companies are required to maintain minimum capital relative to the amount and types of assets they hold. The final supervisory determination on an institution&#8217;s capital adequacy is based on the regulator&#8217;s assessment of numerous factors. As a bank holding company and a state-chartered non-member bank, the Company and the Bank are subject to both risk-based and leverage regulatory capital requirements.

&#160;

In 1988, the International Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, a committee of central banks and bank supervisors, (&#8220;Basel Committee&#8221;), adopted a capital accord, known as Basel I, which established the framework for risk-based capital guidelines implemented by the U.S. federal bank regulators. The federal banking agencies subsequently adopted separate risk-based capital guidelines for so-called &#8220;core banks&#8221; based upon the revised framework issued by the Basel Committee in November 2005, Basel II. In 2010, the Basel Committee implemented the revised framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity, referred to as Basel III.

&#160; 

Prior to implementation of revised capital regulations based on the Basel III framework, as discussed below, the Federal Reserve&#8217;s system of capital adequacy requirements used a combination of risk-based capital guidelines and a leverage ratio to evaluate capital adequacy and considered these capital levels when taking action on various types of applications and when conducting supervisory activities related to safety and soundness. Assets and off-balance sheet items, such as letters of credit and unfunded loan commitments, were assigned to broad risk categories, each with appropriate risk weights. Regulatory capital, in turn, was classified in one of two tiers. &#8216;&#8216;Tier 1&#8217;&#8217; capital included common equity, retained earnings, qualifying non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, less goodwill, most intangible assets and certain other assets. &#8216;&#8216;Tier 2&#8217;&#8217; capital included, among other things, qualifying subordinated debentures and allowances for loan and lease losses, subject to limitations. The resulting capital ratios represented capital as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet items. 

&#160; 

The guidelines required a minimum total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% (of which at least 4.0% is required to consist of Tier 1 capital elements). Total capital is the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. The leverage ratio is a company&#8217;s Tier 1 capital divided by its average total consolidated assets. Certain highly rated bank holding companies could maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 3.0%, but other bank holding companies were required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least 4.0%. 

&#160; 

In July 2013, after a lengthy rulemaking process, the federal banking agencies published final capital rules that revised their risk-based and leverage capital requirements and their method for calculating risk-weighted assets to implement, in part, Basel III agreements reached by the Basel Committee and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. While some provisions are tailored to larger institutions, the revised capital rules generally apply to all banking organizations, including the Company and the Bank. In broad terms, the final regulations increased the required quality and quantity of the capital base, reduced the range of instruments that count as capital and increase the risk-weighted asset assessment for certain types of activities. 

&#160; 

Among other things, the final rules impact regulatory capital ratios of banking organizations in the following manner, when fully phased in: create a new requirement to maintain a ratio of &#8220;common equity Tier 1 capital&#8221; to total risk-weighted assets of not less than 4.5%; increase the minimum leverage capital ratio to 4.0% for all banking organizations; increase the minimum tier 1 risk-based capital ratio from 4.0% to 6.0%; and maintain the minimum total risk-based capital ratio at 8.0%. 

&#160; 

In addition, the rules would subject a banking organization to certain limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers if the organization did not maintain a &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221; of common equity Tier 1 capital in an amount greater than 2.5% of its total risk-weighted assets. The effect of the capital conservation buffer will be to increase the minimum common equity Tier 1 capital ratio to 7.0%, the minimum tier 1 risk-based capital ratio to 8.5% and the minimum total risk-based capital ratio to 10.5%, for banking organizations seeking to avoid the limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. 

&#160; 

The rules also change the capital categories for insured depository institutions for purposes of prompt corrective action. Under the rules, to be well capitalized, an insured depository institution would be required to maintain a minimum common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6.5%, a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.0%, a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.0%, and a leverage capital ratio of at least 5.0%. In addition, the final rules establish more conservative standards for including an instrument in regulatory capital and impose certain deductions from and adjustments to the measure of common equity Tier 1 capital. 

&#160; 

The final Basel III framework also requires some banks and holding companies to measure their liquidity against specific liquidity tests that, although similar in some respects to liquidity measures historically applied by banks and regulators for management and supervisory purposes, going forward would be required by regulation. The final rule applies to larger banking organizations and does not cover the Company or the Bank. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Under the final rules, banking organizations were provided a one-time option in their initial regulatory financial report filed after January 1, 2015, to remove certain components of accumulated other comprehensive income from the computation of common equity regulatory capital. For banking organizations with less than $15 billion in total assets, existing trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock continue to be included in regulatory capital while other instruments are disallowed. The final rules also provide additional constraints on the inclusion of minority interests, mortgage servicing assets, deferred tax assets and certain investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions in Tier 1 capital, as well as providing stricter risk weighting rules to these assets. 

&#160;

The final rules also provide stricter rules related to the risk weighting of past due and certain commercial real estate loans, as well as on some equity investment exposures, and replaces the existing credit rating approach for determining the risk weighting of securitization exposures with an alternative approach.

&#160;

The federal banking agencies&#8217; risk-based and leverage ratios are minimum supervisory ratios generally applicable to banking organizations that meet certain specified criteria. The federal bank regulatory agencies may set capital requirements for a particular banking organization that are higher than the minimum ratios when circumstances warrant. Federal Reserve guidelines also provide that banking organizations experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels, without significant reliance on intangible assets. 

&#160; 

The enhanced capital requirements are effective January 1, 2015 for the Bank and the Company, other than the capital conservation buffer, which will phase in over four years beginning in 2016. We are continuing to evaluate the long-term effect the new regulations may have on the Bank and the Company. 

&#160;

Prompt Corrective Action 

&#160;

Under the FDIA, the federal bank regulatory agencies must take prompt corrective action against undercapitalized U.S. depository institutions. U.S. depository institutions are assigned one of five capital categories: &#8220;well capitalized,&#8221; &#8220;adequately capitalized,&#8221; &#8220;undercapitalized,&#8221; &#8220;significantly undercapitalized,&#8221; and &#8220;critically undercapitalized,&#8221; and are subjected to different regulation corresponding to the capital category within which the institution falls. A depository institution is deemed to be &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater and the institution is not subject to an order, written agreement, capital directive or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific level for any capital measure. A depository institution is deemed to be &#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221; if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5% or greater; a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater; a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater; and does not meet the criteria for a &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; bank. A depository institution is &#8220;under-capitalized&#8221; if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio less than 4.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0% or a leverage ratio of less than 4.0%. Under certain circumstances, a well-capitalized, adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution may be treated as if the institution were in the next lower capital category. A banking institution that is undercapitalized is required to submit a capital restoration plan. The capital restoration plan will not be accepted by the regulators unless each company having control of the undercapitalized institution guarantees the subsidiary&#8217;s compliance with the capital restoration plan up to a certain specified amount.

&#160;

Failure to meet capital guidelines could subject the institution to a variety of enforcement remedies by federal bank regulatory agencies, including: termination of deposit insurance upon notice and hearing, restrictions on certain business activities, and appointment of the FDIC as conservator or receiver. As of December 31, 2015, the Bank met the requirements to be &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; under the prompt corrective action regulations.

&#160;

Regulatory Limits on Dividends and Distributions 

&#160;

As a bank holding company, we are subject to certain restrictions on paying dividends under applicable federal and Texas laws and regulations. The Federal Reserve has issued a policy statement that provides that a bank holding company should not pay dividends unless (i) its net income over the last four quarters (net of dividends paid) has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends, (ii) the prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be consistent with the capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition of the bank holding company and its subsidiaries and (iii) the bank holding company will continue to meet minimum required capital adequacy ratios.Accordingly, a bank holding company should not pay cash dividends that exceeds its net income or that can only be funded in ways that weaken the bank holding company&#8217;s financial health, such as by borrowing. The Dodd-Frank Act imposes, and Basel III results in, additional restrictions on the ability of banking institutions to pay dividends.

&#160;

Substantially all of our income, and a principal source of our liquidity, are dividends from the Bank. The ability of the Bank to pay dividends to us is restricted by federal and state laws, regulations and policies.

&#160;

&#160;

Capital adequacy requirement serve to limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by the Bank. Under the FDIA, an insured depository institution such as the Bank is prohibited from making capital distributions, including the payment of dividends, if, after making such distribution, the institution would become &#8220;undercapitalized.&#8221; The FDIC may further restrict the payment of dividends by requiring the Bank to maintain a higher level of capital than would otherwise be required to be adequately capitalized for regulatory purposes. Payment of dividends by the Bank also may be restricted at any time at the discretion of the appropriate regulator if it deems the payment to constitute an unsafe and unsound banking practice. As noted above, the capital conservation buffer created under the final capital rules, when fully implemented, may also have the effect of limiting the payment of capital distributions from the Bank.

&#160;

Reserve Requirements 

&#160; 

Pursuant to regulations of the Federal Reserve, all banking organizations are required to maintain average daily reserves at mandated ratios against their transaction accounts. In addition, reserves must be maintained on certain non-personal time deposits. These reserves must be maintained in the form of vault cash or in an account at a Federal Reserve Bank.

&#160;

Limits on Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders 

&#160;

Insured depository institutions are subject to restrictions on their ability to conduct transactions with affiliates and other related parties. Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act imposes quantitative limits, qualitative requirements, and collateral requirements on certain transactions by an insured depository institution with, or for the benefit of, its affiliates. Transactions covered by Section 23A include loans, extensions of credit, investment in securities issued by an affiliate, and acquisitions of assets from an affiliate. Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act requires that most types of transactions by an insured depository institution with, or for the benefit of, an affiliate be on terms, substantially the same or at least as favorable to the insured depository institution as if the transaction were conducted with an unaffiliated third party.

&#160;

As noted above, the Dodd-Frank Act generally enhances the restrictions on transactions with affiliates under Section 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, including an expansion of the definition of &#8220;covered transactions&#8221; and a clarification regarding the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered credit transactions must be satisfied. The ability of the Federal Reserve to grant exemptions from these restrictions is also narrowed by the Dodd-Frank Act, including by requiring coordination with other bank regulators.

&#160;

The Federal Reserve&#8217;s Regulation O regulations impose restrictions and procedural requirements in connection with the extension of credit by an insured depository institution to directors, executive officers, principal shareholders and their related interests.

&#160;

Brokered Deposits 

&#160; 

The FDIA restricts the use of brokered deposits by certain depository institutions. Under the applicable regulations, a &#8220;well capitalized insured depository institution&#8221; may solicit and accept, renew or roll over any brokered deposit without restriction. An &#8220;adequately capitalized insured depository institution&#8221; may not accept, renew or roll over any brokered deposit unless it has applied for and been granted a waiver of this prohibition by the FDIC. An &#8220;undercapitalized insured depository institution&#8221; may not accept, renew or roll over any brokered deposit. The FDIC may, on a case-by-case basis and upon application by an adequately capitalized insured depository institution, waive the restriction on brokered deposits upon a finding that the acceptance of brokered deposits does not constitute an unsafe or unsound practice with respect to such institution.

&#160;

Concentrated Commercial Real Estate Lending Guidance 

&#160; 

The federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, have promulgated guidance governing financial institutions with concentrations in commercial real estate lending. The guidance provides that a bank has a concentration in commercial real estate lending if (i) total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land represent 100% or more of total capital or (ii) total reported loans secured by multifamily and non-farm residential properties and loans for construction, land development, and other land represent 300% or more of total capital and the bank&#8217;s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased 50% or more during the prior 36 months. Owner-occupied commercial real estate loans are excluded from this second category. If a concentration is present, management must employ heightened risk management practices that address the following key elements: board and management oversight and strategic planning, portfolio management, development of underwriting standards, risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing and maintenance of increased capital levels as needed to support the level of commercial real estate lending.

&#160; 

&#160;

Examination and Examination Fees 

&#160; 

The FDIC periodically examines and evaluates state non-member banks. Based on such an evaluation, the Bank, among other things, may be required to revalue its assets and establish specific reserves to compensate for the difference between the Bank&#8217;s assessment and that of the FDIC. The TDB also conducts examinations of state banks but may accept the results of a federal examination in lieu of conducting an independent examination. In addition, the FDIC and TDB may elect to conduct a joint examination. The TDB charges fees to recover the costs of examining Texas chartered banks, as well as filing fees for certain applications and other filings. The Dodd-Frank Act provides various agencies with the authority to assess additional supervision fees.

&#160;

Deposit Insurance and Deposit Insurance Assessments 

&#160; 

The FDIC is an independent federal agency that insures the deposits of federally insured depository institutions up to applicable limits. The FDIC also has certain regulatory, examination and enforcement powers with respect to FDIC-insured institutions. The deposits of the Bank are insured by the FDIC up to applicable limits. As a general matter, the maximum deposit insurance amount is $250 thousand per depositor. FDIC-insured depository institutions are required to pay deposit insurance assessments to the FDIC. The amount of a particular institution&#8217;s deposit insurance assessment for institutions with less than $10 billion in assets is based on that institution&#8217;s risk classification under an FDIC risk based assessment system. An institution&#8217;s risk classification is assigned based on its capital levels and the level of supervisory concern the institution poses to the regulators. Institutions assigned to higher risk categories (that is, institutions that pose a higher risk of loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund) pay assessments at higher rates than institutions that pose a lower risk.

&#160;

Deposit insurance assessments fund the Deposit Insurance Fund, which is currently underfunded. As noted above, the Dodd-Frank Act changed the way an insured depository institution&#8217;s deposit insurance premiums are calculated. Continued action by the FDIC to replenish the Deposit Insurance Fund, as well as these changes may impact assessment rates, which could impact the profitability of the Company&#8217;s operations.

&#160;

Depositor Preference 

&#160;

The FDIA provides that, in the event of the &#8220;liquidation or other resolution&#8221; of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors of the institution (including the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors) and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution. If the Company invests in or acquires an insured depository institution that fails, insured and uninsured depositors, along with the FDIC, will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured, non-deposit creditors, including the Company, with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution.

&#160;

Anti-Money Laundering and OFAC 

&#160; 

Under federal law, financial institutions must maintain anti-money laundering programs that include established internal policies, procedures and controls, a designated compliance officer, an ongoing employee training program and testing of the program by an independent audit function. Financial institutions are also prohibited from entering into specified financial transactions and account relationships and must meet enhanced standards for due diligence and customer identification in their dealings with non-U.S. financial institutions and non-U.S. customers. Financial institutions must take reasonable steps to conduct enhanced scrutiny of account relationships to guard against money laundering and to report any suspicious transactions, and law enforcement authorities have been granted increased access to financial information maintained by financial institutions. Bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations and they must consider an institution&#8217;s compliance with such obligations in connection with the regulatory review of applications, including applications for banking mergers and acquisitions. The regulatory authorities have imposed &#8220;cease and desist&#8221; orders and civil money penalty sanctions against institutions found to be violating these obligations.

&#160;

The U.S. Department of the Treasury&#8217;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (&#8220;OFAC&#8221;), is responsible for helping to ensure that U.S. entities do not engage in transactions with certain prohibited parties, as defined by various Executive Orders and Acts of Congress. OFAC publishes lists of persons, organizations, and countries suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts, known as Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons. If the Company or the Bank finds a name on any transaction, account or wire transfer that is on an OFAC list, the Company or the Bank must freeze or block such account or transaction, file a suspicious activity report and notify the appropriate authorities.

&#160;

Consumer Laws and Regulations 

&#160;

Banking organizations are subject to numerous laws and regulations intended to protect consumers. These laws include, among others:

&#160;

&#8226; Truth in Lending Act;

&#160;

&#8226; Truth in Savings Act;

&#160;

&#160;

&#8226; Electronic Funds Transfer Act;

&#160;

&#8226; Expedited Funds Availability Act;

&#160;

&#8226; Equal Credit Opportunity Act;

&#160;

&#8226; Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act;

&#160;

&#8226; Fair Housing Act;

&#160;

&#8226; Fair Credit Reporting Act;

&#160;

&#8226; Fair Debt Collection Act;

&#160;

&#8226; Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act;

&#160;

&#8226; Home Mortgage Disclosure Act;

&#160;

&#8226; Right to Financial Privacy Act;

&#160;

&#8226; Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act;

&#160;

&#8226; laws regarding unfair and deceptive acts and practices; and

&#160;

&#8226; usury laws.

&#160;

Many states and local jurisdictions have consumer protection laws analogous to, and in addition to, those listed above. These federal, state and local laws regulate the manner in which financial institutions deal with customers when taking deposits, making loans, or conducting other types of transactions. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could give rise to regulatory sanctions, customer rescission rights, action by state and local attorneys general and civil or criminal liability. The creation of the CFPB by the Dodd-Frank Act has led to enhanced enforcement of consumer financial protection laws.

&#160;

The Community Reinvestment Act 

&#160;

The Community Reinvestment Act (the &#8220;CRA&#8221;), and related regulations are intended to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs of their service areas, including low and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with safe and sound operations. The bank regulators examine and assign each bank a public CRA rating. The CRA requires bank regulators to take into account the bank&#8217;s record in meeting the needs of its service area when considering an application by a bank to establish or relocate a branch or to conduct certain mergers or acquisitions. The Federal Reserve is required to consider the CRA records of a bank holding company&#8217;s controlled banks when considering an application by the bank holding company to acquire a banking organization or to merge with another bank holding company. When we or the Bank applies for regulatory approval to engage in certain transactions, the regulators will consider the CRA record of target institutions and our depository institution subsidiaries. An unsatisfactory CRA record could substantially delay approval or result in denial of an application. The regulatory agency&#8217;s assessment of the institution&#8217;s record is made available to the public. The Bank received an overall CRA rating of &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; on its most recent CRA examination.

&#160;

Changes in Laws, Regulations or Policies 

&#160;

Federal, state and local legislators and regulators regularly introduce measures or take actions that would modify the regulatory requirements applicable to banks, their holding companies and other financial institutions. Changes in laws, regulations or regulatory policies could adversely affect the operating environment for us in substantial and unpredictable ways, increase our cost of doing business, impose new restrictions on the way in which the Company conducts its operations or add significant operational constraints that might impair the Company&#8217;s profitability. Whether new legislation will be enacted and, if enacted, the effect that it, or any implementing regulations, would have on the Company and its subsidiaries&#8217; business, financial condition or results of operations cannot be predicted. The Dodd-Frank Act is in the process of imposing substantial changes to the regulatory framework applicable to us and our subsidiaries. The majority of these changes will be implemented over time by various regulatory agencies. The full effect that these changes will have on us and our subsidiaries remains uncertain at this time and may have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business and results of operations.

&#160;

&#160;

Effect on Economic Environment 

&#160;

The policies of regulatory authorities, including the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve, have a significant effect on the operating results of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries. Among the means available to the Federal Reserve to affect the money supply are open market operations in U.S. government securities, changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings, and changes in reserve requirements with respect to deposits. These means are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distribution of bank loans, investments and deposits, and their use may affect interest rates charged on loans or paid for deposits. Federal Reserve monetary policies have materially affected the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The Company cannot predict the nature of future monetary policies and the effect of such policies on its business and earnings.

&#160;
