 Item 1. Business. &#160; 

BUSINESS 

&#160;

We are a biotechnology company developing bioengineered organ implants based on our novel Cellframe&#8482; technology.

&#160;

Our Cellframe technology is comprised of a biocompatible scaffold that is seeded with the recipient&#8217;s own cells. We believe that this technology may prove to be effective for treating patients across a number of life-threatening medical indications who currently have unmet medical needs. We are currently developing our Cellframe technology to treat life-threatening conditions of the esophagus, trachea or bronchus with the objective of dramatically improving the treatment paradigm for those patients.

&#160;

We believe that our Cellframe technology may provide surgeons with a new treatment paradigm to address damage to the esophagus, bronchi, and trachea due to cancer, infection, trauma or congenital abnormalities. Organ implants being developed based on our Cellframe technology for those indications are called Cellspan&#8482;. We announced key preliminary preclinical results of large-animal studies for the esophagus, trachea and bronchus in November 2015. While the studies pertaining to the trachea and bronchus showed promising results for restoring organ function, the most promising results were shown in the esophagus study. As such, our Cellspan esophageal implant will be our lead development product candidate.

&#160;

A portion of all patients diagnosed with esophageal cancer are treated via a surgical procedure known as an esophagectomy. The current standard of care for an esophagectomy requires a complex surgical procedure that involves moving the patient&#8217;s stomach or a portion of their colon into the chest to replace the portion of esophagus resected by the removal of the tumor. These current procedures have high rates of complications, and can lead to a severely diminished quality of life and require costly ongoing care. Our Cellspan esophageal implant aims to simplify the procedure, reduce complications, result in a better quality of life and reduce the overall cost of patient care to the healthcare system.

&#160;

Our product candidates are currently in development and have not yet received regulatory approval for sale anywhere in the world.

&#160;

The Office of Combination Products of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, has confirmed for us that the FDA intends to regulate our cell-seeded scaffold implant as a combination biologic-device product under the primary jurisdiction of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER, and will require a BLA pathway for market approval. The initial indication for which we intend to seek FDA approval will be to restore the function of the esophagus after a portion of the esophagus has been surgically removed to treat cancer, damage caused by injury or infection or congenital abnormalities. While this FDA confirmation was based on our previous-generation tracheal product candidate, we expect that our Cellspan esophageal implant would similarly be regulated as a combination product under the primary jurisdiction of the CBER. We also intend to request expedited review from the FDA for the Cellspan esophageal implant product. Receipt of the FDA&#8217;s expedited review would reduce the overall time through the regulatory process.

&#160;

We plan to apply for orphan drug designation from the FDA for our Cellspan esophageal implant in the U.S. and Europe. Orphan drug status provides market exclusivity in the U.S. for seven years from the date of the product&#8217;s approval for marketing. This exclusivity is in addition to any exclusivity we may obtain due to our patents. Additionally, orphan designation provides a waiver of the BLA application fee. Orphan drug status in Europe provides market exclusivity there for ten years from the date of the product&#8217;s approval for marketing.

&#160;

We believe that our Cellframe technology may prove to be effective for treating patients across several life-threatening medical indications who currently have unmet medical needs. We are now advancing the development of our Cellframe technology to address life-threatening conditions of three organs, including the esophagus, the trachea and the bronchus. We are currently developing our lead product candidate, our Cellspan esophageal implant, in large-animal studies with Mayo Clinic to gain third-party confirmation of our esophageal product&#8217;s potential and to develop compelling data in support of our goal of filing an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the FDA in late 2016, seeking to initiate clinical trials in humans. We currently anticipate providing an update on our ongoing large-animal research collaboration with Mayo Clinic mid-second quarter 2016.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Our Mission and Our Strategy 

&#160;

Our mission is to be the leading developer and supplier of bioengineered organ implants for restoring organ function for patients with life-threatening conditions of the esophagus, the bronchus and the trachea. Our business strategy to accomplish this mission includes:

&#160;

Targeting life-threatening medical conditions. We are focused on creating products to help physicians treat life-threatening conditions like esophageal cancer, central lung cancer and damage to the trachea caused by cancer, trauma or infection. We are also developing products for the treatment of congenital abnormalities of the esophagus and the airways. We are not targeting less severe conditions that have reasonable existing treatment options. Solutions for life-threatening medical conditions present a favorable therapeutic index, or risk/benefit relationship, by providing the opportunity of a significant medical benefit for patients who have poor or no treatment alternatives. We believe that product candidates targeting life-threatening medical conditions may be eligible for review and approval by regulatory authorities under established expedited review programs, which may result in savings of time in the regulatory approval process. Also, we believe that products targeting life-threatening medical conditions may be more likely to receive favorable reimbursement compared with treatments for less critical medical conditions. 

&#160; 

Developing products that have a relatively short time to market. Since the number of patients diagnosed with esophageal cancer in the U.S. each year is relatively small, we expect the number of patients that we would likely need to enroll in a clinical trial will also be relatively small. A small number of patients implies a relatively fast enrollment time and a less expensive clinical development program. Therefore, we expect to be able to conduct a clinical trial in a relatively short period of time compared to clinical trials in indications with larger patient populations. We intend to work closely with regulatory agencies and clinical experts to design and size the clinical studies appropriately based on the specific conditions our products are intended to treat.

&#160; 

Using our Cellframe technology as a platform to address multiple organs. We believe that preclinical data we have produced to date may suggest that our Cellframe technology is a novel and innovative approach to restoring organ function that may provide an ability to develop products that would address life-threatening conditions impacting organs like the esophagus, bronchi and trachea, and perhaps lower portions of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. We believe that our Cellframe technology may allow physicians to treat certain life-threatening conditions in ways not currently possible, and in some combination, to save patients&#8217; lives, avoid or reduce complications experienced in the current standard of care, and improve the patients&#8217; quality of life, while at the same time reducing the overall cost of patient care to the healthcare system.

&#160;

Supplying the finished organ implant to the surgeon. Our technology includes our proprietary organ bioreactor, as well as our proprietary biocompatible scaffold that is seeded with the patient&#8217;s own cells. We believe there is considerable value in supplying the final cell-seeded scaffold implant to the surgeon so that the hospital and surgeon may focus solely on performing the implantation.

&#160;

Collaborating with leading medical and research institutions. We have and will continue to collaborate with leading medical and research institutions. We have a co-development agreement with Mayo Clinic for regenerative medicine organ implant products for the esophagus and airways, and we are currently conducting large-animal studies with Mayo Clinic to develop our Cellframe technology. We are also collaborating with Connecticut Children&#8217;s Medical Center on a co-development project to research regenerative medicine-based solutions to esophageal atresia. We believe the use of our product candidates by leading surgeons and institutions will increase the likelihood that other surgeons and institutions will use our products.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Our Technology 

&#160;

Our Cellframe technology is comprised of our proprietary bioengineered organ scaffold seeded with the patient&#8217;s own stem cells in our proprietary organ bioreactor prior to implantation. We believe that our Cellframe technology combines a highly-engineered, biocompatible scaffold and a robust population of cells that, by tapping into the stem cell niche of the surrounding native tissue after implantation, may potentially enable a tubular organ to remodel or regenerate tissue to close the gap created by a surgical resection of a portion of that organ. This unique combination of technologies, developed through our extensive testing performed during the last two years, may potentially provide solutions to life-threatening conditions for patients with unmet medical needs.

&#160;

We believe that our new technology is unique, in that its mode of action appears to be different from other tissue engineering organ scaffold products developed previously, of which we are aware. Prior to our development of the Cellframe technology, our approach attempted to implant an organ scaffold that would be incorporated into the patient&#8217;s body by the surrounding native tissue growing into the scaffold. To our knowledge, all previous research and development efforts by other investigators were based on that same concept. Our Cellframe technology appears to work very differently. We believe that the unique combination of our highly-engineered organ scaffold with a population of the patient&#8217;s own mesenchymal stem cells enables an organ to develop new native tissue around our scaffold, but not into it, so the scaffold acts as a sort of frame or staging for the new tissue. As a result, our scaffold is not incorporated into the body. Instead, it is retrieved from the body via an endoscopic or bronchoscopic procedure, not surgically, after sufficient tissue remodeling and regeneration has occurred to restore the organ&#8217;s integrity and function.

&#160;

A Cellframe technology-based organ implant includes two key components: a biocompatible synthetic scaffold and the patient&#8217;s own stem cells.

&#160;

Biocompatible Scaffold Component 

&#160;

Our proprietary biocompatible scaffold component of the Cellspan esophageal implant is constructed primarily of polyurethane (PU; a plastic polymer). This material was chosen based on extensive testing of various materials. The scaffold is made using a manufacturing process known as electrospinning. The combination of the electrospinning process, which provides accurate control over the desired microstructure of the scaffold fabric, with the PU results in a scaffold that we believe has favorable biocompatibility characteristics.

&#160; 

The Patient&#8217;s Cells 

&#160;

Based on current preclinical development efforts, the cells we seed onto the scaffold are obtained from the patient&#8217;s adipose tissue (abdominal fat). This fat tissue is obtained in a standard biopsy before the implant surgery. Mesenchymal stem cells are extracted and isolated from the adipose tissue biopsy. The isolated cells are then expanded, or grown, for a short period prior to surgery in order to derive a sufficient cell population to be seeded on the scaffold. The cells are then seeded on the scaffold in our proprietary organ bioreactor and incubated there before the implant surgery.

&#160;

We believe the Cellspan esophageal implant has the potential to provide a major advance over the current therapeutic options for treating esophageal cancer, damage from infection or trauma and congenital abnormalities. We believe our Cellframe technology has the potential to overcome the major challenges in restoring organ function for a damaged esophagus. With our Cellspan esophageal implant we are developing a surgical procedure that has the objective of reconstituting the continuity of the patient&#8217;s esophagus without having to relocate another organ in its place. In addition, by reducing or eliminating complications that occur in the current standard of care, we expect to reduce the costs of addressing and treating those additional complications. Because these substantial costs can be reduced or even eliminated with our technology, we believe our products, if successfully developed, can help save lives, improve the quality of life for patients and reduce overall healthcare costs.

&#160;

Further, human embryonic stem cells are not part of any of our implant product candidates. This eliminates both the medical risks and ethical controversy associated with regenerative medicine approaches that use human embryonic stem cells.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Unmet Patient Needs and Cellspan Implant Solutions 

&#160;

Esophageal Cancer 

&#160;

There are approximately 456,000 new diagnoses of esophageal cancer globally each year. According to the American Cancer Society, there are approximately 17,000 new diagnoses of esophageal cancer in the U.S. each year, and there are more than 15,000 deaths from esophageal cancer each year. Esophageal cancer is very deadly - the five-year survival rate for people with esophageal cancer is 18% in the U.S. Approximately 5,000 esophagectomy surgeries occur in the U.S. annually to treat esophageal cancer, and approximately 10,000 esophagectomies occur in Europe annually. We believe that our Cellspan esophageal implant, if approved, has the potential to provide a major advance over the current esophagectomy procedures for addressing esophageal cancer, which have high complication and morbidity rates.

&#160;

The current standard of care for the esophagectomy requires either (A) a gastric pull-up, where the stomach is cut and sutured into a tubular shape, then pulled up through the diaphragm to replace a portion of the esophagus resected by the removal of the cancerous tumor; or (B) a colon interposition, where a portion of the colon is resected and used to replace the portion of the esophagus resected by the removal of the cancerous tumor. Esophagectomies have 90-day mortality rates of up to 19%. Serious complications, such as leakage at the anastomoses, which can lead to infections and sepsis, and pulmonary complications, such as impaired pulmonary function or pneumonia, occur in up to 30% of esophagectomy cases. Other complications from esophagectomies, such as a narrowing of the esophagus post-surgery, gastroesophageal reflux and dumping syndrome (repetitive nausea, dizziness and vomiting) can also pose significant quality of life issues for patients.

&#160;

We believe that the Cellspan esophageal implant has the potential to provide physicians a new, simpler procedure to restore organ function while significantly reducing complication and morbidity rates compared with the current standard of care, and without creating significant quality of life issues for patients.

&#160;

Esophageal Atresia 

&#160;

Esophageal Atresia (EA) is a rare congenital abnormality in which a baby is born without part of the esophagus. About 1 in 4,000 babies in the U.S. is born with EA. In some cases, the two sections can be connected surgically. However, in cases where the gap is too great for a simple surgical reconnection, the current standard of care is a gastric pull-up, a colon interposition, or a procedure known as the Foker process. In the Foker process, traction devices are surgically attached to the two ends of the esophagus. Traction is then applied, usually for several weeks during which time the baby remains in an Intensive Care Unit, to stimulate the ends of the esophagus to grow and narrow the gap. If the Foker process is successful in narrowing the gap sufficiently, a second surgery is necessary to connect the two ends of the esophagus. In addition to the Foker process being complex, it is also a very expensive procedure, because the baby will normally be several months in hospital for the process.

&#160;

We believe that a pediatric Cellspan esophageal implant may provide pediatric surgeons with a better procedure to treat EA that would result in a connected esophagus with higher success rates, lower complications and lower overall costs to the healthcare system.

&#160;

Central Lung Cancer 

&#160;

Lung cancer is the most common form of cancer and the most common cause of death from cancer worldwide. There are more than 450,000 new lung cancer diagnoses annually in the U.S. and Europe. In approximately 25% of all lung cancer cases, the cancerous tumor resides only in a bronchus and not in the lobes of the lungs, and is known as central lung cancer. Approximately 33,000 central lung cancer cases diagnosed in the U.S. and Europe are Stage I and II and are considered eligible for surgical resection, often with adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation. Approximately 5,000 of those patients are treated via pneumonectomy, a surgical procedure involving the resection of the cancer tumor, the whole bronchus below the tumor and the entire lung to which it is connected. It is a complex surgery and results in a 50% reduction in the patient&#8217;s respiratory capacity. The procedure has reported rates of post-surgical (in hospital) mortality of 8% to 15%. Complication rates associated with pneumonectomy are reported as high as 50%, and include post-operative pneumonia, supraventricular arrhythmias and anastomotic leakage, placing patients at significant mortality risk post-discharge.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

We believe that a Cellspan bronchial implant, once developed and approved for marketing, has the potential to provide physicians a treatment alternative superior to the sleeve pneumonectomy to address central lung cancer, a simpler procedure to restore organ function of the bronchus without sacrificing one of the patient&#8217;s lungs, resulting in fewer post-surgery complications, improved mortality rates and improved quality of life for the patient.

&#160;

Life-threatening conditions of the Trachea 

&#160;

There are approximately 8,000 patients per year in the U.S. and Europe who suffer from a condition of the trachea that put the patient at high risk of death. These conditions can be due to tracheal trauma, tracheal stenosis or trachea cancer. There are approximately 40,000 tracheal trauma patients diagnosed each year in the U.S. Of those, approximately 1,000 are severe enough to need surgical resection procedures. Tracheal stenosis is as a rare complication from tracheostomies, but have a devastating impact on respiratory function for patients. Approximately 2,000 patients are diagnosed with stenosis from tracheostomy in the U.S. each year. Trachea cancer is a very rare but extremely deadly cancer. Trachea cancer patients in the U.S. have a median survival of 10 months from diagnosis and a 5-year survival of only 27%. There were approximately 200 cases of primary trachea cancer diagnosed in the U.S. in 2013. Based on these facts, we estimate that there are approximately 8,000 patients in the U.S. and Europe with conditions of the trachea that put them at high risk of death, but for whom there is currently no clinically effective tracheal implant or replacement method currently available.

&#160;

We believe that a Cellspan tracheal implant may potentially provide physicians a treatment to re-establish the structural integrity and function of a damaged or diseased trachea to address life-threatening conditions due tracheal trauma, stenosis or cancer.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Our History 

&#160;

We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on May 3, 2012 by Harvard Bioscience, Inc. (&#8220;Harvard Bioscience&#8221;) to provide a means for separating its regenerative medicine business from its other businesses. Harvard Bioscience has been designing and manufacturing devices for life science researchers for over 100 years. Harvard Bioscience first explored the regenerative medicine market in 2007 and began focusing on providing devices to scientists involved in regenerative medicine research in 2008. Since early 2009, Harvard Bioscience&#8217;s regenerative medicine business initiative operated as a division of Harvard Bioscience. During this first phase of development of our company, the business was built on the basis of Harvard Bioscience&#8217;s expertise in physiology and applying that know-how to developing new organ bioreactors and other equipment to be used in regenerative medicine researchers&#8217; laboratories.

&#160;

Harvard Bioscience decided to separate its regenerative medicine business into our company, a separate corporate entity (the &#8220;Separation&#8221;), and it spun off its interest in our business to its stockholders in November 2013. Since the Separation we have been a separately-traded public company and Harvard Bioscience has not been a stockholder of our common stock or controlled our operations. Following the Separation, we continued to innovate our bioreactors based on our physiology expertise, we developed our materials science capabilities and we investigated and developed a synthetic tracheal scaffold. In April 2014, our first Chief Medical Officer, Saverio LaFrancesca, M.D., joined our company. By that time we had built and staffed cell biology laboratories at our Holliston facility, to give ourselves the ability to perform and control our scientific investigation and developments internally. At that point, we began the second phase of our company&#8217;s development.

&#160;

In mid-2014, under Dr. LaFrancesca&#8217;s leadership, we increased the pace of our scientifically-based internal analysis and development of our first-generation tracheal implant product, the HART-Trachea. From large-animal studies conducted thereafter we found that the product elicited an unfavorable inflammatory response after implantation, which required additional development and testing. These requirements extended our expectations regarding our regulatory milestones and we announced the additional testing and extended milestone expectations in January 2015. During 2015 we isolated and tested all major variables of the organ scaffold and the cell source and protocols, examining the effects of alternatives against the then-existing product approach. Through extensive in vitro preclinical studies, and small-animal and large-animal studies, we made dramatic improvements, and discovered that the mechanism of action of this new approach was very different from our hypothesis regarding that of the first-generation product. We call this new implant approach our Cellframe&#8482; technology. Our Cellframe technology uses a different scaffold material and microstructure, a different source and concentration of the patient&#8217;s cells and several other changes from our HART-Trachea product. We believe that our Cellframe technology, although built on learnings from our earlier-generation product, represents a new technology platform resulting from our rigorous science and development.. We see the development of our Cellframe technology platform as the beginning of a new, third phase in our company&#8217;s progression.

&#160;

Leading up to the time of the Separation, we engaged in activities with a surgeon, Dr. Paolo Macchiarini, then employed by the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden, one of the world&#8217;s most respected medical institutions, and who was at that time considered to be a world-renowned regenerative medicine pioneer. We provided organ bioreactors and organ scaffolds to Dr. Macchiarini&#8217;s laboratories to conduct cell biology research and in return Dr. Macchiarini was to provide us with scientific data to advance the development of our bioreactors and tracheal scaffold. We also provided bioreactors and tracheal scaffolds in support of several compassionate care human surgeries performed by Dr. Macchiarini. We collaborated with Dr. Macchiarini in an effort to advance our product research and development with the assistance of a highly-acclaimed researcher and a well-respected institution. Regarding compassionate use human surgeries, we relied on the due process that involved a team of physicians and the Institutional Review Boards of the institutions where the surgeries were performed. We developed no part of any clinical protocol in any manner. Further, all surgeries involving any of our products or product candidates were conducted under the compassionate use system governed by the rules and regulations of each institution. Dr. Macchiarini was not employed by or affiliated with our company, and we did not pay him any wages or consulting fees. In June 2014, shortly after our Chief Medical Officer joined our company we ceased support of any human surgeries with Dr. Macchiarini. In addition, in November 2014, we formally announced that we would no longer be supporting or providing products to the human surgeries being performed in Russia, based in part on our belief that, due to the design of the Russian hospital&#8217;s study and the nature and extent of the follow-up medical data made available to us, additional surgeries in Russia would provide less meaningful product development data than the work being done in our U.S. research and preclinical programs at that time.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Since the time we withdrew from involvement with Dr. Macchiarini, his work has become the subject of at least two investigations by the Karolinska Institutet. Many of the claims Dr. Macchiarini made publicly and published in peer-reviewed articles in reputable medical journals about the post-surgery quality of life, or even the necessity, of certain of his compassionate care surgeries where he used either a HART bioreactor or a HART-Trachea scaffold, or both, have been called into question. We discontinued development of our HART-Trachea product in 2014, and that first-generation product was significantly different from our new Cellframe technology and Cellspan products currently in development. We have focused our development efforts on our Cellframe technology and Cellspan products, which we have and will continue to develop internally, and with our collaborators, via a rigorous scientific development process. As a result, we believe that prior statements by Dr. Macchiarini or others regarding the patients whose surgeries utilized our HART bioreactor or HART-Trachea scaffold, or such products, are not pertinent to our Cellframe technology or Cellspan products, or their respective future development.

&#160;

Clinical Trials 

&#160;

In order to market our product candidates, we will need to successfully complete clinical trials. The initial indication for which we intend to seek FDA approval will be to restore the function of the esophagus subsequent to esophageal damage or stenosis due to cancer, injury or infection.

&#160;

Because esophageal cancer affects only approximately 17,000 patients per year in the U.S. we anticipate that our clinical trials will involve relatively few patients. Therefore, once commenced, we expect to be able to conduct a clinical trial in a relatively short period of time compared to clinical trials in indications with larger patient populations. We intend to work closely with regulatory agencies and clinical experts to design and size the clinical studies appropriately based on the specific conditions our products are intended to treat. We also intend to request expedited review from the FDA for the Cellspan esophageal implant product. Receipt of expedited review would reduce the overall time through the regulatory approval process.

&#160;

We intend to pursue regulatory approval for the Cellspan esophageal implant in the U.S., Canada and Europe initially. Following clinical trials in other foreign markets, we expect to pursue regulatory approval for the Cellspan esophageal implant in those foreign markets, as well.

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160;

Our primary research and development activities are focused in three areas: materials science, cell biology and engineering. In materials science, we focus on designing and testing biocompatible organ scaffolds, testing the structural integrity and the cellularization capacities of the scaffolds. In cell biology, we focus on developing and testing isolation and expansion protocols, cell characterization and fate studies, investigating the effects of various cell types and concentrations, evaluating the biocompatibility of scaffolds, experimenting with different cell seeding methodologies, and developing protocols for implantation experiments. Our engineering group supports the materials science and cell biology groups across an array of their activities, i.e. designing, engineering and making our proprietary organ bioreactors. All three of our R&#38;D groups combine to plan and execute the in vitro studies. A fundamental part of our R&#38;D effort in developing the Cellframe technology has been dedicated to the discovery and development of small and large animal model studies. The large-animal model employs the use of Yucatan mini-pigs. Our Cellspan scaffolds were implanted in the cervical portion as well as the thoracic portion of the esophagus and the airways in studies to date. As of December 31, 2015, we employed 12 full-time scientists and engineers and we also hire other consultants and part-time employees from time to time.

&#160;

In addition to our in-house engineering and scientific development team, we collaborate with leaders in the field of regenerative medicine who are performing the fundamental research and surgeries in this field to develop and test new products that will advance and improve the procedures being performed. As these procedures become more common, we will work with our collaborators to further enhance our products to make them more efficient and easier to use by surgeons. In the U.S., our principal collaboration is with Mayo Clinic. Collaboration typically involves us developing new technologies specifically to address issues these researchers and clinicians face. In certain instances, we have entered into agreements that govern the ownership of the technologies developed in connection with these collaborations. These agreements are discussed below in &#8220;Intellectual Property and Related Agreements.&#8221; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

We incurred approximately $5.1 million and $4.8 million of research and development expenses in 2014 and 2015, respectively. As we have not yet applied for or received regulatory approval to market any clinical products and sales of our research bioreactor products have not been significant in relation to our operating costs, no significant amount of these research and development costs have been passed on to our customers.

&#160; 

Manufacturing 

&#160;

For our scaffolds we use a process called electrospinning to create the fabric part of the scaffold. Electrospinning is a well-known fabrication process. It is useful for cell culture applications as it can create extremely thin fibers (much thinner than a human hair) that can make a fabric with pores approximately the same size as a cell. The electrospinning process parameters can be tuned to create a structure that is very similar to the natural structure of the collagen fibers in human extracellular matrix. Our Cellspan scaffolds are made from polyurethane, an inert polymer that is not bioresorbable. However, we also perform studies on the use of scaffolds made from bioresorbable materials. While we do not manufacture the cells, as they will come from the patient&#8217;s adipose tissue, for regulatory purposes we are responsible for the quality control of the cells and the seeding of the cells onto the scaffold in the bioreactor. For this we have, in collaboration with our partners, developed standard operating procedures for the seeding of cells on the scaffold. For U.S. clinical trials we anticipate that the seeding will be performed in an automated version of our bioreactor at a pre-qualified third-party contract manufacturer using current Good Manufacturing Procedures (cGMP) using our proprietary protocol and under the supervision of our staff.

&#160;

For our scaffolds, our primary materials are medical-grade plastic resins and solvents used to liquefy the resins in our manufacturing process. These materials are readily available from a variety of suppliers and do not currently represent a large proportion of our total costs. For our bioreactors, we perform final assembly and testing of components that we buy from third parties like machine shops, parts distributors, molding facilities and printed circuit board manufacturers. These operations are performed primarily at our Holliston, MA headquarters.

&#160;

Sales and Marketing 

&#160;

We expect that most surgeries using the Cellspan esophageal implant product will be performed at a relatively small number of major hospitals in the U.S., Canada and European countries that will establish themselves as specialized centers of excellence. We believe that a relatively small number of centers of excellence in each country would be able to treat a very large percentage of that country&#8217;s patients annually, given the expected number of patients to be treated each year. So, we expect our markets to be served by a concentrated number of treatment centers. Further, our three Cellspan product candidates are for the esophagus, the bronchi and the trachea, three organs all treated by thoracic surgeons. Therefore, all three products, once approved, would be marketed primarily to physicians practicing in a single surgical specialty, so we expect that the total number of physicians using our products will be a much smaller population than if our products were to be used by physicians in multiple areas of surgical specialties. Due to our expectation of a population of physicians in one surgical specialty being the primary users of our products in a concentrated number of centers of excellence in each national market, we expect to be able to support our markets with a fairly small field sales force.

&#160;

We expect to price the product commensurate with the medical value created for the patient and the costs avoided with the use of our product. We further expect to be paid by the hospital that buys the product from us. Finally, we expect that the hospital would seek reimbursement from payers for the entire transplant procedure, including the use of our products.

&#160;

Harvard Bioscience is the exclusive distributor for the research versions of our organ bioreactors. Harvard Bioscience can only sell those products to the research markets in accordance with the terms of our distribution agreement. We retain all rights to manufacture and sell all our products for clinical use.

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Intellectual Property and Related Agreements 

&#160;

We actively seek to protect our products and proprietary information by means of U.S. and foreign patents, trademarks and contractual arrangements. Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and enforce patents on our products, processes and technologies to preserve our trade secrets and other proprietary information and to avoid infringing on the patents or proprietary rights of others.

&#160;

We have rights in the patent and the patent applications listed below. The patent or patents that may issue based on the patent applications are scheduled to expire as provided below:

&#160;

We also rely on unpatented proprietary technologies in the development and commercialization of our products. We also depend upon the skills, knowledge and experience of our scientific and technical personnel, as well as those of our advisors, consultants and other contractors. To help protect our proprietary know-how that may not be patentable, and our inventions for which patents may be difficult to enforce, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. To this end, we require employees, consultants and advisors to enter into agreements that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions that arise from their activities for us. Additionally, these confidentiality agreements require that our employees, consultants and advisors do not bring to us, or use without proper authorization, any third party&#8217;s proprietary technology. &#160;

We currently have no affiliation with Harvard University.

&#160;

Separation Agreements with Harvard Bioscience 

&#160;

On November 1, 2013, to effect the Separation, Harvard Bioscience distributed all of the shares of our common stock to the Harvard Bioscience stockholders (the &#8220;Distribution&#8221;). Prior to the Distribution Harvard Bioscience contributed the assets of its regenerative medicine business, and approximately $15 million in cash, to our company to fund our operations following the Distribution.

&#160;

In connection with the Separation and immediately prior to the Distribution, we entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement, Intellectual Property Matters Agreement, Product Distribution Agreement, Tax Sharing Agreement, Transition Services Agreement, and Sublicense Agreement with Harvard Bioscience to effect the Separation and Distribution and provide a framework for our relationship with Harvard Bioscience after the Separation. These agreements govern the current relationships among us and Harvard Bioscience and provided for the allocation among us and Harvard Bioscience of Harvard Bioscience&#8217;s assets, liabilities and obligations (including employee benefits and tax-related assets and liabilities) attributable to periods prior to the Separation.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Government Regulation 

&#160;

Any product that we may develop based on our Cellframe technology, and any other clinical products that we may develop, will be subject to considerable regulation by governments. We were in the past informed by the FDA that our previous-generation tracheal product candidate would be regulated under the Biologics License Application, or BLA, pathway in the U.S. and we were informed by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) that the previous generation tracheal product would be regulated under the Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products, or ATMP, pathway in the EU. Although our Cellframe technology differs in design and performance from the first generation product candidate, we expect that Cellframe-based products will be regulated by the FDA and EMA under the same pathways as the first generation tracheal product candidate. This expectation is based on the fact that the Cellframe technology is centered on the delivery of the patient&#8217;s own cells seeded on an implanted synthetic scaffold in order to restore organ function and our belief that the cells provide the primary mode of action. Of course, it is possible that some of our current and future products may use alternative regulatory pathways.

&#160;

Combination Product/Biologic 

&#160; 

Government Regulation Combination Products/Biologics 

&#160;

We believe that products derived from our Cellframe technology may be defined as combination products consisting of two or more regulated components, a biologic and a medical device. In the U.S., a combination product usually is assigned by the FDA to one of the agency&#8217;s centers, such as the CBER or the Center for Devices and Radiological Health, or CDRH, with the chosen center to take the lead in pre-marketing review and approval of the combination product. Other FDA centers also may review the product in regard to matters that are within their expertise. The FDA selects the lead center based on an assessment of the combination product&#8217;s &#8220;primary mode of action.&#8221; Some products also may require approval or clearance from more than one FDA center.

&#160;

To determine which FDA center or centers will review a combination product submission, companies may submit a Request for Designation to the FDA. Those requests may be handled formally or informally. In some cases, jurisdiction may be determined informally based on FDA experience with similar products. However, informal jurisdictional determinations are not binding on the FDA. Companies also may submit a formal Request for Designation to the FDA Office of Combination Products. The Office of Combination Products will review the request and make its jurisdictional determination within 60 days of receiving a Request for Designation. We believe that regenerative medicine products containing cells will be reviewed by CBER, possibly with CBER&#8217;s consultation with CDRH.

&#160; 

Domestic Regulation of Our Products and Business 

&#160;

The testing, manufacturing, and potential labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, import and marketing of our products are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the U.S. and in other countries. In the U.S., the FDA, under the Public Health Service Act, the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, and its implementing regulations, regulates biologics and medical device products.

&#160;

The labeling, advertising, promotion, marketing and distribution of biopharmaceuticals, or biologics and medical devices also must be in compliance with the FDA and U.S. Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, requirements which include, among others, standards and regulations for off-label promotion, industry sponsored scientific and educational activities, promotional activities involving the internet, and direct-to-consumer advertising. The FDA and FTC have very broad enforcement authority, and failure to abide by these regulations can result in penalties, including the issuance of a warning letter directing us to correct deviations from regulatory standards and enforcement actions that can include seizures, injunctions and criminal prosecution. Recently, promotional activities for FDA-regulated products of other companies have been the subject of enforcement action brought under healthcare reimbursement laws and consumer protection statutes. In addition, under the federal Lanham Act and similar state laws, competitors and others can initiate litigation relating to advertising claims. Further, we are required to meet regulatory requirements in countries outside the U.S., which can change rapidly with relatively short notice.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory enforcement powers. Manufacturers of biologics and medical devices are subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA to determine compliance with applicable regulations, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of some of our subcontractors. Failure by manufacturers or their suppliers to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. Potential FDA enforcement actions include:

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; untitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; &#160;

&#160; &#8226; unanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions; &#160;

&#160; &#8226; customer notifications for repair, replacement, refunds; &#160;

&#160; &#8226; recall, detention or seizure of our products; &#160;

&#160; &#8226; operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production; &#160;

&#160; &#8226; operating restrictions; &#160;

&#160; &#8226; refusal to grant export approval for our products; or &#160;

&#160; &#8226; criminal prosecution. &#160;

In addition, other government authorities influence the success of our business, including the availability of adequate reimbursement from third party payers, including government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement policies can also influence corresponding policies of private insurers and managed care providers, which can further affect our business.

&#160; 

Biologics Regulation 

&#160;

Biological products must satisfy the requirements of the Public Health Services Act and the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act and their implementing regulations. In order for a biologic product to be legally marketed in the U.S., the product must have a BLA approved by the FDA.

&#160; 

The BLA Approval Process 

&#160;

The steps for obtaining FDA approval of a BLA to market a biopharmaceutical, or biologic product in the U.S. include:

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies under the FDA&#8217;s GLP regulations; &#160;

&#160; &#8226; submission to the FDA of an IND application, for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and which must include Institutional Review Board, or IRB, approval at each clinical site before the trials may be initiated; &#160;

&#160; &#8226; performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in accordance with Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for each indication; &#160;

&#160; &#8226; submission to the FDA of a BLA, which contains detailed information about the chemistry, manufacturing and controls for the product, extensive pre-clinical information, reports of the outcomes of the clinical trials, and proposed labeling and packaging for the product; &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; the FDA&#8217;s acceptance of the BLA for filing; &#160;

&#160; &#8226; satisfactory review of the contents of the BLA by the FDA, including the satisfactory resolution of any questions raised during the review or by the advisory committee, if applicable; &#160;

&#160; &#8226; satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP regulations, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to ensure the product&#8217;s identity, strength, quality and purity; and &#160;

&#160; &#8226; FDA approval of the BLA. &#160;

Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of product toxicity, as well as animal studies.

&#160;

An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions about issues such as the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND. In that case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed.

&#160;

Clinical trials are subject to extensive monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Clinical trials must be conducted under the oversight of an IRB for the relevant clinical trial sites and must comply with FDA regulations, including but not limited to those relating to GCP. Adverse events must be reported and investigated in a timely manner. To conduct a clinical trial, a company is also required to obtain the patients&#8217; informed consent in form and substance that complies with both FDA requirements and state and federal privacy and human subject protection regulations. The sponsor, the FDA or the IRB could suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to trial subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each site at which the trial is conducted must approve the protocol and any amendments. If foreign clinical trials are intended to be considered by the FDA for approval of a product in the U.S. then those foreign clinical trials performed under an IND must meet the same requirements that apply to U.S. studies. The FDA will accept a foreign clinical trial not conducted under an IND only if the trial is well-designed, well-conducted, performed by qualified investigators in accordance with international principles for GCP, or with the laws and regulations of the country in which the research was conducted, whichever provides greater protection of the human subjects. The FDA, however, has substantial discretion in deciding whether to accept data from foreign non-IND clinical trials.

&#160;

Clinical trials involving biopharmaceutical products are typically conducted in three sequential phases. The phases may overlap or be combined. A fourth, or post-approval, phase may include additional clinical trials. These phases are described generally below. We note, however, that the exact number of study subjects required for each specific intended use, and our intent to combine or &#8220;telescope&#8221; various study phases together, are both areas where we will actively seek FDA feedback to streamline the clinical evaluation process. Briefly, the phases of clinical development generally include the following:

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; Phase I. Phase I clinical trials involve the initial introduction of the product into human subjects to determine the adverse effects associated with increasing doses. Such Phase I studies frequently are highly abbreviated or combined with Phase II studies (as outlined below), when the product involves the patient&#8217;s own cells. &#160;

&#160; &#8226; Phase II. Phase II clinical trials usually involve studies in a limited patient population to evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific, targeted indications, to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks. Products that contain the patient&#8217;s own cells frequently are studied for initial safety and effectiveness determinations in combined or &#8220;telescoped&#8221; Phase I/II clinical studies. &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; Phase III. If the product is found to be potentially effective and to have an acceptable safety profile in Phase II (or sometimes Phase I) trials, the clinical trial program will be expanded to further demonstrate clinical efficacy, optimal dosage and safety within an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. As noted, the exact number of subjects needed, the duration of clinical follow-up, and the endpoints by which safety and efficacy are demonstrated are based on the condition being treated. &#160;

&#160; &#8226; Post-Approval (Phase IV). Post-approval clinical trials are required of or agreed to by a sponsor as a condition of, or subsequent to marketing approval. Further, if the FDA becomes aware of new safety information about an approved product, it is authorized to require post approval trials of the biological product. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and to document a clinical benefit in the case of biologics approved under accelerated approval regulations. If the FDA approves a product while a company has ongoing clinical trials that were not necessary for approval, a company may be able to use the data from these clinical trials to meet all or part of any Phase IV clinical trial requirement. These clinical trials are often referred to as Phase III/IV post approval clinical trials. Failure to promptly conduct Phase IV clinical trials could result in withdrawal of approval for products approved under accelerated approval regulations. &#160;

Clinical testing may not be completed successfully within any specified time period, if at all. The FDA closely monitors the progress of each of the three phases of clinical trials that are conducted under an IND and may, at its discretion, reevaluate, alter, suspend, or terminate the testing based upon the data accumulated to that point and the FDA&#8217;s assessment of the risk/benefit ratio to the patient. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time for various reasons, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. The FDA can also request that additional pre-clinical studies or clinical trials be conducted as a condition to product approval. Additionally, new government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development. Furthermore, IRBs have the authority to suspend clinical trials in their respective institutions at any time for a variety of reasons, including safety issues.

&#160;

Certain information about clinical trials, including a description of the trial, participation criteria, location of trial sites, and contact information, is required to be sent to the National Institute of Health, or NIH for inclusion in a publicly-assessable database. Sponsors also are subject to certain state laws imposing requirements to make publicly available certain information on clinical trial results. In addition, the FDA Amendments Act of 2007 directs the FDA to issue regulations that will require sponsors to submit to the NIH the results of certain controlled clinical trials, other than Phase I studies.

&#160;

Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and of the clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including information on the chemistry, manufacture and composition of the product, are submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the BLA must be accompanied by a substantial user fee. The FDA will initially review the BLA for completeness before it accepts the BLA for filing. There can be no assurance that the submission will be accepted for filing or that the FDA may not issue a refusal-to-file, or RTF. If a RTF is issued, there is opportunity for dialogue between the sponsor and the FDA in an effort to resolve all concerns. If the BLA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA will begin an in-depth review of the BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product&#8217;s identity, strength, quality and purity.

&#160;

Companies also may seek Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designation for their products. Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy products are those that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition and that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a condition. If awarded, the Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designation applies to the product only for the indication for which the designation was received.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

If the FDA determines after review of preliminary clinical data submitted by the sponsor that a Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy product may be effective, it may begin review of portions of a BLA before the sponsor submits the complete BLA (rolling review), thereby accelerating the date on which review of a portion of the BLA can begin. There can be no assurance that any of our products will be granted Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designation. And even if they are designated as Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy products, we cannot assure you that our products will be reviewed or approved more expeditiously for their Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy indications than would otherwise have been the case or will be approved promptly, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA can revoke Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designation at any time.

&#160;

In addition, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive Accelerated Approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a product receiving Accelerated Approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-approval clinical trials to verify and further define the product&#8217;s clinical benefit and safety profile. There can be no assurance that any of our products will receive Accelerated Approval. Even if Accelerated Approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw such approval if the sponsor fails to conduct the required post-approval clinical trials, or if the post-approval clinical trials fail to confirm the early benefits seen during the accelerated approval process.

&#160;

Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designation and Accelerated Approval should be distinguished from Priority Review designation although products awarded Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designation may also be eligible for Priority Review designation. Products regulated by the CBER may receive Priority Review designation if they provide significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a serious or life-threatening disease. The agency has agreed to the performance goal of reviewing products awarded Priority Review designation within six months, whereas products under standard review receive a ten-month target. The review process, however, can be significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission. Priority Review designation is requested at the time the BLA is submitted, and the FDA makes a decision as part of the agency&#8217;s review of the application for filing. We intend to seek Priority Review designation for the Cellspan esophageal implant as a biologic through the BLA process. We cannot guarantee that the FDA will grant the designation and cannot predict if awarded, what impact, if any, it will have on the review time for approval of our product.

&#160;

If granted, Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designation, Accelerated Approval and Priority Review designation may expedite the approval process, but they do not change the standards for approval.

&#160;

Before approving a BLA, the FDA will generally inspect the facility or the facilities at which the finished product and its components are manufactured to ensure compliance with cGMP.

&#160;

Separate approval is required for each proposed indication. If we want to expand the use of an approved product, we will have to design additional clinical trials, submit the trial designs to the FDA for review and complete those trials successfully.

&#160;

The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take several years to complete. Data obtained from clinical activities are not always conclusive, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all. We may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to secure necessary governmental approvals, which could delay or preclude us from marketing our products. The FDA may limit the indications for use or place other conditions, such as post approval studies, on any approvals that could restrict the commercial application of the products. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Post-Approval Requirements 

&#160;

After regulatory approval of a product is obtained, companies are required to comply with a number of post-approval requirements relating to manufacturing, labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion, distribution and recordkeeping. For example, as a condition of approval of a BLA, the FDA may require post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the product&#8217;s safety or efficacy. In addition, holders of an approved BLA are required to keep extensive records, to report certain adverse reactions and production deviations and problems to the FDA, to provide updated safety and efficacy information and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for their products. If we fail to comply with the regulatory requirements of the FDA and other applicable U.S. and foreign regulatory authorities, or previously unknown problems with any approved commercial products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes are discovered, we could be subject to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions or other setbacks. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.

&#160;

Specifically, our products could be subject to voluntary recall if we or the FDA determine, for any reason, that our products pose a risk of injury or are otherwise defective. Moreover, the FDA can order a mandatory recall if there is a reasonable probability that our device would cause serious adverse health consequences or death. In addition, the FDA could suspend the marketing of or withdraw a previously approved product from the market upon receipt of newly discovered information regarding the product&#8217;s safety or effectiveness.

&#160; 

Orphan Drug Designations 

&#160;

The Orphan Drug Act provides incentives to manufacturers to develop and market drugs and biologics for rare diseases and conditions affecting fewer than 200,000 persons in the U.S. at the time of application for orphan drug designation, or more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug or biological product available in the U.S. for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting a new drug application, or NDA, or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. In September 2014 the FDA granted orphan designation to our HART-Trachea product in the U.S. We now plan to apply for orphan designation from the FDA for our Cellspan esophageal implant product in the U.S. market. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. The first developer to receive FDA marketing approval for an orphan biologic is entitled to a seven year exclusive marketing period in the U.S. for that product as well as a waiver of the BLA user fee. The exclusivity prevents FDA approval of another application for the same product for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances where there is a change in formulation in the original product and the second product has been proven to be clinically superior to the first.

&#160; 

International 

&#160;

We plan to seek required regulatory approvals and comply with extensive regulations governing product safety, quality, manufacturing and reimbursement processes in order to market our products in other major foreign markets. The regulation of our products in the EU and in other foreign markets varies significantly from one jurisdiction to another. The classification of the particular products and related approval or CE marking procedures can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain these foreign approvals or to CE mark our products may be longer or shorter than that required in the U.S., and requirements for approval may differ from the FDA requirements. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The marketing authorization of products containing viable human tissues or cells in the EU is governed by Regulation 1394/2007/EC on advanced therapy medicinal products, read in combination with Directive 2001/83/EC of the European parliament and of the Council, commonly known as the Community code on medicinal products. Regulation 1394/2007/EC lays down specific rules concerning the authorization, supervision and pharmacovigilance of medicinal products, cell therapy medicinal products and tissue engineered products. Manufacturers of advanced therapy medicinal products must demonstrate the quality, safety and efficacy of their products to the European Medicines Agency which is required to provide an opinion regarding the application for marketing authorization. The European Commission grants or refuses marketing authorization in light of the opinion delivered by the European Medicines Agency. Regulation 1394/2007/EC also applies to combination products which consist of medical devices and advanced therapy medicinal products. In light of Regulation 1394/2007/EC, a medical device which forms part of a combined advanced therapy medicinal product must meet the Essential Requirements laid down in Annex I to Directive 93/42/EEC. The manufacturer of the combination product must include evidence of such compliance in its marketing authorization application. The application for a marketing authorization for a combined advanced therapy medicinal product must also, where available, include the results of the assessment of the medical device part by a notified body in accordance with Directive 93/42/EEC.

&#160;

Legislation similar to the Orphan Drug Act has been enacted in other jurisdictions, including the EU. The orphan legislation in the EU is available for therapies addressing conditions that affect five or fewer out of 10,000 persons. The marketing exclusivity period is for ten years, although that period can be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, available evidence establishes that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015, we had 19 employees working in our business, of whom 18 were full-time and one was part-time. At that date, all of our employees were based in the U.S. None of our employees are unionized. In general, we consider our relations with our employees to be good.

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160;

We are not aware of any companies whose products are directly competitive with our cell-seeded biocompatible synthetic scaffold system. However, in our key markets we may in the future compete with multiple pharmaceutical, biotechnology, medical device and scientific research instrument companies, including, among others, Aldagen, Asterias Biotherapeutics, Athersys, BioTime, Baxter International, Inc., Bose Corporation, Caladrius Biosciences, Celgene, Cytori Therapeutics, E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, Harvest Technologies, InVivo Therapeutics, Mesoblast, Miramatrix Medical, Nanofiber Solutions, Neuralstem, Organovo, Osiris Therapeutics, Pluristem, Smiths Medical, Tissue Genesis, Inc., Tissue Growth Technologies, Transmedics, United Therapeutics, Vericel Corporation and W.L. Gore and Associates. In addition, there are many academic and clinical centers that are developing regenerative technologies that may one day become competitors with us.

&#160;

Many of our potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technological, research and development, marketing, and personnel resources than we do. We cannot forecast if or when these or other companies may develop competitive products.

&#160;

We expect that other products will compete with products and potential products based on efficacy, safety, cost, and intellectual property positions. While we believe that these will be the primary competitive factors, other factors include, in certain instances, obtaining marketing exclusivity under the Orphan Drug Act, availability of supply, manufacturing, marketing and sales expertise and capability, and reimbursement coverage.
