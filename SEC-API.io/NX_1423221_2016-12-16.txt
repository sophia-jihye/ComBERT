 Item 1. Business (Continuing Operations). 

Our Company 

Quanex was incorporated in Delaware on December 12, 2007 as Quanex Building Products Corporation. We manufacture components for original equipment manufacturers (OEM) in the building products industry. These components can be categorized as window and door (fenestration) components and kitchen and bath cabinet components. Examples of fenestration components include (1) energy-efficient flexible insulating glass spacers, (2) extruded vinyl profiles, (3) window and door screens, and (4) precision-formed metal and wood products. In addition, we provide certain other non-fenestration components and products, which include solar panel sealants, wood flooring, trim moldings, vinyl decking, fencing, water retention barriers, and conservatory roof components. We use low-cost production processes and engineering expertise to provide our customers with specialized products for their specific window, door, and cabinet applications. We believe these capabilities provide us with unique competitive advantages. We serve a primary customer base in North America and the United Kingdom, and also serve customers in international markets through our operating plants in the United Kingdom and Germany, as well as through sales and marketing efforts in other countries. 

Our History 

Our predecessor company, Quanex Corporation, was organized in Michigan in 1927 as Michigan Seamless Tube Company, and was later reincorporated in Delaware in 1968. In 1977, Michigan Seamless Tube Company changed its name to Quanex Corporation. On December 12, 2007, Quanex Building Products Corporation was incorporated as a wholly-owned subsidiary in the state of Delaware, in order to facilitate the separation of Quanex Corporation's vehicular products and building products businesses. This separation became effective on April 23, 2008, through a spin-off of the building products business to Quanex Corporation's then-existing shareholders. Immediately following the spin-off, our former parent company, consisting principally of the vehicular products business and all non-building products related corporate accounts, merged with a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gerdau S.A. 

Since the spin-off in 2008, we have evolved our business by making investments in organic growth initiatives and taking a disciplined approach to new business and strategic acquisition opportunities, while disposing of non-core businesses. 

Notable developments and transactions which occurred since the spin-off include the following: 

&#8226; 

in March 2011, we acquired Edgetech, I.G. Inc. and its German subsidiary, which provided us with three manufacturing facilities, one each in the United States, United Kingdom and Germany, that produce and market a full line of flexible insulating glass spacer systems for window and door customers in North America and abroad. This acquisition complemented our then existing insulating glass products business in the United States and, as a result, we committed to a plan to consolidate these facilities in November 2011. This consolidation plan, in part, resulted in the closure of a plant in Barbourville, Kentucky, and the relocation of equipment that was used to manufacture the single seal, warm-edge spacer system to our facility in Cambridge, Ohio. This consolidation was substantially completed by August 2012, with minor residual cash payments and program costs incurred during fiscal 2013. We sold the facility in Barbourville in May 2014; 

&#8226; 

in December 2012, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Alumco Inc. and its subsidiaries (Alumco), an aluminum screen manufacturer, which allowed us to expand the scope of our fenestration business to include screens for vinyl window and door manufacturers and to expand our geographic reach throughout the United States; 

&#8226; 

in April 2014, we sold our interest in a limited liability company which held the net assets of our Nichols Aluminum business (Nichols), to Aleris International, Inc. (Aleris), a privately held company which provides aluminum rolled products and extrusions, aluminum recycling and specification aluminum alloy production; 

&#8226; 

in June 2015, we acquired the outstanding ownership shares of Flamstead Holdings Limited, an extruder of vinyl lineal products and manufacturer of other plastic products incorporated and registered in England and Wales. Following a pre-sale reorganization and purchase, Flamstead Holdings Limited owned 100% of the ownership shares of the following subsidiaries: HL Plastics Limited, Vintage Windows Limited, Wegoma Machinery Sales Limited (renamed in 2016 as Avantek Machinery Company), and Liniar Limited (collectively referred to as &#8220;HLP&#8221;), each registered in England and Wales. This acquisition expanded our vinyl extrusion product offerings and expanded our international presence in the global fenestration business; 

&#8226; 

in November 2015, we completed the merger of QWMS, Inc., a Delaware corporation which was a newly-formed and wholly-owned Quanex subsidiary, and WII Holding, Inc. (WII), a Delaware corporation. Upon satisfaction or waiver of 

&#160; 

conditions set forth in the merger agreement, QWMS, Inc. merged with and into WII, and WII became our wholly-owned subsidiary, and, as a result, we acquired all the subsidiaries of WII (referred to collectively as Woodcraft). Woodcraft is a manufacturer of cabinet doors and other components for OEMs in the kitchen and bathroom cabinet industry, operating various plants in the United States and Mexico; and 

&#8226; 

In October 2016, we committed to a restructuring plan that includes the closure of two vinyl-extrusion plants in the United States and our kitchen and bathroom cabinet door plant in Guadalajara, Mexico. 

As of October 31, 2016, we operated 41 manufacturing facilities located in 18 states in the United States, five facilities in the United Kingdom, one in Germany, and another in Mexico. These facilities feature efficient plant design and flexible manufacturing processes, enabling us to produce a wide variety of custom engineered products and components primarily focused on the window and door segment of the residential building products markets. We are able to maintain minimal levels of finished goods inventories at most locations because we typically manufacture products upon order to customer specifications. We believe the primary drivers of our operating results are new home construction and residential remodeling and replacement activity in the markets we serve. 

Our Industry 

Our business is largely North American based and dependent upon the spending and growth activity levels of our customers which include national and regional residential window, door and cabinet manufacturers. With the HLP acquisition in June 2015, we expanded our international presence to include a platform from which to sell vinyl extruded lineals for house systems to smaller customers primarily in the United Kingdom. 

We use data related to housing starts and window shipments in the United States and United Kingdom, as published by or derived from third-party sources, to evaluate the fenestration market in these countries. We also use data related to cabinet demand in the United States to evaluate the residential cabinet market.

According to Freedonia Group, a consulting and research firm, total United States residential cabinet demand is expected to increase 6.9% annually from 2014 to 2019. 

We have noted the following trends which we believe affect our industry: 

&#8226; 

the number of housing starts and window shipments in the United States has increased in recent years following a dramatic decline from 2007 through 2011. The NAHB expects this trend to continue for the next several years, which should result in higher demand for our fenestration and kitchen and bathroom cabinet door products; 

&#8226; 

the recent growth in the housing market has been predominately in new construction which has outpaced the growth in the residential remodeling and replacement sector; growth in the residential remodeling and replacement sector has been stagnated by uncertainty in the economy and the job market; 

&#8226; 

the recovery of the housing market has been slowed due to predominant growth of multi-family homes compared to mid- and higher priced single family homes; the current growth in single-family homes has seen the share of the large tract builders increase and the smaller custom builders decrease; and multi-family and tract homes typically employ fewer, lower cost, and less energy efficient windows and lower cost kitchen and bathroom cabinets; 

&#8226; 

programs in the United States such as Energy Star have improved customer awareness of the technological advances in window and door energy-efficiency, but the government has been reluctant to enforce stricter energy standards; 

&#8226; 

foreign currency rates in the United Kingdom and other European nations have changed significantly relative to the United States Dollar due in part to the referendum relating to a potential exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union during June 2016; 

&#8226; 

commodity prices have fluctuated in recent years, and to the extent we cannot pass this cost to our customers, this impacts cost of critical materials used in our manufacturing processes such as resin, which affects margins related to our vinyl extrusion products; oil products such as butyl, which affects our insulating glass products; and aluminum and wood products used by our other businesses; and 

&#8226; 

higher energy efficiency standards in Europe should favorably impact sales of our insulating glass spacer products in the short- to mid-term. 

Strategy 

Our vision is to be the preferred supplier to our customers in each market we serve. Our strategy to achieve this vision includes the following: 

&#8226; 

focus on organic growth with our current customer base and expand our market share with national and regional customers by providing: (1) a quality product; (2) a high level of customer service; (3) product choices at different price points; and (4) new products or enhancements to existing product offerings. These enhancements may include higher thermal efficiency, enhanced functionality, improved weatherability, better appearance and best-in-class quality for our fenestration and cabinet door products; 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

realize improved profitability in our manufacturing processes through: (1) ongoing preventive maintenance programs; (2) better utilization of our capacity by focusing on operational efficiencies and reducing scrap; (3) marketing our value added products; and (4) focusing on employee safety; 

&#8226; 

offer logistic solutions that provide our customers with just-in-time service which can reduce their processing costs; 

&#8226; 

pursue targeted business acquisitions that allow us to expand our existing footprint, enhance our existing product offerings, acquire complementary technology, enhance our leadership position within the markets we serve, and expand into adjacent markets or service lines; and 

&#8226; 

exit unprofitable service lines. 

Business Segments 

We currently have three reportable business segments: (1) North American Engineered Components segment (&#8220;NA Engineered Components&#8221;), comprised of four operating segments primarily focused on the fenestration market in North America manufacturing vinyl profiles, insulating glass ("IG") spacers, screens &#38; other fenestration components; (2) European Engineered Components segment (&#8220;EU Engineered Components&#8221;), comprised of our United Kingdom-based vinyl extrusion business, manufacturing vinyl profiles and conservatories, and the European insulating glass business manufacturing IG spacers; and (3) North American Cabinet Components segment (&#8220;NA Cabinet Components&#8221;), comprised solely of the North American cabinet door and components business acquired in November 2015. We continue to maintain the grouping previously called Corporate &#38; Other, now called Unallocated Corporate &#38; Other, but a portion of the general and administrative costs associated with the corporate office have been allocated to the reportable operating segments, based upon a relative measure of profitability in order to more accurately reflect each reportable operating segment's administrative costs. Certain costs were not allocated to the business segments, but remain in Unallocated Corporate &#38; Other, including transaction expenses, stock-based compensation, long-term incentive awards based on the performance of our common stock and other factors, certain severance and legal costs not deemed to be allocable to all segments, depreciation of corporate assets, interest expense, other, net, income taxes and inter-segment eliminations. This treatment was applied to avoid an asymmetrical allocation amongst the reportable operating segments for the comparative period due to the timing of acquisitions. Prior to November 2, 2015, we had two reportable business segments: (1) Engineered Products, comprised of our four operating segments focused primarily on North American fenestration, and (2) International Extrusion, comprised solely of HLP acquired on June 15, 2015. In addition, we recorded LIFO inventory adjustments, corporate office charges and inter-segment eliminations as Corporate &#38; Other. Prior to April 1, 2014, we presented two reportable segments: (1) Engineered Products, and (2) Aluminum Sheet Products as well as corporate and other. On April 1, 2014, we sold Nichols, the sole operating segment included in our Aluminum Sheet Products reportable segment, leaving one reportable segment. To account for Nichols as a discontinued operation, we reclassified certain costs from Corporate &#38; Other to Nichols, including a portion of the LIFO reserve, as well as insurance accruals related to workers compensation claims, to properly reflect these direct expenses as a component of the disposal group. The accounting policies of our operating segments are the same as those used to prepare our accompanying consolidated financial statements. Financial information specific to each segment is located in Note 18, "Segment Information" of the accompanying financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Our Strengths 

We believe our strengths include design expertise, new technology development capability, customer service, just-in-time delivery systems, high quality manufacturing, the ability to generate unique patented products and participation in industry and governmental advocacy. 

Raw Materials and Supplies 

We purchase a diverse range of raw materials, which include PVC, epoxy resin, butyl, titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) desiccant powder, silicone and EPDM rubber compounds, coated and uncoated aluminum sheet and wood (both hardwood and softwood). These raw materials are generally available from several suppliers at market prices. We may enter into sole sourcing arrangements with our suppliers from time to time if we believe we can realize beneficial savings, but only after we have determined that the vendor can reliably supply our raw material requirements. These sole sourcing arrangements generally have termination clauses to protect us if a sole sourced vendor could not provide raw materials timely and on economically feasible terms. We believe there are other qualified suppliers from which we could purchase raw materials and supplies. 

&#160; 

Competition 

Our products are sold under highly competitive conditions. We compete with a number of companies, some of which have greater financial resources than us. We believe the primary competitive factors in the markets we serve include price, product quality, delivery and the ability to manufacture to customer specifications. The volume of engineered building products that we manufacture represents a small percentage of annual domestic consumption. Similarly, our subsidiaries in the United Kingdom compete against some larger vinyl producers and smaller window manufacturers. For our kitchen and bathroom cabinet door business, we believe we are the largest supplier to OEMs in the United States, but we compete with other national and regional businesses, including OEMs who are vertically integrated. 

We compete against a range of small and mid-size metal, vinyl and wood products suppliers, wood molding companies, and the in-house operations of customers who have vertically integrated fenestration operations. We also compete against IG spacer manufacturing firms. IG systems are used in numerous end markets including residential housing, commercial construction, appliances and transportation vehicles, but we primarily serve the residential housing market. Competition is largely based on regional presence, custom engineering, product development, quality, service and price. Primary competitors include, but are not limited to, Veka, Deceuninck, Energi, Vision Extrusions, GED Integrated Solutions, Technoform, Swiss Spacer, Thermix, Rite Screen, Allmetal, and Endura. Competitors in the vinyl extrusion business in the United Kingdom include Epwin, Veka, Synseal, Eurocell and others. Primary competitors in the cabinet door business in the United States include Conestoga, Decore-ative Specialties, Northern Contours and others. 

Sales, Marketing, and Distribution 

We sell our products to customers in various countries. Therefore, we have sales representatives whose territories essentially cover the United States, Canada, Europe, and to a lesser extent, the Middle East, Latin and South America, Australia and Asia. Our sales force is tasked with selling and marketing our complete range of components, products and systems to national and regional OEMs through a direct sales force in North America and Europe, supplemented with the limited use of distributors and independent sales agents. 

Customers 

Certain of our businesses or product lines are largely dependent on a relatively few large customers. See Note 1, " Nature of Operations, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies - Concentration of Credit Risk and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts ," of the accompanying financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for related disclosure. 

Sales Backlog 

&#32;Given the short lead times involved in our business, we have a relatively low backlog, approximately $25 million as of October 31, 2016. The criteria for revenue recognition has not been met with regard to sales backlog, and therefore, we have not recorded revenue or deferred revenue pursuant to these sales orders. If these sales orders result in a sale, we will record revenue during fiscal 2017 in accordance with our revenue recognition accounting policy. 

Seasonal Nature of Business 

Our business is impacted by seasonality. We have historically experienced lower sales for our products during the first half of our fiscal year as winter weather reduces homebuilding and home improvement activity. Our operating income tends to decline during this period of lower sales because a higher percentage of our operating expenses are fixed overhead. We typically experience more favorable results in the third and fourth quarters of the fiscal year. Our exposure to seasonality was somewhat tempered with the entry into the kitchen and bathroom cabinet door industry, which is focused "inside the house" and less susceptible to inclement weather. Expenses for labor and other costs are generally semi-variable throughout the year. 

Working Capital 

We fund operations through a combination of available cash and cash equivalents, cash flow generated from our operations, and borrowings from our revolving credit facility. We extend credit to our domestic customers in the ordinary course of business generally for a term of 30 days, while the terms for our international customers vary from cash advances to 90 days. Inventories of raw materials are carried in quantities deemed necessary to ensure a smooth production process, some of which are governed by consignment agreements with suppliers. We strive to maintain minimal finished goods inventories, while ensuring an adequate supply on hand to service customer needs. 

&#160; 

Service Marks, Trademarks, Trade Names, and Patents 

Our federally registered trademarks or service marks include QUANEX, QUANEX and design, "Q" design, TRUSEAL TECHNOLOGIES, DURASEAL, DURALITE, SOLARGAIN EDGE TAPE, ENVIROSEALED WINDOWS, EDGETHERM, COLONIAL CRAFT, EDGETECH, ECOBLEND, SUPER SPACER, TSS, TRUE WARM, E &#38; Design, QUIET EDGE, HEALTH SMART WINDOWS, ENERGY WISE WINDOWS, DESI-ROPE, 360 and design, INTELLICLIP, SUSTAINAVIEW, MIKRON, MIKRONWOOD, MIKRONBLEND, MIKRON BLEND and design, ENERGYCORE, FUSION INSULATED SYSTEM, AIRCELL, SUPERCOAT, SUPERCAP, STYLELOCK, STYLELOCK and design, K2 MIKRON and design, HOMESHIELD, HOMESHIELD and design, STORM SEAL, and TENON. We consider the following marks, design marks and associated trade names to be valuable in the conduct of our business: HOMESHIELD, COLONIAL CRAFT, TRUSEAL TECHNOLOGIES, EDGETECH, MIKRON, WOODCRAFT and QUANEX. With the acquisition of HLP in June 2015, we acquired a number of registered designs, patents and trademarks registered in the United Kingdom, which include: MODLOK, LINIAR, SUPERCUT, and various other trademarks and patents which are pending approval. Generally, our business does not depend on patent protection, but patents obtained with regard to our vinyl extrusion products and processes, fabricated metal components and IG spacer products business remain a valuable competitive advantage over other building products manufacturers. We obtain patent protection for various dies and other tooling created in connection with the production of customer-specific vinyl profile designs and vinyl extrusions. Our fabricated metal components business obtains patent protection for its thresholds. Our window sealant business unit relies on patents to protect the design of several of its window spacer products. Although we hold numerous patents, the proprietary process technology that has been developed is also considered a source of competitive advantage. 

Research and Development 

&#32;In general, we expense research and development costs as incurred. We devote time, effort and expense to: (1) custom- engineer products for specific customer applications; (2) develop superior, proprietary process technology; and (3) partner with customers to develop new products. In addition, we may acquire businesses with patented technology in order to expand our product offerings. We partner with several universities to help fund new product applications which may benefit our business. 

Environmental and Employee Safety Matters 

We are subject to extensive laws and regulations concerning worker safety, the discharge of materials into the environment and the remediation of chemical contamination. To satisfy such requirements, we must make capital and other expenditures on an on-going basis. The cost of worker safety and environmental matters has not had a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition in the past, and we are not currently aware of any existing conditions that we believe are likely to have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, or cash flows. 

Safety and Environmental Policies 

For many years, we have maintained compliance policies that are designed to help protect our workforce, to identify and reduce the potential for job-related accidents, and to minimize liabilities and other financial impacts related to worker safety and environmental issues. These policies include extensive employee training and education, as well as internal policies embodied in our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. We have a Director of Environmental, Health and Safety and maintain a company-wide Safety Council, comprised of leaders from across the organization, which meets regularly to discuss safety issues and drive safety improvements. We plan to continue to focus on safety in particular as a core strategy to improve our operational efficiency and financial performance. 

Remediation 

Under applicable state and federal laws, we may be responsible for, among other things, all or part of the costs required to remove or remediate wastes or hazardous substances at locations we, or our predecessors, have owned or operated. From time to time, we also have been alleged to be liable for all or part of the costs incurred to clean up third-party sites where there might have been an alleged improper disposal of hazardous substances. At present, we are not involved in any such matters. 

Environmental Compliance Costs 

From time to time, we incur routine expenses and capital expenditures associated with compliance with existing environmental regulations, including control of air emissions and water discharges, and plant decommissioning costs. We have not incurred any material expenses or capital expenditures related to environmental matters during the past three fiscal years, and do not expect to incur a material amount of such costs in fiscal 2017. While we will continue to have future expenditures related to environmental matters, any such amounts are impossible to reasonably estimate at this time. Based upon our experience to date, we do not believe 

&#160; 

that our compliance with environmental requirements will have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition or cash flows. 

Employees 

As of October 31, 2016, we had 4,138 employees. Of these employees, 3,540 were domiciled in the United States, 519 in the United Kingdom, 65 in Germany, and 14 in Mexico.
