Our Company 

&#160;

Live Ventures Incorporated is a holding company for diversified businesses. Commencing in fiscal year 2015, we began a strategic shift in our business plan away from providing online marketing solutions for small and medium business to acquiring profitable companies in various industries that have demonstrated a strong history of earnings power. Prior to that shift, we primarily promoted online marketing solutions to small and medium businesses to help them boost customer awareness, gain visibility and manage their online presence under our Velocity Local&#8482; brand. In 2013 we launched LiveDeal.com, real-time &#8220;deal engine&#8221; that connects restaurants across the United States and consumers via an platform. The LiveDeal.com platform targets restaurants in cities across the United States to help them use the platform to attract new customers. In addition, through our subsidiary, ModernEveryday, we maintain an online consumer products retailer.

&#160;

We continue to actively develop, revise and evaluate our products, services and our marketing strategies in our businesses. As a result of the shift in our strategy, as of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, we decided to cease operating Live Goods, DealTicker and we discontinued our suite of online presence marketing products and solutions under the Velocity Local&#8482; brand. Due to the shift in our business to diversifying our operations by acquiring businesses in several industries, we expect that revenues from our online marketplace business segment and our legacy products will be continue to be diluted in the coming months and years.

&#160;

Under the Live Ventures brand we seek opportunities to acquire profitable and well-managed companies. We will work closely with consultants who will help us identify target companies that fit within the criteria we have established for opportunities that will provide synergies with our businesses.

Manufacturing and Industrial Products Segment 

&#160;

Marquis Industries, Inc. 

&#160;

In July 2015, we acquired a majority interest in Marquis Industries, Inc., a Georgia corporation, through our partially-owned subsidiary, Marquis Affiliated Holdings LLC. Marquis Industries is a leading carpet manufacturer and a manufacturer of innovative yarn products, as well as a reseller of hard surface flooring products. Over the last decade, Marquis has been an innovator and leader in the value-oriented polyester carpet sector, which is currently the market&#8217;s fastest-growing fiber category. We focus on the residential, niche commercial, and hospitality end-markets and serve over 2,000 customers.

&#160;

Since its founding in 1990, Marquis has built a strong reputation for outstanding value, styling, and customer service. Its innovation has yielded products and technologies that differentiate its brands in the flooring marketplace. Marquis&#8217;s state-of-the-art operations enable high quality products, unique customization, and exceptionally short lead-times. Furthermore, the Company has recently invested in additional capacity to grow several attractive lines of business, including printed carpet and yarn extrusion. Through its A-O Division, utilizes its state-of-the-art yarn extrusion capacity to market monofilament textured yarn products to the artificial turf industry.

&#160;

We operate our business through 14 divisions, each specializing in a distinct area of the business. Best Buy Flooring Source is the largest of all of the operating divisions with sales to over 2,000 carpet dealers. The following is a breakdown of each division and the specialized products sold:

Products 

&#160;

Carpets &#38; Rugs 

&#160;

Marquis is a top 10 residential carpet manufacturer in the US and also produces innovative commercial products. Marquis has 21 running line styles offering outstanding quality and value. It also offers special value in polyester styles and residential nylon roll buy. Beginning in 2014, Marquis offered eight new carpet styles with 6.8 twists or better, six styles in &#188; gauge construction and to with a 1/8 gauge construction. These styles have some of the best performance ratings in the industry.

&#160;

Hard Surfaces 

&#160;

In the past 10 years, Marquis has developed one of the strongest and most competitive, high styled hard surface lines on the market. The Best Buy Hard Surface running line is a mainstream line up of high styled luxury vinyl tile, several unique laminates and hand scraped engineered wood along with six individual series of vinyl. Best Buy Hard Surface also features hundreds of rolls of vinyl specials at promotional prices.

&#160;

Yarns 

&#160;

Through it&#8217;s A-O Division, Marquis uses state-of-the-art yarn extrusion capacity to market monofilament textured yarn products to the artificial turf industry.

&#160;

Industry and Market 

&#160;

Marquis is a significant flooring manufacturer within a fragmented industry composed of a wide variety of companies from small privately held firms to large multinationals. In 2013, the US floor covering industry had an estimated $20.0 billion in sales, up 6.6 % over 2012&#8217;s sales of $18.8 billion, which was an increase of 4.8% over 2011 sales of $17.9 billion. The US market represents only about 9% of world floor covering sales, which were estimated to be $208 billion in 2012.

&#160;

Flooring covering sales are influenced by the homeowner remodeling and residential builder markets, existing home sales and housing starts, average house size and home ownership. In addition, the level of sales in the floor covering industry is influenced by consumer confidence, spending for durable goods, the condition of residential and commercial construction, and overall strength of the economy.

&#160; 

Our Market 

&#160;

Carpet and Rugs 

&#160;

The carpet and rug industry had shipments of $10.4 billion in 2013 in the U.S., up 6.5% from 2012. The industry has two primary markets, residential and commercial, with the residential market making up the largest portion of the industry. The industry has two primary-sub-markets, replacement and new construction, with replacement being the significant industry factor. Approximately 60% of industry shipments are made in response to residential replacement demand.

&#160;

Residential products consist of broadloom carpets and rugs in a broad range of styles, colors and textures. Commercial products consist primarily of broadloom carpet and modular carpet tile for a variety of institution al applications such as office buildings, restaurant chains, schools and other commercial establishments. The carpet industry also manufactures carpet for the automotive, recreational vehicle, small boat and other industries.

&#160;

The Carpet and Rug Institute (the &#34;CRI&#34;) is the national trade association representing carpet and rug manufacturers. Information compiled by the CRI suggests that the domestic carpet and rug industry is comprised of fewer than 100 manufacturers, with a meaningful percentage of the industry's production concentrated in a limited number of manufacturers focused on the lower end of the price curve.

&#160;

Hard Surfaces 

&#160;

Hard flooring surfaces such as ceramic, vinyl, hardwood, stone, and laminate have shipments of $9.6 billion in 2013 in the U.S., up 6.8% from 2012. As with carpet and rugs, the market is split between residential / commercial and replacement / new construction with residential replacement being the largest segment of the market.

&#160;

Synthetic Turf 

&#160;

Northwest Georgia has become host to a relative of the carpet industry -a thriving synthetic turf industry. Early versions of fake grass, in domed and open-air sports stadiums, used to be referred to as &#34;carpet&#34; by the athletes who played upon it. Today it's more like a manmade organism, with advanced underlay, cushioning and drainage systems. AstroTurf, the granddaddy of artificial turf, is headquartered in Dalton, GA. Other major turf players in Georgia include Challenger Industries, Controlled Products, Synthetic Turf Resources, and Grass-Tex. Marquis, through its A-O Industries division, has developed significant yarn extrusion expertise and services the synthetic turf industry through the sale of highest quality yarns. Marquis is the only company in the industry able to efficiently perform certain texturizing processes that are valued by turf manufacturers.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

Marquis is a fully integrated carpet mill, and as a result it is able to produce carpet at the lowest cost possible for its target price point. Marquis offers a one stop shop for soft and hard surface products, allowing its customers to save time and receive exceptional service. The company offers innovative products and has quick turnaround times turning a new product in two weeks from conception to delivery. The principal methods of competition are service, quality, price, product innovation and technology. Marquis&#8217; lean operating structure plus investments in manufacturing equipment, computer systems and marketing strategy contribute to its ability to provide exceptional value on the basis of performance, quality, style and service, rather than just competing on price.

&#160;

Raw Materials and Suppliers 

&#160;

Our suppliers include Honeywell, DAK, Global Backing and Mattex. We believe that we will have access to an adequate supply of raw material on satisfactory commercial terms for the foreseeable future. We are not dependent on any one supplier.

&#160;

Customers 

&#160;

Marquis sells products to flooring dealers, home centers, other flooring manufacturers and directly to the end user. Approximately 70% of sales are to a network of over 2,000 flooring dealers across several different end markets, geographies, and product lines. Management believes that the dealer market is the most profitable market for its products because it&#8217;s a diversified customer base that values innovation, style and service. Dealer networks typically allow the Company to achieve higher margin, lower volume accounts. We have only one customer whose sales represent more than 10% of Marquis&#8217; total revenues. As a result we are not dependent on any one customer to sustain our revenue. Although we also sell our products to a limited number of retailers, sales to those retailers make up a very small percentage of Marquis&#8217; revenue.

&#160;

Manufacturing

&#160;

Marquis has a manufacturing facility with state-of-the-art equipment in all phases of its vertically integrated production, from extrusion of yarn to yarn processing to tufting carpet. Marquis manufactures high quality products and offer unique customization with exceptionally short lead-times. Marquis has recently invested in new, efficient equipment to expand it yarn extrusion capacity to enter new markets. The new equipment allows Marquis to reduce production costs and increase margins. Marquis has existing capacity to grow sales by 25% without additional investment.

&#160; 

Marketing 

&#160;

The Company has a team of 23 full-time salespeople who constantly deepen customer relationships throughout its markets.

&#160;

Online Marketplace Platform Segment 

&#160;

LiveDeal.com 

&#160;

In September 2013, we launched LiveDeal.com. LiveDeal.com is a real-time &#8220;deal engine&#8221; connecting restaurants with consumers. LiveDeal.com provides marketing solutions to restaurants to boost customer awareness and merchant visibility on the Internet. Restaurants can sign up to use the LiveDeal platform at our website.

&#160;

Highlights of LiveDeal.com include:

&#160;

&#8212; an intuitive interface enabling restaurants to create limited-time offers and publish them immediately, or on a preset schedule that is fully customizable;

&#160;

&#8212; state-of-the-art scheduling technology giving restaurants the freedom to choose the days, times and duration of the offers, enabling them to create offers that entice consumers to visit their establishment during their slower periods;

&#160;

We were best known for migrating print yellow pages to the Internet in 1994 and began to develop the model for LiveDeal.com after having worked closely with well-known publishers in the daily deal market. In mid-2013, we tested the beta platform in a number of cities, and the model has been well received by restaurants, consumers, and various restaurant associations.

&#160;

During fiscal 2014 we acquired three business that offer consumer products. We incorporated the sale of consumer products into our livedeal.com platform to increase our product offering. Below is a brief description of the businesses purchased in fiscal 2014:

&#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Modern Everyday, Inc., 

&#160;

Modern Everyday, Inc. (&#8220;MEI&#8221;), acquired in August 2014, has both a retail location and a web presence providing consumers with products that range from kitchen and dining products, apparel and sporting goods to children's toys and beauty products. Modern Everyday also has proprietary software that will give us the capability to track products and predict consumer behavior and spending habits.

&#160; 

DA Stores Asset Acquisition 

&#160;

On March 7, 2014, Live Goods acquired substantially all of the assets of DA Stores, LLC, a furniture retailer, which included inventory and equipment, furniture, software, hardware, and domain names. As of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, we decided to cease operating Live Goods.

&#160;

DealTicker&#8482; 

&#160;

On May 6, 2014, Live Goods acquired DealTicker, an online platform company in the retail industry offering discounted products and services in the US and Canada This acquisition increased our ability to sell consumer goods online. For strategic reasons, we closed the operations of DealTicker.

&#160;

Promotional Marketing 

&#160;

In November 2012, we commenced the sale of marketing tools that help local businesses manage their online presence under what was previously our Velocity Local&#8482; brand, which we refer to as online presence marketing. In September 2015, we sold all of the assets of Velocity Local,and discontinued the business.

&#160;

Our target customers were SMB owners who work long hours to deliver real value to their customers in their own communities that do not have the time or expertise to develop the powerful, multi-faceted, online marketing and advertising programs necessary for successful online marketing. We sourced local special deals and activities for SMBs. We offered our clients a solution that utilizes our business channels to market our clients&#8217; products and services to potential customers.

&#160;

Prior to our launch of LiveDeal.com, our business strategy included partnering established strategic publishing partners to publish and sell our client&#8217;s deals in exchange for a share of the revenue. We had entered into sourcing agreements with several reputable publishers who have large user bases, including Travelzoo, Google Local, and Amazon, and act as an intermediary to connect SMBs to our publishing partners. Our business relied in part on the ability of our partners to display our clients&#8217; deals to a large, relevant audience and to sell the offers. However, with the launch of LiveDeal.com, we focused our promotional marketing efforts and offer a substantial portion of those products and services through our own proprietary platform.

&#160;

Marketing 

&#160;

General. We rely on telemarketing and online lead generation to drive customer acquisition. We have created our own telemarketing sales team which works with highly automated technology and specializes in creating, deploying and managing telemarketing campaigns quickly and efficiently. We believe that our telemarketing structure enables us to build and scale sales programs quickly.

&#160;

We have long-standing relationships with data and lead providers, which enable us to source high quality leads and to focus our telemarketing efforts toward the demographics we believe most likely to result in long-term customers. We primarily market our products and services to SMBs in lists we acquire from third party data companies.

&#160;

LiveDeal.com National Advertising Campaign. In 2014, we launched a 35 city advertising campaign to support the restaurant owners who have created more than 10,000 deals in over 8,000 restaurants in those 35 cities. The campaign, which includes TV, Radio and web-based ad delivery, is designed to expand awareness, increase user registrations and drive traffic into the restaurant locations that are utilizing the LiveDeal real-time &#8220;deal engine&#8221;. 

&#160;

Our Market 

&#160;

More than 27 million SMBs operate in the United States today. While a majority of SMBs have a website, most of them are not optimized for mobile devices and therefore do not effectively generate business for the SMB. SMB owners frequently lack the time, expertise or resources necessary to make their website a relevant, effective part of their marketing efforts, or to exploit the additional internet marketing channels needed for successful online marketing. Our target customers are SMBs which normally do not market their products and services nationally, but wish to utilize local marketing opportunities, including local search, to promote their products and services.

&#160;

Effective online marketing requires the dedication of time, the marshaling of resources, and the development of technological, language, presentation and other skills and expertise that few SMB owners have, or have the intention or realistic ability to acquire. We recognize that, to succeed, many SMB owners must remain intensely focused on the fundamentals of their business.

&#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

At the same time, we believe that many SMB owners realize that an effective internet presence &#8211; including engaging with online and social tools &#8211; is essential to their marketing efforts, and SMBs are shifting their marketing budgets from traditional media to online channels. According to BIA/Kelsey forecasts, traditional media business segments such as print advertising, Yellow Pages and newspapers are experiencing large declines in advertising revenues, whereas social media advertising revenues will grow from $5.1 billion in 2010 to $8.2 billion in 2015, representing a compound annual growth rate of 10%. According to internet research firm ComScore, online ad spending increased to just over $30 billion in the U.S. in 2011, a 20.2% increase over 2010.

&#160;

According to PricewaterhouseCoopers and the Interactive Advertising Bureau, or PWC and IAB, local online/digital advertising revenues in the United States rose 14% in the first half of 2012 and continued to rise steeply through the end of 2012. Searches for products, services or businesses constrained by geographical search parameters, such as municipality or zip code, which we refer to as local searches, are an increasingly significant segment of the online marketing industry. According to a May 2011 study, The Kelsey Group estimates that the local search market in the United States will grow from $5.7 billion in 2011 to $10.2 billion in 2016. PWC and IAB also report that revenue from search is 47% of the total internet advertising revenue.

&#160;

Accordingly, many SMBs need a partner with the necessary expertise and understanding to manage evolving internet audience acquisition services. We believe that this creates a large market opportunity for nimble, reliable and reputable service providers that help companies leverage these new channels efficiently and at affordable prices.

&#160;

The continued rise in smart phones, which now outsell traditional mobile phones, has changed the ground rules for online marketing, with the consumption of online advertising rapidly moving to mobile devices. As of mid-2012, eMarketer anticipated that overall spending on mobile advertising in the United States, including display, search and messaging-based ads served to mobile phones and tablets, would rise to $4 billion in 2012 (a 180% increase over 2011), $7.19 billion in 2013, and nearly $21 billion by 2016. Borrell Associates&#8217; August 2011 Mobile Report projected that the amount spent on mobile advertising will double every year for the next five years. If borne out, in 2016, mobile advertising would exceed the amount spent on local search advertising in 2011.

&#160;

We see SMBs quickly adapting to the local and mobile marketing opportunities because of the great potential to retain existing and draw in new customers at affordable prices. We anticipate that soon most online searches will be conducted using a mobile phone, which greatly increases the effectiveness of mobile marketing.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

General. Many of our competitors have access to greater capital resources than we do. These resources could enable our competitors to engage in advertising and other promotional activities that will enhance their brand name recognition and market share. We believe, however, that our products provide a simple and affordable way for our clients to create a web presence to market their products and services to local audiences. We further believe that we can compete effectively by continuing to provide quality services at competitive prices and by actively developing new products and services for potential clients that enable us to become a single vendor for the online marketing needs of SMBs. 

&#160;

Promotional Marketing. Our promotional marketing business (including our new LiveDeal.com platform) competes for local deals with several large competitors, such as Groupon and LivingSocial, and many smaller competitors. This business is part of a new market which has operated at a substantial scale for only a limited period of time. We expect competition in this market to continue to increase because no significant barriers to entry exist. Contracts with deal publishers typically contain exclusivity provisions which restrict SMBs from offering deals through other outlets.

&#160;

We seek desirable local products and services which we can provide to our publishing partners. We believe that we are in a position to compete in this market successfully due to the unique features of our LiveDeal.com platform (as described above), our experienced sales managers, our experience at sourcing, selling and servicing large numbers of small business accounts, the comprehensiveness of our database, the effectiveness of our marketing programs, and the diversity of our publisher distribution network. Our distribution partnerships allow our clients to reach large audiences and promote their products and services in innovative ways.

&#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The principal competitive factors in this market include personalization of service, ease of use, quality of services, availability of quality content, value-added products and services, access to consumers, effectiveness at driving business to our clients, and price.

&#160;

Many boutique firms offer services similar to our online presence marketing products. Generally these small firms cannot provide all the comprehensive services we do. However, these small firms provide many options for web design, social media marketing, internet marketing, and search engine optimization.

&#160;

Because of efficiencies stemming from our proprietary software and business structure, we are generally able to provide these services at a lower recurring cost and with lower upfront charges to commence a complete marketing campaign and build a client&#8217;s mobile-optimized website.

&#160;

We also compete against larger companies which offer a similar or more expanded set of products. Our principal competitive advantages over these companies are our lower prices and the better quality and service of our website design, particularly our web app platform. We believe our combination of outstanding service and low cost will enable us to provide a suite of attractive packages to our clients.

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

Our success will depend significantly on our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technology and operate without infringing upon the intellectual property rights of third parties. We currently rely primarily on a combination of copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions, and similar measures to protect our intellectual property.

&#160;

We estimate that reliance upon trade secrets and unpatented proprietary know-how will continue to be our principal method of protecting our trade secrets and other proprietary technologies. While we have hired third-party contractors to help develop our proprietary software and to provide various fulfillment services, we generally own (or have permissive licenses for) the intellectual property provided by these contractors. Our proprietary software is not substantially dependent on any third-party software, although our software does utilize open source code. Notwithstanding the use of this open source code, we do not believe our usage requires public disclosure of our own source code nor do we believe the use of open source code will have a material impact on our business.

&#160;

We register some of our product names, slogans and logos in the United States. In addition, we generally require our employees, contractors and many of those with whom we have business relationships to sign non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements. Neither intellectual property laws, contractual arrangements, nor any of the other steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property, can ensure that third parties will not exploit our technologies or develop similar technologies.

&#160;

Our proprietary publishing system provides an advanced set of integrated tools for design, service, and modifications to support our mobile web app services. Our mobile web app builder software enables easy and efficient design, end user modification and administration, and includes a variety of other tools accessible by our team members. 

&#160;

Corporate Offices 

&#160;

Our principal offices are located at 325 E. Warm Springs Road, Suite 102, Las Vegas, Nevada 89119, our telephone number is (702) 939-0231, and our corporate website (which does not form part of this report) is located at www.livedeal.com.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of September 30, 2015, we had 300 full-time employees and two part-time employees in the United States, none of whom is covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
