 ITEM 1. 

Business 

Our Company 

CareTrust REIT, Inc. (&#8220;CareTrust&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) was formed on October 29, 2013, as a wholly owned subsidiary of The Ensign Group, Inc. (&#8220;Ensign&#8221;). On June 1, 2014, Ensign completed the separation of its healthcare business and its real estate business into two separate and independent publicly traded companies through the distribution of all of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company to Ensign stockholders on a pro rata basis (the &#8220;Spin-Off&#8221;). The Spin-Off was effective from and after June 1, 2014, with shares of our common stock distributed to Ensign stockholders on June 2, 2014. CareTrust holds substantially all of the real property that was previously owned by Ensign. As of December 31, 2015, CareTrust&#8217;s real estate portfolio consisted of 122 skilled nursing facilities (&#8220;SNFs&#8221;), assisted living facilities (&#8220;ALFs&#8221;) and independent living facilities (&#8220;ILFs&#8221;). Of these properties, 94 are leased to Ensign on a triple-net basis under multiple long-term leases (each, an &#8220;Ensign Master Lease&#8221; and, collectively, the &#8220;Ensign Master Leases&#8221;) that have cross default provisions and are all guaranteed by Ensign, 14 are leased to affiliates of Pristine Senior Living ("Pristine") under a long-term, triple-net master lease that is guaranteed by Pristine and two of its principals, and 11 properties are leased to seven other tenants on a triple-net basis. We also own and operate three ILFs. As of December 31, 2015, the 94 facilities leased to Ensign had a total of 10,121 beds and units and are located in Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Nebraska, Nevada, Texas, Utah and Washington; the 14 facilities leased to affiliates of Pristine had a total of 1,258 beds and units and are located in Ohio; and the 11 remaining leased properties had a total of 765 beds and units and are located in Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Minnesota, Virginia and Washington. The three ILFs that we own and operate had a total of 264 units and are located in Texas and Utah. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had one other real estate investment, consisting of an $8.5 million preferred equity investment. 

We acquired the 14 facilities leased to affiliates of Pristine in an acquisition completed on October 1, 2015. We acquired the facilities, which comprise a 14 facility skilled nursing and assisted living portfolio, from affiliates of Liberty Nursing Center ("Liberty"), for approximately $176.5 million (the "Liberty Acquisition"). Since the Spin-Off, we have also acquired an additional 11 properties, comprising seven assisted living facilities and four skilled nursing facilities, for approximately $82.6 million. 

We are an independent publicly traded, self-administered, self-managed real estate investment trust (&#8220;REIT&#8221;) primarily engaged in the ownership, acquisition and leasing of healthcare-related properties. We generate revenues primarily by leasing healthcare-related properties to healthcare operators in triple-net lease arrangements, under which the tenant is solely responsible for the costs related to the property (including property taxes, insurance, and maintenance and repair costs). We conduct and manage our business as one operating segment for internal reporting and internal decision making purposes. We expect to grow our portfolio by pursuing opportunities to acquire additional properties that will be leased to a diverse group of local, regional and national healthcare providers, which may include Ensign, as well as senior housing operators and related businesses. We also anticipate diversifying our portfolio over time, including by acquiring properties in different geographic markets, and in different asset classes. 

We have elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2014. We believe that we have been organized and have operated, and we intend to continue to operate, in a manner to qualify for taxation as a REIT. We operate through an umbrella partnership, commonly referred to as an UPREIT structure, in which substantially all of our properties and assets are held through CTR Partnership, L.P. (the &#8220;Operating Partnership&#8221;). The Operating Partnership is managed by CareTrust&#8217;s wholly owned subsidiary, CareTrust GP, LLC, which is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership. To maintain REIT status, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we annually distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gains. 

Our Industry 

We operate as a REIT that invests in income-producing healthcare-related properties. We expect to grow our portfolio by pursuing opportunities to acquire additional properties that will be leased to a diverse group of local, regional and national healthcare providers, which may include Ensign, as well as senior housing operators and related businesses. We also anticipate 

diversifying our portfolio over time, including by acquiring properties in different geographic markets and in different asset classes. Our portfolio primarily consists of SNFs, ALFs and ILFs. 

&#160; 

The skilled nursing industry has evolved to meet the growing demand for post-acute and custodial healthcare services generated by an aging population, increasing life expectancies and the trend toward shifting of patient care to lower cost settings. The skilled nursing industry has evolved in recent years, which we believe has led to a number of favorable improvements in the industry, as described below: 

&#8226; 

Shift of Patient Care to Lower Cost Alternatives. &#32; The growth of the senior population in the United States continues to increase healthcare costs. In response, federal and state governments have adopted cost-containment measures that encourage the treatment of patients in more cost-effective settings such as SNFs, for which the staffing requirements and associated costs are often significantly lower than acute care hospitals, inpatient rehabilitation facilities and other post-acute care settings. As a result, SNFs are generally serving a larger population of higher-acuity patients than in the past. 

&#8226; 

Significant Acquisition and Consolidation Opportunities. The skilled nursing industry is large and highly fragmented, characterized predominantly by numerous local and regional providers. We believe this fragmentation provides significant acquisition and consolidation opportunities for us. 

&#8226; 

Widening Supply and Demand Imbalance . The number of SNFs has declined modestly over the past several years. According to the American Health Care Association, the nursing home industry was comprised of approximately 15,700 facilities as of December 2013, as compared with over 16,700 facilities as of December 2000. We expect that the supply and demand balance in the skilled nursing industry will continue to improve due to the shift of patient care to lower cost settings, an aging population and increasing life expectancies. 

&#8226; 

Increased Demand Driven by Aging Populations and Increased Life Expectancy . As life expectancy continues to increase in the United States and seniors account for a higher percentage of the total U.S. population, we believe the overall demand for skilled nursing services will increase. At present, the primary market demographic for skilled nursing services is individuals age 75 and older. According to the 2010 U.S. Census, there were over 40 million people in the United States in 2010 that were over 65 years old. The 2010 U.S. Census estimates this group is one of the fastest growing segments of the United States population and is expected to more than double between 2000 and 2030. According to the Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services, nursing home expenditures are projected to grow from approximately $151 billion in 2012 to approximately $264 billion in 2022, representing a compounded annual growth rate of 5.7%. We believe that these trends will support an increasing demand for skilled nursing services, which in turn will likely support an increasing demand for our properties. 

Portfolio Summary 

We have a geographically diverse portfolio of properties, consisting of the following types: 

&#8226; 

Skilled Nursing Facilities. &#32;SNFs are licensed healthcare facilities that provide restorative, rehabilitative and nursing care for people not requiring the more extensive and sophisticated treatment available at acute care hospitals. Treatment programs include physical, occupational, speech, respiratory and other therapies, including sub-acute clinical protocols such as wound care and intravenous drug treatment. Charges for these services are generally paid from a combination of government reimbursement and private sources. As of December 31, 2015, our portfolio included 100 SNFs, 13 of which include assisted or independent living operations. 

&#8226; 

Assisted Living Facilities . ALFs are licensed healthcare facilities that provide personal care services, support and housing for those who need help with activities of daily living, such as bathing, eating and dressing, yet require limited medical care. The programs and services may include transportation, social activities, exercise and fitness programs, beauty or barber shop access, hobby and craft activities, community excursions, meals in a dining room setting and other activities sought by residents. These facilities are often in apartment-like buildings with private residences ranging from single rooms to large apartments. Certain ALFs may offer higher levels of personal assistance for residents requiring memory care as a result of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease or other forms of dementia. Levels of personal assistance are based in part on local regulations. As of December 31, 2015, our portfolio included 18 ALFs, some of which also contain independent living units. 

&#8226; 

Independent Living Facilities . ILFs, also known as retirement communities or senior apartments, are not healthcare facilities. The facilities typically consist of entirely self-contained apartments, complete with their own kitchens, baths and individual living spaces, as well as parking for tenant vehicles. They are most often rented unfurnished, and generally can be personalized by the tenants, typically an individual or a couple over the age of 55. These facilities offer various services and amenities such as laundry, housekeeping, dining options/meal plans, exercise and wellness programs, transportation, social, cultural and recreational activities, on-site security and 

emergency response programs. As of December 31, 2015, our portfolio of four ILFs includes one that is operated by Ensign and three that are operated by us. 

Our portfolio of SNFs, ALFs and ILFs is broadly diversified by geographic location throughout the United States, with concentrations in Texas and California. Our properties are grouped into four categories: (1) SNFs - these are properties that are comprised exclusively of SNFs; (2) Skilled Nursing Campuses - these are properties that include a combination of SNFs and ALFs or ILFs or both; (3) ALFs and ILFs - these are properties that include ALFs or ILFs, or a combination of the two; and (4) ILFs operated by CareTrust - these are ILFs operated by CareTrust, unlike the other properties, which are leased to third-party operators. 

Significant Master Leases 

We have leased 94 of our properties to subsidiaries of Ensign pursuant to the Ensign Master Leases, which consist of eight triple-net leases, each with its own pool of properties, that have varying maturities and diversity in both property type and geography. The Ensign Master Leases provide for initial terms in excess of ten years with staggered expiration dates and no purchase options. At the option of Ensign, each Ensign Master Lease may be extended for up to either two or three five year renewal terms beyond the initial term and, if elected, the renewal will be effective for all of the leased property then subject to the Ensign Master Lease. The rent is a fixed component that was initially set near the time of the Spin-Off. The annual revenues from the Ensign Master Leases are $56.0 million during each of the first two years of the Ensign Master Leases. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2015, the lease coverage ratio of the Ensign Master Leases was approximately 2.07x based on the ANOI from the leased properties. We define ANOI as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and rent. A management fee equal to five percent of gross revenues is included as a reduction to ANOI. Commencing on June 1, 2016 and annually thereafter, the annual rents from the Ensign Master Leases will be escalated by an amount equal to the product of (1) the lesser of the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index (but not less than zero) or 2.5%, and (2) the prior year&#8217;s rent. The Ensign Master Leases are guaranteed by Ensign. 

On February 5, 2016, we entered into an agreement with Ensign allowing them to voluntarily close and decertify from the Medicare program its operations at one of the 94 properties we lease to Ensign operating subsidiaries, a facility located in Texas, pursuant to one of our Ensign Master Leases (&#8220;Master Lease No. 2&#8221;). Under the agreement, Ensign will continue to pay 100% of the indivisible master rent due under Master Lease No. 2 throughout the term of that lease and any renewals, and will continue to maintain and pay all expenses related to the closed property on a triple-net basis as required by the lease for up to five years. We estimate that the planned closure will reduce our approximate lease coverage ratio for Master Lease No. 2 from 2.10x to 2.03x, and for the overall Ensign portfolio from 2.07x to 2.06x. We also believe that the fair value of the assets after closure will exceed our net book value therefor, and accordingly do not anticipate any impairment of value now or in the future. In addition, under the agreement we have the right to unilaterally extricate the property and the Texas licenses and Medicaid bed rights attached thereto from Master Lease No. 2 at our discretion, and to redeploy or dispose of such assets free and clear of the lease without any obligation to Ensign. We intend to use this right to monetize the recovered assets in due course. We believe that Ensign&#8217;s voluntary closure plan for this property was based on unique and isolated concerns about this particular property&#8217;s operations, and we have no reason to anticipate any similar plans or requests in the future with respect to other properties we lease to Ensign. 

We have leased 14 of our properties to subsidiaries of Pristine pursuant to a triple-net master lease entered into effective as of October 1, 2015, which has an initial term of 15 years, two five year renewal options and no purchase options. The annual revenues from the Pristine master lease are $17.0 million and will be escalated annually by an amount equal to the product of (1) the lesser of the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index (but not less than zero) or 3.0%, and (2) the prior year&#8217;s rent. The Pristine master lease is guaranteed by Pristine and two of its principals. 

Because we lease most of our properties to Ensign and Pristine, these two tenants are the primary source of our revenues, and their financial condition and ability and willingness to (i) satisfy their obligations under their master leases and (ii) renew those leases upon expiration of the initial base terms thereof significantly impacts our revenues and our ability to service our indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders. There can be no assurance that these tenants have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable them to satisfy their obligations under the master leases, and any inability or unwillingness on their part to do so would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity, on our ability to service our indebtedness and other obligations and on our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders, as required for us to qualify, and maintain our status, as a REIT. We also cannot assure you that these tenants will elect to renew their lease arrangements with us upon expiration of the initial base terms or any renewal terms thereof or, if such leases are not renewed, that we can reposition the affected properties on the same or better terms. See &#8220;Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business - We are dependent on Ensign, Pristine and other healthcare operators to make payments to us under leases, and an event that materially and adversely affects their business, financial position or results of operations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position or results of operations.&#8221;

Average monthly revenue per occupied unit is equivalent to average effective rent per unit, as we do not offer tenants free rent or other concessions. 

We view our ownership and operation of the three ILFs as complementary to our real estate business. Our goal is to provide enhanced focus on their operations to improve their financial and operating performance. The three ILFs that we own and operate as of December 31, 2015 are: 

&#8226; 

Lakeland Hills Independent Living, located in Dallas, Texas, with 168 units; 

&#8226; 

The Cottages at Golden Acres, located in Dallas, Texas, with 39 units; and 

&#8226; 

The Apartments at St. Joseph Villa, located in Salt Lake City, Utah, with 57 units. 

Investment and Financing Policies 

Our investment objectives are to increase cash flow, provide quarterly cash dividends, maximize the value of our properties and acquire properties with cash flow growth potential. We intend to invest primarily in SNFs and seniors housing, including ALFs and ILFs, as well as medical office buildings, long-term acute care hospitals and inpatient rehabilitation facilities. Our properties are located in 15 states and we intend to continue to acquire properties in other states throughout the United States. Although our portfolio currently consists primarily of owned real property, future investments may include first mortgages, mezzanine debt and other securities issued by, or joint ventures with, REITs or other entities that own real estate consistent with our investment objectives. 

Our Competitive Strengths 

We believe that our ability to acquire, integrate and improve facilities is a direct result of the following key competitive strengths: 

Geographically Diverse Property Portfolio. &#32;Our properties are located in 15 different states, with concentrations in Texas and California. The properties in any one state do not account for more than 26% of our total beds and units as of December 31, 2015. We believe this geographic diversification will limit the effect of changes in any one market on our overall performance. 

Long-Term, Triple-Net Lease Structure. All of our properties (except for the three ILFs that we own and operate) are leased to our tenants under long-term, triple-net leases, pursuant to which the operators are responsible for all facility maintenance and repair, insurance required in connection with the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties, taxes levied on or with respect to the leased properties and all utilities and other services necessary or appropriate for the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties. 

&#160; 

Financially Secure Primary Tenant. Ensign is an established provider of healthcare services with strong financial performance and accounted for 81% of our 2015 revenues, exclusive of tenant reimbursements. Ensign is subject to the reporting requirements of the SEC and is required to file with the SEC annual reports containing audited financial information and quarterly reports containing unaudited financial information. Ensign&#8217;s publicly available filings can be found at the SEC&#8217;s website at www.sec.gov. 

Ability to Identify Talented Operators . As a result of our management team&#8217;s operating experience and network of relationships and insight, we believe that we are able to identify and pursue working relationships with qualified local, regional and national healthcare providers and seniors housing operators. We expect to continue our disciplined focus on pursuing investment opportunities, primarily with respect to stabilized assets but also some strategic investment in improving properties, while seeking dedicated and engaged operators who possess local market knowledge, have solid operating records and emphasize quality services and outcomes. We intend to support these operators by providing strategic capital for facility acquisition, upkeep and modernization. Our management team&#8217;s experience gives us a key competitive advantage in objectively evaluating an operator&#8217;s financial position, care and service programs, operating efficiencies and likely business prospects. 

Experienced Management Team. Gregory K. Stapley, our President and Chief Executive Officer, has extensive experience in the real estate and healthcare industries. Mr. Stapley has more than 29 years of experience in the acquisition, development and disposition of real estate including healthcare facilities and office, retail and industrial properties, including 14 years at Ensign. Our Chief Financial Officer, William M. Wagner, has more than 23 years of accounting and finance experience, primarily in real estate, including 11 years of experience working extensively for REITs. Most notably he worked for both Nationwide Health Properties, Inc., a healthcare REIT, and Sunstone Hotel Investors, Inc., a lodging REIT, serving as Senior Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer of each company. David M. Sedgwick, our Vice President of Operations, is a licensed nursing home administrator with more than 12 years of experience in skilled nursing operations, including turnaround operations, and trained over 100 Ensign nursing home administrators while he was Ensign&#8217;s Chief Human Capital Officer. Our executives have years of public company experience, including experience accessing both debt and equity capital markets to fund growth and maintain a flexible capital structure. 

Flexible UPREIT Structure. We operate through an umbrella partnership, commonly referred to as an UPREIT structure, in which substantially all of our properties and assets are held through the Operating Partnership. Conducting business through the Operating Partnership will allow us flexibility in the manner in which we structure the acquisition of properties. In particular, an UPREIT structure enables us to acquire additional properties from sellers in exchange for limited partnership units, which provides property owners the opportunity to defer the tax consequences that would otherwise arise from a sale of their real properties and other assets to us. As a result, this structure allows us to acquire assets in a more efficient manner and may allow us to acquire assets that the owner would otherwise be unwilling to sell because of tax considerations. &#32; 

Business Strategies 

Our primary goal is to create long-term stockholder value through the payment of consistent cash dividends and the growth of our asset base. To achieve this goal, we intend to pursue a business strategy focused on opportunistic acquisitions and property diversification. We also intend to further develop our relationships with tenants and healthcare providers with a goal to progressively expand the mixture of tenants managing and operating our properties. 

The key components of our business strategies include: 

Diversify Asset Portfolio . &#32;We diversify through the acquisition of new and existing facilities from third parties and the expansion and upgrade of current facilities. We employ what we believe to be a disciplined, opportunistic acquisition strategy with a focus on the acquisition of skilled nursing, assisted living and independent living facilities, as well as medical office buildings, long-term acute care hospitals and inpatient rehabilitation facilities. As we acquire additional properties, we expect to further diversify by geography, asset class and tenant within the healthcare and healthcare-related sectors. 

&#160; 

Maintain Balance Sheet Strength and Liquidity. We maintain a capital structure that provides the resources and flexibility to support the growth of our business. We intend to maintain a mix of credit facility debt, mortgage debt and unsecured debt which, together with our anticipated ability to complete future equity financings, we expect will fund the growth of our property portfolio. 

Develop New Tenant Relationships. &#32;We cultivate new relationships with tenants and healthcare providers in order to expand the mix of tenants operating our properties and, in doing so, to reduce our dependence on Ensign. We expect that this objective will be achieved over time as part of our overall strategy to acquire new properties and further diversify our portfolio of healthcare properties. 

Provide Capital to Underserved Operators. &#32;We believe there is a significant opportunity to be a capital source to healthcare operators, through the acquisition and leasing of healthcare properties to them that are consistent with our investment and financing strategy at appropriate risk-adjusted rates of returns, which, due to size and other considerations, are not a focus for larger healthcare REITs. We pursue acquisitions and strategic opportunities that meet our investing and financing strategy and that are attractively priced, including funding development of properties through preferred equity or construction loans and thereafter entering into sale and leaseback arrangements with such developers as well as other secured term financing and mezzanine lending. We utilize our management team&#8217;s operating experience, network of relationships and industry insight to identify both large and small quality operators in need of capital funding for future growth. In appropriate circumstances, we may negotiate with operators to acquire individual healthcare properties from those operators and then lease those properties back to the operators pursuant to long-term triple-net leases. 

Fund Strategic Capital Improvements. &#32;We support operators by providing capital to them for a variety of purposes, including capital expenditures and facility modernization. We expect to structure these investments as either lease amendments that produce additional rents or as loans that are repaid by operators during the applicable lease term. 

Pursue Strategic Development Opportunities. &#32;We work with operators and developers to identify strategic development opportunities. These opportunities may involve replacing or renovating facilities that may have become less competitive. We also identify new development opportunities that present attractive risk-adjusted returns. We may provide funding to the developer of a property in conjunction with entering into a sale leaseback transaction or an option to enter into a sale leaseback transaction for the property. 

Competition 

We compete for real property investments with other REITs, investment companies, private equity and hedge fund investors, sovereign funds, pension funds, healthcare operators, lenders and other institutional investors. Some of these competitors are significantly larger and have greater financial resources and lower costs of capital than us. Increased competition will make it more challenging to identify and successfully capitalize on acquisition opportunities that meet our investment objectives. Our ability to compete is also impacted by national and local economic trends, availability of investment alternatives, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, existing laws and regulations, new legislation and population trends. 

In addition, revenues from our properties are dependent on the ability of our tenants and operators to compete with other healthcare operators. Healthcare operators compete on a local and regional basis for residents and patients and their ability to successfully attract and retain residents and patients depends on key factors such as the number of facilities in the local market, the types of services available, the quality of care, reputation, age and appearance of each facility and the cost of care in each locality. Private, federal and state payment programs and the effect of other laws and regulations may also have a significant impact on the ability of our tenants and operators to compete successfully for residents and patients at the properties. 

&#160; 

Employees 

We employ approximately 46 employees (including our executive officers), none of whom is subject to a collective bargaining agreement. 

Government Regulation, Licensing and Enforcement 

Overview 

As operators of healthcare facilities, Ensign and other tenants of our healthcare properties are typically subject to extensive and complex federal, state and local healthcare laws and regulations relating to fraud and abuse practices, government reimbursement, licensure and certificate of need and similar laws governing the operation of healthcare facilities, and we expect that the healthcare industry, in general, will continue to face increased regulation and pressure in the areas of fraud, waste and abuse, cost control, healthcare management and provision of services, among others. These regulations are wide-ranging and can subject our tenants to civil, criminal and administrative sanctions. Affected tenants may find it increasingly difficult to comply with this complex and evolving regulatory environment because of a relative lack of guidance in many areas as certain of our healthcare properties are subject to oversight from several government agencies and the laws may vary from one jurisdiction to another. Changes in laws and regulations and reimbursement enforcement activity and regulatory non-compliance by our tenants could have a significant effect on their operations and financial condition, which in turn may adversely affect us, as detailed below and set forth under &#8220;Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business.&#8221; 

The following is a discussion of certain laws and regulations generally applicable to operators of our healthcare facilities and, in certain cases, to us. 

Fraud and Abuse Enforcement 

There are various extremely complex federal and state laws and regulations governing healthcare providers&#8217; relationships and arrangements and prohibiting fraudulent and abusive practices by such providers. These laws include, but are not limited to, (i) federal and state false claims acts, which, among other things, prohibit providers from filing false claims or making false statements to receive payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs, (ii) federal and state anti-kickback and fee-splitting statutes, including the Medicare and Medicaid anti-kickback statute, which prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals or recommendations of healthcare items or services, (iii) federal and state physician self-referral laws (commonly referred to as the &#8220;Stark Law&#8221;), which generally prohibit referrals by physicians to entities with which the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship, (iv) the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which prohibits, among other things, the knowing presentation of a false or fraudulent claim for certain healthcare services and (v) federal and state privacy laws, including the privacy and security rules contained in the Health Insurance Portability and 

Accountability Act of 1996, which provide for the privacy and security of personal health information. Violations of healthcare fraud and abuse laws carry civil, criminal and administrative sanctions, including punitive sanctions, monetary penalties, imprisonment, denial of Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement and potential exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs. These laws are enforced by a variety of federal, state and local agencies and can also be enforced by private litigants through, among other things, federal and state false claims acts, which allow private litigants to bring qui tam or &#8220;whistleblower&#8221; actions. Ensign and our other tenants are (and many of our future tenants are expected to be) subject to these laws, and some of them may in the future become the subject of governmental enforcement actions if they fail to comply with applicable laws. 

&#160; 

Reimbursement 

Sources of revenue for Ensign and our other tenants include (and for our future tenants is expected to include), among other sources, governmental healthcare programs, such as the federal Medicare program and state Medicaid programs, and non-governmental payors, such as insurance carriers and health maintenance organizations. As federal and state governments focus on healthcare reform initiatives, and as the federal government and many states face significant budget deficits, efforts to reduce costs by these payors will likely continue, which may result in reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by Ensign and some of our other tenants. 

Healthcare Licensure and Certificate of Need 

Our healthcare facilities are subject to extensive federal, state and local licensure, certification and inspection laws and regulations. In addition, various licenses and permits are required to dispense narcotics, operate pharmacies, handle radioactive materials and operate equipment. Many states require certain healthcare providers to obtain a certificate of need, which requires prior approval for the construction, expansion and closure of certain healthcare facilities. The approval process related to state certificate of need laws may impact some of our tenants&#8217; abilities to expand or change their businesses. 

Americans with Disabilities Act (the &#8220;ADA&#8221;) 

Although most of our properties are not required to comply with the ADA because of certain &#8220;grandfather&#8221; provisions in the law, some of our properties must comply with the ADA and similar state or local laws to the extent that such properties are &#8220;public accommodations,&#8221; as defined in those statutes. These laws may require removal of barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable. Under our triple-net lease structure, our tenants would generally be responsible for additional costs that may be required to make our facilities ADA-compliant. Noncompliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. 

Environmental Matters 

A wide variety of federal, state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations affect healthcare facility operations. These complex federal and state statutes, and their enforcement, involve a myriad of regulations, many of which involve strict liability on the part of the potential offender. Some of these federal and state statutes may directly impact us. Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, an owner of real property, such as us, may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at, under or disposed of in connection with such property, as well as other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances (including government fines and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property). The cost of any required remediation, removal, fines or personal or property damages and the owner&#8217;s liability therefore could exceed or impair the value of the property and/or the assets of the owner. In addition, the presence of such substances, or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such substances, may adversely affect the owner&#8217;s ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral which, in turn, could reduce our revenues. See &#8220;Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business - Environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with real estate properties owned by us may materially impair the value of those investments.&#8221; 

Compliance Process 

As an operator of healthcare facilities, Ensign has a program to help it comply with various requirements of federal and private healthcare programs. In October 2013, Ensign entered into a corporate integrity agreement (the &#8220;CIA&#8221;) with the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The CIA requires, among other things, that Ensign and its subsidiaries maintain a corporate compliance program to help comply with various requirements of federal and private healthcare programs. Although we are no longer a subsidiary of Ensign, we are subject to certain continuing obligations under Ensign&#8217;s compliance program, including certain training in Medicare and Medicaid laws for our employees, as required by the CIA. 

REIT Qualification 

We elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2014. Our qualification as a REIT will depend upon our ability to meet, on a continuing basis, various complex requirements under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#8220;Code&#8221;), relating to, among other things, the sources of our gross income, the composition and values of our assets, our distribution levels to our stockholders and the concentration of ownership of our capital stock. We believe that we are organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code and that our manner of operation has and will enable us to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT. 

The Operating Partnership 

We own substantially all of our assets and properties and conduct our operations through the Operating Partnership. We believe that conducting business through the Operating Partnership provides flexibility with respect to the manner in which we structure the acquisition of properties. In particular, an UPREIT structure enables us to acquire additional properties from sellers in tax deferred transactions. In these transactions, the seller would typically contribute its assets to the Operating Partnership in exchange for units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership (&#8220;OP Units&#8221;). Holders of OP Units will have the right, after a 12-month holding period, to require the Operating Partnership to redeem any or all of such OP Units for cash based upon the fair market value of an equivalent number of shares of CareTrust&#8217;s common stock at the time of the redemption. Alternatively, we may elect to acquire those OP Units in exchange for shares of our common stock on a one-for-one basis. The number of shares of common stock used to determine the redemption value of OP Units, and the number of shares issuable in exchange for OP Units, is subject to adjustment in the event of stock splits, stock dividends, distributions of warrants or stock rights, specified extraordinary distributions and similar events. The Operating Partnership is managed by our wholly owned subsidiary, CareTrust GP, LLC, which is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership and owns one percent of its outstanding partnership interests. As of December 31, 2015, CareTrust is the only limited partner of the Operating Partnership, owning 99% of its outstanding partnership interests, and we have not issued OP Units to any other party. 

The benefits of our UPREIT structure include the following: 

&#8226; 

Access to capital . We believe the UPREIT structure provides us with access to capital for refinancing and growth. Because an UPREIT structure includes a partnership as well as a corporation, we can access the markets through the Operating Partnership issuing equity or debt as well as the corporation issuing capital stock or debt securities. Sources of capital include possible future issuances of debt or equity through public offerings or private placements. 

&#8226; 

Growth . The UPREIT structure allows stockholders, through their ownership of common stock, and the limited partners, through their ownership of OP Units, an opportunity to participate in future investments we may make in additional properties. 

&#8226; 

Tax deferral . The UPREIT structure provides property owners who transfer their real properties to the Operating Partnership in exchange for OP Units the opportunity to defer the tax consequences that otherwise would arise from a sale of their real properties and other assets to us or to a third party. As a result, this structure allows us to acquire assets in a more efficient manner and may allow us to acquire assets that the owner would otherwise be unwilling to sell because of tax considerations. 

Insurance 

We maintain, or require in our leases, including the Ensign Master Leases, that our tenants maintain all applicable lines of insurance on our properties and their operations. The amount and scope of insurance coverage provided by our policies and the policies maintained by our tenants is customary for similarly situated companies in our industry. However, we cannot assure you that our tenants will maintain the required insurance coverages, and the failure by any of them to do so could have a material adverse effect on us. We also cannot assure you that we will continue to require the same levels of insurance coverage under our leases, including the Ensign Master Leases, that such insurance will be available at a reasonable cost in the future or that the insurance coverage provided will fully cover all losses on our properties upon the occurrence of a catastrophic event, nor can we assure you of the future financial viability of the insurers.
