 Item 1. Business of Community Health Systems, Inc. 

Overview of Our Company 

We are one of the largest publicly-traded hospital companies in the United States and a leading operator of general acute care hospitals in communities across the country. We were originally founded in 1986 and were reincorporated in 1996 as a Delaware corporation. We provide healthcare services through the hospitals that we own and operate and affiliated businesses in non-urban and selected urban markets throughout the United States. As of December 31, 2015, we owned or leased 194 hospitals included in continuing operations, comprised of 190 general acute care hospitals and four stand-alone rehabilitation or psychiatric hospitals. These hospitals are geographically diversified across 28 states, with an aggregate of 29,853 licensed beds. We generate revenues by providing a broad range of general and specialized hospital healthcare services and other outpatient services to patients in the communities in which we are located. Services provided through our hospitals and affiliated businesses include general acute care, emergency room, general and specialty surgery, critical care, internal medicine, obstetrics, diagnostic, psychiatric and rehabilitation services. We also provide additional outpatient services at urgent care centers, occupational medicine clinics, imaging centers, cancer centers, ambulatory surgery centers and home health and hospice agencies. An integral part of providing these services is our relationship and network of affiliated physicians at our hospitals and affiliated businesses. As of December 31, 2015, we employed approximately 3,400 physicians and an additional 1,000 licensed healthcare practitioners. Through our management and operation of these businesses, we provide standardization and centralization of operations across key business areas; strategic assistance to expand and improve services and facilities; implementation of patient safety and quality of care improvement programs and assistance in the recruitment of additional physicians and licensed healthcare practitioners to the markets in which our hospitals are located. In a number of our markets, we have partnered with local physicians or not-for-profit providers, or both, in the ownership of our facilities. In addition to our hospitals and related businesses, we also owned and operated 79 licensed home care agencies and 22 licensed hospice agencies as of December 31, 2015, located primarily in markets where we also operate a hospital. Also, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Quorum Health Resources, LLC, or QHR, we provide management and consulting services to non-affiliated general acute care hospitals located throughout the United States. For the services we provide through hospitals and home care agencies that we own and operate, we are paid by governmental agencies, private insurers and directly by the patients we serve. For our management and consulting services, we are paid by the non-affiliated hospitals utilizing our services. The financial information for our reportable operating segments is presented in Note 15 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or Form 10-K. 

Our strategy includes growth by acquisition. We generally target hospitals in growing, non-urban and selected urban healthcare markets for acquisition because of their favorable demographic and economic trends and competitive conditions. Because non-urban and suburban service areas have smaller populations, there are generally fewer hospitals and other healthcare service providers in these communities and generally a lower level of managed care presence in these markets. We believe that communities with smaller populations generally view the local hospital as an integral part of the community and support less direct competition for hospital-based services. We believe opportunities exist for skilled, disciplined operators in selected urban markets to create networks between urban hospitals and non-urban hospitals while improving physician alignment in both those markets and making it more attractive to managed care. In recent years, our acquisition strategy has also included acquiring selected physician practices and physician-owned ancillary service providers. Such acquisitions are executed in markets where we already have a hospital presence and provide an opportunity to increase the number of affiliated physicians or expand the range of specialized healthcare services provided by our hospitals. 

On January 27, 2014, we completed the acquisition of Health Management Associates, Inc., or HMA, for approximately $7.3 billion, including the assumption of approximately $3.8 billion of indebtedness, which is 

&#160;

referred to in this report as the HMA merger. Additional details regarding the HMA merger are set forth in the Executive Summary section of &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#148; 

Throughout this Form 10-K, we refer to Community Health Systems, Inc., or the Parent Company, and its consolidated subsidiaries in a simplified manner and on a collective basis, using words like &#147;we,&#148; &#147;our,&#148; &#147;us&#148; and the &#147;Company.&#148; This drafting style is suggested by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and is not meant to indicate that the publicly-traded Parent Company or any particular subsidiary of the Parent Company owns or operates any asset, business or property. The hospitals, operations and businesses described in this filing are owned and operated, and management services provided, by distinct and indirect subsidiaries of Community Health Systems, Inc. 

On August 3, 2015, we announced a plan to spin off 38 hospitals and Quorum Health Resources into Quorum Health Corporation, or QHC, an independent, publicly-traded corporation. The transaction, which would be effected through the distribution of QHC common stock to the Company&#146;s shareholders, is intended to be tax free to the Company and its shareholders, and is expected to close in the first half of 2016. The completion of the spin-off is subject to, among other requirements, the effectiveness of QHC&#146;s registration statement on Form 10, requisite regulatory approvals, execution of operational transition agreements, the receipt of opinions of tax, legal and valuation advisors (including as to the tax-free nature of the transaction), market conditions and final Board approval. QHC filed an Amendment No. 3 to Form 10 on December 4, 2015 (the Form 10 has not yet become effective), which filing contains information regarding the contemplated spin-off and the anticipated business of QHC. The Form 10 is available on the SEC&#146;s website but is not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K. There can be no assurance regarding the ultimate timing of the spin-off, or that it will be completed.

Our Business Strategy 

Our objective is to increase shareholder value by providing high-quality patient care using cost effective and efficient operations while pursuing selective growth opportunities. The key elements of our business strategy to achieve this objective are to: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; expand and strengthen regional networks, &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; increase revenue at our facilities, &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; improve profitability, &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; improve patient safety and quality of care, and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; grow through selective acquisitions. &#160;

Expand and Strengthen Regional Networks 

We believe opportunities exist in selected urban markets to create networks between urban hospitals and non-urban hospitals in order to expand the breadth of services offerings in the non-urban hospitals while improving alignment in these markets and making them more attractive to managed care. These networks allow us to build market density and develop better relationships with physicians, patients, employers and third-party payors and enable us to achieve an attractive return on investments in facility expansion and physician recruitment. 

Increase Revenue at Our Facilities 

Overview. We seek to increase revenue at our facilities by providing a broader range of services in a more attractive care setting, as well as by supporting, recruiting and employing physicians. We identify the healthcare needs of the community by analyzing demographic data and patient referral trends. We also work with local hospital boards, management teams and medical staffs to determine the number and type of additional physician specialties needed. In recent years, we have built through acquisitions and consolidation several major networks of affiliated hospitals in key states in which we operate. We believe the use of these hospital networks allows us to provide more integrated services and maximizes the usage of our strong physician base. Our initiatives to increase revenue include: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; recruiting and/or employing additional primary care physicians and specialists, &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; expanding the breadth of services offered at our hospitals and our affiliated businesses, and in the communities in which we operate, through targeted capital expenditures and physician alignment to support the addition of more convenient or complex services, including orthopedics, cardiovascular services, urology and urgent care, &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; providing the capital to invest in technology and the physical plant at our facilities, particularly in our emergency rooms, surgery departments, critical care departments and diagnostic services, and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; executing select managed care contracts through a centrally managed review process. Physician Recruiting. The primary method of adding or expanding medical services is the recruitment of new physicians into the community. A core group of primary care physicians is necessary as an initial contact point for all local healthcare. The addition of specialists who offer services, including general surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, cardiovascular services, orthopedics and urology, completes the full range of medical and surgical services required to meet a community&#146;s core healthcare needs. At the time we acquire a hospital and from time to time thereafter, we identify the healthcare needs of the community in which such hospital is located by analyzing demographic data and patient referral trends. As a result of this analysis, we are able to determine what we believe to be the optimum mix of primary care physicians and specialists. We employ recruiters at the corporate level to support the local hospital managers in their recruitment efforts. Additionally, in response to the recent trend in physicians seeking employment, we have begun employing more physicians, including, in many instances, acquiring physician practices. We have increased the number of physicians affiliated with us through our recruiting and employment efforts. The percentage of recruited or other physicians commencing practice with us that were specialists was over 55% in 2015. However, most of the physicians in our communities remain in private practice and are not our employees. We believe we have been successful in recruiting physicians because of the practice opportunities afforded physicians in our markets, as well as lower managed care penetration as compared to larger urban areas. 

Expansion of Services and Capital Investment. In an effort to better meet the healthcare needs of the communities we serve and to capture a greater portion of the healthcare spending in our markets, we have added a broad range of services to our facilities and, in certain markets, acquired physician practices to broaden our service offerings. These services range from various types of diagnostic equipment capabilities to additional and renovated emergency rooms, surgical and critical care suites and specialty services. We have concentrated our focus on expanding our service lines to those service offerings that we believe have the greatest growth potential, 

&#160;

including orthopedics, neuroscience, cardiovascular care, women&#146;s health and cancer care. The expansion of these service lines has also been enabled through providing additional access points separate from the traditional hospital service location, through the maximization of physician practice utilization, partnerships with third-party urgent care and retail service locations, expansion of outside diagnostic and surgery center locations, and advancing tele-health strategies. 

We spent approximately $451 million on 70 major construction projects that were completed in 2015. The 2015 projects included new emergency rooms, cardiac catheterization laboratories, hospital additions and surgical suites. These projects improved various diagnostic and other inpatient and outpatient service capabilities. We believe that appropriate capital investments in our facilities, combined with the development of our service capabilities, will reduce the migration of patients to competing providers while providing an attractive return on investment. We also employ a small group of clinical consultants at our corporate headquarters to assist the hospitals in their development of surgery, emergency, critical care, cardiovascular and hospitalist services. In addition to spending capital on expanding services at our existing hospitals, we also build replacement facilities in certain markets to better meet the healthcare needs in those communities. In 2015 and 2014, we spent $123 million and $120 million, respectively, on construction projects related to the Birmingham and York replacement hospitals discussed below. In September 2010, we received approval of our request for a certificate of need, or CON, from the Alabama Certificate of Need Review Board for a replacement hospital in Birmingham, Alabama. This CON was challenged in the Alabama state circuit and appellate courts, but the CON was upheld by the Supreme Court of Alabama in May 2013, eliminating any further appeals. Completion of the replacement hospital, Grandview Medical Center, and transfer of all operations was completed on October 10, 2015. As part of an acquisition in 2012, we agreed to build a replacement hospital in York, Pennsylvania by July 2017. The total cost of the replacement hospital in York, Pennsylvania is estimated to be $125 million. 

Managed Care Strategy. Managed care has seen growth across the U.S. as health plans expand service areas and membership in an attempt to control rising medical costs. As we service primarily non-urban markets, we do not have significant relationships with individual managed care organizations, including Medicare Advantage. We have responded with a proactive and carefully considered strategy developed specifically for each of our facilities. Our experienced corporate managed care department reviews and approves all managed care contracts, which are organized and monitored using a central database. The primary mission of this department is to select and evaluate appropriate managed care opportunities, manage existing reimbursement arrangements and negotiate increases. Generally, we do not intend to enter into capitated or risk sharing contracts. However, some purchased hospitals have risk sharing contracts at the time we acquire them. We seek to discontinue these contracts to eliminate risk retention related to payment for patient care. We do not believe that we have, at the present time, any risk sharing contracts that would have a material impact on our results of operations. 

Improve Profitability 

Overview. To improve efficiencies and increase operating margins, we implement cost containment programs and adhere to operating philosophies that include: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; standardizing and centralizing our methods of operation and management, including: &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; monitoring and enhancing productivity of our human resources, &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; capitalizing on purchasing efficiencies through the use of company-wide standardized purchasing contracts and terminating or renegotiating specified vendor contracts, &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; installing standardized management information systems, resulting in more streamlined clinical operations and more efficient billing and collection procedures, and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; improving patient safety and optimizing resource allocation through our case and resource management program, which assists in improving clinical care and containing costs. &#160;

In addition, each of our hospital management teams is supported by our centralized operational, reimbursement, regulatory and compliance expertise, as well as by our senior management team, a seasoned group of executives with an average of over 25 years of experience in the healthcare industry. 

Standardization and Centralization. Our standardization and centralization initiatives encompass nearly every aspect of our business, from developing standard policies and procedures with respect to patient accounting and physician practice management to implementing standard processes to initiate, evaluate and complete construction projects. Our standardization and centralization initiatives are a key element in improving our operating results. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Billing and Collections. We have adopted standard policies and procedures with respect to billing and collections. We have also automated and standardized various components of the collection cycle, including statement and collection letters and the movement of accounts through the collection cycle. Upon completion of an acquisition, our management information systems team converts the hospital&#146;s existing information system to our standardized system. This enables us to quickly implement our business controls and cost containment initiatives. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Physician Support. We support our newly recruited physicians to enhance their transition into our communities. All newly recruited physicians who enter into contracts with us are required to attend a three-day introductory seminar that covers issues involved in starting up a practice. We have also implemented physician practice management seminars, webinars and other training. We host these seminars monthly. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Procurement and Materials Management. We have standardized and centralized our operations with respect to medical supplies, equipment and pharmaceuticals used in our hospitals. We have a participation agreement with HealthTrust Purchasing Group, L.P., or HealthTrust, a group purchasing organization, or GPO. HealthTrust contracts with certain vendors who supply a substantial portion of our medical supplies, equipment and pharmaceuticals. The current term of our agreement with HealthTrust expires in January 2017, with automatic renewal terms of one year unless either party terminates by giving notice of non-renewal. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Facilities Management. We have standardized interiors, lighting and furniture programs. We have also implemented a standard process to initiate, evaluate and complete construction projects. Our corporate staff monitors all construction projects, and reviews and pays all construction project invoices. Our initiatives in this area have reduced our construction costs and shortened our project completion times while maintaining the same high level of quality. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Other Initiatives. We have also improved efficiency and productivity by implementing standard programs with respect to ancillary services in various areas, including emergency rooms, pharmacy, laboratory, imaging, home care, skilled nursing, centralized outpatient scheduling and health information management. We work to identify and communicate best practices and monitor these improvements throughout the Company. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting. We have centralized many of our significant internal controls over financial reporting and standardized those other controls that are performed at our hospital locations. We continuously monitor compliance with and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. Case and Resource Management. The primary goal of our case management program is to ensure the delivery of safe, high quality care in an efficient and cost effective manner. The program focuses on: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; appropriate management of length of stay consistent with national standards and benchmarks, &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; reducing unnecessary utilization, &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; developing and implementing operational best practices, &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; discharge planning, and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; compliance with all regulatory standards. Our case management program integrates the functions of utilization review, discharge planning, assessment of medical necessity and resource management. Patients are assessed upon presentation to the hospital and throughout their course of care with ongoing reviews. Industry standard criteria are utilized in patient assessments, and discharge plans are adjusted according to patient needs. Cases are monitored to prevent delays in service or unnecessary utilization of resources. When a patient is ready for discharge, a case manager works with the patient&#146;s attending physician to evaluate and coordinate the patient&#146;s needs for continued care in the post-acute setting. Each hospital has the support of a physician advisor to act as a liaison to the medical staff and assist with all the activities of the program. 

Improve Patient Safety and Quality of Care 

Each of our hospitals is operated by a corporate board of directors that has established a local board of trustees, which includes members of the hospital&#146;s medical staff. The board of directors delegates certain matters to the board of trustees, including establishing policies concerning the hospital&#146;s medical, professional, and ethical practices, monitoring these practices, and responsibility for ensuring that these practices conform to legally required standards. We maintain quality assurance programs to support and monitor quality of care standards and to meet Medicare and Medicaid accreditation and regulatory requirements. Patient care evaluations and other quality of care assessment activities are reviewed and monitored continuously with comparison to regional and national benchmarks when available. 

We believe value-based purchasing models, such as linking payment for healthcare services to performance on objective measures, will increasingly become key drivers of financial performance. We have implemented various programs to support our hospitals in an effort to ensure continuous improvement in patient safety and the quality of care provided. We have developed high reliability/safety and quality training programs for all senior hospital management, chief nursing officers, quality directors, physicians and other clinical staff. We share information among our hospital management to implement best practices and assist in complying with regulatory requirements. We have standardized many of our processes for documenting compliance with accreditation requirements and clinical practices proven to lead to improved patient outcomes. All hospitals conduct patient, physician and staff satisfaction surveys to help identify methods of improving patient safety and the quality of care. 

To ensure the experience of our emergency room patients meets our service and quality expectations, we have implemented a program to contact selected patients as a follow-up to the services they received. We verify that patients were able to obtain any prescriptions and outpatient appointments recommended at discharge. We also ensure that their symptoms have abated and that they understood the discharge instructions given at the hospital. Through this program, we placed almost two million follow-up calls in 2015. 

In 2011, we established a component patient safety organization, or PSO, which was listed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality on January 11, 2012. We believe our PSO has assisted, and will continue to assist, us in improving patient safety at our hospitals. The PSO was recertified in 2014 through 2018. 

Grow Through Selective Acquisitions 

Acquisition Criteria. Acquisitions have been a core part of our growth strategy historically. We intend to maintain a disciplined and targeted approach to acquisitions and seek opportunities that are complementary to our existing markets or represent new markets that fit our operating criteria. Generally, we pursue acquisition candidates that: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; are located in a market that has a stable or growing population base, &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; are the sole or primary provider of acute care services in the community, &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; are located in an area with the potential for service expansion, &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; are not located in an area that is dependent upon a single employer or industry, and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; have financial performance that we believe will benefit from our management&#146;s operating skills. Occasionally, we have pursued acquisition opportunities outside of our specified criteria when such opportunities have had uniquely favorable characteristics. In addition, in recent years, we have been successful in acquiring multi-hospital systems in larger metropolitan areas. We believe the acquisition of certain hospitals located in select urban or other geographic regions can provide additional opportunities for increased services and leveraging of our existing presence in some regions as well as reduced costs through shared resources. 

While no hospital acquisitions closed during 2013, in July 2013 we announced that we, one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and HMA had entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (which we subsequently amended on September 24, 2013). On January 27, 2014, we completed the merger with HMA, which at the time of acquisition owned or leased 71 hospitals. In addition to the HMA hospitals, during 2014 we acquired four other hospitals located in Ocala, Florida; Sharon, Pennsylvania; Natchez, Mississippi; and Gaffney, South Carolina. No hospital acquisitions closed during 2015. 

We also apply these factors in the reverse to the hospitals currently in our portfolio to determine if there are facilities that no longer meet our operating criteria. Separate and apart from the planned spin-off of the 38 facilities to Quorum Health Corporation, in 2015, we divested eight facilities, including two that were mandated by the Federal Trade Commission in connection with the HMA transaction. As the delivery model continues to evolve and we expand our existing networks of hospitals and facilities, we will also seek to divest facilities that no longer fit our model but may be more valuable when realigned with other providers&#146; networks. 

Disciplined Acquisition Approach. We believe that we have been disciplined in our approach to acquisitions. We have a dedicated team of internal and external professionals who complete a thorough review of the hospital&#146;s financial and operating performance, the demographics and service needs of the market and the physical condition of the facilities. Based on our historical experience, we then build a pro forma financial model that reflects what we believe can be accomplished under our ownership. Whether we buy or lease the existing facility or agree to construct a replacement hospital, we believe we have been disciplined in our approach to pricing. We typically begin the acquisition process by entering into a non-binding letter of intent with an acquisition candidate. After we complete business and financial due diligence and financial modeling, we decide whether or not to enter into a definitive agreement. Once an acquisition is completed, we have an organized and systematic approach to transitioning and integrating the new hospital into our system of hospitals. 

Acquisition Efforts. A key part of our strategy involves establishing a broader presence in our states and markets of operation and expanding and strengthening our regional networks where appropriate. Apart from our acquisition of Triad hospitals in 2007 and HMA in 2014, most of our acquisition targets have been municipal or other not-for-profit hospitals. We believe that our access to capital, ability to recruit physicians and reputation for providing quality care make us an attractive partner for these communities. In addition, we have found that communities located in states where we already operate a hospital are more receptive to our acquiring their hospitals, because they are aware of our operating track record with respect to our other hospitals within the state. 

At the time we acquire a hospital, we may commit to an amount of capital expenditures, such as a replacement facility, renovations, or equipment over a specified period of time. Pursuant to a hospital purchase agreement in effect as of December 31, 2015, we are required to build a replacement facility in York, Pennsylvania by July 2017. Estimated construction costs, including equipment costs, are approximately $125 million for this replacement facility, of which approximately $5 million has been incurred to date. In addition, in October 2008, after the purchase of the noncontrolling owner&#146;s interest in our Birmingham, Alabama facility, we initiated the purchase of a site, which included a partially constructed hospital structure, for a potential replacement for our 

&#160;

existing Birmingham facility. In September 2010, we received approval of our request for a certificate of need from the Alabama Certificate of Need Review Board. This CON was challenged in the Alabama state circuit and appellate courts, but the CON was upheld by the Supreme Court of Alabama in May 2013, eliminating any further appeals. Construction of the replacement hospital, Grandview Medical Center, and transfer of all operations was completed on October 10, 2015. Our construction costs, including the acquisition of the site and equipment costs, for the Birmingham replacement facility at Grandview Medical Center have totaled approximately $303 million to date. Under other purchase agreements in effect as of December 31, 2015, we have committed to spend $516 million, generally over a five to seven year period after acquisition, for costs such as capital improvements, equipment, selected leases and physician recruiting. Through December 31, 2015, we have incurred approximately $254 million related to these commitments. 

Industry Overview 

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, reported that in 2014 total U.S. healthcare expenditures grew by 5.3% to approximately $3.0 trillion. CMS also projected total U.S. healthcare spending to grow by 5.3% in 2015 and by an average of 5.8% annually from 2014 through 2024, largely as a result of the continued implementation of the Affordable Care Act coverage expansions, faster projected economic growth and the aging of the population. By these estimates, healthcare expenditures will account for approximately $5.4 trillion, or 19.6% of the total U.S. gross domestic product, by 2024. 

Hospital services, the market within the healthcare industry in which we operate, is the largest single category of healthcare expenditures at 32.1% of total healthcare spending in 2014, or approximately $972 billion, as reported by CMS. CMS projected the hospital services category to increase 5.4% in 2015 due to the continued effects of the Affordable Care Act insurance expansion combined with the effect of faster economic growth. For 2016 through 2024, CMS projected that continued population aging and the impact of improved economic conditions will result in projected average annual growth of 6.1%. 

U.S. Hospital Industry. The U.S. hospital industry is broadly defined to include acute care, rehabilitation and psychiatric facilities that are either public (government owned and operated), not-for-profit private (religious or secular), or for-profit institutions (investor owned). According to the American Hospital Association, there are approximately 5,000 inpatient hospitals in the U.S. which are not-for-profit owned, investor owned, or state or local government owned. Of these hospitals, approximately 40% are located in non-urban communities. We believe that a majority of these hospitals are owned by not-for-profit or governmental entities. These facilities offer a broad range of healthcare services, including internal medicine, general surgery, cardiology, oncology, orthopedics, OB/GYN and emergency services. In addition, hospitals also offer other ancillary services, including psychiatric, diagnostic, rehabilitation, home care and outpatient surgery services. 

Urban vs. Non-Urban Hospitals . According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 19.3% of the U.S. population lives in communities designated as non-urban. In these non-urban communities, hospitals are typically the primary source of healthcare. In many cases a single hospital is the only provider of general healthcare services in these communities. 

Factors Affecting Performance. Among the many factors that can influence a hospital&#146;s financial and operating performance are: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; facility size and location, &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; facility ownership structure (i.e., tax-exempt or investor owned), &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; a facility&#146;s ability to participate in group purchasing organizations, and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; facility payor mix. &#160;

Patients needing the most complex care are more often served by the larger and/or more specialized urban hospitals. We believe opportunities exist in selected urban markets to create networks between urban hospitals and non-urban hospitals in order to expand the breadth of services offered in the non-urban hospitals while improving physician alignment in those markets and making them more attractive to managed care. 

Hospital Industry Trends 

Demographic Trends. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2014, there were approximately 46.2 million Americans aged 65 or older in the U.S. comprising approximately 14.5% of the total U.S. population. By the year 2030, the number of Americans aged 65 or older is expected to climb to 72.1 million, or 19.3% of the total population. Due to the increasing life expectancy of Americans, the number of people aged 85 years and older is also expected to increase from 6.2 million in 2014 to 8.7 million by the year 2030. This increase in life expectancy will increase demand for healthcare services and, as importantly, the demand for innovative, more sophisticated means of delivering those services. Hospitals, as the largest category of care in the healthcare market, will be among the main beneficiaries of this increase in demand. Based on data compiled for us, the populations of the service areas where our hospitals are located grew 3.2% from 2010 to 2015 and are expected to grow by 3.6% from 2015 to 2020. The number of people aged 65 or older in these service areas grew by 15.8% from 2010 to 2015 and is expected to grow by 16.6% from 2015 to 2020. People aged 65 or older comprised 16.8% of the total population in our service areas in 2015, yet they could comprise 18.9% of the total population in our service areas by 2020. 

Consolidation. In addition to our own acquisitions in recent years, consolidation activity in the hospital industry, primarily through mergers and acquisitions involving both for-profit and not-for-profit hospital systems, is continuing. Reasons for this activity include: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; ample supply of available capital, &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; valuation levels, &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; financial performance issues, including challenges associated with changes in reimbursement and collectability of self-pay revenue, &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the desire to enhance the local availability of healthcare in the community, &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the need and ability to recruit primary care physicians and specialists, &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the need to achieve general economies of scale and to gain access to standardized and centralized functions, including favorable supply agreements and access to malpractice coverage, &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; changes to healthcare payment models that emphasize cost-effective delivery of service and quality of outcomes for the entire episode of care, and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; regulatory changes. The healthcare industry is also undergoing consolidation in reaction to efforts to reform the payment system. Hospital systems are acquiring physician practices and other outpatient and sub-acute providers to position themselves for readmission, bundling and other payment restructuring. Similarly, payors are consolidating and acquiring disease management service providers in an effort to offer more competitive programs. 

Trends in Payment for Healthcare Services . As discussed in more detail in the Government Regulation section of this Form 10-K, the impact of healthcare reform legislation, combined with the growing financial and economic pressures on the healthcare industry, has resulted in challenges to current and future reimbursement trends. Because of higher healthcare costs and expanded coverage for uninsured patients, the healthcare industry must face the risk that higher deductibles and co-payment requirements for insured patients will increase, resulting in the potential for greater write-offs of uncollectible amounts from those patients. 

&#160;

Shift to Outpatient Services . Because of the growing availability of stand-alone outpatient healthcare facilities and the increase in the services that are able to be provided at these locations, many individuals are seeking a broader range of services at outpatient facilities. This trend has contributed to an increase in outpatient services while inhibiting the growth of inpatient admissions.

(1) Licensed beds are the number of beds for which the appropriate state agency licenses a facility regardless of whether the beds are actually available for patient use. &#160;

(2) Beds in service are the number of beds that are readily available for patient use. &#160;

(3) Admissions represent the number of patients admitted for inpatient treatment. &#160;

(4) Adjusted admissions is a general measure of combined inpatient and outpatient volume. We computed adjusted admissions by multiplying admissions by gross patient revenues and then dividing that number by gross inpatient revenues. &#160;

(5) Patient days represent the total number of days of care provided to inpatients. &#160;

(6) Average length of stay (days) represents the average number of days inpatients stay in our hospitals. &#160;

(7) We calculated occupancy rate percentages by dividing the average daily number of inpatients by the weighted-average number of beds in service. &#160;

(8) EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, consists of net income attributable to Community Health Systems, Inc. before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA, also a non-GAAP financial measure, is EBITDA adjusted to exclude discontinued operations, loss from early extinguishment of debt, impairment of long-lived assets, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, acquisition and integration expenses from the acquisition of HMA, expenses incurred related to the planned spin-off of Quorum Health Corporation, expenses related to government legal settlements and related costs, and (income) expense from fair value adjustments related to the HMA legal proceedings accounted for at fair value, underlying the CVR agreement, and related legal expenses. We have from time to time sold noncontrolling interests in certain of our subsidiaries or acquired subsidiaries with existing noncontrolling interest ownership positions. We believe that it is useful to present adjusted EBITDA because it excludes the portion of EBITDA attributable to these third-party interests and clarifies for investors our portion of EBITDA generated by continuing operations. We use adjusted EBITDA as a measure of liquidity. We have also presented adjusted EBITDA because we believe it provides investors with additional information about our ability to incur and service debt and make capital expenditures. Adjusted EBITDA also aligns with a similar metric as defined in our senior secured credit facility, which is a key component in the determination of our compliance with some of the covenants under our senior secured credit facility, and is used to determine the interest rate and commitment fee payable under the senior secured credit facility (although adjusted EBITDA does not include all of the adjustments described in the senior secured credit facility). &#160;

&#160; Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance or liquidity under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. It should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, operating income, cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities, or any other measure 

&#160;

&#160; calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The items excluded from adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and evaluating financial performance and liquidity. Our calculation of adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The following table reflects the calculation of adjusted EBITDA, as defined, from income from continuing operations before income taxes and reconciles adjusted EBITDA, as defined, to our net cash provided by operating activities as derived directly from our Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 (in millions):

(9) Includes former HMA hospitals for the periods from January 1 through December 31, 2015 and 2014, as if such hospitals were owned during each of these comparable periods. For all hospitals owned throughout both periods, the same-store operating results and statistical data reflects the indicated periods. The same-store information does not reflect the application of purchase accounting adjustments as if the HMA merger had been completed on January 1, 2014. Therefore, this information is not intended to present pro forma information prepared under the guidelines of Articles 3-05 and 11 of the SEC. However, management 

&#160;

&#160; believes the information provides investors with useful information about the hospital admissions, adjusted admissions and net operating revenues had the HMA facilities been owned for the indicated periods. This same-store information for the hospitals acquired in the HMA merger for the period from January 1 through December 31, 2014 is non-GAAP financial information and may not be comparable to the information provided for the comparable 2015 period due to the aforementioned purchase accounting adjustments not having been applied. In addition, same-store comparisons exclude our hospitals that have previously been classified as discontinued operations for accounting purposes. Sources of Revenue 

We receive payment for healthcare services provided by our hospitals from: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the federal Medicare program, &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; state Medicaid or similar programs, &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; healthcare insurance carriers, health maintenance organizations or &#147;HMOs,&#148; preferred provider organizations or &#147;PPOs,&#148; and other managed care programs, and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; patients directly. The following table presents the approximate percentages of operating revenues, net of contractual allowances and discounts (but before provision for bad debts), by payor source for the periods indicated. The data for the years presented are not strictly comparable due to the effect that hospital acquisitions have had on these statistics.

&#160;

&#160; As shown above, we receive a substantial portion of our revenues from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Included in Managed Care and other third-party payors is operating revenues from insurance companies with which we have insurance provider contracts, Medicare managed care, insurance companies for which we do not have insurance provider contracts, workers&#146; compensation carriers and non-patient service revenue, such as rental income and cafeteria sales. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively, the Reform Legislation, has increased and is expected to continue to increase the number of insured patients particularly in states that have expanded Medicaid, which, in turn, has reduced and is expected to continue to reduce the percentage of our revenues from self-pay patients. However, other aspects of the Reform Legislation, including payment reductions and uncertainty regarding implementation and potential changes to the law, create uncertainty regarding the law&#146;s ultimate impact. 

Medicare is a federal program that provides medical insurance benefits to persons age 65 and over, some disabled persons, and persons with end-stage renal disease. Medicaid is a federal-state funded program, administered by the states, which provides medical benefits to individuals who are unable to afford healthcare. All of our hospitals are certified as providers of Medicare and Medicaid services. In the future, we generally expect revenues received from the Medicare and Medicaid programs to increase due to the general aging of the population. However, amounts received under the Medicare and Medicaid programs are generally significantly 

&#160;

less than a hospital&#146;s customary charges for the services provided. Further, the Reform Legislation imposes significant reductions in amounts the government pays healthcare providers and Medicare managed care plans. The trend toward increased enrollment in Medicare managed care may adversely affect our operating revenue growth. Since a substantial portion of our revenue comes from patients under Medicare and Medicaid programs, our ability to operate our business successfully in the future will depend in large measure on our ability to adapt to changes in these programs. 

In addition to government programs, we are paid by private payors, which include insurance companies, HMOs, PPOs, other managed care companies and employers, and by patients directly. Blue Cross payors are included in the &#147;Managed Care and other third-party payors&#148; line in the above table. Patients are generally not responsible for any difference between customary hospital charges and amounts paid for hospital services by Medicare and Medicaid programs, insurance companies, HMOs, PPOs and other managed care companies, but are responsible for services not covered by these programs or plans, as well as for deductibles and co-insurance obligations of their coverage. The amount of these deductibles and co-insurance obligations has increased in recent years. Collection of amounts due from individuals is typically more difficult than collection of amounts due from government or business payors. To further reduce their healthcare costs, an increasing number of insurance companies, HMOs, PPOs and other managed care companies negotiate discounted fee structures or fixed amounts for hospital services performed, rather than paying healthcare providers the amounts billed, and utilize structures such as narrow networks that restrict the providers that enrollees may utilize. We negotiate discounts with managed care companies, which are typically smaller than discounts under government programs. If an increased number of insurance companies, HMOs, PPOs and other managed care companies succeed in negotiating discounted fee structures or fixed amounts or if we are unable to participate in managed care networks serving our markets, our results of operations may be negatively affected. There can be no assurance that we will retain our existing reimbursement arrangements or that these third-party payors will not attempt to further reduce the rates they pay for our services. For more information on the payment programs on which our revenues depend, see &#147;Payment&#148; on page 22. 

As of December 31, 2015, Florida, Texas, Pennsylvania and Indiana represented our only areas of significant geographic concentration. Operating revenues, net of contractual allowances and discounts (but before the provision for bad debts), generated by the Company&#146;s hospitals in Florida (which became an area of geographic concentration in 2014 as a result of the HMA merger), as a percentage of consolidated operating revenues, were 13.6% in 2015 and 13.0% in 2014. Operating revenues, net of contractual allowances and discounts (but before the provision for bad debts), generated by the Company&#146;s hospitals in Texas, as a percentage of consolidated operating revenues, were 11.1% in 2015, 10.9% in 2014 and 15.0% in 2013. Operating revenues, net of contractual allowances and discounts (but before the provision for bad debts), generated by the Company&#146;s hospitals in Pennsylvania, as a percentage of consolidated operating revenues, were 10.6% in 2015, 11.1% in 2014 and 13.1% in 2013. Operating revenues, net of contractual allowances and discounts (but before the provision for bad debts), generated by the Company&#146;s hospitals in Indiana, as a percentage of consolidated operating revenues, were 7.3% in 2015, 7.6% in 2014 and 10.6% in 2013. 

Hospital revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels, the volume of outpatient procedures and the charges or negotiated payment rates for hospital services provided. Charges and payment rates for routine inpatient services vary significantly depending on the type of service performed and the geographic location of the hospital. In recent years, we have experienced a significant increase in revenue received from outpatient services. We attribute this increase to: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; advances in technology, which have permitted us to provide more services on an outpatient basis and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; pressure from Medicare or Medicaid programs, insurance companies and managed care plans to reduce hospital stays and to reduce costs by having services provided on an outpatient rather than on an inpatient basis. &#160;

Government Regulation 

Overview. The healthcare industry is required to comply with extensive government regulation at the federal, state and local levels. Under these regulations, hospitals must meet requirements to be certified as hospitals and qualified to participate in government programs, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs. These requirements include those relating to the adequacy of medical care, equipment, personnel, operating policies and procedures; billing and coding for services; properly handling overpayments; classifications of levels of care provided; preparing and filing of cost reports; relationships with referral sources and referral recipients; maintenance of adequate records; hospital use; rate-setting; compliance with building codes; environmental protection; and privacy and security. There are also extensive laws and regulations governing a hospital&#146;s participation in these government programs. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we may be subject to criminal penalties and civil sanctions, our hospitals could lose their licenses and we could lose our ability to participate in these government programs. Further, government regulations may change. If that happens, we may have to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel and services so that our hospitals remain certified as hospitals and qualified to participate in these programs. We believe that our hospitals are currently in substantial compliance with current federal, state and local regulations and standards. We cannot make assertions that governmental officials responsible for enforcing these laws or whistleblowers will not assert that we are in violation of them or that such statutes or regulations will be interpreted by the courts in a manner consistent with our interpretation. 

Hospitals are subject to periodic inspection by federal, state and local authorities to determine their compliance with applicable regulations and requirements necessary for licensing and certification. All of our hospitals are licensed under appropriate state laws and are qualified to participate in Medicare and Medicaid programs. In addition, most of our hospitals are accredited by The Joint Commission. This accreditation indicates that a hospital satisfies the applicable health and administrative standards to participate in Medicare and Medicaid programs. 

Healthcare Reform. The U.S. Congress and certain state legislatures have introduced and passed a large number of proposals and legislation designed to make major changes in the healthcare system, including changes that increased access to health insurance. The Reform Legislation mandates that substantially all U.S. citizens maintain medical insurance coverage and expands health insurance coverage through a combination of public program expansion and private sector health insurance reforms. Based on projections issued by the Congressional Budget Office, or CBO, in March 2015, the incremental insurance coverage due to the Reform Legislation could result in 25 million formerly uninsured Americans gaining coverage by the end of 2025. 

As the number of persons with access to health insurance in the United States increases, there may be a resulting increase in the number of patients using our facilities who have health insurance coverage. We operate hospitals in eight of the 10 states that experienced the largest reductions in uninsured rates among adult residents between 2013 and 2015. Most of these states with the greatest reductions in the number of uninsured adult residents have established a health insurance exchange operated either by the state or in partnership with the federal government and also expanded Medicaid. However, states may opt out of the Medicaid coverage expansion provisions of the Reform Legislation without losing existing federal Medicaid funding. A number of states have opted out of the Medicaid coverage expansion provisions, but could ultimately decide to expand their programs at a later date. Of the 28 states in which we operate hospitals that are included in continuing operations, 15 states have taken action to expand their Medicaid programs, including Louisiana, which is expected to implement Medicaid coverage expansion at some point in 2016. At this time, the other 13 states have not, including Florida, Tennessee and Texas, where we operated a significant number of hospitals as of December 31, 2015. Some states that have opted out are evaluating options such as waiver plans to operate an alternative Medicaid expansion plan. Failure to expand Medicaid or implement an effective alternative in these states will likely have a negative impact on the goal of reducing the number of uninsured individuals. 

&#160;

Our hospitals are well positioned to participate in the provider networks of various qualified health plans, or QHPs, offering plan options on the health insurance exchanges created pursuant to the Reform Legislation. For the 2016 plan year, all of our hospitals in continuing operations have arrangements to participate in at least one health insurance exchange agreement, approximately 90% of our hospitals participate in two or more contracts, approximately 87% of our hospitals participate in the first or second lowest cost bronze plan networks (QHPs with a 60% actuarial value) and approximately 90% of our hospitals participate in the first or second lowest cost silver plan networks (QHPs with a 70% actuarial value). 

We have conducted significant healthcare reform outreach efforts across all of our markets. Such efforts included the expanded use of eligibility screening services, select facility designations as Certified Application Counselor Organizations, and approximately 700 volunteers and staff members trained and designated as Certified Application Counselors, or CACs. These CACs assisted people in understanding and, if appropriate, enrolling in new coverage options, including, but not limited to QHPs on the health insurance exchange or Marketplace, Medicaid and the Children&#146;s Health Insurance Program, or CHIP. 

The Reform Legislation makes a number of changes to Medicare and Medicaid, such as reductions to the Medicare annual market basket update for federal fiscal years 2010 through 2019, a productivity offset to the Medicare market basket update, and a reduction to the Medicare and Medicaid disproportionate share payments, each of which could adversely impact the reimbursement received under these programs. 

The Reform Legislation also includes provisions aimed at reducing fraud, waste and abuse in the healthcare industry. These provisions allocate significant additional resources to federal enforcement agencies and expand the use of private contractors to recover potentially inappropriate Medicare and Medicaid payments. The Reform Legislation amends several existing federal laws, including the federal anti-kickback statute and the False Claims Act making it easier for government agencies and private plaintiffs to prevail in lawsuits brought against healthcare providers. These amendments also make it easier for potentially severe fines and penalties to be imposed on healthcare providers that violate applicable laws and regulations. 

We believe the expansion of private sector health insurance and Medicaid coverage will, over time, increase our reimbursement related to providing services to individuals who were previously uninsured, which should reduce our expense from uncollectible accounts receivable. The various provisions in the Reform Legislation that directly or indirectly affect reimbursement take effect over a number of years. In addition, we believe that the Reform Legislation had a positive impact on net operating revenues and income from continuing operations during 2014 and 2015 as the result of the expansion of private sector and Medicaid coverage that has already occurred from the Reform Legislation and we believe that the net impact of the Reform Legislation on our net operating revenues will continue to be positive. Other provisions of the Reform Legislation, such as requirements related to employee health insurance coverage, have increased and will continue to increase our operating costs. 

However, because of the many variables involved, including clarifications and modifications resulting from the rule-making process, legislative efforts to repeal or modify the law, future judicial interpretations resulting from court challenges to its constitutionality and interpretation, the development of agency guidance, whether and how many states ultimately decide to expand Medicaid coverage, the number of uninsured who elect to purchase health insurance coverage, budgetary issues at federal and state levels, and the potential for delays in the implementation of the Reform Legislation, it is difficult to predict the ultimate effect of the Reform Legislation. We may not be able to fully realize the positive impact the Reform Legislation may otherwise have on our business, results of operations, cash flow, capital resources and liquidity. Furthermore, we cannot predict whether we will be able to modify certain aspects of our operations to offset any potential adverse consequences from the Reform Legislation. 

Fraud and Abuse Laws. Participation in the Medicare program is heavily regulated by federal statute and regulation. If a hospital fails to comply substantially with the requirements for participating in the Medicare program, the hospital&#146;s participation may be terminated and/or civil or criminal penalties may be imposed. The 

&#160;

Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 requires civil monetary penalties to increase by up to 150% by August 1, 2016, and to increase annually thereafter based on updates to the consumer price index. Further, a hospital may lose its ability to participate in the Medicare program if it engages in any of the following acts: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; making claims to Medicare for services not provided or misrepresenting actual services provided in order to obtain higher payments, &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; paying money to induce the referral of patients where services are reimbursable under a federal health program, or &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; paying money to limit or reduce the services provided to Medicare beneficiaries. Any person or entity that knowingly and willfully defrauds or attempts to defraud a healthcare benefit program, including private healthcare plans, may be subject to fines, imprisonment or both. Additionally, any person or entity that knowingly and willfully falsifies or conceals a material fact or makes any material false or fraudulent statements in connection with the delivery or payment of healthcare services by a healthcare benefit plan is subject to a fine, imprisonment or both. 

Another law regulating the healthcare industry is a section of the Social Security Act, known as the &#147;anti-kickback statute&#148;. This law prohibits some business practices and relationships under Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. These practices include the payment, receipt, offer, or solicitation of remuneration of any kind in exchange for items or services that are reimbursed under most federal or state healthcare programs. Violations of the anti-kickback statute may be punished by criminal and civil fines, exclusion from federal healthcare programs and damages up to three times the total dollar amount involved. 

The Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, or OIG, is responsible for identifying and investigating fraud and abuse activities in federal healthcare programs. As part of its duties, the OIG provides guidance to healthcare providers by identifying types of activities that could violate the anti-kickback statute. The OIG also publishes regulations outlining activities and business relationships that would be deemed not to violate the anti-kickback statute. These regulations are known as &#147;safe harbor&#148; regulations. However, the failure of a particular activity to comply with the safe harbor regulations does not necessarily mean that the activity violates the anti-kickback statute; however, such failure may lead to increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities. 

The OIG has identified the following incentive arrangements as potential violations of the anti-kickback statute: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; payment of any incentive by the hospital when a physician refers a patient to the hospital, &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; use of free or significantly discounted office space or equipment for physicians in facilities usually located close to the hospital, &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; provision of free or significantly discounted billing, nursing, or other staff services, &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; free training for a physician&#146;s office staff, including management and laboratory techniques (but excluding compliance training), &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; guarantees which provide that if the physician&#146;s income fails to reach a predetermined level, the hospital will pay any portion of the remainder, &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; low-interest or interest-free loans, or loans which may be forgiven if a physician refers patients to the hospital, &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; payment of the costs of a physician&#146;s travel and expenses for conferences, &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; payment of services which require few, if any, substantive duties by the physician, or payment for services in excess of the fair market value of the services rendered, &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; coverage on the hospital&#146;s group health insurance plans at an inappropriately low cost to the physician, &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; purchasing goods or services from physicians at prices in excess of their fair market value, &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; rental of space in physician offices, at other than fair market value, or &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; physician-owned entities (often referred to as physician-owned distributorships, or PODS) that derive revenue from selling, or arranging for the sale of, implantable medical devices ordered by their physician-owners for use on procedures that physician-owners perform on their own patients at hospitals or ASCs. We have a variety of financial relationships with physicians who refer patients to our hospitals. Physicians own interests in a number of our facilities. Physicians may also own our stock. We also have contracts with physicians providing for a variety of financial arrangements, including employment contracts, leases, management agreements and professional service agreements. We provide financial incentives to recruit physicians to relocate to communities served by our hospitals. These incentives include relocation, reimbursement for certain direct expenses, income guarantees and, in some cases, loans. Although we strive to comply with the anti-kickback statute, taking into account available guidance including the &#147;safe harbor&#148; regulations, we cannot assure you that regulatory authorities will not determine otherwise. If that happens, we could be subject to criminal and civil penalties and/or exclusion from participating in Medicare, Medicaid, or other government healthcare programs. 

The Social Security Act also includes a provision commonly known as the &#147;Stark Law.&#148; This law prohibits physicians from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to healthcare entities in which they or any of their immediate family members have ownership interests or other financial arrangements. These types of referrals are commonly known as &#147;self referrals.&#148; There are ownership and compensation arrangement exceptions to the self-referral prohibition. One exception, known as the &#147;whole hospital&#148; exception, allows a physician to make a referral to a hospital if the physician owns an interest in the entire hospital, as opposed to an ownership interest in a department of the hospital. Another exception allows a physician to refer patients to a healthcare entity in which the physician has an ownership interest if the entity is located in a rural area, as defined in the statute. There are also exceptions for many of the customary financial arrangements between physicians and providers, including employment contracts, leases and recruitment agreements. From time to time, the federal government has issued regulations which interpret the provisions included in the Stark Law. 

The Reform Legislation narrowed the &#147;whole hospital&#148; exception to the Stark Law. The Reform Legislation permitted existing physician investments in a whole hospital to continue under a &#147;grandfather&#148; clause if the arrangement satisfies certain requirements and restrictions, but physicians are prohibited, from the time the Reform Legislation became effective, from increasing the aggregate percentage of their ownership in the hospital. The Reform Legislation also restricts the ability of existing physician-owned hospitals to expand the capacity of their aggregate licensed beds, operating rooms and procedure rooms. The whole hospital exception also contains additional public disclosure requirements. 

Sanctions for violating the Stark Law include denial of payment, civil monetary penalties of up to $15,000 per claim submitted and exclusion from federal healthcare programs. The statute also provides for a penalty of up to $100,000 for a scheme intended to circumvent the Stark Law prohibitions. 

In addition to the restrictions and disclosure requirements applicable to physician-owned hospitals under the Stark Law, CMS regulations require physician-owned hospitals and their physician owners to disclose certain ownership information to patients. Physician-owned hospitals must disclose their physician ownership in writing to patients and must make a list of their physician owners available upon request. Additionally, each physician owner who is a member of a physician-owned hospital&#146;s medical staff must agree, as a condition of continued 

&#160;

medical staff membership or admitting privileges, to disclose in writing to all patients whom they refer to the hospital their (or an immediate family member&#146;s) ownership interest in the hospital. A hospital is considered to be physician-owned if any physician, or an immediate family member of a physician, holds debt, stock or other types of investment in the hospital or in any owner of the hospital, excluding physician ownership through publicly-traded securities that meet certain conditions. If a hospital fails to comply with these regulations, the hospital could lose its Medicare provider agreement and be unable to participate in Medicare. 

Evolving interpretations of current, or the adoption of new, federal or state laws or regulations could affect many of the arrangements entered into by each of our hospitals. In addition, law enforcement authorities, including the OIG, the courts and Congress are increasing scrutiny of arrangements between healthcare providers and potential referral sources to ensure that the arrangements are not designed as a mechanism to improperly pay for patient referrals and/or other business. Investigators also have demonstrated a willingness to look behind the formalities of a business transaction to determine the underlying purpose of payments between healthcare providers and potential referral sources. 

Many states in which we operate have also adopted laws that prohibit payments to physicians in exchange for referrals similar to the federal anti-kickback statute or that otherwise prohibit fraud and abuse activities. Many states have also passed self-referral legislation similar to the Stark Law, prohibiting the referral of patients to entities with which the physician has a financial relationship. Often these state laws are broad in scope and may apply regardless of the source of payment for care. These statutes typically provide criminal and civil penalties, as well as loss of licensure. Little precedent exists for the interpretation or enforcement of these state laws. 

Our operations could be adversely affected by the failure of our arrangements to comply with the anti-kickback statute, the Stark Law, billing laws and regulations, current state laws or other legislation or regulations in these areas adopted in the future. We are unable to predict whether other legislation or regulations at the federal or state level in any of these areas will be adopted, what form such legislation or regulations may take or how they may affect our operations. We are continuing to enter into new financial arrangements with physicians and other providers in a manner structured to comply in all material respects with these laws. We strive to comply with applicable fraud and abuse laws. We cannot assure you, however, that governmental officials responsible for enforcing these laws or whistleblowers will not assert that we are in violation of them or that such statutes or regulations ultimately will be interpreted by the courts in a manner consistent with our interpretation. 

Federal False Claims Act and Similar State Laws. Another trend affecting the healthcare industry is the increased use of the federal False Claims Act, or FCA, which can be used to prosecute Medicare and other government program fraud involving issues such as coding errors, billing for service not provided and submitting false cost reports. Further, the FCA covers payments involving federal funds in connection with the health insurance exchanges created under the Reform Legislation, if those payments involve any federal funds. Liability under the FCA often arises when an entity knowingly submits a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government. The FCA broadly defines the term &#147;knowingly.&#148; Although simple negligence will not give rise to liability under the FCA, submitting a claim with reckless disregard to its truth or falsity may constitute &#147;knowingly&#148; submitting a false claim and result in liability. Among the many other potential bases for liability under the FCA is the knowing and improper failure to report and refund amounts owed to the government within 60 days of identifying an overpayment. Effective March 14, 2016, an overpayment is deemed to be identified when a person has, or should have through reasonable diligence, determined that an overpayment was received and quantified the overpayment. Submission of a claim for an item or service generated in violation of the anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim under the FCA. In some cases, whistleblowers, the federal government and courts have taken the position that providers who allegedly have violated other statutes, such as the Stark Law, have thereby submitted false claims under the FCA. 

When a defendant is determined by a court of law to be liable under the FCA, the defendant must pay three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $5,500 and $11,000 for each separate false claim. Civil monetary penalties will increase by up to 150% by August 1, 2016, and will increase annually thereafter. Settlements entered into prior to litigation usually involve a less severe 

&#160;

calculation of damages. The FCA also contains &#147;qui tam&#148; or whistleblower provisions, which allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the government alleging that the defendant has defrauded the federal government. If the government intervenes in the action and prevails, the party filing the initial complaint may share in any settlement or judgment. If the government does not intervene in the action, the whistleblower plaintiff may pursue the action independently and may receive a larger share of any settlement or judgment. When a private party brings a qui tam action under the FCA, the defendant generally will not be made aware of the lawsuit until the government commences its own investigation or determines whether it will intervene. Every entity that receives at least $5 million annually in Medicaid payments must have written policies for all employees, contractors and agents providing detailed information about false claims, false statements and whistleblower protections under certain federal laws, including the FCA, and similar state laws. 

A number of states, including states in which we operate, have adopted their own false claims provisions as well as their own whistleblower provisions whereby a private party may file a civil lawsuit in state court. Federal law provides an incentive to states to enact false claims laws that are comparable to the FCA. From time to time, companies in the healthcare industry, including ours, may be subject to actions under the FCA or similar state laws. 

Corporate Practice of Medicine; Fee-Splitting. Some states have laws that prohibit unlicensed persons or business entities, including corporations, from employing physicians. Some states also have adopted laws that prohibit direct or indirect payments to, or entering into fee-splitting arrangements with, physicians and unlicensed persons or business entities. Possible sanctions for violations of these restrictions include loss of a physician&#146;s license, civil and criminal penalties and rescission of business arrangements. These laws vary from state to state, are often vague and have seldom been interpreted by the courts or regulatory agencies. We structure our arrangements with healthcare providers to comply with the relevant state law. However, we cannot be assured that governmental officials responsible for enforcing these laws will not assert that we, or transactions in which we are involved, are in violation of these laws. These laws may also be interpreted by the courts in a manner inconsistent with our interpretations. 

Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act. The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act imposes requirements as to the care that must be provided to anyone who comes to facilities providing emergency medical services seeking care before they may be transferred to another facility or otherwise denied care. Sanctions for failing to fulfill these requirements include exclusion from participation in Medicare and Medicaid programs and civil money penalties. In addition, the law creates private civil remedies which enable an individual who suffers personal harm as a direct result of a violation of the law to sue the offending hospital for damages and equitable relief. A medical facility that suffers a financial loss as a direct result of another participating hospital&#146;s violation of the law also has a similar right. Although we believe that our practices are in compliance with the law, we can give no assurance that governmental officials responsible for enforcing the law or others will not assert we are in violation of these laws. 

Conversion Legislation. Many states, including some where we have hospitals and others where we may in the future acquire hospitals, have adopted legislation regarding the sale or other disposition of hospitals operated by not-for-profit entities. In other states that do not have specific legislation, the attorneys general have demonstrated an interest in these transactions under their general obligations to protect charitable assets from waste. These legislative and administrative efforts primarily focus on the appropriate valuation of the assets divested and the use of the proceeds of the sale by the not-for-profit seller. While these reviews and, in some instances, approval processes can add additional time to the closing of a hospital acquisition, we have not had any significant difficulties or delays in completing the process. There can be no assurance, however, that future actions on the state level will not seriously delay or even prevent our ability to acquire hospitals. If these activities are widespread, they could limit our ability to acquire hospitals. 

Certificates of Need. The construction of new facilities, the acquisition of existing facilities and the addition of new services at our facilities may be subject to state laws that require prior approval by state regulatory agencies. These CON laws generally require that a state agency determine the public need and give approval prior to the 

&#160;

construction or acquisition of facilities or the addition of new services. As of December 31, 2015, we operated 111 hospitals in 15 states that have adopted CON laws for acute care facilities. If we fail to obtain necessary state approval, we will not be able to expand our facilities, complete acquisitions or add new services in these states. Violation of these state laws may result in the imposition of civil sanctions or the revocation of a hospital&#146;s licenses. 

HIPAA Administrative Simplification and Privacy and Security Requirements. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, requires the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for healthcare claims and payment transactions submitted or received electronically. These provisions are intended to encourage electronic commerce in the healthcare industry. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, has established electronic data transmission standards that all healthcare providers must use when submitting or receiving certain healthcare transactions electronically. In addition, HIPAA requires that each provider use a National Provider Identifier. As of October 1, 2015, all healthcare providers covered by HIPAA are required to use updated standard code sets for certain diagnoses and procedures known as ICD-10 code sets. We have transitioned all of our hospitals to the ICD-10 coding system. This transition continues to involve a significant focus on our technology and information systems, as well as costs related to training of hospital employees and providers and corporate support staff involved with coding and billing. Use of the ICD-10 code sets has required and continues to require significant changes; however, we believe that the cost of compliance with these regulations has not had and is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations. The Reform Legislation requires the HHS to adopt standards for additional electronic transactions and to establish operating rules to promote uniformity in the implementation of each standardized electronic transaction. 

As required by HIPAA, HHS has issued privacy and security regulations that extensively regulate the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health-related information and require covered entities, including health plans and most healthcare providers, to implement administrative, physical and technical practices to protect the security of individually identifiable health information that is electronically maintained or transmitted. Certain provisions of the security and privacy regulations apply to business associates (entities that handle identifiable health-related information on behalf of covered entities), and business associates are subject to direct liability for violation of the regulations. In addition, a covered entity may be subject to penalties as a result of a business associate violating HIPAA, if the business associate is found to be an agent of the covered entity. We have developed and utilize a HIPAA compliance plan as part of our effort to comply with HIPAA privacy and security requirements. The privacy regulations and security regulations have and will continue to impose significant costs on our facilities in order to comply with these standards. 

Covered entities must report breaches of unsecured protected health information to affected individuals without unreasonable delay, but not to exceed 60 days of discovery of the breach by the covered entity or its agents. Notification must also be made to HHS and, in certain situations involving large breaches, to the media. HHS is required to publish on its website a list of all covered entities that report a breach involving more than 500 individuals. All non-permitted uses or disclosures of unsecured protected health information are presumed to be breaches unless the covered entity or business associate establishes that there is a low probability the information has been compromised. Various state laws and regulations may also require us to notify affected individuals in the event of a data breach involving individually identifiable information. 

Violations of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations may result in criminal penalties and in civil penalties of up to $50,000 per violation for a maximum of $1,500,000 in a calendar year for violations of the same requirement. HHS is required to perform compliance audits and has announced its intent to perform audits in 2016. In addition to enforcement by HHS, state attorneys general are authorized to bring civil actions seeking either injunction or damages in response to violations of HIPAA privacy and security regulations that threaten the privacy of state residents. HHS may resolve HIPAA violations through informal means, such as allowing a covered entity to implement a corrective action plan, but HHS has the discretion to move directly to impose monetary penalties and is required to impose penalties for violations resulting from willful neglect. Our facilities 

&#160;

also are subject to any federal or state privacy-related laws that are more restrictive than the privacy regulations issued under HIPAA. These laws vary and could impose additional penalties. For example, the Federal Trade Commission uses its consumer protection authority to initiate enforcement actions in response to data breaches. 

Payment 

Medicare. Under the Medicare program, we are paid for inpatient and outpatient services performed by our hospitals. 

Payments for inpatient acute services are generally made pursuant to a prospective payment system, commonly known as &#147;PPS.&#148; Under PPS, our hospitals are paid a predetermined amount for each hospital discharge based on the patient&#146;s diagnosis. Specifically, each discharge is assigned to a diagnosis-related group, commonly known as a &#147;DRG,&#148; based upon the patient&#146;s condition and treatment during the relevant inpatient stay. Each DRG is assigned a payment rate using 100% of the national average cost per case and 100% of the severity-adjusted DRG weights. DRG payments are based on national averages and not on charges or costs specific to a hospital. Severity-adjusted DRGs more accurately reflect the costs a hospital incurs for caring for a patient and account more fully for the severity of each patient&#146;s condition. However, DRG payments are adjusted by a predetermined geographic adjustment factor assigned to the geographic area in which the hospital is located. While a hospital generally does not receive payment in addition to a DRG payment, hospitals may qualify for an &#147;outlier&#148; payment when the relevant patient&#146;s treatment costs are extraordinarily high and exceed a specified regulatory threshold. 

The DRG payment rates are adjusted by an update factor on October 1 of each year, the beginning of the federal fiscal year. The index used to adjust the DRG payment rates, known as the &#147;market basket index,&#148; gives consideration to the inflation experienced by hospitals in purchasing goods and services. DRG payment rates were increased by the full &#147;market basket index,&#148; for the federal fiscal years 2015 and 2016 by 2.9% and 2.4% respectively, subject to certain reductions. For federal fiscal year 2015, the DRG payment rates were reduced by 0.8% for documentation and coding; reduced by 0.5% for the multi-factor productivity adjustment; and reduced by 0.2% in accordance with the Reform Legislation. For federal fiscal year 2016, the DRG payment rates were reduced by 0.8% for documentation and coding; reduced by 0.5% for the multi-factor productivity adjustment; and reduced by 0.2% in accordance with the Reform Legislation. There is also a negative 0.2% adjustment to offset projected spending increases associated with admission and medical review criteria for inpatient services commonly known as the &#147;two midnight rule.&#148; Under the rule, services to Medicare beneficiaries are only payable as inpatient hospital services when there is a reasonable expectation that the hospital care is medically necessary and will be required across two midnights, absent unusual circumstances. A two percentage point reduction to the market basket index occurs if patient quality data is not submitted, and a reduction of one-half of the market basket index update occurs for hospitals that fail to demonstrate meaningful use of certified electronic health records, or EHR, technology without receiving a hardship exception. Future legislation may decrease the rate of increase for DRG payments or even decrease such payment rates, but we are not able to predict the amount of any reduction or the effect that any reduction will have on us. 

The DRG payment rates are also adjusted pursuant to provisions of the Reform Legislation that promote value-based purchasing, linking payments to quality and efficiency. First, hospitals that meet or exceed certain quality performance standards will receive greater reimbursement under CMS&#146;s value-based purchasing program, while hospitals that do not satisfy certain quality performance standards will receive reduced Medicare inpatient hospital payments. The amount collected from the reductions is pooled and used to fund the payments that reward hospitals based on a set of quality measures that have been linked to improved clinical processes of care and patient satisfaction. CMS scores each hospital on its achievement relative to other hospitals and improvement relative to that hospital&#146;s own past performance. Second, hospitals experiencing &#147;excess readmissions&#148; for conditions designated by CMS within 30 days from the patient&#146;s date of discharge will receive inpatient payments reduced by an amount determined by comparing that hospital&#146;s readmission performance to a risk-adjusted national average. Third, the 25% of hospitals with the worst national risk-adjusted hospital acquired 

&#160;

condition, or HAC, rates in the previous year will have their total inpatient operating Medicare payments reduced by 1%. In addition, HHS has indicated that it will increase its efforts to promote, develop and use alternative payment models such as Accountable Care Organizations, or ACOs, and bundled payment arrangements. 

In addition, hospitals may qualify for Medicare disproportionate share payments when their percentage of low income patients exceeds specified regulatory thresholds. A majority of our hospitals qualify to receive Medicare disproportionate share payments. Medicare disproportionate share payments are reduced by 75% and earmarked for an uncompensated care payment pool, in accordance with the Reform Legislation. The uncompensated care pool is further reduced each year by a formula that reflects reductions in the U.S. uninsured population that is under 65 years of age. Thus, the greater the level of coverage for the uninsured, the more the Medicare uncompensated care pool will be reduced. Each eligible hospital is then paid, out of the uncompensated care pool, an amount based upon its estimated cost of providing uncompensated care. At this time, we cannot predict an impact for this change. These Medicare disproportionate share and uncompensated care payments as a percentage of operating revenues, net of contractual allowances and discounts (but before the provision for bad debts), were 1.2% and 1.5% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Hospitals may also qualify for Medicaid disproportionate share payments when they qualify under the state established guidelines. These Medicaid disproportionate share payments as a percentage of operating revenues, net of contractual allowances and discounts (but before the provision for bad debts), were 0.4% and 0.3% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 

We also receive Medicare reimbursement for outpatient services through a PPS. The outpatient conversion factor was increased 2.9% effective January 1, 2015; however, there was a negative 0.2% adjustment in accordance with the Reform Legislation and a negative 0.5% productivity adjustment and other payment adjustments, which CMS estimated would result in a 2.3% increase. The outpatient conversion factor was increased 2.4% effective January 1, 2016; however, there is a negative 0.2% adjustment in accordance with the Reform Legislation, a negative 0.5% productivity adjustment and a negative 2.0% adjustment to address what CMS views as inflated payments for laboratory tests packaged with payments for hospital outpatient services. Taking into account these and other payment adjustments, CMS estimates the 2016 update will result in a 0.4% decrease in outpatient PPS payments to hospitals. For fiscal year 2016, an additional reduction applies to hospitals that do not submit required patient quality data. We are complying with this data submission requirement. 

The HHS also uses a PPS to reimburse providers of home health services (i.e., home care). The home health agency market basket percentage increased by 2.6% on January 1, 2015; however, coupled with adjustments to other variables within the home health agency PPS, an approximate 0.3% net decrease in home health agency payments was expected to occur. The home health agency market basket percentage increased by 2.3% on January 1, 2016; however, coupled with adjustments to other variables within the home health agency PPS, an approximate 1.4% net decrease in home health agency payments is expected to occur. The Reform Legislation increases the home health agency PPS per episodic payment rate by 3.0% for home health services provided to patients in rural areas on or after April 1, 2010 through December 31, 2016. This 3% increase was extended through December 31, 2018 with the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, or MACRA. A two percentage point reduction to the market basket occurs if patient quality data is not submitted. We are complying with this data submission requirement. 

The Medicare reimbursement discussed above was reduced in 2013 due to the Budget Control Act of 2011 that required across-the-board spending cuts to the federal budget, also known as sequestration. These sequestration cuts included reductions in payments for Medicare and other federally funded healthcare programs, including TRICARE. The cuts began on March 1, 2013, with the sequester-related Medicare reimbursement cuts beginning April 1, 2013. These reductions have been extended through 2025. 

Payment under the Medicare program for physician services, which is based upon the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule, or MPFS, changed in April 2015 with the enactment of MACRA. The law effectively eliminated a payment reduction that was scheduled for physicians and other practitioners who treat Medicare patients. 

&#160;

MACRA provides for a 0.5% update to the MPFS for each calendar year through 2019. MACRA also requires the establishment of the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System, or MIPS, beginning in 2019, under which physicians will receive performance-based payment incentives or payment reductions based on their performance with respect to clinical quality, resource use, clinical improvement activities, and meaningful use of EHR. MIPS will consolidate certain existing physician incentive programs, and also requires CMS to provide, beginning in 2019, incentive payments for physicians and other eligible professionals that participate in alternative payment models, such as accountable care organizations, or ACOs. In addition, MACRA extended the Medicare Inpatient Low Volume payment and Medicare Dependent Hospital programs to qualifying hospitals through September 30, 2017. If additional legislation is not passed to extend these Medicare hospital payment programs, we could experience a reduction in future reimbursement. 

Medicaid. Most state Medicaid payments are made under a PPS or under programs which negotiate payment levels with individual hospitals. Medicaid is funded jointly by state and federal government. The federal government and many states are currently considering significantly reducing Medicaid funding, while at the same time expanding Medicaid benefits. Currently, several states utilize supplemental reimbursement programs for the purpose of providing reimbursement to providers to offset a portion of the cost of providing care to Medicaid and indigent patients. These programs are designed with input from CMS and are funded with a combination of state and federal resources, including, in certain instances, fees or taxes levied on the providers. Similar programs are also being considered by other states. We can provide no assurance that reductions to Medicaid funding will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations. Further, the Reform Legislation prohibits the use of federal funds under the Medicaid program to reimburse providers for medical services provided to treat HACs. 

TRICARE . TRICARE is the Department of Defense&#146;s healthcare program for members of the armed forces. For inpatient services, TRICARE generally reimburses hospitals based on a DRG system modeled on the Medicare inpatient PPS. For outpatient services, TRICARE reimburses hospitals based on a PPS that is similar to that utilized for services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries. 

Annual Cost Reports. Hospitals participating in the Medicare and some Medicaid programs, whether paid on a reasonable cost basis or under a PPS, are required to meet specified financial reporting requirements. Federal and, where applicable, state regulations require submission of annual cost reports identifying medical costs and expenses associated with the services provided by each hospital to Medicare beneficiaries and Medicaid recipients. 

Annual cost reports required under the Medicare and some Medicaid programs are subject to routine governmental audits. These audits may result in adjustments to the amounts ultimately determined to be due to us under these reimbursement programs. Finalization of these audits often takes several years. Providers can appeal any final determination made in connection with an audit. DRG outlier payments have been and continue to be the subject of CMS audit and adjustment. The OIG is also actively engaged in audits and investigations into alleged abuses of the DRG outlier payment system. 

Commercial Insurance and Managed Care Companies. Our hospitals provide services to individuals covered by private healthcare insurance or by health plans administered by managed care companies. These payors pay our hospitals or in some cases reimburse their policyholders based upon the hospital&#146;s established charges and the coverage provided in the insurance policy. They try to limit the costs of hospital services by negotiating discounts, including PPS, which would reduce payments by commercial insurers or health plans to our hospitals. Commercial insurers and managed care companies also seek to reduce payments to hospitals by establishing payment rules that in effect re-characterize the services ordered by physicians. For example, some payors vigorously review each patient&#146;s length of stay in the hospital and recharacterize as outpatient all in-patient stays of less than a particular duration (e.g. 24 hours). Reductions in payments for services provided by our hospitals to individuals covered by these payors could adversely affect us. 

&#160;

Medicare Administrative Contractors . CMS competitively bids the Medicare fiscal intermediary and Medicare carrier functions to Medicare Administrative Contractors, or MACs, in 12 jurisdictions. Each MAC is geographically assigned and serves both Part A and Part B providers within a given jurisdiction. CMS is currently engaged in a consolidation strategy to move from 15 MAC jurisdictions to 10. Chain providers had the option of having all hospitals use one home office MAC, and we chose to do so. However, CMS has not converted all of our hospitals to one MAC and currently does not have an established date to accomplish the conversion. CMS periodically re-solicits bids, and the MAC servicing a geographic area can change as a result of the bid competition. MAC transition periods can impact claims processing functions and the resulting cash flow. 

Medicare Integrity. CMS contracts with third parties to promote the integrity of the Medicare program through review of quality concerns and detection of improper payments. Quality Improvement Organizations, or QIOs, for example, are groups of physicians and other healthcare quality experts which work on behalf of CMS to ensure that Medicare pays only for goods and services that are reasonable and necessary and that are provided in the most appropriate setting . Under the Recovery Audit Contractor, or RAC, program, CMS contracts with RACs nationwide to conduct post-payment reviews to detect and correct improper payments in the Medicare program, as required by statute. RACs review claims submitted to Medicare for billing compliance, including correct coding and medical necessity. Compensation for RACs is on a contingency basis and based upon the amount of overpayments and underpayments identified, if any. CMS recently reduced the number of claims that RACs may audit by limiting the number of records that RACs may request from hospitals based on each provider&#146;s claim denial rate for the previous year. 

The RAC program&#146;s scope also includes Medicaid claims. States may coordinate with Medicaid RACs regarding recoupment of overpayments and refer suspected fraud and abuse to appropriate law enforcement agencies. Under the Medicaid Integrity Program, CMS employs private contractors, referred to as Medicaid Integrity Contractors, or MICs, to perform reviews and post-payment audits of Medicaid claims and identify overpayments. MICs are assigned to five geographic jurisdictions. Besides MICs, several other contractors and state Medicaid agencies have increased their review activities. 

We maintain policies and procedures to respond to the RAC requests and payment denials. Payment recoveries resulting from RAC reviews and denials are appealable, and we pursue reversal of adverse determinations at appropriate appeal levels. Currently, there are significant delays in the assignment of new Medicare appeals to Administrative Law Judges. In April 2015, the Office of Medicare Hearings and Appeals estimated that the assignment of requests for hearings could be delayed for up to 28 months. Thus, we may experience significant delays in appealing any RAC payment denials. Depending upon the growth of RAC programs and our success in appealing claims in future periods, our cash flows and results of operations could be negatively impacted. 

Accountable Care Organizations . With the aim of reducing healthcare costs by improving quality and operational efficiency, ACOs are gaining traction in both the public and private sectors. An ACO is a network of providers and suppliers (including hospitals, physicians and other designated professionals) which work together to invest in infrastructure and redesign delivery processes to achieve high quality and efficient delivery of services. ACOs are intended to produce savings as a result of improved quality and operational efficiency. Pursuant to the Reform Legislation, HHS established a Medicare Shared Savings Program that seeks to promote accountability and coordination of care through the creation of ACOs. Medicare-approved ACOs that achieve quality performance standards established by HHS are eligible to share in a portion of the amounts saved by the Medicare program. HHS has significant discretion to determine key elements of ACO programs. Certain waivers are available from fraud and abuse laws for ACOs. As of January 2016, CMS has approved over 475 ACOs to participate in various Medicare ACO initiatives. 

Bundled Payment Initiatives . The Reform Legislation created the CMS Innovation Center with responsibility for establishing demonstration projects and other initiatives in order to identify, develop, test and encourage the adoption of new methods of delivering and paying for healthcare that create savings under the Medicare and Medicaid programs, while maintaining or improving quality of care. One initiative implemented by the CMS Innovation Center is a voluntary bundled payment initiative known as the Bundled Payment for Care 

&#160;

Improvement, or BPCI, initiative. This voluntary initiative is comprised of four broadly defined models of care and links payments to participating providers for services provided during an episode of care. Participating providers agree to receive one payment for services provided to Medicare patients for certain medical conditions or episodes of care. In contrast to the traditional fee-for-service model, bundled payments are intended to align incentives for providers, encouraging more effective and efficient care. We are participating in these BPCI initiatives in eleven of our markets. 

Beginning in April 2016, hospitals located in markets selected by CMS, including some of our facilities, will be required to participate in the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement model, a mandatory bundled payment initiative for specified joint replacement procedures. Participating hospitals will be evaluated against quality standards and Medicare spending targets established by CMS for each episode of care. An episode of care begins with a patient&#146;s hospital admission and includes all related care by the hospital and other providers within 90 days of discharge. Depending on whether overall CMS spending per episode exceeds or falls below the target and whether quality standards are met, hospitals may receive supplemental Medicare payments or owe repayments to CMS. 

The Reform Legislation also provides for a bundled payment demonstration project for Medicaid services, but CMS has not yet implemented this project. HHS may select up to eight states to participate, and these state programs may target particular categories of beneficiaries, selected diagnoses or geographic regions of the state. The selected state programs will provide one payment for both hospital and physician services provided to Medicaid patients for certain episodes of inpatient care. 

Supply Contracts 

In March 2005, we began purchasing items, primarily medical supplies, medical equipment and pharmaceuticals, under an agreement with HealthTrust, a GPO in which we are a noncontrolling partner. As of December 31, 2015, we had a 24.7% ownership interest in HealthTrust. By participating in this organization, we are able to procure items at competitively priced rates for our hospitals. There can be no assurance that our arrangement with HealthTrust will continue to provide the discounts that we have historically received. 

Competition 

The hospital industry is highly competitive. An important part of our business strategy is to continue to acquire hospitals in non-urban markets and selected urban markets. However, other for-profit hospital companies and not-for-profit hospital systems generally attempt to acquire the same type of hospitals as we do. In addition, some hospitals are sold through an auction process, which may result in higher purchase prices than we believe are reasonable. 

In addition to the competition we face for acquisitions, we must also compete with other hospitals and healthcare providers for patients. The competition among hospitals and other healthcare providers for patients has intensified in recent years. The majority of our hospitals are located in non-urban service areas in which we are the sole provider of general acute care health services. Those hospitals in non-urban service areas face no direct competition because there are no other hospitals in their primary service areas. However, these hospitals face competition from hospitals outside of their primary service area, including hospitals in urban areas that provide more complex services. Patients in those service areas may travel to these other hospitals for a variety of reasons, including the need for services we do not offer or physician referrals. Patients who are required to seek services from these other hospitals may subsequently shift their preferences to those hospitals for services we do provide. Those hospitals in selected urban service areas may face competition from hospitals that are more established than our hospitals. Certain of these competing facilities offer services, including extensive medical research and medical education programs, which are not offered by our facilities. In addition, in certain markets where we operate, there are large teaching hospitals that provide highly specialized facilities, equipment and services that may not be available at our hospitals. We also face competition from other specialized care 

&#160;

providers, including outpatient surgery, orthopedic, oncology and diagnostic centers. Some competitors are implementing physician alignment strategies, such as employing physicians, acquiring physician practice groups, and participating in ACOs, or other clinical integration models. 

In most markets in which we are not the sole provider of general acute care health services, our primary competitor is a not-for-profit hospital. These hospitals are owned by tax-supported governmental agencies or not-for-profit entities supported by endowments and charitable contributions. These hospitals do not pay income or property taxes, and can make capital expenditures without paying sales tax. These financial advantages may better position such hospitals to maintain more modern and technologically upgraded facilities and equipment and offer services more specialized than those available at our hospitals. 

The number and quality of the physicians on a hospital&#146;s staff is an important factor in a hospital&#146;s competitive position. Physicians decide whether a patient is admitted to the hospital and the procedures to be performed. Admitting physicians may be on the medical staffs of other hospitals in addition to those of our hospitals. We attempt to attract our physicians&#146; patients to our hospitals by offering quality services and facilities, convenient locations and state-of-the-art equipment. In addition, CMS publicizes on its Hospital Compare website data that hospitals submit in connection with Medicare reimbursement claims, including performance data related to quality measures and patient satisfaction surveys. Federal law provides for the future expansion of the number of quality measures that must be reported. Additional quality measures and other future trends toward clinical transparency may have a potential impact on our competitive position and patient volumes in ways that we are unable to predict. In addition, as a result of the Reform Legislation, hospitals must either make public a list of their standard charges, or their policies for allowing the public to view a list of these charges in response to an inquiry. 

Compliance Program 

We take an operations team approach to compliance and utilize corporate experts for program design efforts and facility leaders for employee-level implementation. We believe compliance is another area that demonstrates our utilization of standardization and centralization techniques and initiatives which yield efficiencies and consistency throughout our facilities. We recognize that our compliance with applicable laws and regulations depends on individual employee actions as well as company operations. Our approach focuses on integrating compliance responsibilities with operational functions. This approach is intended to reinforce our company-wide commitment to operate strictly in accordance with the laws and regulations that govern our business. 

Our company-wide compliance program has been in place since 1997. Currently, the program&#146;s elements include leadership, management and oversight at the highest levels, a Code of Conduct, risk area specific policies and procedures, employee education and training, an internal system for reporting concerns, auditing and monitoring programs and a means for enforcing the program&#146;s policies. 

The compliance program continues to be expanded and developed to meet the industry&#146;s expectations and our needs. Specific written policies, procedures, training and educational materials and programs, as well as auditing and monitoring activities, have been prepared and implemented to address the functional and operational aspects of our business. Included within these functional areas are materials and activities for business sub-units, including laboratory, radiology, pharmacy, emergency, surgery, observation, home care, skilled nursing and clinics. Specific areas identified through regulatory interpretation and enforcement activities have also been addressed in our program. Claims preparation and submission, including coding, billing and cost reports, comprise the bulk of these areas. Financial arrangements with physicians and other referral sources, including compliance with the federal anti-kickback statute and the Stark Law, emergency department treatment and transfer requirements and other patient disposition issues, are also the focus of policy and training, standardized documentation requirements and review and audit. Another focus of the program is the interpretation and implementation of the HIPAA standards for privacy and security. 

&#160;

We have a Code of Conduct which applies to all directors, officers, employees and consultants, and a confidential disclosure program to enhance the statement of ethical responsibility expected of our employees and business associates who work in the accounting, financial reporting and asset management areas of our Company. Our Code of Conduct is posted on our website at www.chs.net/company-overview/code-of-conduct. 

Corporate Integrity Agreement 

On August 4, 2014, we announced that we had entered into a civil settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice, other federal agencies and identified relators that concluded previously announced investigations and litigation related to short stay admissions through emergency departments at certain of our affiliated hospitals. See the &#147;Legal Proceedings&#148; discussion in Part II, Item 1 of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2014 for further discussion of the background of this matter and details of the settlement. In addition to the amounts paid in the settlement, we executed a five-year Corporate Integrity Agreement, or CIA, with the OIG that has been incorporated into our existing and comprehensive compliance program. 

The compliance measures and reporting and auditing requirements contained in the CIA include: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; continuing the duties and activities of our Corporate Compliance Officer, Corporate Compliance Work Group, and Facility Compliance Officers and committees; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; maintaining our written Code of Conduct, which sets forth our commitment to full compliance with all statutes, regulations, and guidelines applicable to federal healthcare programs; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; maintaining our written policies and procedures addressing the operation of our Compliance Program, including adherence to medical necessity and admissions standards for inpatient hospital stays; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; continuing our general compliance training; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; providing specific training for appropriate personnel on billing, case management and clinical documentation; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; engaging an independent third party to perform an annual review of our compliance with the CIA; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; continuing our Confidential Disclosure Program and hotline to enable employees or others to disclose issues or questions regarding possible inappropriate policies or behavior; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; enhancing our screening program to ensure that we do not hire or engage employees or contractors who are ineligible persons for federal healthcare programs; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; reporting any material deficiency which resulted in an overpayment to us by a federal healthcare program; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; submitting annual reports to the OIG which describe in detail the operations of our corporate Compliance Program for the past year. Material, uncorrected violations of the CIA could lead to our suspension or disbarment from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs and repayment obligations. In addition, we are subject to possible civil penalties for failure to substantially comply with the terms of the CIA, including stipulated penalties ranging from $1,000 to $2,500 per day. We are also subject to a stipulated penalty of $50,000 for each false certification made by us or on our behalf in connection with reports required under the CIA. The CIA increases the amount of information we must provide to the federal government regarding our healthcare 

&#160;

practices and our compliance with federal regulations. The reports we provide in connection with the CIA could result in greater scrutiny by regulatory authorities. We believe our existing Compliance Program addresses compliance with the operational terms of the CIA. 

Employees and Medical Staff 

At December 31, 2015, we had approximately 137,000 employees, including approximately 28,000 part-time employees. References herein to &#147;employees&#148; refer to employees of our affiliates. We are subject to various state and federal laws that regulate wages, hours, benefits and other terms and conditions relating to employment. At December 31, 2015, certain employees at 32 of our hospitals are represented by various labor unions. It is likely that union organizing efforts will take place at additional hospitals in the future. We consider our employee relations to be good and have not experienced work stoppages that have materially, adversely affected our business or results of operations. Our hospitals, like most hospitals, have experienced rising labor costs. In some markets, nurse and medical support personnel availability has become a significant operating issue to healthcare providers. To address this challenge, we have implemented several initiatives to improve retention, recruiting, compensation programs and productivity. 

Our hospitals are staffed by licensed physicians, including both employed physicians and physicians who are not employees of our hospitals. Some physicians provide services in our hospitals under contracts, which generally describe a term of service, provide and establish the duties and obligations of such physicians, require the maintenance of certain performance criteria and fix compensation for such services. Any licensed physician may apply to be accepted to the medical staff of any of our hospitals, but the hospital&#146;s medical staff and the appropriate governing board of the hospital, in accordance with established credentialing criteria, must approve acceptance to the staff. Members of the medical staffs of our hospitals often also serve on the medical staffs of other hospitals and may terminate their affiliation with one of our hospitals at any time. 

We may be required to continue to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other medical support personnel or to hire more expensive temporary or contract personnel. As a result, our labor costs could increase. We also depend on the available labor pool of semi-skilled and unskilled employees in each of the markets in which we operate. Certain proposed changes in federal labor laws and the National Labor Relations Board&#146;s pending modification of its election procedures could increase the likelihood of employee unionization attempts. To the extent a significant portion of our employee base unionizes, our costs could increase significantly. In addition, the states in which we operate could adopt mandatory nurse-staffing ratios or could reduce mandatory nurse-staffing ratios already in place. State-mandated nurse-staffing ratios could significantly affect labor costs, and have an adverse impact on revenues if we are required to limit patient admissions in order to meet the required ratios. 

Professional Liability Claims 

As part of our business of owning and operating hospitals, we are subject to legal actions alleging liability on our part. To cover claims arising out of the operations of hospitals, we maintain professional malpractice liability insurance and general liability insurance on a claims made basis in excess of those amounts for which we are self-insured, in amounts we believe to be sufficient for our operations. We also maintain umbrella liability coverage for claims which, due to their nature or amount, are not covered by our other insurance policies. However, our insurance coverage does not cover all claims against us or may not continue to be available at a reasonable cost for us to maintain adequate levels of insurance. For a further discussion of our insurance coverage, see our discussion of professional liability claims in &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#148; in Item 7 of this Form 10-K. 

Environmental Matters 

We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials, including medical and pharmaceutical waste products. We do not currently 

&#160;

expect compliance with these laws and regulations to have a material adverse effect on us. It is possible, however, that environmental issues may arise in the future which we cannot now predict. 

We are insured for damages of personal property or environmental injury arising out of environmental impairment for both above ground and underground storage tank issues under one insurance policy for all of our hospitals. Our policy coverage is $5 million per occurrence with a $50,000 deductible and a $20 million annual aggregate. This policy also provides pollution legal liability coverage.
