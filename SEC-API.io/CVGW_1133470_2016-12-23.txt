General development of the business 

&#160; 

Calavo Growers, Inc. (Calavo, the Company, we, us or our), is a global leader in the avocado industry and an expanding provider of value-added fresh food. Our expertise in marketing and distributing avocados, prepared avocados, and other perishable foods allows us to deliver a wide array of fresh and prepared food products to food distributors, produce wholesalers, supermarkets, convenience stores, and restaurants on a worldwide basis. We procure avocados principally from California and Mexico. Through our various operating facilities, we (i) sort, pack, and/or ripen avocados, tomatoes and/or Hawaiian grown papayas, (ii) process and package fresh cut fruit and vegetables, salads, wraps, sandwiches, fresh snacking products and a variety of behind-the-glass deli items and (iii) produce and package guacamole and salsa. We distribute our products both domestically and internationally and report our operations in three different business segments: Fresh products, Calavo Foods and RFG. See Note 11 in our consolidated financial statements for further information about our business segments. Our principal executive offices are located at 1141-A Cummings Road, Santa Paula, California 93060; telephone (805) 525-1245. 

&#160; 

On October 9, 2001, we completed a series of transactions whereby common and preferred shareholders of Calavo Growers of California (the Cooperative), an agricultural marketing cooperative association, exchanged all of their outstanding shares for shares of our common stock. Concurrent with this transaction, the Cooperative was merged into us with Calavo Growers, Inc. (Calavo) emerging as the surviving entity. These transactions had the effect of converting the legal structure of the business from a non-profit cooperative to a for-profit corporation. 

&#160; 

In December 2014, Calavo formed a wholly owned subsidiary Calavo Growers De Mexico, S. de R.L. de C.V. (Calavo Growers de Mexico). In July 2015, Calavo Growers de Mexico entered into a Shareholder Agreement with Grupo Belo del Pacifico, S.A. de C.V., (Belo) a Mexican Company owned by Agricola Belher, and Agricola Don Memo, S.A. de C.V. (Don Memo). Don Memo, a Mexican corporation formed in July 2013, is engaged in the business of owning and improving land in Jalisco, Mexico for the growing of tomatoes and other produce and the sale and distribution of tomatoes and other produce. Belo and Calavo Growers de Mexico have an equal one-half ownership interest in Don Memo. Pursuant to a management service agreement, Belo, through its officers and employees, shall have day-to-day power and authority to manage the operations. In fiscal 2016 and 2015, we contributed $2.3 million and $1.0 million as investments in Don Memo. These investment contributions represent Calavo Growers de Mexico&#8217;s 50% ownership in Don Memo, which is included in investment in unconsolidated entities on our balance sheet. In fiscal 2015 and 2014, we advanced $0.8 million and $3.2 million. These monies totaling $4.0 million, effectively a bridge loan, were repaid in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. In January 2016, Calavo entered into an agreement with Bank of America, N.A. (BoA), essentially guaranteeing a loan made from BoA to Don Memo. See footnote 12 to our consolidated financial statements. 

&#160; 

In August 2015, we entered into a Shareholder&#8217;s Agreement with various partners which created Avocados de Jalisco, S.A.P.I. de C.V. (Avocados de Jalisco). Avocados de Jalisco is a Mexican corporation created to engage in procuring, packing and selling avocados in Jalisco, Mexico. This entity is approximately 80% owned by Calavo Growers de Mexico, a wholly owned subsidiary of Calavo, and is consolidated into our financial statements. In the 3 rd fiscal quarter of 2016, Avocados de Jalisco completed the construction of a packinghouse located in Jalisco, Mexico which is expected to be operational in the first quarter of 2017. We invested approximately $10.8 million to construct and equip this new packinghouse. 

&#160; 

In fiscal 2016, we expanded and refurbished our plant facilities in Houston, TX and Jacksonville, FL to add additional capacity and in-plant capabilities. We invested approximately $7.3 million into the Houston facility and $13.3 million into the Jacksonville facility.

&#160; 

Fresh products 

&#160; 

Calavo was founded in 1924 to market California avocados. In California, the growing area stretches from San Diego County to Monterey County, with the majority of the growing areas located approximately 100 miles north and south of Los Angeles County. The storage life of fresh avocados is limited. It generally ranges from one to four weeks, depending upon the maturity of the fruit, the growing methods used, and the handling conditions in the distribution chain. 

&#160; 

We sell avocados to a diverse group of supermarket chains, wholesalers, food service and other distributors, under the Calavo family of brand labels, as well as private labels. From time to time, some of our larger customers seek short-term sales contracts that formalize their pricing and volume requirements. Generally, these contracts contain provisions that establish a price floor and/or ceiling during the contract duration. In our judgment, the shift by our customers to drafting sales contracts benefits large handlers like us, which have the ability to fulfill the terms of these contracts. During fiscal year 2016, our 5 and 25 largest fresh customers represented approximately 15% and 36% of our total consolidated revenues. During fiscal year 2015, our 5 and 25 largest fresh customers represented approximately 18% and 39% of our total consolidated revenues. During fiscal year 2016, 2015 and 2014 none of our fresh customers represented more than 10% of total consolidated revenues. 

&#160; 

The Hass variety is the predominant avocado variety marketed on a worldwide basis. Generally, California grown Hass avocados are available year-round, with peak production periods occurring from April through August. Other varieties have a more limited picking season and generally command a lower price. Approximately 1,900 California growers deliver avocados to us, generally pursuant to a standard marketing agreement. Our share of the California avocado crop approximated 28% of the 2016 shipped California avocado crop, based on data published by the California Avocado Commission. We attribute our solid foothold in the California industry principally to the competitiveness of the per pound returns we pay and the communication and service we maintain with our growers. 

California avocados delivered to our packinghouses are grouped as a homogenous pool on a weekly basis based on the variety, size, and grade. They are then graded, sized, packed, cooled and, frequently, ripened for delivery to customers. Our ability to estimate the size, as well as the timing of the delivery of the annual avocado crop, has a substantial impact on both our costs and the sales price we receive for the fruit. To that end, our field personnel maintain direct contact with growers and farm managers and coordinate harvest plans. The feedback from our field-managers is used by our sales department to prepare sales plans used by our direct sales force. 

A significant portion of our California avocado handling costs is fixed. As a result, significant fluctuations in the volume of avocados delivered have a considerable impact on the per pound packing costs of avocados we handle. Generally, larger crops will result in a lower per pound handling cost. We believe that our cost structure is geared to optimally handle larger avocado crops. Our strategy calls for continued efforts in aggressively recruiting new large growers, retaining existing growers, and procuring a larger percentage of the California avocado crop. 

&#160; 

&#160;

The proceeds we receive from the sale of each separate avocado pool, net of a packing and marketing fee to cover our costs and a profit, generate the initial amounts considered to be paid back to the growers once a month. The packing and marketing fee we withhold is determined by our Chief Executive Officer and is revised from time to time based on our estimated per pound packing and operating costs, as well as our operating profit. This fee is a fixed rate per pound packed. These amounts are then compared to field quotes provided for each avocado pool, with the resulting final payment determined based on the field quotes to the growers. 

&#160; 

The California avocado market is highly competitive with nine major avocado handlers. A marketing order enacted by the state legislature is in effect for California grown avocados and provides the financial resource to fund generic advertising and promotional programs. Avocados handled by us are identifiable through packaging and the Calavo brand name sticker. 

&#160; 

We also import avocados from Mexico. We typically purchase Mexican avocados from growers and packers located in Mexico. The purchase price we pay for fruit acquired from Mexican growers is generally negotiated for substantially all the fruit in a particular grove, by bloom. The Mexican avocado crop will typically have three to four blooms in a single year. Once a purchase price is tentatively agreed to, the fruit is then harvested and delivered to our packinghouse located in Uruapan, Michoac&#225;n, Mexico. Purchased fruit is harvested and hauled by a number of subcontracted picking companies that we hire. &#160; Once delivered, such fruit is weighed, graded, sized, packed, and cooled for shipment, primarily to the United States. Payment for such fruit can be changed from what was initially agreed to if the actual packout does not reach levels forecasted by the grower. Fruit purchased directly from unaffiliated third-party Mexican packers is used as a supplemental source and is packed to our standards for shipment to either our customers&#8217; or our operating facilities. In either case, the purchase price of Mexican avocados is generally based on our estimated selling prices of such fruit, less anticipated packing and/or selling costs and our desired margin. We believe these two current sources, in conjunction with the expected opening of our packinghouse in Jalisco, Mexico, allow us to maximize both the timely acquisition, as well as purchase price, of Mexican fruit. 

&#160; 

Similar to California avocados, a significant portion of our handling costs for Mexican avocados are fixed. As a result, significant fluctuations in the volume of Mexican avocados delivered to our packinghouse can have a considerable impact on the per pound packing costs of avocados we handle. Generally, larger crops will result in a lower per pound handling cost. In fiscal year 2012, we completed an expansion of our Uruapan packinghouse. This expansion more than doubled our capacity to handle Mexican avocados. We believe that our cost structure for Mexican avocados is geared to optimally handle larger avocado crops. 

&#160; 

We believe that our continued success in marketing Mexican avocados is largely dependent upon securing a reliable, high-quality supply of avocados at reasonable prices, and keeping the handling costs low as we ship the Mexican avocados to our packinghouses and distribution centers. We are subject to USDA and other regulatory inspections to ensure the safety and the quality of the fruit being delivered from Mexico. The Mexican avocado harvest is year round (though generally most significant from September to June). As a result, it is common for Mexican growers to monitor year round the supply of avocados for export to the United States in order to obtain higher field prices. During 2016, we packed and distributed approximately 16% of the avocados exported from Mexico into the United States and approximately 7% of the avocados exported from Mexico to countries outside of North America, based on our estimates. 

&#160; 

We have developed a series of marketing and sales initiatives primarily aimed at our largest customers that are designed to differentiate our products and services from those offered by our competitors. Some of these key initiatives are as follows: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

We continue to have success with our ProRipeVIP&#8482; avocado ripening program. This proprietary program allows us to deliver avocados ~evenly ripened to our customers&#8217; specifications. We have invested in TasteTech Near Infrared (NIR) technology and equipment. The most significant reason we invested in the TasteTech systems is because the NIR technology measures internal qualities of the entire piece of fruit, as opposed to competitive mechanical tests that use pressure and calculated averages to measure firmness. We believe that ripened avocados help our customers address the consumers' immediate needs and accelerate the sale of avocados through their stores. We currently have three TasteTech systems in use in the United States, which, we believe, can effectively meet our customers&#8217; demand for conditioned fruit. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#183; 

We have developed various display techniques and packages that appeal to consumers and, in particular, impulse buyers. Some of our techniques include the bagging of avocados and the strategic display of the bags within the produce section of retail stores. Our research has demonstrated that consumers generally purchase a larger quantity of avocados when presented in a bag as opposed to the conventional bulk displays. We also believe that the value proposition of avocados in a bag provides for a higher level of sales to grocery stores. 

&#160; 

Other perishable food products include various other fruit, such as tomatoes, papayas, and pineapples. The majority of our other perishable food sales are generated from tomatoes and papayas. Tomatoes are primarily handled on a consigned basis, while papayas are handled on a pooling basis, generally at a fixed fee per papaya delivered. Sales of our diversified Fresh products generally experience fluctuations related to seasonality. We believe our efforts in distributing our other various types of fruit complement our offerings of avocados. 

&#160; 

Calavo Foods 

&#160; 

The Calavo Foods segment was originally conceived as a mechanism to stabilize the price of California avocados by reducing the volume of avocados available to the marketplace. In the 1960's and early 1970's, we pioneered the process of freezing avocado pulp and developed a wide variety of guacamole recipes to address the diverse tastes of consumers and buyers in both the retail and food service industries. One of the key benefits of frozen products is their long shelf-life. With the introduction of low cost processed products delivered from Mexican based processors, however, we realigned the segment's strategy by shifting the fruit procurement and pulp processing functions to Mexico. 

&#160; 

We utilize ultra-high pressure technology equipment, which is designed to protect and safeguard our avocado and guacamole products without the need of preservatives. Using high pressure only, this procedure substantially destroys the cells of any bacteria that could lead to spoilage, food safety, or oxidation issues. Once the procedure is complete, our packaged guacamole is cased and shipped to various retail, club, and food service customers throughout the markets we service in the U.S and abroad. By fiscal year 2010, we had two ultra-high pressure machines into service. These machines, which are located in Uruapan, pressurize all guacamole product lines, including all frozen products, which begun in fiscal 2010. A 3rd ultra-high pressure machine, with a larger capacity, was put into service during our first fiscal quarter of 2012. We estimate that our actual capacity utilization for all three ultra-high pressure machines for fiscal 2016 to be approximately 90%. In fiscal 2017, we expect to use a qualified co-packer to produce several of our retail and foodservice products. This co-packer will also use ultra-high pressure technology, similar to our existing production, and will be overseen by certain Calavo personnel. We expect our selling capacity to increase materially through the use of this co-packer. Net sales of our ultra-high pressure (fresh refrigerated) products, typically sold to retail customers, represented approximately 50% and 48% of total guacamole products within the Calavo Foods segment sales for the years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015. 

&#160; 

Sales in the U.S. and Canada are made principally through a commissioned nationwide broker network, which is supported by our regional sales managers. We believe that our marketing strength is distinguished by providing quality products, innovation, year-round product availability, strategically located warehouses, and market relationships. During fiscal year 2016, our 5 and 25 largest processed product customers represented approximately 3% and 6% of our total consolidated revenues. During fiscal year 2015, our 5 and 25 largest processed product customers represented approximately 3% and 5% of our total consolidated revenues. During fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014 none of our processed product customers represented more than 10% of total consolidated revenues. 

&#160; 

RFG 

&#160; 

Acquired in June of 2011, Renaissance Food Group, LLC (RFG) is a leader in the fast-growing refrigerated fresh packaged foods category. RFG produces, markets, and distributes nationally a portfolio of healthy, high quality fresh packaged food products for consumers via the retail channel, including national and regional supermarkets, club stores, mass merchandisers, convenience stores, and specialty/natural retailers. As a leader in refrigerated fresh packaged foods, RFG utilizes a network of company-operated and independently-operated USDA and organic certified fresh food facilities strategically located across the U.S. These facilities allow RFG to offer national retailers high quality, refrigerated fresh foods that can be delivered within hours from time of production. Consumer demand is high for 

&#160;

quality refrigerated fresh packaged foods and RFG&#8217;s speed to market, product innovation and broad product range positions the Company well to serve retailers addressing this consumer trend. RFG products include fresh prepared fruit and vegetables, fresh prepared entr&#233;e salads, wraps, sandwiches and fresh snacking products as well as ready-to-heat entrees and other hot bar and behind-the-deli glass meal and salad kits. RFG products are marketed under the Garden Highway Fresh Cut, Garden Highway, and Garden Highway Chef Essentials as well as store-brand, private label programs. Backed by Calavo&#8217;s resources, the business unit continues to expand its footprint in the retail grocery channel During fiscal year 2016, our 5 and 25 largest RFG product customers represented approximately 25% and 36% of our total consolidated revenues. During fiscal year 2015, our 5 and 25 largest RFG product customers represented approximately 23% and 33% of our total consolidated revenues. During fiscal year 2016, RFG had one customer that represented more than 10% of total consolidated revenues. During fiscal years 2015 and 2014, none of our RFG product customers represented more than 10% of total consolidated revenues.

Sales and Other Financial Information by Business Segment and Product Category 

&#160; 

Sales and other financial information by business segment are provided in Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements that are included in this Annual Report. 

&#160; 

Patents and Trademarks 

&#160; 

Our trademarks include the Calavo and RFG brand name and related logos. We also utilize the following trademarks in conducting our business: Avo Fresco, Bueno, Calavo Gold, Calavo Salsa Lisa, Salsa Lisa, Celebrate the Taste, El Dorado, Fresh Ripe, Select, Taste of Paradise, The First Name in Avocados, Tico, Mfresh, Maui Fresh International, Triggered Avocados, ProRipeVIP&#8482;, Garden Highway Fresh Cut, Garden Highway, and Garden Highway Chef Essentials. 

&#160; 

Working Capital Requirements 

&#160; 

Generally, we make payments to our avocado growers and other suppliers in advance of collecting all of the related accounts receivable. We generally bridge the timing between vendor payments and customer receipts by using operating cash flows and commercial bank borrowings. In addition, we provide crop loans and other advances to some of our growers, which are also funded through operating cash flows and borrowings. 

&#160; 

Non-California sourced avocados and other perishable food products often require working capital to finance the payment of advances to suppliers and collection of accounts receivable. These working capital needs are also financed through the use of operating cash flows and bank borrowings. 

&#160; 

With respect to our Calavo Foods business, we require working capital to finance the production of our processed avocado products, building and maintaining an adequate supply of finished product, and collecting our accounts receivable balances. These working capital needs are financed through the use of operating cash flows and bank borrowings. 

&#160; 

Backlog 

&#160; 

Our customers do not place product orders significantly in advance of the requested product delivery dates. Customers typically order perishable products two to ten days in advance of shipment, and typically order Calavo Foods within thirty days in advance of shipment. 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

Prior to the acquisition of RFG, we did not undertake significant research and development efforts. Research and development programs, if any, were limited to the continuous process of refining and developing new techniques to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of our Calavo Foods operations and the handling, ripening, storage, and packing of fresh avocados. With the acquisition of RFG, however, we have increased research and development for new and improved products which is driven by customer requests, changes in product specifications, customer and market 

&#160;

research and/or innovative ideas generated by our own team of experts with food processing and culinary backgrounds. We solicit customer and supplier input, review process and product trends and conduct sensory and shelf life testing, all to expand the category and drive new sales for our customers. In fiscal year 2014, with the consolidation of FreshRealm, we had an increased emphasis on research and development. Much of the research and development for FreshRealm was on a re-usable shipping container, which includes designing and the testing of prototypes, testing packing efficiency, gathering consumer feedback, thermal research, and testing the longevity and reusability of the containers. We deconsolidated FreshRealm in the third quarter of fiscal 2014. Research and development costs are charged to expense when incurred. Total research and development costs for fiscal years 2016 and 2015 were insignificant. Total research and development costs for fiscal years 2014 were approximately $0.8 million. 

&#160; 

Compliance with Government Regulations 

&#160; 

The California State Department of Food and Agriculture oversees the packing and processing of California avocados and conducts tests for fruit quality and packaging standards. All of our packages are stamped with the state seal as meeting standards. Various states have instituted regulations providing differing levels of oversight with respect to weights and measures, as well as quality standards. 

&#160; 

As a manufacturer and marketer of processed avocado products, our operations are subject to extensive regulation by various federal government agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the USDA and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), as well as state and local agencies, with respect to production processes, product attributes, packaging, labeling, storage and distribution. Under various statutes and regulations, these agencies prescribe requirements and establish standards for safety, purity and labeling. In addition, advertising of our products is subject to regulation by the FTC, and our operations are subject to certain health and safety regulations, including those issued under the Occupational Safety and Health Act. Our manufacturing facilities and products are subject to periodic inspection by federal, state and local authorities. 

&#160; 

As a result of our agricultural and food processing activities, we are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations govern the treatment, handling, storage and disposal of materials and waste and the remediation of contaminated properties. 

&#160; 

We seek to comply at all times with all such laws and regulations and to obtain any necessary permits and licenses, and we are not aware of any instances of material non-compliance. We believe our facilities and practices are sufficient to maintain compliance with applicable governmental laws, regulations, permits and licenses. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of October 31, 2016, we had 2,096 employees, of which 681 were located in the United States and 1,415 were located in Mexico. We do not have a significant number of United States employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Approximately 1,250 of Calavo's Mexican employees are represented by a union. We consider the relationship with our employees to be good and we have never experienced a significant work stoppage.
