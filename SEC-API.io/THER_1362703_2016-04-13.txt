 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. 

&#160; 

As used in this annual report on Form 10-K and unless otherwise indicated, the terms &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;OncBioMune Pharmaceuticals, Inc.&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221; refer to OncBioMune Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and/or its subsidiaries, as the context may require. 

&#160; 

Business Overview 

&#160; 

We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on March 18, 2005. From 2010 until 2013, we engaged in the pharmaceutical business. During 2013, we decided to divest the balance of our pharmaceutical assets and engage in the digital media business, which encompasses social discovery aspects of the internet, primarily through an engagement website with mobile and tablet applications. 

&#160; 

Effective September 2, 2015, we became a biotechnology company specializing in innovative cancer therapies. We have proprietary rights to a breast and prostate cancer therapeutic vaccines, a process for the growth of cancer cells and targeted chemotherapies. Our mission is to improve the overall patient condition through innovative immunotherapy with proven treatment protocols. 

&#160; 

We are pursuing licensing and/or acquisition of our therapies and proprietary technologies. Robert L. Elliott, MD, our Chief Medical Officer and a member of our board of directors, and Jonathan F. Head, PhD, our Chief Executive Officer and a director, have conducted their research and development activities in association with their breast cancer research and treatment facility, the Elliott-Elliott-Head Breast Cancer Research and Treatment Center. The Elliott-Elliott-Head Breast Cancer Research and Treatment Center is located in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and treats an average of 40 patients daily. 

&#160; 

Our current product portfolio consists of three target therapies and a vaccine platform that allows us to create a therapeutic vaccine for any solid tumor cancer. The vaccine platform has treated over 300 patients. We are in the planning stage of a Phase 2 clinical trial of our lead product, ProscaVax&#174;. The trial will be under the direction of Glenn Bubley, MD and the lead site will be Harvard&#8217;s Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, with additional other hospitals in the Harvard Health System. We anticipate that the trial will expand the results that we found in our Phase 1 clinical trial in a different patient population. We also hope to develop our other proprietary technologies, such as the paclitaxel-albumin conjugate with regard to which we plan to file an orphan drug indication within the next two years. 

&#160; 

Recent Developments 

&#160; 

Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation 

&#160; 

On August 12, 2015, we amended and restated our articles of incorporation to, among other things: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; change our corporate name from Quint Media, Inc. to OncBioMune Pharmaceuticals, Inc., &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; increase our authorized shares to 520,000,000, of which 500,000,000 shares are common stock, with a par value of $0.0001 per share, and 20,000,000 shares are preferred stock, with a par value of $0.0001 per share, and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; effect a reverse stock split, which became effective on August 27, 2015 (&#8220;Reverse Stock Split&#8221;), of our outstanding common stock pursuant to which every 139.23 issued and outstanding shares of our common stock was reclassified and converted into one share of common stock. No cash was paid or distributed as a result of the Reverse Stock Split, and no fractional shares were issued. All fractional shares which would otherwise have been required to be issued as a result of the Reverse Stock Split were rounded up to a whole share. &#160; 

On August 20, 2015, we filed a Certificate of Designation with the Nevada Secretary of State, designating 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock as Series A Preferred Stock (&#8220;Series A Preferred Stock&#8221;). Each holder of Series A Preferred Stock is entitled to 500 votes for each share of Series A Preferred Stock held as of the applicable date on any matter that is submitted to a vote or for the consent of the stockholders of the Company. The holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall have no special voting rights and their consent shall not be required (except to the extent they are entitled to vote with holders of common stock as set forth herein) for taking any corporate action. 

&#160; 

On August 27, 2015, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority approved the Reverse Stock Split and our corporate name change. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Closing of the Exchange; Management Changes 

&#160;

Effective as of September 2, 2015, we closed the exchange (the &#8220;Exchange&#8221;) pursuant to that certain share exchange agreement dated as of June 22, 2015, as amended, among OncBioMune, Inc. (&#8220;ONC&#8221;), the ONC stockholders and us (the &#8220;Exchange Agreement&#8221;). On September 2, 2015, pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Agreement, we issued an aggregate of 47,000,000 shares of our common stock (representing approximately 91.3% of our then-outstanding common stock) and 1,000,000 shares of our Series A preferred stock (representing 100% of our outstanding Series A preferred shares) in exchange for 47,000,000 shares of ONC&#8217;s common stock. As a result, the ONC stockholders became our stockholders and ONC became our wholly-owned subsidiary. 

&#160; 

Each share of Series A preferred stock is entitled to 500 votes on all matters that come before stockholders for a vote. For federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Exchange qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. ONC is treated as the accounting acquirer and as such the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K present the former operations of ONC for all periods presented. 

&#160; 

In accordance with the terms of the Exchange Agreement, as amended, Constantin Dietrich resigned as our President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary, Treasurer and sole director. Mr. Dietrich&#8217;s resignation was not as a result of any disagreements with the Company. In addition, each of Jonathan F. Head, Ph. D., Robert L. Elliott, M.D., and Andrew Kucharchuk were appointed as members of our board of directors, effective September 2, 2015. We also appointed the following individuals to the respective offices set forth next to their names: 

&#160; 

Jonathan F. Head, Ph. D. - Chief Executive Officer 

Robert L. Elliott, Jr., M.D. - Chief Medical Officer (not an executive officer position) 

Andrew Kucharchuk - Chief Financial Officer and President 

&#160; 

In connection with our corporate name change to OncBioMune Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the trading symbol for our common stock was changed from &#8220;QUNI&#8221; to &#8220;OBMP.&#8221; Also, effective as of September 2, 2015, we changed our fiscal year end from February 28 to December 31. 

&#160; 

Effective November 18, 2015, Charles L. Rice, Jr. was appointed as a member of our board of directors. On December 30, 2015, Daniel S. Hoverman was appointed as a member of our board of directors. 

&#160; 

Change in Our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

&#160; 

On September 2, 2015, our board of directors approved the engagement of Anton &#38; Chia, LLP (&#8220;Anton&#8221;), and the dismissal of Salberg &#38; Company, P.A., as our independent registered public accounting firm. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

As a matter of regular course, we have obtained, and intend to actively seek to obtain, when appropriate, protection for our current and prospective products and proprietary technology by means of United States and foreign patents, trademarks, and applications for each of the foregoing. In addition, we rely upon trade secrets and contractual agreements to protect certain of our proprietary technology and products. ProscaVax is a novel biologic, and it is difficult to predict how competition could develop and accordingly which aspects of our related intellectual property may prove the most significant in the future. We currently have a patent application relating to a protein therapeutic cancer vaccine and a provisional patent application relating to taxane- and taxoid-protein compositions. Both United States patent applications expire in 2031. In addition, we had a patent that expired in 2014 relating to vaccination of cancer patients using tumor-associated antigens mixed with interleukin-2 and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor. 

&#160; 

Patent expiration dates may be subject to patent term extension depending on certain factors. In addition, following expiration of a basic product patent or loss of patent protection resulting from a legal challenge, it may be possible to continue to obtain commercial benefits from other characteristics such as clinical trial data, product manufacturing trade secrets, uses for products, and special formulations of the product or delivery mechanisms. 

&#160; 

We intend to continue using our scientific experience to pursue and patent new developments to enhance our position in the cancer field. Patents, if issued, may be challenged, invalidated, declared unenforceable, circumvented or may not cover all applications we desire. Thus, any patent that we own or license from third parties may not provide adequate protection against competitors. Our pending patent applications, those we may file in the future, or those we may license from third parties may not result in issued patents. Also, patents may not provide us with adequate proprietary protection or advantages against competitors with, or who could develop, similar or competing technologies, or who could design around our patents. In addition, future legislation may impact our competitive position in the event brand-name and follow-on biologics do not receive adequate patent protection. From time to time, we have received invitations to license third-party patents. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

We also rely on trade secrets and know-how that we seek to protect, in part, by using confidentiality agreements. Our policy is to require our officers, employees, consultants, contractors, manufacturers, outside scientific collaborators and sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual&#8217;s relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific limited circumstances. We also require signed confidentiality agreements from companies that receive our confidential data. For employees, consultants and contractors, we require agreements providing that all inventions conceived while rendering services to us shall be assigned to us as our exclusive property. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. Pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and other research organizations are actively engaged in the discovery, research and development of products designed to address prostate cancer and other indications. There are products currently under development by other companies and organizations that could compete with ProscaVax or other products that we are developing. Products such as chemotherapeutics, androgen metabolism or androgen receptor antagonists, endothelin A receptor antagonists, antisense compounds, angiogenesis inhibitors and gene therapies for cancer are also under development by a number of companies and could potentially compete with ProscaVax and our other product candidates. In addition, many universities and private and public research institutes may in the future become active in cancer research, which may be in direct competition with us. Docetaxel (also referred to by its brand name Taxotere) was approved by the FDA for the therapeutic treatment of metastatic, androgen-independent prostate cancer in 2004 and JEVTANA&#174; (cabazitaxel) was approved in 2010 for use in men as a second line therapy following progression after initial treatment with docetaxel. 

&#160; 

In 2011, ZYTIGA&#174; (abiraterone acetate) was approved for use in men with prostate cancer with progression following treatment with a chemotherapeutic regime. In 2012, ZYTIGA was approved, in combination with prednisone, to treat men with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer prior to receiving chemotherapy, and Xtandi (Enzalutamide), an androgen receptor inhibitor, was approved to treat men with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer who previously received docetaxel chemotherapy. In 2013, Xofigo (radium RA 223 dichloride) injection was approved for the treatment of patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), symptomatic bone metastases and no known visceral metastatic disease. Other therapies such as Bavarian Nordic&#8217;s PROSTVAC&#174; are the subject of ongoing clinical trials in men with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer. PROSTVAC&#174;, currently in Phase 3 clinical development, is a therapeutic cancer vaccine being studied in men with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer. 

&#160; 

Our competitors include major pharmaceutical companies. These companies may have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing. In addition, smaller competitors may collaborate with these large established companies to obtain access to their resources. 

&#160; 

Our ability to successfully commercialize ProscaVax and our other potential products, and compete effectively with third parties will depend, in large part, on: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; &#160; the perception of physicians and other healthcare professionals of the safety, efficacy and relative benefits of ProscaVax or our other products compared to those of competing products or therapies; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts in appropriately targeting a resonant clinical message to both oncologists and urologists; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; the willingness of physicians to adopt a new treatment regimen consisting of infusion of an immunotherapy; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; reimbursement policies for ProscaVax or our other product candidates, if developed and approved; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; the price of ProscaVax and that of other products we may develop and commercialize relative to competing products; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; our ability to manufacture ProscaVax and other products we may develop on a cost-effective commercial scale; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; our ability to accurately forecast demand for ProscaVax, and our product candidates if regulatory approvals are achieved; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; our ability to advance our other product candidates through clinical trials and through the FDA approval process and those of non-United States regulatory authorities. &#160; 

Competition among approved marketed products will be based upon, among other things, efficacy, reliability, product safety, price-value analysis, and patent position. Our competitiveness will also depend on our ability to advance our product candidates, license additional technology, maintain a proprietary position in our technologies and products, obtain required government and other approvals on a timely basis, attract and retain key personnel and enter into corporate relationships that enable us and our collaborators to develop effective products that can be manufactured cost-effectively and marketed successfully. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Regulatory 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

Government authorities in the United States and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the preclinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising, promotion, export, marketing and distribution of biologic products. In the United States, the FDA subjects pharmaceutical and biologic products to rigorous review under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act and other federal statutes and regulations. 

&#160; 

FDA Approval Process 

&#160; 

To obtain approval of our product candidates from the FDA, we must, among other requirements, submit data supporting safety and efficacy as well as detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product candidate. In most cases, this entails extensive laboratory tests and preclinical and clinical trials. The collection of these data, as well as the preparation of applications for review by the FDA, are costly in time and effort, and may require significant capital investment. We may encounter significant difficulties or costs in our efforts to obtain FDA approvals that could delay or preclude us from marketing any products we may develop. 

&#160; 

A company typically conducts human clinical trials in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. Phase 1 trials consist of testing of the product in a small number of patients or healthy volunteers, primarily for safety at one or more doses. Phase 1 trials in cancer are often conducted with patients who are not healthy and who have end-stage or metastatic cancer. Phase 2 trials, in addition to safety, evaluate the efficacy of the product in a patient population somewhat larger than Phase 1 trials. Phase 3 trials typically involve additional testing for safety and clinical efficacy in an expanded population at geographically dispersed test sites. Prior to commencement of each clinical trial, a company must submit to the FDA a clinical plan, or &#8220;protocol,&#8221; which must also be approved by the Institutional Review Boards at the institutions participating in the trials. The trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA&#8217;s good clinical practices. The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time. 

&#160; 

To obtain marketing authorization, a company must submit to the FDA the results of the preclinical and clinical testing, together with, and among other things, detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product, in the form of a new drug application or, in the case of a biologic such as ProscaVax, a biologics license application. 

&#160; 

We are also subject to a variety of regulations governing clinical trials and sales of our products outside the United States. Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of conduct of a clinical trial or authorization of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries and regions must be obtained prior to the commencement of marketing the product in those countries. The approval process varies from one regulatory authority to another and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval based on local regulations. In the E.U., Canada and Australia, regulatory requirements and approval processes are similar, in principle, requiring a rigorous assessment of the data to ensure a product has satisfactorily demonstrated an acceptable benefit/risk profile prior to regulatory approval for marketing. 

&#160; 

Fast Track Designation/Priority Review 

&#160; 

Congress enacted the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 (the &#8220;Modernization Act&#8221;) in part to ensure the availability of safe and effective drugs, biologics and medical devices by expediting the development and review for certain new products. The Modernization Act establishes a statutory program for the review of Fast Track products, including biologics. A Fast Track product is defined as a new drug or biologic intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition that demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for this condition. Under the Fast Track program, the sponsor of a new drug or biologic may request that the FDA designate the drug or biologic as a Fast Track product at any time during the development of the product, prior to a new drug application submission. 

&#160; 

Post-Marketing Obligations 

&#160; 

The Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 expanded FDA authority over drug products after approval. All approved drug products are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, sampling and distribution requirements, notifying the FDA and gaining its approval of certain manufacturing or labeling changes, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements, submitting periodic reports to the FDA, maintaining and providing updated safety and efficacy information to the FDA, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. Failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action, criminal prosecution, or civil penalties. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

The FDA may require post-marketing studies or clinical trials to develop additional information regarding the safety of a product. These studies or trials may involve continued testing of a product and development of data, including clinical data, about the product&#8217;s effects in various populations and any side effects associated with long-term use. The FDA may require post-marketing studies or trials to investigate known serious risks or signals of serious risks or identify unexpected serious risks and may require periodic status reports if new safety information develops. Failure to conduct these studies in a timely manner may result in substantial civil fines. 

&#160; 

Drug and biologics manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and to list their products with the FDA. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities in the United States and abroad in order to assure compliance with the applicable cGMP regulations and other requirements. Facilities also are subject to inspections by other federal, foreign, state or local agencies. In complying with the cGMP regulations, manufacturers must continue to assure that the product meets applicable specifications, regulations and other post-marketing requirements. We must ensure that third-party manufacturers continue to ensure full compliance with all applicable regulations and requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements subjects the manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as suspension of manufacturing or recall or seizure of product. 

&#160; 

Also, newly discovered or developed safety or efficacy data may require changes to a product&#8217;s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, additional preclinical or clinical studies, or even in some instances, revocation or withdrawal of the approval. Violations of regulatory requirements at any stage, including after approval, may result in various adverse consequences, including the FDA&#8217;s withdrawal of an approved product from the market, other voluntary or FDA-initiated action that could delay or restrict further marketing, and the imposition of civil fines and criminal penalties against the manufacturer and Biologics License Applications (&#8220;BLA&#8221;) holder. In addition, discovery of previously unknown problems may result in restrictions on the product, manufacturer or BLA holder, including withdrawal of the product from the market. Furthermore, new government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development, or affect the conditions under which approved products are marketed. 

&#160; 

We are also subject to a variety of regulations governing post-marketing obligations for our product in the European Union. As part of the approval process governed by European regulations, a company may be required to complete post marketing commitments as a condition of approval to assess additional information regarding the safety of a product. The EMA may require post-marketing studies to investigate known serious risks or signals of serious risks or identify unexpected serious risks and may require periodic status reports if new safety information develops. Failure to complete post-marketing requirements in a timely manner may result in substantial fines including the risk to continued marketing in the European Union. 

&#160; 

Biosimilars 

&#160; 

The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (&#8220;BPCIA&#8221;) was passed on March 23, 2010 as Title VII to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The law provides for an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that demonstrate biosimilarity to a previously-approved biological product. The BPCIA provides 12 years of exclusivity for innovator biological products. The BPCIA may be applied to our product in the future and could be applied to allow approval of biosimilars to our products. 

&#160; 

Federal Anti-Kickback, False Claims Laws &#38; The Federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act 

&#160; 

In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws are relevant to certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry. These laws include anti-kickback statutes, false claims statutes, and the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act. The federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal health care programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. For example, this statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Violations of the federal anti-kickback statute are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. The federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 and subsequent legislation (collectively, &#8220;PPACA&#8221;), among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback statute. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, PPACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims statutes. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions; however, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that do not fit squarely within an exception or safe harbor may be subject to scrutiny. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Federal false claims laws prohibit, among other things, any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim. For example, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have faced enforcement actions under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, anti-kickback statute violations and certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also implicate false claims laws. Federal false claims laws violations may result in imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary damages and penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback law and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. A number of states have anti-kickback laws that apply regardless of the payer. 

&#160; 

In addition, the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act will require extensive tracking of physician and teaching hospital payments, maintenance of a payments database, and public reporting of the payment data. The Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services (&#8220;CMS&#8221;) recently issued a final rule implementing the Physician Payment Sunshine Act provisions and clarified the scope of the reporting obligations, requiring manufacturers to begin tracking on August 1, 2013 and reporting payment data to CMS by March 31, 2014. Failure to comply with the reporting obligations may result in civil monetary penalties. 

&#160; 

State Laws 

&#160; 

Marketing Restrictions and Disclosure Requirements. A number of states, such as Minnesota, Massachusetts and Vermont, have requirements that restrict pharmaceutical marketing activities. These state requirements limit the types of interactions we may have with healthcare providers licensed in these jurisdictions. In addition, a number of states have laws that require pharmaceutical companies to track and report payments, gifts and other benefits provided to physicians and other health care professionals and entities. Still other state laws mandate implementation of specific compliance policies to regulate interactions with health care professionals. 

&#160; 

State Fraud and Abuse Laws. Several states have enacted state law equivalents of federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws. These state laws may apply to items or services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer. 

&#160; 

State Price Reporting Requirements. Some states, including Texas, New Mexico and Vermont, have enacted state price disclosure requirements that may apply to any drug sold in the state, subject to specific state requirements. 

&#160; 

Healthcare Reform. Certain states, such as Massachusetts, are pursuing their own programs for health reform. These programs may include cost containment measures that could affect state healthcare benefits, particularly for higher priced drugs. Under PPACA, states will have authority to define packages of &#8220;essential health benefits&#8221; that health plans in the individual and small group markets must offer beginning in 2014. The definition of these packages could affect coverage of our products by those plans. 

&#160; 

Sale of Pharmaceutical Products. Many states have enacted their own laws and statutes applicable to the sale of pharmaceutical products within the state, with which we must comply. We are also subject to certain state privacy and data protection laws and regulations. 

&#160; 

Coverage and Reimbursement by Third-Party Payers 

&#160; 

Our sale of ProscaVax is dependent on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, including government healthcare programs and private insurance plans. 

&#160; 

Medicare Part B Coverage and Reimbursement of Drugs and Biologicals 

&#160; 

In the United States, the Medicare program is administered by CMS. Coverage and reimbursement for products and services under Medicare are determined in accordance with the Social Security Act and pursuant to regulations promulgated by CMS, as well as the agency&#8217;s subregulatory coverage and reimbursement determinations. Medicare Part B provides limited coverage of outpatient drugs and biologicals that are furnished &#8220;incident to&#8221; a physician&#8217;s services. Generally, &#8220;incident to&#8221; drugs and biologicals are covered only if they satisfy certain criteria, including that they are of the type that is not usually self-administered by the patient and they are reasonable and necessary for a medically accepted diagnosis or treatment. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Medicare Part B pays providers under a payment methodology using average sales price (&#8220;ASP&#8221;) information. Manufacturers are required to provide ASP information to CMS on a quarterly basis. If a manufacturer is found to have made a misrepresentation in the reporting of ASP, the statute provides for civil monetary penalties of up to $10,000 for each misrepresentation for each day in which the misrepresentation was applied. This information is used to compute Medicare payment rates, updated quarterly based on this ASP information. The Medicare Part B payment methodology for physicians is ASP plus six percent and can change only through legislation. There is a mechanism for comparison of ASP for a product to the widely available market price and the Medicaid Average Manufacturer Price for the product, which could cause further decreases in Medicare payment rates, although this mechanism has yet to be utilized. The statute establishes the payment rate for new drugs and biologicals administered in hospital outpatient departments that are granted &#8220;pass-through status&#8221; at the rate applicable in physicians&#8217; offices (i.e., ASP plus six percent) for two to three years after FDA approval. CMS establishes the payment rates for drugs and biologicals that do not have pass-through status by regulation. 

&#160; 

The methodology under which CMS establishes reimbursement rates is subject to change, particularly because of budgetary pressures facing the Medicare program and the federal government. Beginning April 1, 2013, Medicare payments for all items and services, including drugs and biologicals, will be reduced by up to 2% under the sequestration required by the Budget Control Act of 2011, Pub. L. No. 112-25 (&#8220;BCA&#8221;), as amended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, Pub. L. 112-240 (&#8220;ATRA&#8221;), unless Congress acts to prevent the cuts. The Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 made changes in reimbursement methodology that reduced the Medicare reimbursement rates for many drugs, including oncology therapeutics. In the past year, Congress has considered additional reductions in Medicare reimbursement for drugs as part of legislation to reduce the budget deficit. Similar legislation could be enacted in the future. The Medicare regulations and interpretive determinations that determine how drugs and services are covered and reimbursed also are subject to change. 

&#160; 

Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement Under Medicaid and Other Programs 

&#160; 

In many of the markets in which we may do business in the future, the prices of pharmaceutical products are subject to direct price controls (by law) and to drug reimbursement programs with varying price control mechanisms.

We expect that ProscaVax will be made available to patients that are eligible for Medicaid benefits. A condition of federal funds being made available to cover our products under Medicaid and Medicare Part B is our participation in the Medicaid drug rebate program, established by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, Pub. L. 101-508, and as amended by subsequent legislation, including PPACA. Under the Medicaid drug rebate program, we will pay a rebate to each state Medicaid program for each unit of ProscaVax paid for by those programs. The rebate amount varies by quarter, and is based on pricing data reported by us on a monthly and quarterly basis to CMS. These data include the monthly and quarterly average manufacturer price (&#8220;AMP&#8221;) for our drugs, and in the case of innovator products like ProscaVax, the quarterly best price (the &#8220;QBP&#8221;), which is our lowest price in a quarter to any commercial or non-governmental customer. If we become aware that our reported prices for prior quarters are incorrect or should be changed to reflect late-arriving pricing data, we would be obligated to submit the corrected data for a period not to exceed 12 quarters from the quarter in which the data originally were due. Any corrections to our pricing data could result in an overage or underage in our rebate liability for past quarters, depending on the nature of the correction. 

&#160; 

The availability of federal funds under Medicaid and Medicare Part B to pay for any products that are approved for marketing also is conditioned on our participation in the Public Health Service 340B drug pricing program. The 340B drug pricing program requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily-defined covered entities no more than the 340B &#8220;ceiling price&#8221; for the manufacturer&#8217;s covered outpatient drugs. These covered entities include hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients, as well as a variety of community health clinics and other recipients of health services grant funding. PPACA expanded the 340B program to include certain free standing cancer hospitals, critical access hospitals, rural referral centers and sole community hospitals, each as defined by the Act. The 340B ceiling price for a drug is calculated using a statutory formula that is based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amount for the drug. Any revisions to previously reported Medicaid pricing data also may require revisions to the 340B ceiling prices that were based on those data and could require the issuance of refunds. 

&#160; 

If we make ProscaVax available for purchase by authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule (&#8220;FSS&#8221;) of the General Services Administration pursuant to an FSS contract with the Department of Veterans Affairs (&#8220;VA&#8221;), the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 (&#8220;VHCA&#8221;), would require us to offer deeply discounted FSS contract pricing to four federal agencies commonly referred to as the &#8220;Big Four&#8221; &#8212; the VA, the Department of Defense (&#8220;DoD&#8221;), the Coast Guard and the Public Health Service (including the Indian Health Service) &#8212; for federal funding to be made available for reimbursement of any of our products under the Medicaid program, Medicare Part B and for our products to be eligible to be purchased by those four federal agencies and certain federal grantees. FSS pricing to those four federal agencies must be equal to or less than the federal ceiling price (&#8220;FCP&#8221;). The FCP is based on a weighted average wholesaler price known as the non-federal average manufacturer price (&#8220;Non-FAMP&#8221;). We are required to report Non-FAMP to the VA on a quarterly and annual basis. If we misstate Non-FAMP or FCP, we must restate these figures. In addition, if we are found to have knowingly submitted false information to the government, the VHCA provides for civil monetary penalties of $100,000 per item of false information in addition to other penalties the government may impose. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

The FSS contract is a federal procurement contract that includes standard government terms and conditions and extensive disclosure and certification requirements. All items on FSS contracts are subject to a standard FSS contract clause that requires FSS contract price reductions under certain circumstances where pricing is reduced to an agreed &#8220;tracking customer.&#8221; Further, in addition to the &#8220;Big Four&#8221; agencies, all other federal agencies and some non-federal entities are authorized to access FSS contracts. If we overcharge the government in connection with our FSS contract, whether due to a misstated FCP or otherwise, we would be required to refund the difference to the government. 

&#160; 

Data Privacy 

&#160; 

Numerous federal and state laws, including state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use and disclosure of personal information. Other countries also have, or are developing, laws governing the collection, use and transmission of personal information. In addition, most healthcare providers who prescribe our product and from whom we obtain patient health information are subject to privacy and security requirements under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (&#8220;HIPAA&#8221;). We are not a HIPAA covered entity, and we do not operate as a business associate to any covered entities. Therefore, these privacy and security requirements do not apply to us. However, we could be subject to criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain individually identifiable health information from a covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA or for aiding and abetting the violation of HIPAA. We are unable to predict whether our actions could be subject to prosecution in the event of an impermissible disclosure of health information to us. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing amount of focus on privacy and data protection issues with the potential to affect our business, including recently enacted laws in a majority of states requiring security breach notification. These laws could create liability for us or increase our cost of doing business.

European Regulatory Authorities for Reimbursement 

&#160; 

In the European Union, national governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of such products to consumers. The approach taken varies from member state to member state. Some jurisdictions operate positive and/or negative list systems under which products may be marketed only once a reimbursement price has been agreed. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products, as exemplified by the role of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence in the United Kingdom, which evaluates the data supporting new medicines and passes reimbursement recommendations to the government. In addition, in some countries cross-border imports from low-priced markets (parallel imports) exert commercial pressure on pricing within a country.

Environmental and Safety Laws 

&#160; 

We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local regulations relating to the use, handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials, including chemicals and radioactive and biological materials. Our operations produce such hazardous waste products. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with the standards prescribed by federal, state and local regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of such substances, and store our low level radioactive waste at our facilities until the materials are no longer considered radioactive. We are also subject to various laws and regulations governing laboratory practices and the experimental use of animals. 

&#160; 

We are also subject to regulation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (&#8220;OSHA&#8221;), and the Environmental Protection Agency (the &#8220;EPA&#8221;), and to regulation under the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other regulatory statutes, and may in the future be subject to other federal, state or local regulations. OSHA and/or the EPA may promulgate regulations that may affect our research and development programs.
