End Markets

We primarily operate in two end markets: the advanced industrial market and the medical market. 

Advanced Industrial Market

For the year ended December 31, 2015, the advanced industrial market accounted for approximately 60% of the Company&#8217;s revenue. Revenue from our products sold to the advanced industrial market is affected by a number of factors, including changing technology requirements and preferences of our customers, productivity or quality investments in a manufacturing environment, the financial condition of our customers, changes in regulatory requirements and laws, and general economic conditions. We believe that the Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) on manufacturing activities specific to different regions around the world may provide an indication of the impact of general economic conditions on our sales into the advanced industrial market. 

Medical Market

For the year ended December 31, 2015, the medical market accounted for approximately 40% of the Company&#8217;s revenue. Our revenue from products sold to the medical market is generally affected by hospital and other health care provider capital spending, changes in regulatory requirements and laws, aggregation of purchasing by healthcare networks, trends in surgical procedures, changes in technology requirements, changes in customers or patient preferences, and general demographic trends. 

&#160;

&#160;

Customers 

We have a diverse group of customers that include companies that are global leaders in their industries. Many of our customers participate in several market industries. No customer accounted for greater than 10% of our consolidated revenue during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 or 2013. 

Customers of our Laser Products, Vision Technologies, and Precision Motion segments include a large number of original equipment manufacturers who integrate our products into their systems for sale to end users. We also sell directly to end users. Our customers include leaders in the medical and advanced industrial markets. A typical OEM customer will usually evaluate our products and our ability to provide application knowledge and expertise, post-sales application support and services, supply chain management over long durations, manufacturing capabilities, product quality, global presence, and product customization before deciding to incorporate our products into their products or systems. Customers generally choose suppliers based on a number of factors, including product performance, reliability, application support, price, breadth of the supplier&#8217;s product offerings, the financial condition of the supplier, and the geographical coverage offered by the supplier. Once certain of our products have been designed into a given OEM customer&#8217;s product or system, there are generally significant barriers to subsequent supplier changes, especially in the medical market. 

Seasonality 

While our revenues are not highly seasonal on a consolidated basis, the revenues of some of our individual product lines, particularly our visualization solutions, imaging informatics, and thermal printer products, are impacted by seasonality due to hospital budgeting cycles.

Backlog 

As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, our consolidated backlog was approximately $96.8 million and $82.1 million, respectively. The majority of open orders included in backlog represent open orders for products and services that, based on management&#8217;s projections, have a reasonable probability of being delivered over the subsequent twelve month period. Orders included in backlog may be canceled or rescheduled by customers without significant penalty. Management believes that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects for any of our business segments due to the short lead time required on our products and the ability of customers to reschedule or cancel orders. Therefore, backlog as of any particular date should not be relied upon as indicative of our revenues for any future period. 

Manufacturing 

Manufacturing functions are performed internally when management chooses to maintain control over critical portions of the production process or for cost related reasons while some of the less critical portions are outsourced to third parties. To the extent it makes financial sense, we will consider outsourcing additional portions of the production process. 

Products offered by our Laser Products segment are manufactured at facilities in Bedford, Massachusetts; Mukilteo, Washington; Phoenix, Arizona; Taunton, United Kingdom; and Suzhou, China. Products offered by our Vision Technologies segment are manufactured at facilities in Syracuse, New York; San Jose and Chatsworth, California; Bedford, Massachusetts; and Suzhou, China. Products offered by our Precision Motion segment are primarily manufactured at facilities in Bedford, Massachusetts; Loomis, California; Poole, United Kingdom; and Suzhou, China.

Many of our products are manufactured under ISO 9001 certification, while the majority of our products manufactured for the medical market are manufactured under ISO 13485 certification. Certain visualization solutions, thermal printers and imaging informatics products are manufactured under current good manufacturing practices (CGMP&#8217;s), which is a requirement of their medical device classification by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the &#8220;FDA&#8221;). In addition, certain visualization solutions, thermal printers and imaging informatics products are manufactured under section 510(k) of the FDA.

Research and Development and Engineering 

We incur research and development and engineering expenses as part of our ongoing operations. We are strongly committed to research and development for core technology programs directed at creating new products, product enhancements, increasing our addressable market, and new applications for existing products. We are also committed to funding research into future market opportunities. Our markets have experienced rapid technological changes and product innovations. We believe that continued timely development of new products and product enhancements to serve existing and new markets is necessary for us to remain competitive. Research and development and engineering expenses were $31.0 million, or 8.3% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2015, 

&#160;

&#160;

compared to $29.0 million, or 7.9% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $23.8 million, or 7.5% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2013. 

Marketing, Sales and Distribution 

We sell our products globally, primarily through our direct sales force. Sales to foreign jurisdictions are largely based on a direct sales force, but occasionally sold through distributors, including manufacturers&#8217; representatives, to either augment our selling effort or address a local market where we have no direct sales force. Our local sales, applications, and service teams, and our distributors work closely with our customers to ensure customer satisfaction with our products. We have sales and service centers located in North America, Europe, China, and Japan. 

To support our sales efforts we maintain and continue to invest in a number of applications centers around the world, where our applications experts work closely with customers on integrating and using our solutions in their equipment. The applications span a wide range, with teams residing in several facilities in the United States, Europe and Asia.

Competition 

The markets in which we compete are dynamic and highly competitive. Due to the wide range of our products, we face many different types of competition and competitors. This affects our ability to sell our products and the prices at which these products are sold. Our competitors range from large foreign and domestic organizations, which produce a comprehensive array of goods and services and may have greater financial and other resources than we do, to small firms producing a limited number of goods or services for specialized market segments. 

Competitive factors in our Laser Products, Vision Technologies, and Precision Motion segments include product performance, price, quality and reliability, features, compatibility of products with existing systems, technical support, product breadth, market presence, on-time delivery and our overall reputation. We believe that our products offer a number of competitive advantages. However, some of our competitors are substantially larger and have greater financial and other resources. 

Raw Materials, Components and Supplies 

Each of our businesses uses a wide variety of raw materials, key components and parts that are generally available from alternative sources of supply and in adequate quantities from domestic and foreign sources. In some instances, we design and/or re-engineer the parts and components used in our products. For certain critical raw materials, key components and parts used in the production of some of our principal products, we have identified only a limited number of suppliers or, in some instances, a single source of supply. We also rely on a limited number of independent contractors to manufacture subassemblies for some of our products. 

For a further discussion of the importance and risks associated with our supply chain, see applicable risk factors under Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Patents and Intellectual Property 

We rely upon a combination of copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. We hold a number of registered and pending patents in the United States and other countries. In addition, we also have trademarks registered in the United States and foreign countries. We will continue to actively pursue applications for new patents and trademarks as we deem appropriate. However, there can be no assurance that any other patents will be issued to us or that such patents, if and when issued, will provide any protection or benefit to us. 

Although we believe that our patents and pending patent applications are important, we rely upon several additional factors that are essential to our business success, including: market position, technological innovation, know-how, application knowledge and product performance. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to sustain these advantages. 

We also protect our proprietary rights by controlling access to our proprietary information and by maintaining confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, and certain customers and suppliers. For a further discussion of the importance of risks associated with our intellectual property rights, see applicable risk factors under Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Human Resources 

As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we employed 1,355 and 1,418 employees, respectively, of which zero and 36 employees, respectively, were part of our discontinued businesses.

&#160;

&#160;

Geographic Information 

We are a multinational company with approximately 59% of our 2015 revenue outside the United States and approximately 14% of our property, plant and equipment, net, outside the United States at December 31, 2015. Geographic information is discussed in Note 16 to Consolidated Financial Statements. For a further discussion of the risks associated with our foreign operations, see applicable risk factors under Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Government Regulation 

Our current and contemplated activities and the products and processes that will result from such activities are subject to substantial government regulations, both in the United States and internationally. Most of our production facilities are subject to various federal, state, local, and/or foreign environmental regulations, related to the use, storage, handling, and disposals of regulated materials, chemical, and certain waste products. Such rules are subject to change by the governing agency and we monitor those changes closely. We expect all operations to meet the legal and regulatory environmental requirements. Although we believe that our safety procedures for using, handling, storing and disposing of such materials comply with the standards required by federal and state laws and regulations, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. 

We may face the potential of increasing complexity in our product designs and procurement operations due to the evolving nature of product compliance standards. Those standards may impact the material composition of our products entering specific markets. Such regulations went into effect in the European Union (&#8220;EU&#8221;) in 2006, (The Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (RoHS)) and 2007 (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH)), and China in 2007 (Management Methods for Controlling Pollution Caused by Electronic Information Products Regulation (China-RoHS)).

United States Food and Drug Administration 

Certain products manufactured by us are integrated into systems by our customers that are subject to certain regulations administered by the United States Food and Drug Administration. We must comply with certain quality control measurements in order for our products to be effectively used in our customers&#8217; end products. Non-compliance with quality control measurements could result in loss of business with our customers, fines and penalties. 

We are subject to certain medical device regulations. Medical devices are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the Food and Drug Administration and by other federal, state and local authorities. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and related regulations govern the conditions of safety, efficacy, clearance, approval, manufacturing, quality system requirements, labeling, packaging, distribution, storage, record keeping, reporting, marketing, advertising, and promotion of products. Non-compliance with applicable requirements can result in, among other things, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, refusal by the government to grant premarket clearance or approval of products, withdrawal of clearances and approvals, and criminal prosecution.
