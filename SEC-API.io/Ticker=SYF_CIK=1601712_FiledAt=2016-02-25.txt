 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Our Company 

____________________________________________________________________________________________ 

We are one of the premier consumer financial services companies in the United States. Our roots in consumer finance trace back to 1932, and today we are the largest provider of private label credit cards in the United States based on purchase volume and receivables. We provide a range of credit products through programs we have established with a diverse group of national and regional retailers, local merchants, manufacturers, buying groups, industry associations and healthcare service providers, which we refer to as our &#8220;partners.&#8221; Through our partners&#8217; over 350,000 &#32;locations across the United States and Canada, and their websites and mobile applications, we offer their customers a variety of credit products to finance the purchase of goods and services. During 2015 , we financed $113.6 billion &#32;of purchase volume, and at December 31, 2015 , we had $68.3 billion &#32;of loan receivables and 68.3 million &#32;active accounts. Our active accounts represent a geographically diverse group of both consumers and businesses, with an average FICO score of 715 &#32;for consumer active accounts at December 31, 2015 . For the years ended December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , we had net earnings of $2.2 billion &#32;and $2.1 billion , respectively, representing a return on assets of 2.9% &#32;and 3.2% , respectively. 

Our business benefits from longstanding and collaborative relationships with our partners, including some of the nation&#8217;s leading retailers and manufacturers with well-known consumer brands, such as Lowe&#8217;s, Walmart, Amazon and Ethan Allen. We believe our partner-centric business model has been successful because it aligns our interests with those of our partners and provides substantial value to both our partners and our customers. Our partners promote our credit products because they generate increased sales and strengthen customer loyalty. Our customers benefit from instant access to credit, discounts and promotional offers. We seek to differentiate ourselves through deep partner integration and our extensive marketing expertise. We have omni-channel (in-store, online and mobile) technology and marketing capabilities, which allow us to offer and deliver our credit products instantly to customers across multiple channels. For example, the purchase volume in our Retail Card platform from our online and mobile channels increased by 21% &#32;in 2015 . 

We conduct our operations through a single business segment. Our revenue activities are managed through three sales platforms: Retail Card, Payment Solutions and CareCredit. Retail Card is a leading provider of private label credit cards, and also provides Dual Cards and small- and medium-sized business credit products. Payment Solutions is a leading provider of promotional financing for major consumer purchases, offering primarily private label credit cards and installment loans. CareCredit is a leading provider of promotional financing to consumers for elective healthcare procedures or services, such as dental, veterinary, cosmetic, vision and audiology. 

We offer our credit products primarily through our wholly-owned subsidiary, the Bank. Through the Bank, we offer, directly to retail and commercial customers, a range of deposit products insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;), including certificates of deposit, individual retirement accounts (&#8220;IRAs&#8221;), money market accounts and savings accounts. We also take deposits at the Bank through third-party securities brokerage firms that offer our FDIC-insured deposit products to their customers. We have expanded and continue to expand our online direct banking operations to increase our deposit base as a source of stable and diversified low cost funding for our credit activities. We had $43.4 billion &#32;in deposits at December 31, 2015 . 

Formation and Regulation of Synchrony 

____________________________________________________________________________________________ 

Synchrony is a holding company for the legal entities that historically conducted GE&#8217;s North American retail finance business. Synchrony was incorporated in Delaware on September 12, 2003, but prior to April 1, 2013 conducted no business. During the period from April 1, 2013 to September 30, 2013, as part of a regulatory restructuring, substantially all of the assets and operations of GE&#8217;s North American retail finance business, including the Bank, were transferred to Synchrony. The remaining assets and operations of that business subsequently were transferred to Synchrony in connection with our initial public offering (the &#8220;IPO&#8221;), which closed in 2014. Following the IPO, GE owned approximately 84.6% of our common stock. 

On October 14, 2015, we received approval from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve Board") to become a stand-alone savings and loan holding company, to retain control of the Bank and to retain control of our nonbank subsidiaries following the completion of GE&#8217;s offer to exchange shares of GE common stock for all of our shares of our common stock owned by GE (the &#8220;exchange offer&#8221;). On November 17, 2015, we announced the completion of the exchange offer and our separation from GE (the "Separation"). Following the Separation, GE no longer owns any of our outstanding common stock. 

As a savings and loan holding company, the Company is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve Board. In addition, as a large provider of consumer financial services, the Company is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the CFPB. 

The Bank is a federally chartered savings association and therefore is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency of the U.S. Treasury (the &#8220;OCC&#8221;), which is its primary regulator, and by the CFPB. In addition, the Bank, as an insured depository institution, is supervised by the FDIC. 

For a discussion of the regulation of the Company and the Bank, see &#8220; &#8212;Regulation .&#8221; For information regarding certain regulatory matters, including consent orders or assurances of discontinuances that we have entered into with the CFPB, the Department of Justice (the &#8220;DOJ&#8221;) and the Attorney General for the State of New York relating to our CareCredit platform, our debt cancellation product and sales practices and certain collection offers, see &#8220; &#8212;Regulation&#8212;Consumer Financial Services Regulation &#8221; and &#8220; Item 1A. &#32; Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Relating to Regulation&#8212;Changes to our methods of offering our CareCredit products could materially impact operating results .&#8221;

Retail Card 

Retail Card is a leading provider of private label credit cards, and also provides Dual Cards and small and medium-sized business credit products. Retail Card accounted for $7.4 billion , or 69% &#32;of our total platform revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 . Substantially all of the credit extended in this platform is on standard (i.e., non-promotional) terms. 

Retail Card&#8217;s platform revenue consists of interest and fees on our loan receivables, plus other income, less retailer share arrangements. Other income primarily consists of interchange fees earned on Dual Card transactions (when the card is used outside of our partners&#8217; sales channels) and fees paid to us by customers who purchase our debt cancellation products, less loyalty program payments. 

Retail Card Partners 

We have ongoing Retail Card programs with 22 &#32;national and regional retailers, which have approximately 40,000 &#32;retail locations and include department stores, specialty retailers, mass merchandisers, e-retailers (multi-channel and online retailers) and oil and gas retailers. The average length of our relationship with our ongoing Retail Card partners is 17 &#32;years. 

&#32;

During the year ended December 31, 2015 , we added the following new Retail Card partners: 

&#8226; 

BP (program commenced May 2015) 

&#8226; 

Stash Hotels (program commenced October 2015) 

&#8226; 

Citgo (program expected to commence in the first quarter of 2016) 

We also extended our program agreements with Amazon, Chevron, Dick's Sporting Goods and PayPal during the year ended December 31, 2015. Program agreements accounting for nearly 90% &#32;of Retail Card platform revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 currently have an expiration date in 2019 or beyond. Set forth below is certain information regarding the current scheduled expiration dates of our ongoing 22 Retail Card partner programs:

(2) 

Excludes certain credit card portfolios that were sold or have not been renewed which represented 1% of our total Retail Card platform revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Our five largest programs are with Retail Card partners: Gap, JCPenney, Lowe&#8217;s, Sam&#8217;s Club and Walmart. These programs accounted in aggregate for 49% of our total platform revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 51% &#32;of loan receivables at December 31, 2015. Our programs with JCPenney and Walmart each accounted for more than 10% of our total platform revenue and JCPenney, Lowe's and Walmart each accounted for more than 10% of our total platform interest and fees and other income, in each case for the year ended December 31, 2015. Sam&#8217;s Club is a subsidiary of Walmart that is a separate contracting entity with its own program agreement with us, which we report separately from the Walmart program. For purposes of the information provided in this paragraph with respect to Walmart, the platform revenue and interest and fees and other income from the Sam's Club program have not been included. 

The length of our relationship with each of these five Retail Card partners is over 16 years, and in the case of Lowe's, 37 years. All of these program agreements have been renewed in recent years and expire in 2019 or beyond. 

Retail Card Program Agreements 

Our Retail Card programs are governed by program agreements that are each negotiated separately with our partners. Although the terms of the agreements are partner-specific, and may be amended from time to time, under a typical program agreement our partner agrees to support and promote the program to its customers, but we control credit criteria and issue credit cards to customers who qualify under those criteria. We generally own the underlying accounts and all loan receivables generated under the program from the time of origination. Other key provisions in the Retail Card program agreements include: 

Term 

Retail Card program agreements typically have contract terms ranging from approximately five to ten years. Many program agreements have renewal clauses that provide for automatic renewal for one or more years until terminated by us or our partner. We typically seek to renew the program agreements well in advance of their termination dates. 

Exclusivity 

The program agreements typically are exclusive for the products we offer and limit our partners&#8217; ability to originate or promote other private label or co-branded credit cards during the term of the agreement. 

Retailer share arrangements 

Most of our Retail Card program agreements contain retailer share arrangements that provide for payments to our partner if the economic performance of the program exceeds a contractually-defined threshold. Economic performance for the purposes of these arrangements is typically measured based on agreed upon program revenues (including interest income and certain other income) less agreed upon program expenses (including interest expense, provision for loan losses, retailer payments and operating expenses). We may also provide additional economic benefits to our partners such as a signing bonus, royalties on purchase volume or payments for new accounts. All of these arrangements align our interests and provide an additional incentive to our partners to promote our credit products. 

Other economic terms 

In addition to the retailer share arrangements, the program agreements typically provide that the parties will develop a marketing plan to support the program, and they set the terms by which a joint marketing budget is funded, the basic terms of the rewards program linked to the use of our product (such as opportunities to receive double rewards points for purchases made on a Retail Card product), and the allocation of costs related to the rewards program. 

Termination 

The program agreements set forth the circumstances in which a party may terminate the agreement prior to expiration. Our program agreements generally permit us and our partner to terminate the agreement prior to its scheduled termination date for various reasons, including if the other party materially breaches its obligations. Some program agreements also permit our partner to terminate the program if we fail to meet certain service levels or change certain key cardholder terms or our credit criteria, we fail to achieve certain approval rate targets with respect to approvals of new customers, we elect not to increase the program size when the outstanding loan receivables under the program reach certain thresholds, or we are not adequately capitalized, or if certain force majeure events occur or certain changes in our ownership occur. Certain of these program agreements are also subject to early termination by a party if the other party has a material adverse change in its financial condition. Historically, these rights have not typically been triggered or exercised. Some of our program agreements provide that, upon termination or expiration, our partner may purchase or designate a third party to purchase the accounts and loan receivables generated with respect to its program at fair market value or a stated price, including all related customer data. 

Payment Solutions 

Payment Solutions is a leading provider of promotional financing for major consumer purchases, offering private label credit cards and installment loans. Payment Solutions accounted for $1.7 billion , or 15% , of our total platform revenue for year ended December 31, 2015 . Substantially all of the credit extended in Payment Solutions is promotional financing. 

Payment Solutions&#8217; platform revenue primarily consists of interest and fees on our loan receivables, including &#8220;merchant discounts,&#8221; which are fees paid to us by our partners in almost all cases to compensate us for all or part of the foregone interest income associated with promotional financing. The types of promotional financing we offer include: deferred interest (interest accrues during a promotional period and becomes payable if the full purchase amount is not paid off during the promotional period), no interest (no interest on a promotional purchase) and reduced interest (interest is assessed monthly at a promotional interest rate during the promotional period). As a result, during the promotional period we do not generate interest income or generate it at a lower rate, although we continue to generate fee income relating to late fees on required minimum payments. 

Payment Solutions Partners 

In Payment Solutions, we create customized credit programs for national and regional retailers, manufacturers, buying groups, industry associations and our own individually-branded industry programs, which are available to participating merchants, dealers and retail outlets to provide financing offers to their customers. 

At December 31, 2015 , our Payment Solutions partners had approximately 115,000 &#32;retail locations. Payment Solutions is diversified by program, with no one Payment Solutions program accounting for more than 1.2% of our total platform revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015. At December 31, the average length of our relationships with our ten largest Payment Solutions programs was 11 years.

Based on platform revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

In Payment Solutions, we generally partner with sellers of &#8220;big-ticket&#8221; products or services (generally priced from $500 to $25,000) to consumers where our financing products provide strong incremental value to our partners and their customers. We also promote all of our programs through direct marketing activities such as industry trade publications, trade shows and sales efforts by dedicated internal and external sales teams, leveraging our existing partner network or through endorsements from manufacturers, buying groups and industry associations. Our broad array of point of sale technologies and quick enrollment process allow us to quickly and cost-effectively integrate new partners. 

During the year ended December 31, 2015, we added the following key Payment Solutions programs: 

&#8226; 

Guitar Center (program commenced third quarter of 2015) 

&#8226; 

Mattress Firm (program expected to commence second quarter of 2016) 

&#8226; 

Newegg (program commenced fourth quarter of 2015) 

&#8226; 

The Container Store (program expected to commence in the second quarter of 2016) 

We also extended our program agreements associated with some of our key partner relationships, including Discount Tire, Sleepy&#8217;s, P.C. Richard &#38; Son, Conn's, Polaris Industries, Mohawk Flooring, Art Van Furniture and MEGA Group USA during the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Payment Solutions Program Agreements 

National and Regional Retailers and Manufacturers 

The terms of our program agreements with national and regional retailers and manufacturers are typically similar to the terms of our Retail Card program agreements in that we are the exclusive program provider of financing for the national or regional retailer or manufacturer with respect to the financing products that we offer. Some program agreements, however, allow the merchant to use a second source lender after an application has been submitted to us and declined. The term of the program agreements generally run from three to five years and are subject to termination prior to the scheduled termination date by us or our partner for various reasons, including if the other party materially breaches its obligations. Some of these programs also permit our partner to terminate the program if we change certain key cardholder terms, elect not to increase the program size when the outstanding loan receivables under the program reach certain thresholds, certain force majeure events occur, certain changes in our ownership occur, or there is a material adverse change in our financial condition. A few of these programs also may be terminated at will by the partner on specified notice to us (e.g., several months). Many of these program agreements have renewal clauses which allow the program agreement to be renewed for successive one or more year terms until terminated by us or our partner. We typically negotiate with program participants to renew the program agreements well in advance of their termination dates. 

We control credit criteria and issue credit cards or provide installment loans to customers who qualify under those credit criteria. We own the underlying accounts and all loan receivables generated under the program from the time of origination. Our Payment Solutions program agreements set forth the program&#8217;s economic terms, including the merchant discount applicable to each promotional finance offering. We typically do not pay fees to our Payment Solutions partners pursuant to any retailer share arrangements, but in some cases we pay a sign-up fee to a partner or provide volume-based rebates on the merchant discount paid by the partner. In addition to the credit programs, we also process general purpose card transactions for some merchants and dealers under programs with manufacturers as their acquiring bank within most of the credit card network associations, for which we receive an interchange fee. 

Buying Groups and Industry Associations 

The programs we have established with buying groups and industry associations, such as the North American Home Furnishings Association, Jewelers of America and MEGA Group USA, are governed by program agreements under which we make our credit products available to their respective members or dealers, but these agreements generally do not require the members or dealers to offer our products to their customers. Under the terms of the program agreements, buying groups and industry associations generally agree to support and promote the respective programs. These arrangements may include sign-up fees and volume-based incentives paid by us to the groups and their members. 

Individually-Branded Programs 

Our individually-branded programs are focused on specific industries, where we create either company-branded or company and partner-branded private label credit cards that are usable across all participating locations within the industry-specific network. For example, our CarCareONE program, comprised of merchants selling automotive parts, repair services and tires, covers over 23,000 &#32;locations across the United States, and cards issued may be dual branded with CarCareONE and partners such as Midas, Michelin Tires or Pep Boys. Under the terms of these programs, we establish merchant discounts applicable to each financing offer, and, in some cases, the fees we charge partners for their membership in the network. 

Dealer Agreements 

For the programs we have established with manufacturers, buying groups, industry associations and individually-branded programs described above, we enter into individual agreements with the merchants and dealers that offer our credit products under these programs. These agreements generally are not exclusive and some parties who offer our financing products also offer financing from our competitors. Our agreements generally continue until terminated by either party, with termination typically available to either party at will on 15 days&#8217; written notice. Our dealer agreements set forth the economic terms associated with the program, including the fees charged to dealers to offer promotional financing, and in some cases allow us to periodically change the fees we charge. 

CareCredit 

CareCredit is a leading provider of promotional financing to consumers for elective healthcare procedures, products or services, such as dental, veterinary, cosmetic, vision and audiology. CareCredit accounted for $1.7 billion , or 16% , of our total platform revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 . Substantially all of the credit extended in CareCredit is promotional financing. 

We offer customers a CareCredit-branded private label credit card that may be used across our network of CareCredit providers. We generate revenue in CareCredit primarily from interest and fees on our credit products and from merchant discounts provided by partners to compensate us for all or part of the cost of this promotional financing. We also process general purpose card transactions for some providers as their acquiring bank within most of the credit card network associations, for which we obtain an interchange fee. 

CareCredit Partners 

The vast majority of our partners are individual and small groups of independent healthcare providers, which includes networks of healthcare practitioners that provide elective procedures that generally are not covered by insurance. The remainder are primarily national and regional healthcare providers. 

&#32; 

During 2015 , over 165,000 &#32;healthcare provider locations either processed a CareCredit application or made a sale on a CareCredit credit card. No one CareCredit partner accounted for more than 0.3% &#32;of our total platform revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 . 

We enter into provider agreements with individual healthcare providers who become part of our CareCredit network. These provider agreements are similar to the dealer agreements that govern our relationships with the merchants and dealers offering our Payment Solutions products in that the agreements are not exclusive and typically may be terminated at will on 15 days&#8217; notice. There are typically no retailer share arrangements with partners in CareCredit. 

At December 31, 2015 , we had relationships with over 100 &#32;professional and other associations (including the American Dental Association and the American Animal Hospital Association), manufacturers and buying groups, which endorse and promote our credit products to their members. Of these relationships, over 60 &#32;were paid endorsements linked to member enrollment in, and volume under, the relevant program. 

We screen potential partners using a variety of criteria, including whether the potential provider specializes in one of our approved specialties, carries the appropriate licensing and certifications, and has a strong credit history. We also screen potential partners for reputational issues. We work with professional and other associations, manufacturers, buying groups, industry associations and healthcare consultants to educate their constituents about the products and services we offer. We believe our ability to attract new partners is aided by our customer satisfaction rate, which our research in 2015 &#32;shows is 91% . We also approach individual healthcare service providers through direct mail and advertising, and at trade shows. 

During the year ended December 31, 2015 , we added the following new CareCredit relationships: 

&#8226; 

Launched an endorsement program with VSP Vision Care, a leading vision insurance provider 

&#8226; 

Expanding acceptance of our CareCredit credit card to nearly 4,600 Rite Aid locations across the United States 

Our Customers 

____________________________________________________________________________________________ 

Acquiring and Marketing to Retail Card &#38; Payment Solutions Customers 

We work directly with our partners using their distribution network, communication channels and customer interactions to market our products to their customers and potential customers. We believe our presence at our partners&#8217; points of sale and our ability to make credit decisions instantly for a customer that is already predisposed to make a purchase enables us to acquire new customer accounts at significantly lower costs than general purpose card issuers, who typically market directly to consumers through mass mailings and advertising. 

To acquire new customers, we collaborate with our partners and leverage our marketing expertise to create marketing programs that promote our products for creditworthy customers. Frequently, our partners market the availability of credit as part of (and with little incremental cost to) the advertising for their goods and services. Our marketing programs include marketing offers (e.g., 10% off the customer&#8217;s first purchase) and consumer communications that are delivered through a variety of channels, including in-store signage, online advertising, retailer website placement, associate communication, emails, text messages, direct mail campaigns, advertising circulars, and outside marketing via television, radio and print. We also employ our proprietary Quickscreen and eQuickscreen acquisition methods to make targeted pre-approved credit offers at the point-of-sale both in-store and online. Our Quickscreen and eQuickscreen technology allows us to run customer information that we have obtained from our partners through our risk models in advance so that when these customers seek to make payment for goods and services at our partners in-store or online point of sale, we can make a credit offer instantly, if appropriate. Based on our experience, due to the personalized and immediate nature of the offer, Quickscreen and eQuickscreen significantly outperform traditional direct-to-consumer pre-approved channels, such as direct mail or email, in response rate and dollar spending. 

Acquiring and Marketing to CareCredit Customers 

We market our products through our provider network by training our network providers on the advantages of CareCredit products and by making marketing materials available for providers to use to promote the program and educate customers. Our training helps our providers learn to discuss payment options during the pre-treatment consultation phase, including the option to apply for a CareCredit credit card and the offer of promotional credit. According to a 2015 survey of our CareCredit customers, 49% &#32;indicated that they would have postponed or reduced the scope of treatment if financing was not offered by their provider. Consumers can apply for our CareCredit products in the provider&#8217;s office or online via the web or mobile device. 

We also market our products to potential and existing customers directly through our web-based partner locator, which allows customers to search for healthcare service providers that accept the CareCredit credit card by desired geography and provider type. According to our records, our CareCredit partner locator averaged over 700,000 &#32;hits per month during the year ended December 31, 2015 . We believe our partners recognize the locator as an important source of new customer acquisition. 

Customer Relationship Management ("CRM") / Analytics 

After a customer obtains one of our products, our marketing programs encourage card utilization by continuing to communicate our products&#8217; value propositions (such as, depending on the program, promotional financing offers, cardholder events, product discounts, dollar-off certificates, account holder sales, reward points and offers, new product announcements and previews, and free or reduced cost gift wrapping, alteration or delivery services) through our partners&#8217; distribution channels. 

Through our CRM and data analytics teams, we track cardholder responsiveness to our marketing programs and use this research to target marketing messages and promotional offers to cardholders based on their individual characteristics, such as length of relationship and spending pattern. For example, if a cardholder responds positively to a coupon sent by text message, we will tailor future marketing messages so that they are delivered by text message. Our ability to target marketing messages and promotions is enhanced for Dual Card programs because we receive, collect and analyze data on in-store and all other spending. 

Our extensive marketing activities targeted to existing customers have yielded high levels of re-use across both our Payment Solutions and CareCredit sales platforms. During the year ended December 31, 2015, 27% &#32;and 50% &#32;of purchase volume across our Payment Solutions platform and CareCredit network, respectively, resulted from repeat use at one or more retailers or providers. 

Digital and mobile capabilities 

We continue to develop our digital capabilities to help drive an improved mobile and online experience for our customers. Our mobile applications deliver customized features, including rewards, retail offers, and alerts. We also have enhanced the digital capabilities of our online banking experience, which, among other things, allows customers to access their accounts from any device. 

We continue to expand the use of our credit cards within various mobile wallets in order to further enhance the user experience for our customers. In 2015, as well as enabling our Dual Card products for use in mobile wallets, we provided the capability to offer private label cards through Apple Pay, and enabled the use of our Payment Solutions and CareCredit cards in Samsung Pay. 

Loyalty Programs 

The retail loyalty cards we manage typically provide cardholders with rewards in the form of merchandise discounts that are earned by achieving a pre-set spending level on their private label credit card or Dual Card. The merchandise discounts can be mailed to the cardholder, accessed online, or may be immediately redeemable at the partner&#8217;s store. Other programs provide cash back or reward points, which are redeemable for a variety of products or awards. These loyalty programs are designed to generate incremental purchase volume per customer, while reinforcing the value of the card to the customer and strengthening customer loyalty. In the future, we intend to offer loyalty programs to customers that utilize non-credit payment types such as cash, debit or check. These multi-tender loyalty programs will allow our partners to market to an expanded customer base, and allow us access to additional prospective cardholders. 

Commercial Customers 

In addition to our efforts to acquire consumer cardholders, we are increasing our focus on small to mid-sized commercial customers. We offer these customers private label credit cards and Dual Cards that can be used at our Retail Card partners and are similar to our consumer offerings. We are also increasing our focus on marketing our commercial pay-in-full accounts receivable product that supports a wide range of business customers. 

Our Credit Products

We offer three principal types of credit products: credit cards, commercial credit products and consumer installment loans. We also offer a debt cancellation product.

Credit Cards 

Our credit card products are loans we extend through open-ended revolving credit card accounts. We offer two principal types of credit cards: private label credit cards and Dual Cards. 

Private Label Credit Cards 

Private label credit cards are partner-branded credit cards (e.g., Lowe&#8217;s or Amazon) or program-branded credit cards (e.g., CarCareONE or CareCredit) that are used primarily for the purchase of goods and services from the partner or within the program network. In addition, in some cases, cardholders may be permitted to access their credit card accounts for cash advances. 

Credit under a private label credit card typically is extended either on standard terms only, which means accounts are assessed periodic interest charges using an agreed non-promotional fixed and/or variable interest rate, or pursuant to a promotional financing offer, involving deferred interest, no interest or reduced interest during a set promotional period. Promotional periods typically range between six and 48 months, but we may agree to longer terms with the partner. In almost all cases we receive a merchant discount from our partners to compensate us for all or part of the cost of providing the promotional financing feature. The terms of these promotions vary by partner, but generally the longer the deferred interest, reduced interest or interest-free period, the greater the partner&#8217;s merchant discount. Some offers permit customers to pay for a purchase in equal monthly payments with no interest or at a reduced interest rate, rather than deferring or delaying interest charges. For our deferred interest product, approximately 80% &#32;of customer transactions are typically paid off before interest is assessed. 

In Retail Card, credit under our private label credit cards typically is extended on standard terms only, and in Payment Solutions and CareCredit, credit under our private label credit cards typically is extended pursuant to a promotional financing offer. In CareCredit, standard rate financing generally applies to charges under $200. 

We typically do not charge interchange or other fees to our partners when a customer uses a private label credit card to purchase our partners&#8217; goods and services through our payment system. 

Most of our private label credit card business is in the United States. For some of our partners who have locations in Canada, we also support the issuance and acceptance of private label credit cards at their locations in Canada and from customers in Canada. 

Dual Cards 

Our proprietary Dual Cards are general purpose credit cards that are co-branded with our partner&#8217;s own brand and may be used to make purchases of goods or services from our partner (functioning as a private label credit card), purchases from others wherever cards from those card networks are accepted (functioning as a general purpose credit card) or cash advance transactions. We currently issue Dual Cards for use on the Visa and MasterCard networks and we currently have the ability to issue Dual Cards for use on the American Express and Discover networks. 

We have been granted two U.S. patents relating to the process by which our Dual Cards function as a private label credit card when used to make purchases from our partners and function as a general purpose credit card when used on the systems of other credit card associations. 

Credit extended under our Dual Cards typically is extended on standard terms only. Currently, only Retail Card offers Dual Cards. At December 31, 2015 , we offered Dual Cards through 16 &#32;of our 22 &#32;continuing Retail Card programs. We expect to continue to increase the number of partner programs that offer Dual Cards and seek to increase the portion of our loan receivables attributable to Dual Cards. 

Charges using a Dual Card generate interchange income for us in connection with purchases made by cardholders other than in-store or online from the partner. 

We currently do not issue Dual Cards in Canada. 

Terms and Conditions 

As a general matter, the financial terms and conditions governing our credit card products vary by program and product type and change over time, although we seek to standardize the non-financial provisions consistently across all products. The terms and conditions of our credit card products are governed by a cardholder agreement and applicable laws and regulations. 

We assign each card account a credit limit when the account is initially opened. Thereafter, we may increase or decrease individual credit limits from time to time, at our discretion, based primarily on our evaluation of the customer&#8217;s creditworthiness and ability to pay. 

For the vast majority of accounts, periodic interest charges are calculated using the daily balance method, which results in daily compounding of periodic interest charges, subject to, at times, a grace period on new purchases. Cash advances are not subject to a grace period, and some credit card programs do not provide a grace period for promotional purchases. In addition to periodic interest charges, we may impose other charges and fees on credit card accounts, including, as applicable and provided in the cardholder agreement, cash advance transaction fees and late fees where a customer has not paid at least the minimum payment due by the required due date. 

Typically, each customer with an outstanding debit balance on his or her credit card account must make a minimum payment each month. A customer may pay the total amount due at any time without penalty. We also may enter into arrangements with delinquent customers to extend or otherwise change payment schedules and to waive interest charges and/or fees. 

Commercial Credit Products 

We offer private label cards and co-branded cards for commercial customers that are similar to our consumer offerings. We also offer a commercial pay-in-full accounts receivable product to a wide range of business customers. We offer commercial credit products primarily through our Retail Card platform to the commercial customers of our Retail Card partners. 

Installment Loans 

In Payment Solutions, we originate installment loans to consumers (and a limited number of commercial customers) in the United States, primarily in the power product market. Installment loans are closed-end credit accounts where the customer pays down the outstanding balance in installments. The terms of our installment loans are governed by customer agreements and applicable laws and regulations. 

Installment loans are assessed periodic interest charges using fixed interest rates. In addition to periodic interest charges, we may impose other charges and fees on loan accounts, including late fees where a customer has not made the required payment by the required due date and returned payment fees. 

Debt Cancellation Products 

We offer a debt cancellation product to our credit card customers online and, on a limited basis, by direct mail. Customers who choose to purchase this product are charged a monthly fee based on their ending balance on each billing statement. In return, the Bank will cancel all or a portion of a customer&#8217;s credit card balance in the event of certain qualifying life events. 

Direct Banking 

__________________________________________________________________________________________ 

Through the Bank, we offer our customers a range of FDIC-insured deposit products. The Bank also takes deposits through third-party securities brokerage firms that offer our FDIC-insured deposit products to their customers. At December 31, 2015 , we had $43.4 billion &#32;in deposits, $29.7 billion &#32;of which were direct deposits (which includes deposits from banks and financial institutions) and $13.7 billion &#32;of which were brokered deposits. During 2015, direct deposits were received from approximately 230,000 &#32;customers that had a total of over 400,000 &#32;accounts. Retail customers accounted for 98% &#32;of our direct deposits (by volume) and 99% &#32;of our accounts (by number), and commercial customers accounted for the remainder as of December 31, 2015. The Bank had an 88% &#32;retention rate on certificates of deposit balances up for renewal for the year ended December 31, 2015 . FDIC insurance is provided for our deposit products up to applicable limits. 

We have expanded and continue to expand our online direct banking operations to increase our deposit base as a source of stable and diversified low cost funding for our credit activities. Our online platform is highly scalable allowing us to expand without having to rely on a traditional &#8220;brick and mortar&#8221; branch network. We expect the continued growth in our direct banking platform to come primarily from retail deposits. 

We are growing our direct banking operations and believe we are well-positioned to benefit from the consumer-driven shift from branch banking to direct banking. According to 2014 and 2015 American Bankers Association surveys, the percentage of customers who prefer to do their banking via direct channels (internet, mail, phone and mobile) increased from 54% &#32;to 56% &#32;between 2014 and 2015, while those who prefer branch banking declined from 21% &#32;to 17% &#32;over the same period. 

Our deposit products include certificates of deposit, IRAs, money market accounts and savings accounts. We market our deposit products through multiple channels including digital, print and radio advertising. Customers can apply for, fund, and service their deposit accounts at our branch in Bridgewater, NJ, online or via phone. We have dedicated banking representatives within our call centers to service deposit accounts. 

To attract new deposits and retain existing ones, we intend to introduce new deposit products and enhancements to our existing products. These new and enhanced products may include the introduction of checking accounts, overdraft protection lines of credit, a bill payment account feature and Synchrony-branded debit cards, as well as enhanced small business deposit accounts and expanded affinity offers. Our focus on deposit-taking and related branding efforts will also enable us to offer other branded direct-banking products more efficiently in the future. 

Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (&#8220;FIS&#8221;) currently provides our platform for online retail deposits including a customer-facing servicing platform that customers can access via our marketing site. FIS also provides supplemental back office, IT production and development support for our direct banking operations. 

During 2015, we began the process of transitioning the core banking and deposit services provided by FIS to a replacement vendor, Fiserv. We currently expect our planned transition to our new vendor will be completed in 2016. 

We seek to differentiate our deposit product offerings from our competitors on the basis of brand, reputation, convenience, customer service and value. Our deposit products emphasize reliability, trust, security, convenience and attractive rates. We &#32; offer rewards to customers based on their tenure or balance amounts, including reduced fees, travel offers and concierge telephone support. 

Credit Risk Management 

____________________________________________________________________________________________ 

Credit risk management is a critical component of our management and growth strategy. Credit risk refers to the risk of loss arising from customer default when customers are unable or unwilling to meet their financial obligations to us. Our credit risk arising from consumer credit products is generally highly diversified across over 115 million &#32;open accounts at December 31, 2015 , without significant individual exposures. We manage credit risk primarily according to customer segments and product types. 

Customer Account Acquisition 

We have developed programs to promote credit with each of our partners and have developed varying credit decision guidelines for the different partners. We originate credit accounts through several different channels, including in-store, mail, internet, mobile, telephone and pre-approved solicitations. In addition, we have, and may in the future acquire, accounts that were originated by third parties in connection with establishing programs with new partners. 

Regardless of the channel, in making the initial credit approval decision to open a credit card or other account or otherwise grant credit, we follow a series of credit risk and underwriting procedures. In most cases, when applications are made in-store or by internet or mobile, the process is fully automated and applicants are notified of our credit decision immediately. We generally obtain certain information provided by the applicant and obtain a credit bureau report from one of the major credit bureaus. The credit report information we obtain is electronically transmitted into industry scoring models and our proprietary scoring models developed to calculate a credit score. The risk management team determines in advance the qualifying credit scores and initial credit line assignments for each portfolio and product type. We periodically analyze performance trends of accounts originated at different score levels as compared to projected performance, and adjust the minimum score or the opening credit limit to manage risk. Different scoring models may be used depending upon bureau type and account source. 

We also apply additional application screens based on various inputs, including credit bureau information, to help identify potential fraud and prior bankruptcies before qualifying the application for approval. We compare applicants&#8217; names against the Specially Designated Nationals list maintained by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of the Treasury (&#8220;OFAC&#8221;), as well as screens that account for adherence to USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the &#8220;Patriot Act&#8221;) and Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (the &#8220;CARD Act&#8221;) requirements, including ability to pay requirements. 

We occasionally use pre-approved account solicitations for certain programs. Potential applicants are pre-screened using information provided by our partner or obtained from outside lists, and qualified individuals receive a pre-approved credit offer by mail or email. 

Acquired Portfolio Evaluation 

Our risk management team evaluates each portfolio that we acquire in connection with establishing programs with new partners to ensure the portfolio satisfies our credit risk guidelines. As part of this review, we receive data on the third-party accounts and loans, which allows us to assess the portfolio on the basis of certain core characteristics, such as historical performance of the assets and distributions of credit and loss information. In addition, we benchmark potential portfolio acquisitions against our existing programs to assess relative current and projected risks. Finally, our risk management team must approve the acquisition, taking into account the results of our risk assessment process. Once assets are migrated to our systems, our account management protocols will apply immediately as described below under &#8220; &#8212;Customer Account Management ,&#8221; &#8220; &#8212;Credit Authorizations of Individual Transactions &#8221; and &#8220; &#8212;Collections .&#8221; 

Customer Account Management 

We regularly assess the credit risk exposure of our customer accounts. This ongoing assessment includes information relating to the customer&#8217;s performance with respect to its account with us, as well as information from credit bureaus relating to the customer&#8217;s broader credit performance. To monitor and control the quality of our loan portfolio (including the portion of the portfolio originated by third parties), we use behavioral scoring models that we have developed to score each active account on its monthly cycle date. Proprietary risk models, together with the FICO scores obtained on each active account no less than quarterly, are an integral part of our credit decision-making process. Depending on the duration of the customer&#8217;s account, risk profile and other performance metrics, the account may be subject to a range of account actions, including limits on transaction authorization and increases or decreases in purchase and cash credit limits. 

Credit Authorizations of Individual Transactions 

Once an account has been opened, when a credit card is used to make a purchase in-store at one of our partners&#8217; locations or online, point-of-sale terminals or online sites have an online connection with our credit authorization system, which allows for real-time updating of accounts. Each potential sales transaction is passed through a transaction authorization system, which takes into account a variety of behavior and risk factors to determine whether the transaction should be approved or declined, and whether a credit limit adjustment is warranted. 

Fraud Investigation 

We provide follow up and research with respect to different types of fraud such as fraud rings, new account fraud and transactional fraud. We have developed a proprietary fraud model to identify new account fraud and deployed tools that help identify transaction purchase behavior outside a customer&#8217;s established pattern. Our proprietary model is also complemented by externally sourced models and tools used across the industry to better identify fraud and protect our customers. We also are continuously implementing new and improved technologies to detect and prevent fraud. In 2015, we reissued all active Dual Card products (Visa and MasterCards that were active at the time when the portfolio was reissued) with new plastics that utilize embedded security chips ("EMV") chip cards with all of our retail partners. 

Collections 

All monthly billing statements of accounts with past due amounts include a request for payment of these amounts. Collections personnel generally initiate contact with customers within 30 days after any portion of their balance becomes past due. The nature and the timing of the initial contact, typically a personal call, e-mail, text message or letter, are determined by a review of the customer&#8217;s prior account activity and payment habits. 

We re-evaluate our collection efforts and consider the implementation of other techniques, including internal collection activities and use of external vendors, as a customer becomes increasingly delinquent. We limit our exposure to delinquencies through controls within the transaction authorization processes, the imposition of credit limits and criteria-based account suspension and revocation processes. In certain situations, we may enter into arrangements to extend or otherwise change payment schedules, decrease interest rates and/or waive fees to aid customers experiencing financial difficulties in their efforts to become current on their obligations to us. 

Customer Service 

____________________________________________________________________________________________ 

Customer service is an important feature of our relationship with our partners. Our customers can contact us via phone, mail, email, eService and eChat. During the year ended December 31, 2015 , we handled approximately 230 million &#32;calls. 

We assign a dedicated toll-free customer service phone number to each of our Retail Card programs. Our Payment Solutions customers access customer service through one general purpose toll-free customer service phone number (except for a few large Payment Solutions programs, which have dedicated toll-free numbers). Our CareCredit platform has its own, dedicated toll-free customer service phone number. We also have dedicated toll-free customer service phone numbers for our deposit business. 

We service all programs through our thirteen domestic and two off-shore call centers. We also provide phone-based customer service through a third-party vendor. Our off-shore facilities are located in Hyderabad, India and Manila, Philippines. We blend domestic and off-shore locations and seek optimal cost as an important part of our servicing strategy. Customer service for cards issued to customers in Canada is supported through agents based in the United States. 

Given the nature of our business and the high volume of calls, we maintain several centers of excellence to ensure the quality of our customer service across all of our sites. These centers of excellence consist of quality assurance, customer experience, training, workforce and capacity planning, surveillance and process control, tactical operations center, business solutions and technology support. 

Production Services 

____________________________________________________________________________________________ 

Our production services organization oversees a number of services, including: 

&#8226; 

payment processing (more than 500 million &#32;paper and electronic payments in 2015 ); 

&#8226; 

embossing and mailing credit cards (approximately 65 million &#32;cards in 2015 ); 

&#8226; 

printing and mailing and eService delivery of credit card statements (more than 670 million &#32;paper and electronic statements in 2015 ); and 

&#8226; 

other letters mailed or sent electronically (approximately 75 million &#32;in 2015 ). 

All United States customer payments received by mail are processed at one of two centers located in Atlanta, Georgia and Longwood, Florida, both of which are operated by the Bank. United States credit card statement printing and mailing, card embossing and mailing and letter production and mailing for customers are provided through outsourced services with First Data Corporation (&#8220;First Data&#8221;). While these services are outsourced, we monitor and maintain oversight of these other services. First Data also produces our statements and other mailings for deposit customers. 

Card production embossing, mailing, statement printing and mailing services related to cards issued to customers in Canada are outsourced to Canadian suppliers. 

Technology and Data Security 

____________________________________________________________________________________________ 

Products and Services 

We leverage information technology and deliver products and services that meet the needs of our partners and enable us to operate our business efficiently. The integration of our technology with our partners is at the core of our value proposition, enabling, among other things, customers to &#8220;apply and buy&#8221; at the point of sale, and many of our partners to settle transactions directly with us without an interchange fee. A key part of our strategic focus is the continued development of innovative, efficient, flexible technology and operational platforms to support marketing, risk management, account acquisition and account management, customer service, and new product development. We believe that the continued investment in and development of these platforms is an important part of our efforts to increase our competitive capabilities, reduce costs, improve quality and provide faster, more flexible technology services. Consequently, we continuously review capabilities and develop or acquire systems, processes and competencies to meet our business needs. 

As part of our continuous efforts to enhance our technologies, we may either develop these capabilities internally or in partnership with third-party providers. We rely on third-party providers to help us deliver systems and operational infrastructure based on strategies and, in some cases, architecture, designed by us. These relationships include: First Data for our credit card transaction processing and production and FIS (Fiserv in 2016) for retail banking. 

Data Security 

The protection and security of financial and personal information of our consumers is one of our highest priorities. We have implemented a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative, technical and physical safeguards and provides an appropriate level of protection to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our Company's and our customers' information. This includes protecting against any known or evolving threats to the security or integrity of customer records and information, and against unauthorized access to or use of customer records or information. 

Our information security program is intelligence-led, focused on continuously adapting to an evolving landscape of emerging threats and available technology. Through data gathering and evaluation of emerging threats from internal and external incidents and technology investment, security controls are adjusted on a continuous basis. We work directly with our partners on an ongoing basis to expand our intelligence ecosystem and facilitate awareness and communications of events outside of the Company. 

We have developed a security strategy and implemented multiple layers of controls embedded throughout our technology environment that establish multiple control points between threats and our assets. Our security program is designed to provide oversight of third parties who store, process or have access to sensitive data, and we require the same level of protection of such third-party service providers. We evaluate the effectiveness of the key security controls through ongoing assessment and measurement. 

In addition, we identify risks that may threaten customer information and perform a variety of vulnerability and penetration testing on the platforms, systems and applications used to provide our products and services. We employ backup and disaster recovery procedures for all the systems that are used for storing, processing and transferring customer information, and we periodically test and validate our disaster recovery plans. We are compliant with the Payment Card Industry (PCI) program. 

In connection with the Separation, we have completed the migration of the majority of the transitional services relating to technology and business processes provided by GE. The exit of these remaining services includes the migration of very limited portions of our technology operating environment. As a stand-alone company, our corporate infrastructure is more focused and simplified, creating greater security and resiliency for our clients, partners and customers. 

Competition 

____________________________________________________________________________________________ 

Our industry is highly competitive and is becoming more competitive. We compete for relationships with partners in connection with retaining existing or establishing new consumer credit programs. Our primary competitors for partners include major financial institutions such as Alliance Data, American Express, Capital One, Chase, Citibank, TD Bank and Wells Fargo, and to a lesser extent, potential partners&#8217; own in-house financing capabilities. We compete for partners on the basis of a number of factors, including program financial and other terms, underwriting standards, marketing expertise, service levels, product and service offerings (including incentive and loyalty programs), technological capabilities and integration, brand and reputation. In addition, some of our competitors for partners have a business model that allows for their partners to manage underwriting (e.g., new account approval), customer service and collections, and other core banking responsibilities that we retain. 

We also compete for customer usage of our products. Consumer credit provided, and credit card payments made, using our cards constitute only a small percentage of overall consumer credit provided and credit card payments in the United States. Consumers have numerous financing and payment options available to them. As a form of payment, our products compete with cash, checks, debit cards, Visa and MasterCard credit cards, as well as American Express, Discover Card, other private-label card brands, and, to a certain extent, prepaid cards. We also compete with non-traditional providers such as PayPal. In the future, we expect our products may face increased competition from new emerging payment technologies, such as Apple Pay and Square, as well as a consortia of merchants that are expected to combine payment systems to reduce interchange and other costs (e.g., CurrentC), to the extent that our products are not accepted in, or compatible with, such technologies. We may also face increased competition from current competitors or others who introduce or embrace disruptive technology that significantly changes the consumer credit and payment industry. We compete for customers and their usage of our products, and to minimize transfers to competitors of our customers&#8217; outstanding balances, based on a number of factors, including pricing (interest rates and fees), product offerings, credit limits, incentives (including loyalty programs) and customer service. Some of our competitors provide a broader selection of services, including home and automobile loans, debit cards and bank branch ATM access, which may position them better among customers who prefer to use a single financial institution to meet all of their financial needs. In addition, some of our competitors are substantially larger than we are, may have substantially greater resources than we do or may offer a broader range of products and services than we do. Moreover, some of our competitors, including new and emerging competitors in the digital and mobile payments space, are not subject to the same regulatory requirements or legislative scrutiny to which we are subject, which also could place us at a competitive disadvantage. 

In our retail deposits business, we have acquisition and servicing capabilities similar to other direct-banking competitors. We compete for deposits with traditional banks, and in seeking to grow our direct-banking business, we compete with other banks that have direct-banking models similar to ours, such as Ally Financial, American Express, Capital One 360 (ING), Discover, Nationwide, Sallie Mae and United Services Automobile Association (&#8220;USAA"). Competition among direct banks is intense because online banking provides customers the ability to quickly and easily deposit and withdraw funds and open and close accounts in favor of products and services offered by competitors. 

Intellectual Property 

____________________________________________________________________________________________ 

We use a variety of methods, such as trademarks, patents, copyrights and trade secrets, to protect our intellectual property, including our new brand, "Synchrony". We also place appropriate restrictions on our proprietary information to control access and prevent unauthorized disclosures. Our brands are important assets, and we take steps to protect the value of these assets and our reputation. 

Employees 

____________________________________________________________________________________________ 

At December 31, 2015 , we had approximately 12,000 &#32;full time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any material employment-related work stoppages and consider relations with our employees to be good. We also have relationships with third-party call center providers in the United States and other countries that provide us with additional contractors for customer service, collections and other functions. 

Risk Management 

____________________________________________________________________________________________ 

Strong risk management is at the core of our business strategy and we have developed processes to manage the major categories of risk we encounter, namely credit, market, liquidity, operational (including compliance) and strategic risk. The following is a description of our overall risk management function. 

As described in greater detail below under &#8220; &#8212;Risk Management Roles and Responsibilities ,&#8221; we manage our enterprise risk using an integrated framework that includes board-level oversight, administration by a group of cross-functional management committees, and day-to-day implementation by a dedicated risk management team led by the Chief Risk Officer (&#8220;CRO&#8221;). The Risk Committee of our board of directors has responsibility for the oversight of our risk management program, and three other board committees have other oversight roles with respect to risk management. Several management committees and subcommittees have important roles and responsibilities in administering our risk management program, including the Enterprise Risk Management Committee (the &#8220;ERMC&#8221;), the Management Committee (the &#8220;MC&#8221;) and the Asset and Liability Management Committee (the &#8220;ALCO&#8221;). This committee-focused governance structure provides a forum through which risk expertise is applied cross-functionally to all major decisions, including development of processes, policies and controls used by the CRO and risk management team to execute our risk management philosophy. 

Our enterprise risk management philosophy is to ensure that all relevant risks in our business activities are appropriately identified, measured, monitored and controlled. Our approach in executing this philosophy focuses on leveraging our strong credit risk culture to drive enterprise risk management using a strong governance framework, a comprehensive enterprise risk assessment program and an effective risk appetite framework. 

Risk Categories 

Our risk management is organized around five major risk categories: credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk and strategic risk. We evaluate the potential impact of a risk event on us (including subsidiaries) by assessing the partner and customer, financial, reputational, and legal and regulatory impacts. 

Credit Risk 

Credit risk is the risk of loss that arises when an obligor fails to meet the terms of an obligation. Credit risk includes exposure to consumer credit risk from customer loans as well as institutional credit risk, principally from our partners. Consumer credit risk is one of the most significant risks that we face. See &#8220; &#8212;Credit Risk Management &#8221; for a description of our customer credit risk management procedures. 

Market Risk 

Market risk is the risk of loss due to changes in external market variables such as interest rates and asset values. Our principal market risk exposures arise from volatility in interest rates and their impact on our economic value, capitalization levels and earnings. Market risk is managed through our ALCO processes, and is subject to policy and risk appetite limits for both earnings at risk and the economic value of equity sensitivity analysis. The ALCO reviews market risk scenario results on a monthly basis, and interest rate risk appetite metrics are reviewed on a quarterly basis by the ERMC and our board of directors. 

Liquidity Risk 

Liquidity risk is the risk that an institution&#8217;s financial condition or overall safety and soundness are adversely affected by a real or perceived inability to meet contractual obligations and support planned growth. Our primary liquidity objective is to maintain a liquidity profile that will enable us, even in times of stress or market disruption, to fund our existing assets and meet all of our liabilities in a timely manner and at an acceptable cost. Policy and risk appetite limits require us and the Bank (and other entities within our business, as applicable) to ensure that sufficient liquid assets are available to survive liquidity stresses over a specified time period. Our risk appetite policies also call for funding diversification, monitoring early warning indicators in the capital markets, and limits on the amounts of certificates of deposit maturities in any one month. Our ALCO reviews liquidity exposures continuously in the context of approved policy and risk appetite limits and reports results quarterly to the ERMC and our board of directors. 

Operational Risk 

Operational risk is the risk of loss arising from inadequate or failed processes, people or systems, external events (i.e. natural disasters) or compliance, reputational or legal matters, and includes any of those risks as they relate directly to us and our subsidiaries, as well as to third parties with whom we contract or otherwise do business. Compliance risk arises from the failure to adhere to applicable laws, rules, regulations and internal policies and procedures. Operational risk also includes model risk relating to various financial and other models used by us and our subsidiaries, including the Bank, and is subject to a formal governance process. 

Strategic Risk 

Strategic risk consists of the current or prospective risk to earnings and capital arising from changes in the business environment and from adverse business decisions, improper implementation of decisions or lack of responsiveness to changes in the business environment. Our operational risk team will conduct a formal strategic risk assessment at least annually, and establish risk mitigation plans for top strategic risks. The Bank&#8217;s New Product Innovation Council assesses the strategic viability and consistency of each new Bank product or service. New initiatives require the approval of the MC and our board of directors, in the case of projects deemed more risky or critical to the mission of the business. 

Risk Management Roles and Responsibilities 

Responsibility for risk management flows to individuals and entities throughout our Company, including our board of directors, various board and management committees and senior management. We believe our credit risk culture has facilitated, and will continue to facilitate, the evolution of an effective risk presence across the Company. Set forth below is a description of the roles and responsibilities related to the key elements of our risk management framework. 

Board of Directors 

Our board of directors, among other things, has approved the enterprise-wide risk appetite statement and framework for the Company, as well as certain other risk management policies and oversees the Company&#8217;s strategic plan and enterprise-wide risk management program. Our board of directors may assign certain risk management activities to applicable committees and management. 

Board Committees 

Our board of directors has established four committees that assist the board in its oversight of our risk management. These committees and their risk-related roles are described below. 

Audit Committee &#32; 

In coordination with the Risk Committees of the Company and the Bank, the Audit Committee&#8217;s role, among other things, is to review: (i) the Company&#8217;s major financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control these risks; (ii) the Company&#8217;s risk assessment and risk management practices and the guidelines, policies and processes for risk assessment and risk management; (iii) the organization, performance and audit findings of our internal audit function; (iv) our disclosure and internal controls; and (v) the Company&#8217;s risk guidelines and policies relating to financial statements, financial systems, financial reporting processes, compliance and auditing, and allowance for loan losses. 

Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee &#32; 

The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee&#8217;s role, among other things, is to: (i) review and approve certain transactions with related persons; (ii) review and resolve any conflict of interest involving directors or executive officers; (iii) oversee the risks, if any, related to corporate governance structure and practices; and (iv) identify and discuss with management the risks, if any, related to social responsibility actions and public policy initiatives. 

Management Development and Compensation Committee &#32; 

The Management Development and Compensation Committee&#8217;s role, among other things, is to: (i) review our incentive compensation arrangements with a view to appropriately balancing risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose us or any of our subsidiaries to imprudent risks, and are consistent with safety and soundness; and (ii) review (with input from our CRO and the Bank&#8217;s CRO) the relationship between risk management policies and practices, corporate strategies and senior executive compensation. 

Risk Committee 

The Risk Committee&#8217;s role, among other things, is to: (i) assist our board of directors in its oversight of the Company&#8217;s enterprise-wide risk-management framework, including as it relates to credit, investment, market, liquidity, operational compliance and strategic risks; (ii) review and, at least annually, approve the Company&#8217;s risk governance framework and risk assessment and risk management practices, guidelines and policies (including significant policies that management uses to manage credit and investment, market, liquidity, operational, compliance and strategic risks); (iii) review and, at least annually, recommend to our board of directors for approval the Company&#8217;s enterprise-wide risk appetite (including the Company&#8217;s liquidity risk tolerance), and review and approve the Company&#8217;s strategy relating to managing key risks and other policies on the establishment of risk limits as well as the guidelines, policies and processes for monitoring and mitigating such risks; (iv) meet separately on a regular basis with our CRO and (in coordination with the Bank&#8217;s Risk Committee, as appropriate) the Bank&#8217;s CRO; (v) receive periodic reports from management on metrics used to measure, monitor and manage known and emerging risks, including management&#8217;s view on acceptable and appropriate levels of exposure; (vi) receive reports from our internal audit, risk management and independent liquidity review functions on the results of risk management reviews and assessments; (vii) review and approve, at least annually, the Company&#8217;s enterprise-wide capital and liquidity framework (including its contingency funding plan) and, in coordination with the Bank&#8217;s Risk Committee, review, at least quarterly, the Bank&#8217;s, liquidity risk appetite, regulatory capital and ratios and internal capital adequacy assessment processes and, at least annually, the Bank&#8217;s allowance for loan losses methodology, annual capital plan and resolution plan; (viii) review, at least semi-annually, information from senior management regarding whether the Company is operating within its established risk appetite; (ix) review the status of financial services regulatory examinations; (x) review the independence, authority and effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s risk management function and independent liquidity review function; (xi) approve the appointment of, evaluate and, when appropriate, replace, the CRO; and (xii) review disclosure regarding risk contained in the Company&#8217;s annual and quarterly reports. 

Management Committees 

We have established two management committees with important roles and responsibilities in our risk management function: the MC and the ERMC (of which the ALCO is a subcommittee). These committees and their risk-related roles are described below. 

Management Committee 

The MC is under the oversight of the board of directors and is comprised of our senior executives and chaired by our Chief Executive Officer. The MC has responsibility for reviewing and approving lending and investment activities of the Company, such as equity investments, acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures, portfolio deals and investment issues regarding the Company. It is also responsible for overseeing the Company&#8217;s approach to managing its investments, reviewing and approving the Company&#8217;s annual strategic plan and annual operating plan, and overseeing activities administered by its Loan, Credit Strategy, Customer Experience, Information Technology, New Product &#38; Innovation and Pricing subcommittees. The MC also reviews management reports provided on a periodic basis, or as requested, in order to monitor evolving issues, effectiveness of risk mitigation activities and performance against strategic plans. The MC may make decisions only within the authority that is granted to it by the board of directors and must escalate any investment or other proposals outside of its authority to the board of directors for final decision. 

ERMC 

The ERMC is a management committee under the oversight of the Risk Committee and is comprised of our senior executives and chaired by the CRO. The ERMC has responsibility for risk oversight across the Company and for reporting on material risks to our Risk Committee. The responsibilities of the ERMC include the day-to-day oversight of risks impacting the Company, establishing a risk appetite statement and ensuring compliance across the Company with the overall risk appetite. The ERMC also oversees establishment of risk management policies, the performance and functioning of the relevant overall risk management function, and the implementation of appropriate governance activities and systems that support control of risks. 

ALCO 

A subcommittee of the ERMC, the ALCO is comprised of our senior executives and chaired by the Treasurer. It identifies, measures, monitors, manages and controls market, liquidity and credit (investments and bank relationships) risks to the Company&#8217;s balance sheet. ALCO activities include reviewing and monitoring cash management, investments, liquidity, funding and foreign exchange risk activities and overseeing the safe, sound and efficient operation of the Company in compliance with applicable policies, laws and regulations. 

Chief Executive Officer, Chief Risk Officer and Other Senior Officers 

Our Chief Executive Officer has ultimate responsibility for ensuring the management of the Company&#8217;s risk in accordance with the Company&#8217;s approved risk appetite statement, including through her role as chairperson of the MC. The Chief Executive Officer also provides leadership in communicating the risk appetite to internal and external stakeholders so as to help embed appropriate risk taking into the overall risk culture. 

The CRO manages our risk management team and, as chairperson of the ERMC, is responsible for establishing and implementing standards for the identification, management and measurement of risk on an enterprise-wide basis, as well as for monitoring and reporting such risks. In collaboration with our Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, the CRO has responsibility for developing an appropriate risk appetite with corresponding limits that aligns with supervisory expectations, and this risk appetite statement has been approved by our board of directors. The CRO regularly reports to our board of directors and the Risk Committee on risk management matters. 

Our senior executive officers are responsible for ensuring that their respective functions operate within established risk limits, in accordance with the Company&#8217;s enterprise risk management policy. As members of the ERMC and the MC, they are also responsible for identifying risks, considering risk when developing strategic plans, budgets and new products and implementing appropriate risk controls when pursuing business strategies and objectives. In addition, senior executive officers are responsible for deploying sufficient financial resources and qualified personnel to manage the risks inherent in the Company&#8217;s business activities. 

Risk Management Team 

Our risk management team is led by the CRO and provides oversight of our risk profile and the risk profiles of our subsidiaries. This provides a &#8220;second line of defense&#8221; to the functional organizations&#8217; primary role in creating an appropriate control environment for each functional process. 

Compliance Team 

Our compliance team is responsible for establishing and maintaining a compliance program that includes compliance risk identification, assessment, policy development, and monitoring, testing, training and reporting activities. 

Internal Audit Team 

The internal audit team is responsible for performing periodic, independent reviews and testing of compliance with the Company&#8217;s and the Bank&#8217;s risk management policies and standards, as well as with regulatory guidance and industry best practices. The internal audit team also assesses the design and operating effectiveness of these policies and standards and validates risk management controls. 

Enterprise Risk Assessment Process 

The Enterprise Risk Assessment process (ERA) is a top-down process that is designed to identify, assess and quantify risk across the Company&#8217;s primary risk categories and serves as a basis to determine the Company&#8217;s risk profile. Enterprise risk assessments play an important role in directing our risk management activities to prioritize and focus on appropriate risks. The risk leader for each risk category directs the assessment process, reviewing not only the current type and level of risks, but also compliance with regulatory guidance and industry best practices as well as policy and procedural compliance. Progress against any action plans that have been put into place to manage key risks are tracked and reported to the ERMC. Independent risk management utilizes the results of the ERA to assess the appropriateness of risk responses/actions being taken by management to address identified risks. The ERA is performed annually and refreshed quarterly, and is the basis of the Material Risk Inventory used in the strategic and capital planning processes. 

Stress testing efforts as part of the risk assessment process continue to evolve as we model scenarios exploring multi-risk impacts on profitability, liquidity and capital levels. Stress testing activities provide a forward-looking assessment of risks and losses. We seek to integrate the results of our stress testing into our strategic, capital and liquidity planning processes, and will use the results to identify portfolio vulnerabilities and develop risk mitigation strategies or contingency plans across a range of stressed conditions. 

Risk Appetite Framework 

We operate in accordance with a risk appetite statement setting forth our objectives, plans and limits, and expressing our preferences with respect to risk-taking activities in the context of our overall business goals. The risk appetite statement was approved by the ERMC, the Risk Committee and our board of directors, with delegated authority to the CRO for implementation throughout the Company. The risk appetite statement serves as a tool to preclude activities that are inconsistent with our business and risk strategy. The risk appetite statement will be reviewed and approved at least annually as part of our business planning process and will be modified, as necessary, to include updated risk tolerances by risk category, enabling us to meet prescribed goals while continuing to operate within our established risk boundaries. 

Regulation 

____________________________________________________________________________________________ 

General 

Our business, including our relationships with our customers, is subject to regulation, supervision and examination under U.S. federal, state and foreign laws and regulations. These laws and regulations cover all aspects of our business, including lending practices, treatment of our customers, safeguarding deposits, customer privacy and information security, capital structure, liquidity, dividends and other capital distributions, transactions with affiliates, and conduct and qualifications of personnel. 

As a savings and loan holding company, Synchrony is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve Board. As a large provider of consumer financial services, we are also subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the CFPB. 

The Bank is a federally chartered savings association. As such, the Bank is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the OCC, which is its primary regulator, and by the CFPB. In addition, the Bank, as an insured depository institution, is supervised by the FDIC. 

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 

The Dodd-Frank Act, which was enacted in July 2010, significantly restructured the financial regulatory regime in the United States. As discussed further throughout this section, certain aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to further rulemaking that will take effect over several years, making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on us or across the industry. See also &#8220; Item 1A . Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Relating to Regulation&#8212;The Dodd-Frank Act has had, and may continue to have, a significant impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations .&#8221; 

Savings and Loan Holding Company Regulation 

Overview 

As a savings and loan holding company, we are required to register and file periodic reports with, and are subject to regulation, supervision and examination by, the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board has adopted guidelines establishing safety and soundness standards on such matters as liquidity risk management, securitizations, operational risk management, internal controls and audit systems, business continuity, and compensation and other employee benefits. We are regularly reviewed and examined by the Federal Reserve Board, which results in supervisory comments and directions relating to many aspects of our business that require our response and attention. 

The Federal Reserve Board has broad enforcement authority over us and our subsidiaries (other than the Bank and its subsidiaries). Under the Dodd-Frank Act, we are required to serve as a source of financial strength for any insured depository institution that we control, such as the Bank. 

Capital 

As a stand-alone savings and loan holding company, Synchrony is subject to capital requirements. 

The following are the minimum capital ratios to which Synchrony is subject: 

&#8226; 

under the Basel III standardized approach, a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 7% (the minimum of 4.5% plus a mandatory conservation buffer of 2.5% , which will be fully phased-in by January 1, 2019), a Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 8.5% (the minimum of 6% plus a phased-in mandatory conservation buffer of 2.5% ), and a total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 10.5% (a minimum of 8% plus a phased-in mandatory conservation buffer of 2.5% ); and 

&#8226; 

a leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to total consolidated assets of 4% . 

For a discussion of our capital ratios, see &#8220; Item 7. &#32; Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Capital .&#8221; 

Beginning on January 1, 2017, we will also be required to conduct stress tests on an annual basis. Under the Federal Reserve Board&#8217;s stress test regulations, we will be required to utilize stress-testing methodologies providing for results under at least three different sets of conditions, including baseline, adverse and severely adverse conditions. We already comply with the stress test requirement in substantial part and share results with the Federal Reserve Board. In addition, although as a savings and loan holding company we currently are not subject to the Federal Reserve Board&#8217;s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (&#8220;CCAR&#8221;) rule, the Federal Reserve Board may in the future require us to comply with the CCAR process or some modified version of the CCAR process. Under this process the Federal Reserve Board would measure our minimum capital requirement levels under various stress scenarios. Further, while as a savings and loan holding company we currently are not subject to the Federal Reserve Board&#8217;s capital planning rule, we plan to prepare and submit a form of capital plan in 2016 to the Federal Reserve Board for their review. 

Liquidity 

As a savings and loan holding company with total consolidated assets in excess of $50 billion, we are required to comply with the modified Liquidity Coverage Ratio Rule (&#8220;modified LCR Rule&#8221;) approved by the Federal Reserve Board in 2014. The modified LCR rule requires us to calculate, on a monthly basis, the ratio of the amount of our high quality liquid assets to our expected total net cash outflows over a 30-day stress period (&#8220;modified LCR Ratio&#8221;), and to maintain a modified LCR Ratio above 1.0. The modified LCR Rule is already in effect, although its requirements are being phased in over a two-year period ending January 1, 2017. Under rules proposed by the Federal Reserve Board in 2015, we may also be required to disclose our modified LCR and other associated liquidity data on a quarterly basis commencing in 2018. 

In addition to the modified LCR, we may in the future be required to comply with rules adopted by the Federal Reserve Board or other banking regulators to implement the Basel III Net Stable Funding Ratio (&#8220;NSFR&#8221;), which would require us to maintain a minimum acceptable amount of stable funding based on our liquidity characteristics. The Basel Committee contemplates that the NSFR will be implemented as a minimum standard by January 1, 2018; however, the U.S. federal banking regulators have not yet published a proposed rule to implement the NSFR in the United States. 

Finally, the Federal Reserve Board requires bank holding companies of a similar size to us to comply with certain Enhanced Prudential Standards with respect to liquidity management. Among other things, such bank holding companies must maintain diversified liquidity portfolios and must regularly conduct liquidity stress tests. While, as a savings and loan holding company, we are not covered by the Enhanced Prudential Standards, we currently comply with many aspects of the liquidity management requirements in the Enhanced Prudential Standards, including the diversification and stress testing requirements. 

Dividends and Stock Repurchases 

We are limited in our ability to pay dividends or repurchase our stock by the Federal Reserve Board, including on the basis that doing so would be an unsafe or unsound banking practice. If we intend to declare or pay a dividend, we generally will be required to inform and consult with the Federal Reserve Board in advance to ensure that such dividend does not raise supervisory concerns. It is the policy of the Federal Reserve Board that a savings and loan holding company like us should generally pay dividends on common stock only out of earnings, and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the company&#8217;s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition. 

According to guidance from the Federal Reserve Board, our dividend policies will be assessed against, among other things, our ability to achieve applicable Basel III capital ratio requirements. If we do not achieve applicable Basel III capital ratio requirements when they are fully phased-in, we may not be able to pay dividends. Although we currently expect to meet the applicable final Basel III capital ratio requirements, inclusive of any applicable capital conservation buffer, when they are fully phased in by the Federal Reserve Board, we cannot be sure that we will meet those requirements or even if we do, if we will be able to pay dividends. 

We also will be required to inform and consult with the Federal Reserve Board in advance of redeeming or repurchasing our stock if the result will be a net reduction in our equity compared to our equity as of the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurs. In evaluating the appropriateness of a proposed redemption or repurchase of stock, the Federal Reserve Board will consider, among other things, the potential loss that we may suffer from the prospective need to increase reserves and write down assets as a result of continued asset deterioration, and our ability to raise additional common equity and other capital to replace the stock that will be redeemed or repurchased. The Federal Reserve Board also will consider the potential negative effects on our capital structure of replacing common stock with any lower-tier form of regulatory capital issued. Moreover, the approval process for any capital plan we are required to submit could result in restrictions on our ability to pay dividends or make other capital distributions. See &#8220; Item 1A. &#32; Risk Factors-Risks Relating to Regulation-Failure by Synchrony and the Bank to meet applicable capital adequacy and liquidity requirements could have a material adverse effect on us &#8221; and &#8220; &#8212;We are subject to restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our common stock; the Bank is subject to restrictions that limit its ability to pay dividends to us, which could limit our ability to pay dividends or make payments on our indebtedness &#8221;. 

Activities 

In general, savings and loan holding companies may only conduct, or acquire control of companies engaged in, financial activities as permitted under the relevant provisions of the Bank Holding Company Act and Savings and Loan Holding Company Act. As a savings and loan holding company, our activities are subject to such limitations. 

In addition, we and the Bank are subject to banking laws and regulations that limit in certain respects the types of acquisitions and investments that we can make. For example, certain acquisitions of and investments in depository institutions or their holding companies that we undertake are subject to the prior review and approval of our banking regulators, including the Federal Reserve Board, the OCC and the FDIC. Our banking regulators have broad discretion on whether to approve such acquisitions and investments. In deciding whether to approve a proposed acquisition or investment, federal bank regulators may consider, among other factors: (i) the effect of the acquisition or investment on competition, (ii) our financial condition and future prospects, including current and projected capital ratios and levels, (iii) the competence, experience and integrity of our management and its record of compliance with laws and regulations, (iv) the convenience and needs of the communities to be served, including our record of compliance under the Community Reinvestment Act (the &#8220;CRA&#8221;), (v) our effectiveness in combating money laundering and (vi) any risks that the proposed acquisition poses to the U.S. banking or financial system. 

Certain acquisitions of our voting stock may be subject to regulatory approval or notice under federal law. Investors are responsible for ensuring that they do not, directly or indirectly, acquire shares of our stock in excess of the amount that can be acquired without regulatory approval under the Change in Bank Control Act and the Savings and Loan Holding Company Act, which prohibit any person or company from acquiring control of us without, in most cases, the prior written approval of the Federal Reserve Board. 

Savings Association Regulation 

Overview 

The Bank is required to file periodic reports with the OCC and is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the OCC and the FDIC. The OCC has adopted guidelines establishing safety and soundness standards on such matters as loan underwriting and documentation, asset quality, earnings, internal controls and audit systems, risk management, interest rate risk exposure and compensation and other employee benefits. The Bank is periodically examined by the OCC and the FDIC, which results in supervisory comments and directions relating to many aspects of the Bank&#8217;s business that require the Bank&#8217;s response and attention. In addition, the OCC and the FDIC have broad enforcement authority over the Bank. 

Capital 

The Bank is required by OCC regulations to maintain specified levels of regulatory capital. Institutions that are not well-capitalized are subject to certain restrictions on brokered deposits and interest rates on deposits. The OCC is authorized and, under certain circumstances, required to take certain actions against an institution that fails to meet the minimum ratios for an adequately capitalized institution. At December 31, 2015 , the Bank met or exceeded all applicable requirements to be deemed well-capitalized under OCC regulations. 

The following are the minimum capital ratios to which the Bank has been subject since January 1, 2015: 

&#8226; 

under the Basel III standardized approach, a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 7% (the minimum of 4.5% plus a mandatory conservation buffer of 2.5%, which will be fully phased-in by January 1, 2019), a Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 8.5% (the minimum of 6% plus a phased-in mandatory conservation buffer of 2.5%), and a total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 10.5% (a minimum of 8% plus a phased-in mandatory conservation buffer of 2.5%); and 

&#8226; 

a leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to total consolidated assets of 5%. 

For a discussion of the Bank&#8217;s capital ratios, see &#8220; Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Capital .&#8221; 

The Bank is also required to conduct stress tests on an annual basis. Under the OCC&#8217;s stress test regulations, the Bank is required to utilize stress-testing methodologies providing for results under at least three different sets of conditions, including baseline, adverse and severely adverse conditions. 

In addition, the Bank is required to comply with prudential regulation in connection with liquidity. In particular, under OCC guidelines establishing heightened standards for governance and risk management (the "Heightened Standards"), the Bank is required to establish liquidity stress testing and planning processes, which the Bank has done. For a discussion of the Heightened Standards, see &#8220; &#8212;Heightened Standards for Risk Management Governance &#8221; below. 

As an insured depository institution, the Bank is also subject to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the &#8220;FDIA&#8221;), which requires, among other things, the federal banking agencies to take &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; in respect of depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. The FDIA sets forth the following five capital tiers: &#8220;well-capitalized,&#8221; &#8220;adequately capitalized,&#8221; &#8220;undercapitalized,&#8221; &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; and &#8220;critically undercapitalized.&#8221; A depository institution&#8217;s capital tier will depend upon how its capital levels compare with various relevant capital measures and certain other factors that are established by regulation. To be well-capitalized, the Bank must maintain a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 6.5%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 8%, a total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 10%, and a leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to total consolidated assets of 5%, and not be subject to any written agreement, order or capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by the OCC to meet or maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. At December 31, 2015 , the Bank met or exceeded all applicable requirements to be deemed well-capitalized for purposes of the FDIA. 

Dividends and Stock Repurchases 

OCC regulations limit the ability of savings associations to make distributions of capital, including payment of dividends, stock redemptions and repurchases, cash-out mergers and other transactions charged to the capital account. The Bank must obtain the OCC&#8217;s approval or give the OCC prior notice before making a capital distribution in certain circumstances, including if the Bank proposes to make a capital distribution when it does not meet certain capital requirements (or will not do so as a result of the proposed capital distribution) or certain net income requirements. In addition, the Bank must file a prior written notice of a planned or declared dividend or other distribution with the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board or the OCC may object to a capital distribution if: among other things, (i) the Bank is, or as a result of such distribution would be, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized, (ii) the regulators have safety and soundness concerns or (iii) the distribution violates a prohibition in a statute, regulation, agreement between us and the OCC, or a condition imposed on us in an application or notice approved by the OCC. Additional restrictions on dividends apply if the Bank fails the QTL test (described below under &#8220; &#8212;Activities &#8221;). 

The FDIA also prohibits any depository institution from making any capital distributions (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its parent holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be &#8220;undercapitalized.&#8221; If a depository institution is less than adequately capitalized, it must prepare and submit a capital restoration plan to its primary federal regulator for approval. For a capital restoration plan to be acceptable, among other things, the depository institution&#8217;s parent holding company must guarantee that the institution will comply with the capital restoration plan. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan, it is treated as if it is &#8220;significantly undercapitalized.&#8221; A &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; depository institution may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become &#8220;adequately capitalized,&#8221; elect a new board of directors, reduce total assets or cease taking deposits from correspondent banks. A &#8220;critically undercapitalized&#8221; institution may be subject to the appointment of a conservator or receiver which could sell or liquidate the institution, be required to refrain from making payments on its subordinated debt, or be subject to additional restrictions on its activities. 

Activities 

Under the Home Owners&#8217; Loan Act (&#8220;HOLA&#8221;), the OCC requires the Bank to comply with the qualified thrift lender, or &#8220;QTL&#8221; test. Under the QTL test, the Bank is required to maintain at least 65.00% &#32;of its &#8220;portfolio assets&#8221; (total assets less: (i) specified liquid assets up to 20.00% &#32;of total assets, (ii) intangibles, including goodwill and (iii) the value of property used to conduct business) in certain &#8220;qualified thrift investments&#8221; (primarily residential mortgages and related investments, including certain mortgage-backed securities, credit card loans, student loans and small business loans) in at least nine months of the most recent 12-month period. The Bank currently meets that test. A savings association that fails to meet the QTL test is subject to certain operating restrictions and may be required to convert to a national bank charter. 

Savings associations, including the Bank, are subject as well to limitations on their lending and investments. These limitations include percentage of asset limitations on various types of loans the Bank may make. In addition, there are similar limitations on the types and amounts of investments the Bank may make. 

Insured depository institutions, including the Bank, are subject to restrictions under Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act (as implemented by Federal Reserve Board Regulation W), which govern transactions between an insured depository institution and an affiliate, including an entity that is the institution&#8217;s direct or indirect holding company and a nonbank subsidiary of such a holding company. Restrictions in Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act apply to &#8220;covered transactions&#8221; such as extensions of credit, issuances of guarantees or asset purchases. In general, these restrictions require that any extensions of credit made by the insured depository institution to an affiliate must be fully secured with qualifying collateral and that the aggregate amount of covered transactions is limited, as to any one affiliate of the Bank, to 10% of the Bank&#8217;s capital stock and surplus, and, as to all of the Bank&#8217;s affiliates in the aggregate, to 20% of the Bank&#8217;s capital stock and surplus. In addition, transactions between the Bank and its affiliates must be on terms and conditions that are, or in good faith would be, offered by the Bank to non-affiliated companies (i.e., at arm&#8217;s length). 

The CRA is a federal law that generally requires an insured depository institution to identify the communities it serves and to make loans and investments, offer products and provide services, in each case designed to meet the credit needs of these communities. The CRA also requires an institution to maintain comprehensive records of CRA activities to demonstrate how it is meeting the credit needs of communities. These records are subject to periodic examination by the responsible federal banking agency of the institution. Based on these examinations, the agency rates the institution&#8217;s compliance with CRA as &#8220;Outstanding,&#8221; &#8220;Satisfactory,&#8221; &#8220;Needs to Improve&#8221; or &#8220;Substantial Noncompliance.&#8221; The CRA requires the agency to take into account the record of an institution in meeting the credit needs of the entire communities served, including low- and moderate- income neighborhoods, in determining such rating. Failure of an institution to receive at least a &#8220;Satisfactory&#8221; rating could inhibit the institution or its holding company from undertaking certain activities, including acquisitions. The Bank received a CRA rating of &#8220;Outstanding&#8221; as of its most recent CRA examination. 

The FDIA prohibits insured banks from accepting brokered deposits or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in the bank&#8217;s normal market area or nationally (depending upon where the deposits are solicited) unless it is &#8220;well-capitalized,&#8221; or it is &#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221; and receives a waiver from the FDIC. A bank that is &#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221; and that accepts brokered deposits under a waiver from the FDIC may not pay an interest rate on any deposit in excess of 75 basis points over certain prevailing market rates. There are no such restrictions under the FDIA on a bank that is &#8220;well-capitalized.&#8221; Further, &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221; institutions are subject to growth limitations. At December 31, 2015 , the Bank met or exceeded all applicable requirements to be deemed well-capitalized for purposes of the FDIA. An inability to accept brokered deposits in the future could materially adversely impact our funding costs and liquidity. 

In connection with the OCC&#8217;s December 12, 2012 approval of the Bank&#8217;s assumption of certain deposits and related liabilities of MetLife and acquisition of certain assets of MetLife, the Bank entered into an Operating Agreement with the OCC (the &#8220;Operating Agreement&#8221;) and also into a Capital Assurance and Liquidity Maintenance Agreement with General Electric Capital Corporation (&#8220;GECC&#8221;), GE Consumer Finance, Inc. (&#8220;GECFI&#8221;) and Synchrony (the &#8220;CALMA&#8221;) on January 11, 2013. The OCC terminated the Operating Agreement in writing on February 4, 2016, at which time the CALMA also terminated. The obligations of GECC and GECFI under the CALMA terminated upon the consummation of the exchange offer. The material terms of the Operating Agreement and the CALMA are summarized below, and the Operating Agreement and the CALMA have been filed as exhibits to this report. 

The Operating Agreement required, among other things, that the Bank: (i) maintain a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 11.0% , a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 7.0% &#32;and a leverage ratio of at least 6.0% , (ii) maintain liquid assets at least equal to the greater of $500 million &#32;or 90 days&#8217; coverage of the Bank&#8217;s operating expenses, (iii) not materially change or significantly deviate from a business plan for 2013 and 2014 that was submitted to the OCC without first giving the OCC notice and obtaining its supervisory non-objection, (iv) meet certain conditions to declare or pay a dividend (including being in compliance with the Operating Agreement), (v) maintain a board with at least 40% &#32;independent directors and (vi) for three years immediately after the date of the Operating Agreement, not appoint any new director or senior executive officer or enter into a material services contract with an affiliate without providing prior notice to the OCC. 

The Operating Agreement provided that, if the OCC determined there was an existing or imminent material breach of the Bank&#8217;s obligation to maintain the required amounts of capital or liquidity or Synchrony was likely to be unable to fulfill its obligations under the CALMA due to a material adverse change in the financial condition of Synchrony, or in certain other circumstances, the Bank would have been required to submit to the OCC a plan for the sale, merger or dissolution of the Bank and implement such plan upon obtaining the OCC&#8217;s non-objection and written direction to begin implementation (subject to a right on the Bank&#8217;s part to cure the basis for such direction within 15 days of its issuance). The Operating Agreement also provided that the OCC may have required the Bank to immediately cease extending new or additional credit under certain circumstances, including if (i) the OCC determined there is an existing or imminent material breach of the Bank&#8217;s obligation to maintain the required amounts of capital or liquidity or Synchrony was likely to be unable to fulfill its obligations under the CALMA due to a material adverse change in the financial condition of Synchrony, (ii) the OCC deemed that breach or change likely to pose an imminent threat to the financial condition of the Bank, and (iii) such breach or change had not been cured or remedied, as the case may be, within five days of receiving written notice from the OCC. The Operating Agreement imposed certain monitoring and reporting obligations, including, among other things, notification to the OCC regarding material changes to the financial condition of the Bank and Synchrony. 

The CALMA required, among other things, that Synchrony: (i) make capital infusions as requested by the Bank to ensure that the Bank remains in compliance with the capital requirements of the Operating Agreement, (ii) provide such financial support as requested by the Bank to ensure that the Bank remains in compliance with the liquidity requirements of the Operating Agreement, and (iii) provide certain information to the Bank and the OCC relevant to its financial condition and ability to fulfill its obligations under the CALMA. 

Deposit Insurance 

The FDIA requires the Bank to pay deposit insurance assessments. Deposit insurance assessments are affected by the minimum reserve ratio with respect to the federal Deposit Insurance Fund (the &#8220;DIF&#8221;). The Dodd-Frank Act increased the minimum reserve ratio with respect to the DIF to 1.35% &#32;and removed the statutory cap on the reserve ratio. The FDIC subsequently set a reserve ratio of 2% &#32;and may increase that ratio in the future. Under the FDIC&#8217;s current deposit insurance assessment methodology, the Bank is required to pay deposit insurance assessments based on its average consolidated total assets, less average tangible equity, and various other regulatory factors included in an FDIC assessment scorecard. 

The FDIA creates a depositor preference regime for the resolution of all insured depository institutions, including the Bank. If any such institution is placed into receivership, the FDIC will pay (out of the remaining net assets of the failed institution and only to the extent of such assets) first secured creditors (to the extent of their security), second the administrative expenses of the receivership, third all deposits liabilities (both insured and uninsured), fourth any other general or senior liabilities, fifth any obligations subordinated to depositors or general creditors, and finally any remaining net assets to shareholders in that capacity. 

Resolution and Recovery Planning 

The Bank is required annually to submit to the FDIC a plan for the Bank&#8217;s resolution in the event of its failure. The plan is designed to enable the FDIC, if appointed receiver for the Bank, to resolve the Bank under sections 11 and 13 of the FDIA in a manner that ensures that its depositors receive access to their insured deposits within one business day of the Bank's failure (two business days if the failure occurs on a day other than Friday), maximizes the net present value return from the sale or disposition of the Bank&#8217;s assets, and minimizes the amount of any loss realized by the creditors in the resolution. The resolution and recovery plan requirement is intended to ensure that the FDIC has access to all of the material information it needs to resolve the Bank efficiently in the event of its failure. 

Heightened Standards for Risk Management Governance 

The OCC&#8217;s Heightened Standards establish guidelines for the governance and risk management practices of large OCC-regulated institutions, including the Bank. These Heightened Standards require covered banks to establish and adhere to a written governance framework in order to manage and control their risk-taking activities, provide standards for covered banks&#8217; boards of directors to oversee the risk governance framework, and describe the appropriate risk management roles and responsibilities of front line units, independent risk management, and internal audit functions. The Bank will be required to comply with the Heightened Standards beginning in May 2016. 

Consumer Financial Services Regulation 

The relationship between us and our U.S. customers is regulated under federal and state consumer protection laws. Federal laws include the Truth in Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, HOLA, the Fair Credit Reporting Act (the &#8220;FCRA&#8221;), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the &#8220;GLBA&#8221;), the CARD Act and the Dodd-Frank Act. These and other federal laws, among other things, require disclosures of the cost of credit, provide substantive consumer rights, prohibit discrimination in credit transactions, regulate the use of credit report information, provide financial privacy protections, require safe and sound banking operations, prohibit unfair, deceptive and abusive practices, restrict our ability to raise interest rates, and subject us to substantial regulatory oversight. State and, in some cases, local laws also may regulate the relationship between us and our U.S. customers in these areas, as well as in the areas of collection practices, and may provide other additional consumer protections. Moreover, we and our U.S. subsidiaries are subject to the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, which protects persons called to active military service and their dependents from undue hardship resulting from their military service. The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act applies to all debts incurred prior to the commencement of active duty (including credit card and other open-end debt) and limits the amount of interest, including service and renewal charges and any other fees or charges (other than bona fide insurance) that is related to the obligation or liability. 

Violations of applicable consumer protection laws can result in significant potential liability from litigation brought by customers, including actual damages, restitution and attorneys&#8217; fees. Federal banking regulators, as well as state attorneys general and other state and local consumer protection agencies, also may seek to enforce consumer protection requirements and obtain these and other remedies, including civil money penalties and fines. 

The CARD Act was enacted in 2009 and most of the requirements became effective in 2010. The CARD Act made numerous amendments to the Truth in Lending Act, requiring us to make significant changes to many of our business practices, including marketing, underwriting, pricing and billing. The CARD Act&#8217;s restrictions on our ability to increase interest rates on existing balances to respond to market conditions and credit risk ultimately limits our ability to extend credit to new customers and provide additional credit to current customers. Other CARD Act restrictions, such as limitations on late fees, have resulted and will continue to result in reduced interest income and loan fee income. 

The FCRA regulates the Bank&#8217;s and our use of credit reports and the reporting of information to credit reporting agencies, and also provides a standard for lenders to share information with affiliates and certain third parties and to provide firm offers of credit to consumers. The FCRA also places further restrictions on the use of information shared between affiliates for marketing purposes, requires the provision of disclosures to consumers when risk-based pricing is used in a credit decision, and requires safeguards to help protect consumers from identity theft. 

Under HOLA, the Bank is prohibited from engaging in certain tying or reciprocity arrangements with its customers. In general, the Bank may not extend credit, lease or sell property, or furnish any services or fix or vary the consideration for these on the condition that: (i) the customer obtain or provide some additional credit, property, or services from or to the Bank or Synchrony or their subsidiaries or (ii) the customer may not obtain some other credit, property, or services from a competitor, except in each case to the extent reasonable conditions are imposed to assure the soundness of the credit extended. Certain arrangements are permissible. For example, the Bank may offer more favorable terms if a customer obtains two or more traditional bank products. 

The Durbin Amendment in the Dodd-Frank Act requires the Federal Reserve Board to promulgate certain rules related to debit transaction interchange fees. On June 29, 2011, the Federal Reserve Board adopted a final rule with respect to the Durbin Amendment effective on October 1, 2011, which, among other things, established a regulatory cap for many types of debit interchange transactions that is no more than 21 cents plus five basis points of the value of the transaction. The Federal Reserve Board&#8217;s rule also allows a debit card issuer to recover 1% &#32;per transaction for fraud prevention purposes if the issuer complies with certain fraud-related requirements. In addition, the rule prohibits the imposition of restrictions on a merchant&#8217;s ability to direct the routing of electronic debit transactions over a network for which the issuer has enabled processing. 

The Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB, which regulates consumer financial products and services and certain financial services providers. The CFPB is authorized to prevent &#8220;unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices&#8221; and ensure consistent enforcement of laws so that all consumers have access to markets for consumer financial products and services that are fair, transparent and competitive. The CFPB has rulemaking and interpretive authority under the Dodd-Frank Act and other federal consumer financial services laws, as well as broad supervisory, examination and enforcement authority over large providers of consumer financial products and services, such as us. In addition, the CFPB has an online complaint system that allows consumers to log complaints with respect to various consumer finance products, including the products we offer. The system could inform future agency decisions with respect to regulatory, enforcement or examination focus. There continues to be uncertainty as to how the CFPB&#8217;s strategies and priorities will impact our businesses and our results of operations going forward. See &#8220; Item 1A. &#32; Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Relating to Regulation&#8212;There continues to be uncertainty as to how the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau&#8217;s actions will impact our business; the agency&#8217;s actions have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our business. &#8221; 

On December 10, 2013, we entered into a consent order with the CFPB relating to our CareCredit platform (the &#8220;2013 CFPB Consent Order&#8221;), which required us to pay up to $34.1 million &#32;to customers, to provide additional training and monitoring of our CareCredit enrolled network providers, to include provisions in agreements with our CareCredit enrolled network providers prohibiting charges for certain services not yet rendered, to make changes to certain consumer disclosures, application procedures and procedures for resolution of customer complaints, and to terminate CareCredit enrolled network providers that have chargeback rates in excess of certain thresholds. Some of the changes required by the 2013 CFPB Consent Order are similar to requirements in an assurance of discontinuation that we entered with the Attorney General for the State of New York on June 3, 2013 (the &#8220;Assurance&#8221;). We believe the Bank to be in compliance with the material business practice changes required by the 2013 CFPB Consent Order and the Assurance, subject to ongoing reporting, chargeback monitoring, and biannual enrolled network provider retraining obligations. We will continue to actively monitor and access the impact of these changes on our CareCredit program. In addition to the costs of remediation, which were not material for the Assurance and were $34.1 million &#32;for the 2013 CFPB Consent Order, the Company will incur an estimated ongoing annual cost of approximately $2 million . Although at this time we do not believe that the 2013 CFPB Consent Order and the Assurance will have a material adverse impact on our results of operations going forward, we may elect or be required to make changes with respect to these and other deferred interest products in the future, and those changes may adversely affect customers&#8217; use of our credit cards or our business. See &#8220; Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Relating to Regulation&#8212;Changes to our methods of offering our CareCredit products could materially impact operating results .&#8221; 

On June 19, 2014, we entered into a consent order with the CFPB (the &#8220;2014 CFPB Consent Order&#8221;) that required us to refund $56 million &#32;to cardholders who enrolled in a debt cancellation product over the telephone from January 2010 to October 2012 ( $11 million &#32;of which was refunded prior to the 2014 CFPB Consent Order), pay civil money penalties of $3.5 million , and implement a compliance plan related to the sale of &#8220;add-on&#8221; products to the extent the Bank restarts telesales of such products (which were discontinued in October 2012). In the second quarter of 2015, we completed the consumer refunds. 

In addition to resolving the CFPB&#8217;s concerns regarding our debt cancellation sales practices, the 2014 CFPB Consent Order resolved an unrelated issue that arose from the Bank&#8217;s self-identified omission of certain Spanish-speaking customers and customers residing in Puerto Rico from two offers that were made to certain delinquent customers. We discovered this issue through an audit of our collection operations in 2012, reported it to the CFPB and initiated a voluntary remediation program, which resulted in payments, balance credits and balance waivers of $132 million . The CFPB conducted a review of the collection offer omissions and also referred the matter to the DOJ, which commenced an investigation in March 2014. At the same time we entered into the 2014 CFPB Consent Order, we entered into a consent order with the DOJ (the &#8220;2014 DOJ Consent Order,&#8221; and together with the 2014 CFPB Consent Order, the &#8220;2014 Consent Orders&#8221;) to settle a complaint filed by the DOJ on June 19, 2014 in the United States District Court for the District of Utah that made similar allegations to those alleged in the 2014 CFPB Consent Order. The 2014 DOJ Consent Order was approved by the Court on June 26, 2014. The 2014 DOJ Consent Order is similar to the 2014 CFPB Consent Order and did not impose any additional requirements on us. The 2014 Consent Orders required us to complete our remediation program by providing additional payments, balance credits and balance waivers and to update our credit bureau reporting relating to the affected accounts. In the third quarter of 2015, we completed our consumer remediation program, which consisted of approximately $185 million of balance credits and waivers to previously charged-off accounts and approximately $15 million of other credits or payments. This remediation program included the $132 million of voluntary remediation completed prior to the 2014 Consent Orders. In addition to consumer remediation, the 2014 Consent Orders required us to implement a fair lending compliance plan (including fair lending reviews, audits and training), which will, in part, be satisfied by our existing compliance processes. On January 25, 2016, the DOJ filed a notice with the Court that the 2014 DOJ Consent Order had terminated pursuant to its terms. Although we do not believe that the 2014 Consent Orders themselves will have a material adverse effect on results of operations going forward, we cannot be sure whether the settlement will have an adverse impact on our reputation or whether any similar actions will be brought by state attorneys general or others, all of which could have a material adverse effect on us. 

In December 2015 the CFPB published its second biennial report reviewing the consumer credit card market. In the report, the CFPB identified areas of concern for consumers, including deferred interest products, subprime specialist, credit card issuers, and unexpected rate increases with respect to variable interest rate products. In addition, the report analyzed issues regarding debt sales and debt collection practices, the adequacy and availability of online disclosures as well as of the disclosures associated with rewards products and grace periods. Separately, in March 2015, the CFPB issued a report scrutinizing pre-dispute arbitration clauses, and in October 2015, the CFPB published proposals that would require any arbitration agreement included in a contract for a consumer financial product or service to provide explicitly that the arbitration agreement is inapplicable to cases filed in court on behalf of a class unless and until class certification is denied or the class claims are dismissed. If the CFPB&#8217;s proposals are enacted, we expect that our exposure to class action litigation could increase significantly. See &#8220; Item 1A. &#32; Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Relating to Our Business&#8212;Litigation, regulatory actions and compliance issues could subject us to significant fines, penalties, judgments, remediation costs and/or requirements resulting in increased expenses .&#8221; 

Privacy 

We, along with the Bank, are subject to various privacy, information security and data protection laws, including requirements concerning security breach notification. For example, in the United States, certain of our businesses are subject to the GLBA and implementing regulations and guidance. Among other things, the GLBA: (i) imposes certain limitations on the ability of financial institutions to share consumers&#8217; nonpublic personal information with nonaffiliated third parties, (ii) requires that financial institutions provide certain disclosures to consumers about their information collection, sharing and security practices and affords customers the right to &#8220;opt out&#8221; of the institution&#8217;s disclosure of their personal financial information to nonaffiliated third parties (with certain exceptions) and (iii) requires financial institutions to develop, implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate to the financial institution&#8217;s size and complexity, the nature and scope of the financial institution&#8217;s activities, and the sensitivity of customer information processed by the financial institution as well as plans for responding to data security breaches. Federal and state laws also require us to respond appropriately to data security breaches. We, along with the Bank, have a program to comply with applicable privacy, information security, and data protection requirements imposed by federal, state, and foreign laws, including the GLBA. See also &#8220; Item 1A. &#32; Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Relating to Regulation&#8212;Regulations relating to privacy, information security and data protection could increase our costs, affect or limit how we collect and use personal information and adversely affect our business opportunities .&#8221; 

Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Prevention Program 

We maintain an enterprise-wide program designed to enable us to comply with all applicable anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing laws and regulations, including the Bank Secrecy Act and the USA PATRIOT Act. This program includes policies, procedures, processes and other internal controls designed to identify, monitor, manage and mitigate the risk of money laundering or terrorist financing posed by our products, services, customers and geographic locale. These controls include procedures and processes to detect and report suspicious transactions, perform customer due diligence, respond to requests from law enforcement, and meet all recordkeeping and reporting requirements related to particular transactions involving currency or monetary instruments. The program is coordinated by a compliance officer, undergoes an annual independent audit to assess its effectiveness, and requires training of employees. See &#8220; Item 1A. &#32; Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Relating to Regulation&#8212;Failure to comply with anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing laws could have significant adverse consequences for us .&#8221; 

Sanctions Programs 

We have a program designed to comply with applicable economic and trade sanctions programs, including those administered and enforced by OFAC. These sanctions are usually targeted against foreign countries, terrorists, international narcotics traffickers and those believed to be involved in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. These regulations generally require either the blocking of accounts or other property of specified entities or individuals, but they may also require the rejection of certain transactions involving specified entities or individuals. We maintain policies, procedures and other internal controls designed to comply with these sanctions programs.
