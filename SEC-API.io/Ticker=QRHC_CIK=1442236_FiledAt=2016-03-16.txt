 ITEM 1. 

BUSINESS

Overview

We provide businesses with one-stop management programs to reuse, recycle, and dispose of a wide variety of waste streams and recyclables generated by their businesses. Our comprehensive reuse, recycling, and proper disposal management programs are designed to enable regional and national customers to have a single point of contact for managing a variety of waste streams and recyclables. 

We believe our recycling management programs are comprehensive, innovative, and cost effective. Our services are designed to enable our business customers to capture the commodity value of their waste streams and recyclables, reduce their disposal costs, enhance their management of environmental risks, enhance their legal and regulatory compliance, and create national sustainability initiatives while maximizing the efficiency of their assets. Our services currently focus on the waste streams and recyclables from big box, food chain, and other retailers; automotive and fleet providers; hospital and other healthcare facilities; and commercial, industrial, residential, and educational properties. We currently concentrate on programs for recycling motor oil and automotive lubricants, oil filters, scrap tires, food waste, meat renderings, cooking oil and grease, organics, plastics, cardboard, metal, glass, paper, construction debris, and other hazardous and non-hazardous solid and liquid wastes.

We also operate environmentally based social media and online data platforms that contain information and instructions necessary to empower consumers and consumer product companies to recycle or properly dispose of household products and materials. Our directory of local recycling and proper disposal options empowers consumers directly and enables consumer product companies to empower their customers by giving them the guidance necessary for the proper recycling or disposal of a wide range of household products and materials, including the &#8220;why, where, and how&#8221; of recycling.

Utilizing what we believe is the nation&#8217;s most complete directory of local recycling and proper disposal options for almost every household product and material, we empower consumers and enable consumer product companies to empower their customers by providing them with complete information and instructions about the recycling and disposal of a wide range of household products and materials; and offer advertisers the opportunity to target a zero-waste lifestyle audience concerned about sustainability, recycling, and environmentally appropriate disposal. Consumers can access our directory and instructions for any zip code in the United States through multiple platforms, including the Earth911.com website, mobile applications for smartphones and tablets, traditional phone lines, social media, and branded recycling locators on client platforms and applications, in addition to engaging with our content and media on leading social platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram, Tumblr, YouTube, and Google+.

Industry Overview

The multi-billion dollar solid waste collection and disposal business drives the overall waste industry. The size of the recycling industry has increased for the past several years and is expected to continue to increase as landfill space decreases and businesses and consumers seek alternatives to delivering their recyclables and disposables to landfills. Although society and industry have increased the awareness of environmental issues, such as recycling, reuse, and proper disposal, waste production also continues to increase. There is increasing recognition by U.S. public agencies, consumers, and consumer products manufacturers that many items deposited in landfills have commodity value or usability as material for new products. Because of environmental concerns, local government regulations, and cost factors, it has become increasingly difficult to obtain the necessary permits to build any new landfills. Improvements in recycling and reuse technologies and efficient secondary markets for recycled commodities have made recycling an increasingly cost-attractive alternative.

Regulatory measures and more stringent control of material bound for disposal make the management of solid waste a difficult problem. The Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, and state and local governments are expected to continue the present trend of restricting the amount of potentially recyclable material bound for landfills. Many governmental authorities have passed, or are contemplating, measures that require industrial and commercial companies to recycle all or a portion of their disposable materials and restrict the percentage of recyclable materials in any commercial load of disposable material. Under extended producer responsibility laws, consumer packaged goods companies are required to put in place mechanisms to ensure that certain of their products can be appropriately disposed. This has required consumer packaged goods companies to take an increasingly proactive role in ensuring compliance. We believe that these restrictions may create additional opportunities as proper disposal of materials becomes more specialized. Some large industrial and commercial companies, hospitals, and universities have in-house staff that handle the solid waste management and recycling responsibilities, but have found that in-house handling of these responsibilities may not be an effective solution without adequate resources and staff support. We offer these companies and other establishments a solution to this increasing burden.

&#160;

&#160;

Our Strategy 

Our goal is to be a leading environmental services company. Key elements of our strategy to achieve our goal include the following:

&#160;

&#8226; 

Recycling Program and Management Services . We intend to continue to provide a comprehensive, one-stop recycling program solution for the entire waste stream and recyclables produced by our business customers. 

&#160;

&#8226; 

Emphasize Monetary Benefits of Recycling . We intend to emphasize the monetary advantages of recycling by demonstrating to businesses their ability to capture the commodity value of their waste streams and recyclables, reduce their disposal costs, enhance their management of environmental risks, enhance their legal and regulatory compliance, and create sustainability initiatives.

&#160;

&#8226; 

Expand Our Customer Base . We intend to continue to expand our customer base for our recycling management services. We believe that the expertise we have gained and the value proposition that we offer to our business customers in terms of lower overall removal costs, recyclable revenue sharing, flexible programs, broad service offerings, and a national footprint provide us with competitive advantages in expanding our customer base.

&#160;

&#8226; 

Expand the Types of Materials Covered by Our Services . We plan to expand the types of materials over which we manage the collection. To date, our revenue has been generated primarily from the removal of used oil, oil filters, scrap tires, grease and cooking oil, solid waste, and expired food products. We believe that we can provide value to our business customers by managing a larger portion of disposable and recyclable materials, including paper, plastic, glass, and metals.

&#160;

&#8226; 

Pursue Strategic Acquisitions . We plan to capitalize on the significant consolidation opportunities available in the environmental and recycling management industry. As a result of our considerable industry experience and relationships, we believe we are well positioned to identify and evaluate acquisition candidates and assess their growth prospects, the quality of their management teams, their local reputation with customers, and the suitability of their locations. We believe we are regarded as an attractive acquirer because of (1) the historical performance and the experience and reputation of our management team within the industry; (2) our decentralized operating strategy, which generally enables the managers of an acquired company to continue their involvement in company operations; (3) the ability of management and employees of an acquired company to participate in our growth and expansion through potential stock ownership and career advancement opportunities; and (4) the ability to offer liquidity to the owners of acquired companies through the receipt of common stock or cash.

&#160;

&#8226; 

Maintain Virtual Facilities and Equipment . We plan to continue to pursue an &#8220;asset light&#8221; virtual strategy that utilizes third-party vendors for the collection, sorting, and processing of recyclable materials for businesses. This strategy results in a scalable business model that enables us to concentrate on our core competencies of developing service solutions that are attractive to customers and the sale of recyclable materials at the highest prices; enables us to render our services on a national basis without the need for an extensive workforce, multiple facilities, or numerous vehicles; allows us to negotiate with multiple providers for the best price for our customers; and reduces our capital expenditures and working capital requirements.

&#160;

&#8226; 

Leverage Governmental and Social Factors Expanding Recycling . We intend to leverage the demands by governmental authorities and by the public to expand efforts to recycle materials because of concerns about sustainability, greenhouse gases, global warming, pollution, and other environmental concerns.

&#160;

&#8226; 

Expand Reach and Audience . We plan to expand our media presence and online community to appeal to and attract a larger base of customers, consumers, and product manufacturers to our recycling and environmental services and our environmentally based social media website.

&#160;

Recycling Services

Recycling and Waste Management

We provide an innovative, cost-effective, one-stop recycling program solution for the entire waste stream and recyclables produced by our business customers. Our solution provides a single point of contact for managing the wide variety of disposables and recyclables produced. Our management services can help our customers lower their operational expenses, maximize the value of their recyclable commodities, and help them foster environmental stability. We are capable of providing recycling management services for virtually all forms of recyclables and disposables, though our services currently primarily relate to used motor oil, oil filters, scrap tires, grease and cooking oil, and expired food products. We are also capable of providing our recycling management services for a variety of other materials, including the following:

&#160;

&#8226; 

glass, cardboard, paper, metal;

&#160;

&#8226; 

plastic oil bottles;

&#160;

&#8226; 

industrial cleaning (separator cleaning and tank cleaning);

&#160;

&#8226; 

hazardous materials;

&#160;

&#8226; 

HDPE plastics;

&#160;

&#8226; 

construction debris;

&#160;

&#8226; 

universal waste (batteries, mercury, lights);

&#160;

&#8226; 

regulated medical waste;

&#160;

&#8226; 

electronics;

&#160;

&#8226; 

parts cleaners;

&#160;

&#8226; 

used absorbents; and

&#160;

&#8226; 

solid waste.

Our recycling management services value proposition to our business customers is simple. We seek to

&#160;

&#8226; 

lower our customers&#8217; operational expenses;

&#160;

&#8226; 

maximize the value of our customers&#8217; recyclable commodities;

&#160;

&#8226; 

lower the percentage of the waste stream that must be disposed of in landfills;

&#160;

&#8226; 

help our customers work toward environmental sustainability;

&#160;

&#8226; 

assist our customers with liability protection and services to assist with environmental compliance; and

&#160;

&#8226; 

provide our customers with a centralized point of contact.

Many materials that are disposed of have commodity value. Precious metals, plastics, used cooking oil, and automotive fluids can be recovered and converted into new products and resources. Recovering valuable materials is a key factor in zero-waste initiatives and presents a profitable opportunity for businesses. The recovery of valuable materials is a strong motivator to educate businesses and consumers about proper disposal.

We conduct our recycling management services on an international basis. We currently manage over 39,000 locations for various customers throughout the United States, including Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Canada. Our customers generally have multiple locations. We continue to broaden the range of industries we serve and the nature and extent of the services we provide, which enables us to constantly target new customers and cross-sell additional services to existing customers.

We are independent of any specific materials hauler or recycling facility operator. This independence allows us to seek the best services and the lowest prices for our business customers.

Our recycling management services often reduce the overall cost of our customers&#8217; disposable material removal. Our services reduce the level of disposable material delivered to landfills. In certain cases, we share with our customers the revenue generated by the recyclables we collect from their premises.

&#160;

&#160;

In addition to our general services in the recycling industry, we also provide our customers with the following specialized services: 

&#160;

&#8226; 

Fleet and Industry Services. We recognize the time and effort our customers put into maintaining proper service of their fleet vehicles. We can provide a selection of services or a turn-key option involving the handling of scrap tires, HDPE plastics, used oil, used oil filters, parts cleaners, paint wastes, industrial fluids, and used anti-freeze.

&#160;

&#8226; 

Food Service and Retail Services . We are associated with the nation&#8217;s leading used cooking oil and rendering companies. The marketplace for yellow and brown grease includes offering recycling solutions for the use of these products as biodiesel, alternative fuels, and various animal food additives.

&#160;

&#8226; 

Solid-Waste . We began offering solid-waste collection as a way of becoming a one-stop shop for existing and prospective customers. The solid-waste business provides incremental revenue streams, rounds out our offerings, and provides opportunities to expand into other specialized services.

Landfill Diversion

According to the EPA and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, more than one quarter of the nation&#8217;s food, or about 96 billion pounds of food per year, goes to waste. The EPA has found that discarded food is either the largest or next single largest component (depending on classification) of the nation&#8217;s solid waste. The United States spends an estimated $1 billion per year to dispose of excess food. The issue of how to reduce such waste is critical. We are currently developing targeted programs, based on our Reduce-Reuse-Recycle-Manage, platform, to address these issues. Our &#8220;Organics Program&#8221; seeks to reduce the amount of produce, bakery, and deli materials and expired dairy products in landfills and to find a better solution. 

The Organics Program 

A large portion of America&#8217;s disposable material is organics; produce, bakery and deli items, dairy products, and vegetation trimmings can all be recycled. Our Organics Program offers the following options:

&#160;

&#8226; 

Reduction . We will study a customer&#8217;s current organic material management situation and determine where best to alter current ordering and display options to reduce landfill use.

&#160;

&#8226; 

Animal Feed . Through our network of vendors, we can channel a percentage of organic material into a process in which the product is dehydrated and put back into animal feed. In addition, our Sustainable Selections Program provides the usable portions directly to animals.

&#160;

&#8226; 

Waste-to-Energy . This process involves the creation of energy in the form of electricity through the use of anaerobic digestion. Anaerobic digestion is a series of processes in which microorganisms break down biodegradable material in the absence of oxygen. This process is widely used as a renewable energy source because it produces a methane and carbon dioxide rich bio-gas suitable for energy production helping replace fossil fuels. Also, the nutrient-rich digestate can be used as fertilizer. We currently employ a network of service providers that utilize this method as a form of organic disposal.

&#160;

&#8226; 

Compost/Land Application/Soil Treatment . In composting or land application/soil treatments, organic materials are placed either in a custom vessel or spread out and allowed to decompose naturally. Composting sites have several options for turning and rotating the product to maximize the nutrient content of the end product and speed the turn-around time. Land application/soil treatment facilities typically do not regularly turn the product or add any components and allow nature to return the nutrients to the host soil on its own timetable. Composting facilities also typically bag or sell the product by the truck/train load to individuals or municipalities, whereas land application/soil treatment facilities leave the product where it is initially placed. We have employed these methods with several customers across the country.

Sustainability Programs

We offer a full spectrum of sustainability programs to help our customers reduce operating costs and maximize eco-efficiencies. Our sustainability programs include strategic planning, writing policies and procedures, LEED and Green Globe certification, life cycle assessment, energy modeling, building commissioning, and carbon emission reduction reporting.

Environmentally Based Social Media and Online Data Platforms

Environmentally Related Social Media

The Earth911.com network enables consumers, businesses, and public entities to access the nation&#8217;s most comprehensive online directory of local recycling and proper disposal. We believe that Earth 911.com is widely recognized to be the leading independent and non-partisan data resource on the &#8220;why, where, and how&#8221; for recycling in the United States.

Through the Earth911.com website, we provide data, information, and articles with the goal of engaging, educating, and entertaining consumers regarding the environment, recycling, and sustainability. The content of the Earth911.com website generates 

&#160;

&#160;

significant traffic from consumers interested in learning about environmental issues, environmentally friendly disposal methods, and locations in proximity to their homes where they can dispose of recyclables and environmentally unfriendly products, such as electronic devices, oil, and anti-freeze. The traffic on the Earth911.com website also is attractive to advertisers that desire to target potential consumers that are interested in the environment and recycling. We believe there is a need among tho se interested in the environment for a convenient, efficient, and centralized gathering place to obtain and share news and information. We also believe that corporate advertisers desire new ways to maximize the impact of their sponsorship and advertising p rograms and the opportunity to market their goods directly to a focused community of potential consumers. 

Content . Our editorial staff brings reuse, recycling, proper disposal, environmental, and lifestyle-oriented stories, news, and related tips to consumers. Stories often highlight the businesses or industry segments of our customers. Our expert content is distributed through many different strategic partners and publishers, including RecycleBank, YahooGreen, Huffington Post, and on customer sites in a cost-effective manner. Our content is intended to be politically neutral and on-point. 

Advertising . We regularly publish popular zero-waste lifestyle content across multiple platforms, including the Earth911.com website, our mobile applications, including Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram, Tumblr, YouTube, and Google+, e-mail, and content sharing with other media outlets, such as the Huffington Post and Mother Nature Network, where companies can communicate sustainability efforts, create conversations, and align with a highly engaged, action-oriented audience that makes buying decisions based on sustainability. This enhances brand image with key stakeholders, consumers, governmental entities, retailers, investors, and internal staff, and allows our customers to aim their advertising directly to audiences with an interest in recycling and sustainability. Due to our history, content, data, and expertise, we typically capture premium above the fold search placement for keywords such as recycle or recycling. 

Social, Local, Mobile . We engage consumers with relevant local content regardless of location or device and have worked to create engaged audiences across recognizable and prominent social networks, such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram, Tumblr, YouTube, Google+, and e-mail. We are focused on increased engagement and monetization across these platforms. 

The Earth911 Recycling Directory

We believe that our Earth911 Recycling Directory is the largest directory of information regarding recycling and proper disposal for consumers and consumer product companies. For recycling to occur, consumers must have access to current and accurate information about recycling wherever they are, at the moment they have an item to recycle. The Earth911 Recycling Directory delivers local information on recycling, anywhere and anytime, through leading platforms, including social and mobile.

Sales and Marketing

We primarily market our recycling management programs throughout the United States through a direct sales force and selected strategic partnerships. Our sales and marketing efforts focus on emphasizing the benefits of our comprehensive, one-stop program and the ability to lower our customers&#8217; operational expenses, maximize the value of their recyclable commodities, and foster the benefits of environmental sustainability. We plan to increase our sales and marketing efforts.

We believe our social media audience enables a broad range of advertisers and merchants to take advantage of the brand loyalty of our visitors. We believe targeted sponsorship and advertising programs are more effective than non-targeted banner advertising in supporting broad marketing objectives, including brand promotion, awareness, and the integration of advertising with editorial content. We believe that these sponsorship and advertising arrangements will have longer-term contracts and higher dollar values than banner advertising arrangements as a result of their targeted nature and the strong brand loyalty of our visitors. 

We have limited operations in Canada, and we may further expand our operations internationally as we provide services and products that address the needs of leading international retailers and consumer product companies. International operations would include expansion of certain services within Canada, then to the European Union.

&#160;

We have targeted various business segments for marketing our recycling services, media, environmental certification services, and sustainability programs. The table below summarizes certain of the in dustries that we target and the nature of the products and services that we market to those industries.

Customers

We generally enter into multi-year contracts, typically from one to three years, with our customers that are designed to provide us with recurring monthly revenue. These contracts structure our revenue primarily in three ways: a fixed fee, cost-plus, or revenue sharing from the sale of commodities.

Our recycling management business depends to a significant extent on revenue from our largest customer. Any material reduction in the business we do with that customer could have a material adverse effect on our company. Our largest customer accounted for approximately 44% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, 59% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014, and 76% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2013. Although we currently service that customer&#8217;s stores nationally, a decline in our business with that customer could occur at any time. One of our strategic goals is to continue to diversify our customer base while increasing our business with our largest customer. During 2015, we continued to add additional customers, which reduced our reliance on our largest customer by the end of 2015. We expect our reliance on our single largest customer to continue to decrease; however, we can provide no assurance that our reliance upon our single largest customer will diminish.

By developing and aggregating strategic solutions in our key verticals&#8212;recycling and waste services, media, and sustainability programs&#8212;we believe that we are unique in our ability to offer comprehensive national solutions in the highly fractionalized waste, disposal, and recycling and recycling management business. Through consumer engagement and reward, national media presence, logistics management, compliance, and commodity brokerage, our solution delivers the critical knowhow and experience necessary to implement and execute multi-point reuse, recycling, proper disposal, and waste management programs.

Our Earth911.com website provides advertisers with the opportunity to target an audience interested in recycling and sustainability and enables product manufacturers to place customized logos and Internet addresses that lead consumers to information about recycling and disposal of their products. The site also provides environmentally aware consumers with eco-friendly products and information.

&#160;

&#160;

Competitors 

Recycling and Waste Management Services

The recycling and waste disposal industry as a whole is dominated by large multi-billion dollar companies, such as Waste Management and Republic Services. To date, these large companies have concentrated on their traditional business of collecting waste for disposal in their landfills rather than recycling, which reduces the need for landfills. The strategies of these large companies could change at any time, and we could begin to experience substantially increased competition from them. These companies have greater market recognition, larger customer bases, and substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution, and other resources than we possess and that afford them competitive advantages over us. As a result, they may be able to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of services similar to those we offer, to provide comparable services at lower prices, and to introduce new solutions and respond to customer requirements more quickly than we can.

Environmentally Related Social Media

We are not aware of any current comprehensive competitor for our combination of consumer products and media information, but have fragmented competition in directory or information services. Future competitors may secure more favorable advertising contracts, a superior directory, provide more content, and may devote greater resources to marketing and promotional campaigns, adopt more aggressive growth strategies, and devote substantially more resources to website development and content distribution than we do. We also compete with many other websites and other forms of media for advertising revenue.

Scope of Competitors&#8217; Services

Our services address motor oil, scrap tires, grease, meat, organics, hazardous waste, regulated medical waste, construction debris, cardboard, pallets, plastics, metals, and solid waste. Most of our competitors specialize in only one or a few of these service areas. In delivering our services, we have provided business at times to our competitors thereby utilizing them as our vendors.

While we have many competitors for certain aspects of our business, we are unaware of any provider that provides all of our services, media, recycling data services, environmental certification, and sustainability program offerings.

State and Federal Environmental Regulations

We use our best efforts to be in compliance with federal, state, and local environmental laws, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act, as amended, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, the Clean Air Act, as amended, and the Clean Water Act. Such compliance has not historically constituted a material expense to us.

The collection and disposal of solid waste and rendering of related environmental services as well as recycling operations and issues are subject to federal, state, and local requirements, which regulate health, safety, the environment, zoning, and land-use. Federal, state, and local regulations vary, but generally govern hauling, disposal, and recycling activities and the location and use of facilities and also impose restrictions to prohibit or minimize air and water pollution. In addition, governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with these regulations and to obtain injunctions or impose fines in the case of violations, including criminal penalties. The EPA and various other federal, state, and local environmental, health, and safety agencies and authorities, including the Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the Department of Labor, administer those regulations.

We strive to conduct our operations in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and to assist our customers in their compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. While such amounts expended in environmental compliance in the past or that we anticipate spending in the future have not had and are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operations, the possibility remains that technological, regulatory, or enforcement developments, the results of environmental studies, or other factors could materially alter this expectation.

&#160;

&#160;

Each state in which we operate has its own laws and regulations governing solid waste disposal, water and air pollution and, in most cases, releases and cleanup of hazardous substances and liability for such matters. Several governmental authorities have enacted laws that will require counties to adopt comprehensive plans to reduce the volume of solid waste landfills through waste planning, composting, recycling, or other programs. Legislative and regulatory measures to mandate or encourage waste reduction at the sour ce and materials recycling also are under consideration by Congress and the EPA. 

Finally, various states have enacted, or are considering enacting, laws that restrict the disposal within the state of solid or hazardous wastes generated outside the state. While courts have declared unconstitutional laws that overtly discriminate against out of state waste, courts have upheld some laws that are less overtly discriminatory. Challenges to other such laws are pending.

Equipment and Installation

We currently pursue an &#8220;asset light&#8221; strategy that utilizes third-party vendors for the collection, sorting, and processing of recyclable and waste materials for businesses. We do not own any recycling or waste management assets, such as trucks or landfills. As part of our one-stop solution, we maintain strong relationships with a multitude of vendors to ensure that proper equipment, including recycling containers, container shredders, and bulk oil containers referred to as &#8220;Faith Tanks,&#8221; and installation services are provided to our business customers. Our more than 3,500 third-party relationships currently provide us with an estimated 30,000 trained individuals, 24,000 trucks, and 600 recycling facilities. This strategy results in a scalable business model that enables us to concentrate on our core competencies of developing service solutions that are attractive to customers and the sale of recyclable materials at the highest prices, enables us to render our services on a national basis without the need for multiple facilities or numerous vehicles, allows us to negotiate with multiple providers for the best price for our customers, and reduces our capital expenditures and working capital requirements. 

Employees

As of December 31, 2015, we employed a total of 112 persons, of which three were executive employees, 92 were administrative and client services employees, and 17 were sales and marketing employees. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. None of our employees are represented by a union in collective bargaining with us.

Intellectual Property

Trademarks

Our History

We were incorporated in Nevada in July 2002 under the name BlueStar Financial Group, Inc. Prior to 2010, we were a &#8220;shell company&#8221; under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. On March 30, 2010, we (i) closed a transaction to acquire Youchange, Inc., an Arizona corporation, or Youchange, as a wholly owned subsidiary, (ii) ceased being a shell company, and (iii) experienced a change in control in which the former stockholders of Youchange acquired control of our company. In May 2010, we changed our name to YouChange Holdings Corp.

On October 17, 2012, immediately prior to closing a merger transaction with Earth911, Inc., or Earth911, we filed Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation to (i) change our name to Infinity Resources Holdings Corp., (ii) increase our shares of common stock authorized for issuance, (iii) authorize shares of preferred stock to be designated in series or classes as our board of directors may determine, (iv) effect a 1-for-5 reverse split of our common stock, and (v) divide our board of directors into three classes, as nearly equal in number as possible. On October 17, 2012, we closed the merger transaction, or the Earth911 Merger, to acquire Earth911 as a wholly owned subsidiary and experienced a change in control in which the former stockholders of Earth911 acquired control of our company.

&#160;

&#160;

On July 16, 2013, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of Quest Resource Management Group, LLC, or Quest, held by Quest Resource Group LLC, or QRG, comprising 50% of the membership interests of Quest, or the Quest Interests. Our wholly owned subsidiary, Earth911, held the remaining 50% of the membership interests of Quest for several years. Concurrently with our acquisition of the Quest Interests, we assigned the Quest Interests to Earth911 so that Earth911 now holds 100% of the issued and outstanding membership interests of Quest. On October 28, 2013, we changed our name to Quest Resource Holding Corporation, increased our shares of common stock authorized for issuance, and changed our trading symbol to &#8220;QRHC.&#8221;
