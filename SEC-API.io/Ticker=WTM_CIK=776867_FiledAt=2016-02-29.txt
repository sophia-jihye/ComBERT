 Item 1. Business 

GENERAL 

&#160; 

White Mountains Insurance Group, Ltd. (the &#8220;Company&#8221; or the &#8220;Registrant&#8221;) is an exempted Bermuda limited liability company whose principal businesses are conducted through its insurance, reinsurance and insurance services subsidiaries and affiliates. Within this report, the term &#8220;White Mountains&#8221; is used to refer to one or more entities within the consolidated organization, as the context requires. The Company&#8217;s headquarters is located at 14 Wesley Street, Hamilton, Bermuda HM 11, its principal executive office is located at 80 South Main Street, Hanover, New Hampshire 03755-2053 and its registered office is located at Clarendon House, 2 Church Street, Hamilton, Bermuda HM 11. White Mountains&#8217;s reportable segments are OneBeacon, HG Global/BAM and Other Operations. During the third quarter of 2015, White Mountains signed a definitive agreement to sell Sirius International Insurance Group, Ltd., an exempted Bermuda limited liability company, and its subsidiaries (collectively, &#8220;Sirius Group&#8221;) to CM International Holding PTE Ltd., the Singapore-based investment arm of China Minsheng Investment Corp., Ltd. (&#8220;CMI&#8221;) (See Note 2 - &#8220;Significant Transactions&#8221;). &#32;&#32;Accordingly, Sirius Group has been presented as discontinued operations and assets and liabilities held for sale in the financial statements. Prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year&#8217;s presentation. (See Note 22 - &#8220;Discontinued Operations&#8221;) . 

The OneBeacon segment consists of OneBeacon Insurance Group, Ltd. (&#8220;OneBeacon Ltd.&#8221;), an exempted Bermuda limited liability company that owns a family of property and casualty insurance companies (collectively, &#8220;OneBeacon&#8221;). OneBeacon is a specialty property and casualty insurance writer that offers a wide range of insurance products in the United States primarily through independent agencies, regional and national brokers, wholesalers and managing general agencies. During 2013, OneBeacon formed Split Rock Insurance, Ltd. (&#8220;Split Rock&#8221;), a Bermuda-based reinsurance company. As of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014, White Mountains owned 75.5% &#32;and 75.3% of OneBeacon Ltd.&#8217;s outstanding common shares. In December 2014, OneBeacon completed the sale of its runoff business. Accordingly, OneBeacon&#8217;s runoff business is presented as discontinued operations in White Mountains&#8217;s financial statements. (See Note 22 - &#8220;Discontinued Operations&#8221;) . 

The HG Global/BAM segment consists of HG Global Ltd. (&#8220;HG Global&#8221;) and the consolidated results of Build America Mutual Assurance Company (&#8220;BAM&#8221;). BAM is a municipal bond insurer domiciled in New York that was established in 2012 to provide insurance on bonds issued to support essential U.S. public purposes such as schools, utilities, core governmental functions and existing transportation facilities. HG Global, together with its subsidiaries, provided the initial capitalization of BAM through the purchase of $503 million of surplus notes issued by BAM (the &#8220;BAM Surplus Notes&#8221;). HG Global, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, HG Re Ltd. (&#8220;HG Re&#8221;), also provides 15%-of-par, first loss reinsurance protection for policies underwritten by BAM. As of both December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014, White Mountains owned 96.9% &#32;of HG Global&#8217;s preferred equity and 88.4% of its common equity. White Mountains does not have an ownership interest in BAM, which is a mutual insurance company owned by its members. However, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) require White Mountains to consolidate BAM&#8217;s results in its financial statements. BAM&#8217;s results do not affect White Mountains&#8217;s adjusted book value per share and are attributed to non-controlling interests. 

White Mountains&#8217;s Other Operations segment consists of the Company and its intermediate holding companies, its wholly-owned investment management subsidiary, White Mountains Advisors LLC (&#8220;WM Advisors&#8221;), White Mountains&#8217;s variable annuity reinsurance business, White Mountains Life Reinsurance (Bermuda) Ltd. (&#8220;Life Re Bermuda&#8221;), which is in runoff with all of its contracts maturing by June 30, 2016, and Life Re Bermuda&#8217;s U.S.-based service provider, White Mountains Financial Services LLC (collectively, &#8220;WM Life Re&#8221;), White Mountains&#8217;s ownership positions in Tranzact Holdings, LLC (together with its subsidiaries &#8220;Tranzact&#8221;), QL Holdings, LLC (together with its subsidiaries &#8220;MediaAlpha&#8221;) and Wobi Insurance Agency Ltd. (&#8220;Wobi&#8221;), as well as various other entities and investments. The Other Operations segment also includes Star &#38; Shield Services LLC, Star &#38; Shield Risk Management LLC, and Star &#38; Shield Claims Services LLC (collectively &#8220;Star &#38; Shield&#8221;). Star &#38; Shield provides management services for a fee to Star &#38; Shield Insurance Exchange (&#8220;SSIE&#8221;), a reciprocal that is owned by its members, who are policyholders. As of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014, White Mountains held $21 million and $17 million of surplus notes issued by SSIE (the &#8220;SSIE Surplus Notes&#8221;) but does not have an ownership interest in SSIE. However, as a result of Star &#38; Shield&#8217;s role as the attorney-in-fact to SSIE and the investment in SSIE Surplus Notes, White Mountains is required to consolidate SSIE in its GAAP financial statements. SSIE&#8217;s results do not affect White Mountains&#8217;s common shareholders&#8217; equity, as they are attributable to non-controlling interests. 

In October 2011, White Mountains completed its sale of Esurance Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries (&#8220;Esurance Insurance&#8221;) and Answer Financial Inc. and its subsidiaries (&#8220;AFI&#8221;) (collectively, &#8220;Esurance&#8221;) to The Allstate Corporation (&#8220;Allstate&#8221;) for a cash payment of $1.01 billion, which was equal to $700 million plus the estimated pro forma tangible book value at closing of the legal entities sold of approximately $310 million. 

&#160; 

White Mountains&#8217;s Operating Principles 

&#160; 

White Mountains strives to operate within the spirit of four operating principles. These are: 

&#160; 

Underwriting Comes First. &#160; An insurance enterprise must respect the fundamentals of insurance. There must be a realistic expectation of underwriting profit on all business written, and demonstrated fulfillment of that expectation over time, with focused attention to the loss ratio and to all the professional insurance disciplines of pricing, underwriting and claims management. 

Maintain a Disciplined Balance Sheet. &#160; The first concern here is that insurance liabilities must always be fully recognized. Loss reserves and expense reserves must be solid before any other aspect of the business can be solid. Pricing, marketing and underwriting all depend on informed judgment of ultimate loss costs and that can be managed effectively only with a disciplined balance sheet. 

&#160; 

Invest for Total Return. Historically, GAAP accounting has tended to hide unrealized gains and losses on the investment portfolio and over reward reported investment income (interest and dividends). Regardless of the accounting, White Mountains must invest for the best growth in value over time. In addition to investing our bond portfolios for total after-tax return, that will mean prudent investment in equities consistent with leverage and insurance risk considerations. 

Think Like Owners. &#32;&#32;Thinking like owners has a value all its own. There are stakeholders in a business enterprise and doing good work requires more than this quarter&#8217;s profit. But thinking like an owner embraces all that without losing the touchstone of a capitalist enterprise. 

ONEBEACON 

OneBeacon, with its U.S. corporate headquarters in Plymouth, Minnesota, is a specialty property and casualty insurance writer that offers a wide range of insurance products in the United States primarily through independent agencies, regional and national brokers, wholesalers and managing general agencies. As a specialty underwriter, OneBeacon believes that it will generate superior returns as compared to an underwriter that takes a more &#8220;generalist&#8221; underwriting approach and that its knowledge regarding its specialized insurance products, targeted industries, classes of business, risk characteristics and limited number of specialized competitors provides it with a competitive edge when determining the terms and conditions on individual accounts. 

Historically, OneBeacon offered a range of specialty, commercial and personal products and services. However, as a result of a series of transactions over the past several years, OneBeacon is now focused exclusively on specialty businesses. The most recent of these transactions was the sale of runoff business consisting of assets, liabilities and capital related principally to OneBeacon&#8217;s non-specialty business, including the vast majority of its asbestos and environmental reserves (the &#8220;Runoff Business&#8221;) to an affiliate of Armour Group Holdings Limited, which closed on December 23, 2014 (the &#8220;Runoff Transaction&#8221;). See Note 2 - &#8220;Significant Transactions&#8221; of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

With the closing of the Runoff Transaction, OneBeacon completed its transformation into a specialty insurance company and its balance sheet and risk profile have changed significantly. Its exposure to claims from policies related to the Runoff Business, such as commercial general liability, including asbestos and environmental exposures and workers compensation policies, is now limited to the value of the surplus notes issued in conjunction with the Runoff Transaction, which have a fair value of $51.5 million as of December 31, 2015. OneBeacon&#8217;s total outstanding reserves as of December 31, 2015 for 2004 and prior accident years total $0.1 million and for 2006 and prior accident years total $7.1 million. 

&#32;As of both December 31, 2015 and 2014 , OneBeacon had $3.6 billion &#32;of total assets and $1.0 billion of common shareholders&#8217; equity. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , White Mountains reported $246 million and $259 million of non-controlling interest related to its ownership in OneBeacon. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , White Mountains owned 75.5% &#32;and 75.3% of OneBeacon Ltd.&#8217;s outstanding common shares. OneBeacon wrote $1.1 billion , $1.2 billion &#32;and $1.1 billion in net written premiums in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 

Business Overview 

Generally, property and casualty insurance companies write insurance policies in exchange for premiums paid by their customers (the insureds). An insurance policy is a contract between the insurance company and the insured where the insurance company agrees to pay for losses suffered by the insured or a third party claimant that are covered under the contract. Such contracts are often subject to subsequent legal interpretation by courts, legislative action and arbitration. 

Insurance companies incur a significant amount of their total expenses from policy obligations, which are commonly referred to as claims. In settling claims, various loss adjustment expenses (&#8220;LAE&#8221;) are incurred such as insurance adjusters&#8217; fees and litigation expenses. Loss and LAE are categorized by the year in which the claim is incurred, or &#8220;accident year.&#8221; In the following calendar years, as OneBeacon increases or decreases its estimate for the ultimate loss and LAE for claims incurred in prior accident years, they will record favorable or unfavorable loss reserve development, which is recorded in the current calendar year period. In addition, insurance companies incur policy acquisition expenses, such as commissions paid to agents and premium taxes, and other expenses related to the underwriting process, including employee compensation and benefits. The key measure of relative underwriting performance for an insurance company is the combined ratio. An insurance company&#8217;s GAAP combined ratio is calculated by adding the ratio of incurred loss and LAE to earned premiums (the &#8220;loss and LAE ratio&#8221;) and the ratio of policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses to earned premiums (the &#8220;expense ratio&#8221;). A combined ratio under 100% indicates that an insurance company is generating an underwriting profit. However, when considering investment returns, insurance companies operating at a combined ratio of greater than 100% can be profitable. 

OneBeacon writes both property insurance and casualty insurance. Property insurance generally covers the financial consequences of accidental losses to the insured&#8217;s property, such as a business&#8217;s building, inventory and equipment or personal property. Premiums from ocean and inland marine, certain commercial multiple peril and fire and allied lines generally represent OneBeacon&#8217;s property lines of business, and claims from such business are typically reported and settled in a relatively short period of time. Casualty insurance (often referred to as liability insurance) generally covers the financial consequences of a legal liability of an individual or an organization resulting from negligent acts or omissions causing bodily injury and/or property damage to a third party. Premiums from general liability, workers compensation, commercial auto liability and certain commercial multiple peril policies generally represent OneBeacon&#8217;s casualty lines of business, and claims from such business can take years, even decades, to settle. OneBeacon&#8217;s Specialty Products and Specialty Industry divisions each write business in both the property and casualty lines, as well as other lines of business such as accident and health insurance, credit insurance and surety business. In July 2015, OneBeacon exited the multiple peril crop insurance (&#8220;MPCI&#8221;) business and the related crop-hail business (collectively, &#8220;Crop Business&#8221;) and as a result has no material net exposure related to the Crop Business (See &#8220;OneBeacon Crop Insurance&#8221; &#32; on page 6). Additionally, in 2014 OneBeacon exited its lawyers professional liability business. 

OneBeacon&#8217;s net written premiums by line of business for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 &#32;consist of the following:

(1) &#32;Crop net written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily relates to premiums ceded under a 100% quota-share agreement for the remaining net Crop Business exposure for the 2015 reinsurance year. 

OneBeacon derives substantially all of its revenues from premiums, investment income and net realized and unrealized investment gains and losses on investment securities. Premiums received from insureds are recognized as revenue over the period of time that insurance coverage is provided (i.e., ratably over the life of the policy). Unearned premiums represent the portion of premiums written that are applicable to future insurance coverage provided by policies. A significant period of time often elapses between receipt of insurance premiums and payment of insurance claims. During this time, OneBeacon invests the premiums, earns investment income and generates net realized and unrealized gains and losses on investment activities. 

Insurance Business 

OneBeacon&#8217;s insurance business is comprised of sixteen underwriting units that are reported in two insurance divisions: Specialty Products and Specialty Industries. OneBeacon has added, and expects to continue to add, new businesses both organically and through acquisition, guided by its focus on profitable growth while prudently managing underwriting risk. OneBeacon&#8217;s net written premiums by division for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 &#32;consist of the following:

Marketing and Distribution 

OneBeacon offers its products and services through a network of approximately 2,400 independent agents, regional and national brokers, wholesalers and managing general agencies. OneBeacon selectively enters these relationships with producers who demonstrate an understanding of OneBeacon&#8217;s target markets, capabilities and the specialized needs of their clients. OneBeacon believes this selective distribution approach creates greater insight into the underwriting and management of the risks associated with OneBeacon&#8217;s particular lines of business. Further, OneBeacon believes that agents and brokers will continue to represent a significant share of the business OneBeacon seeks to write going forward. 

Underwriting and Pricing 

OneBeacon believes there must be a realistic expectation of attaining an underwriting profit on all the business it writes, as well as a demonstrated fulfillment of that expectation over time. Consistent with the &#8220;underwriting comes first&#8221; operating principle, adequate pricing is a critical component for achieving an underwriting profit. OneBeacon underwrites its book with a disciplined approach towards pricing its insurance products and is willing to forgo a business opportunity if it believes it is not priced appropriately to the exposure. 

OneBeacon actively monitors pricing activity and measures its use of tiers, credits, debits and limits, and expends considerable effort to measure and verify exposures and insured values. In addition, OneBeacon regularly updates base rates to achieve targeted returns on capital and attempts to shift writings away from lines and classes where pricing is inadequate. To the extent changes in premium rates, policy forms or other matters are subject to regulatory approval (see &#8220;REGULATION&#8212;United States&#8221; &#32;on page 22 and &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212; Regulation may restrict our ability to operate &#8221; &#32;on page 33), OneBeacon proactively monitors its pending regulatory filings to facilitate, to the extent possible, their prompt processing and approval. 

Competition 

Property and casualty insurance is highly competitive. OneBeacon&#8217;s businesses each compete against a different subset of companies. In general, OneBeacon competes in one or more of its businesses with most of the large multi-line insurance companies, such as Chubb, AIG, Beazley, CNA, Hartford, Liberty Mutual, Travelers and Zurich. OneBeacon also competes with most of the specialty companies, such as Tokio Marine HCC, The Navigators Group, Inc., Markel Corporation, RLI Corp. and W.R. Berkley Corporation. Lastly, some of OneBeacon&#8217;s businesses compete with various local and regional insurance companies, and niche carriers such as Axis. 

The more significant competitive factors for most insurance products OneBeacon offers are price, product terms and conditions, agency and broker relationships, claims service, company scale and financial stability. OneBeacon&#8217;s underwriting principles and dedication to independent distribution partners are unlikely to make it the low-cost provider in most markets. While it is often difficult for insurance companies to differentiate their products, OneBeacon believes that by providing superior specialty products to satisfy market needs and relying on agents and brokers who value its targeted expertise, superior claims service, and disciplined underwriting, it establishes a competitive advantage. 

Claims Management 

Effective claims management is a critical factor in achieving satisfactory underwriting results. OneBeacon maintains an experienced staff of claims handlers and managers strategically located throughout its operating territories. 

OneBeacon has dedicated claims managers and adjusters for many of its specialty businesses. These individuals ensure that OneBeacon has the appropriate level of expertise to handle claims involving complex issues. Within the claims organization, OneBeacon also uses various shared services to both more efficiently manage costs and ensure the delivery of superior claims results. These shared services include non-specialty property and casualty insurance claims adjusters, operational and information technology support, subrogation and recovery support, legal bill review, a special investigation unit to detect insurance fraud, and dedicated legal support. 

OneBeacon has adopted a total claims cost management approach that gives equal importance to controlling claims handling expenses, legal expenses and claim payments. OneBeacon collects and reviews various metrics to analyze claims handling results. 

OneBeacon&#8217;s claims department uses an online claims system to record reserves, payments and adjuster activity. The system also helps claim handlers identify recovery potential, estimate property damage, evaluate claims and identify fraud. OneBeacon maintains a paperless claim file system. 

Catastrophe Risk Management and Reinsurance Protection 

OneBeacon&#8217;s insurance subsidiaries enter into reinsurance contracts from time to time to protect their businesses from losses due to concentration of risk, to manage their operating leverage ratios and to limit losses arising from catastrophic events. Catastrophes are severe losses resulting from a wide variety of events. While its exposure to catastrophe losses has decreased meaningfully as a result of its repositioning in recent years as a specialty-only company, OneBeacon is still exposed to catastrophe losses. The timing and size of catastrophe losses are unpredictable and the level of losses experienced in any year could be material to OneBeacon&#8217;s operating results and financial condition. Examples of catastrophes include losses caused by earthquakes, wildfires, hurricanes and other types of storms and terrorist acts. The extent of losses caused by a catastrophic event is a function of severity and the amount and type of insured exposure in the affected area. In the normal course of business, OneBeacon&#8217;s insurance subsidiaries seek to limit losses that may arise from catastrophes or other events through individual risk selection, imposing deductibles and limits, limiting its concentration of insurance in catastrophe-prone areas, such as coastal regions, and reinsuring with third-party reinsurers. 

OneBeacon uses models (primarily AIR Worldwide (&#8220;AIR&#8221;) Touchstone version 3.0) to estimate potential losses from catastrophes. OneBeacon uses this model output in conjunction with other data to manage its exposure to catastrophe losses based on a probable maximum loss (&#8220;PML&#8221;) forecast to quantify its exposure to an extreme catastrophe event. 

OneBeacon purchases a general catastrophe reinsurance treaty with unaffiliated reinsurers to manage its exposure to large catastrophe losses. Effective May 1, 2015, OneBeacon renewed its property catastrophe reinsurance program through April 30, 2016. The program provides coverage for OneBeacon&#8217;s property business as well as certain acts of terrorism. Under the program, the first $20.0 million of losses resulting from any single catastrophe are retained, with 95.0% of the next $10.0 million of losses and 100.0% of the next $100.0 million of losses resulting from the catastrophe being reinsured. OneBeacon retains all of the catastrophe loss in excess of $130.0 million. In the event of a catastrophe, OneBeacon's property catastrophe reinsurance program is reinstated for the remainder of the original contract term by paying a reinstatement premium that is based on the percentage of coverage reinstated and the original property catastrophe coverage premium. OneBeacon anticipates that the $130.0 million limit is more than sufficient to cover the maximum hurricane and earthquake losses with a modeled 0.4% probability of occurrence (1-in-250-year). This $130.0 million limit is consistent with the limit that OneBeacon&#8217;s previous catastrophe reinsurance program provided. 

OneBeacon also purchases property-per-risk reinsurance coverage to reduce large loss volatility. The property-per-risk reinsurance program reinsures 100% of losses in excess of $3 million, down from $5 million in the previous property-per-risk reinsurance coverage, up to $100 million. Individual risk facultative reinsurance is purchased above $100 million. The property-per-risk treaty provides one limit of reinsurance protection for losses in excess of $3 million up to $100 million on an individual risk basis for certified acts of foreign terrorism committed on behalf of any foreign person or foreign interest. However, any nuclear events, or biological, chemical or radiological terrorist attacks are not covered. 

In addition to the corporate catastrophe and property-per-risk reinsurance protection, OneBeacon also purchases reinsurance protection for certain lines of business. Specialty Property purchases a property catastrophe program providing 100% coverage for $34 million of loss in excess of $6 million of loss, which inures to the benefit of the broader property catastrophe reinsurance program described previously. This treaty limit cannot be reinstated. 

OneBeacon&#8217;s MPCI portfolio for the 2015 crop year is fully reinsured through a combination of reinsurance programs, mainly the 100% quota share reinsurance agreement with an insurance operating affiliate of AmTrust for the remaining net exposure. 

In addition to the coverage provided under these treaties, OneBeacon utilizes a number of other catastrophe and general insurance treaties covering specific lines of business. See Note 4&#8212;&#8220;Third-Party Reinsurance&#8221; &#32;of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for descriptions of the significant types of our reinsurance agreements. 

As reinsurance contracts do not relieve OneBeacon of its obligation to its policyholders, collectability of balances due from reinsurers is important to OneBeacon&#8217;s financial strength. 

Terrorism 

OneBeacon&#8217;s current third party reinsurance programs provide varying degrees of coverage for terrorism events. OneBeacon&#8217;s overall terrorism exposure is reduced by the Terrorism Act, which is a federal program administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury that provides for a shared system of public and private compensation for commercial property and casualty losses resulting from events that reach the threshold for losses ($120 million in 2016 and increasing $20 million per year in subsequent years until the threshold becomes $200 million in 2020) and are certified as an act of terrorism by the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, in concurrence with the U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General of the United States. The current program was signed into law on January 12, 2015 and is authorized through December 31, 2020. See Note 4&#8212;&#8220;Third-Party Reinsurance&#8221; &#32;of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a further description of the Terrorism Act, including OneBeacon&#8217;s estimated retention level. 

All losses that result from a nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological terrorist attack are excluded from the Company's current third party reinsurance program. OneBeacon's property catastrophe treaty also excludes acts of terrorism certified pursuant to the Terrorism Act and committed by an individual or individuals acting on behalf of any foreign person or foreign interest. OneBeacon's casualty clash treaty provides coverage for losses that result from certified and non-certified acts of terrorism, on an aggregated basis, subject to a maximum of one full treaty limit. OneBeacon's property per risk, casualty and workers compensation treaties each provide full coverage for certified acts of terrorism on behalf of a non-foreign person or interest, but are sublimited to one full treaty limit for certified acts of terrorism committed on behalf of any foreign person or foreign interest. OneBeacon's healthcare treaty is sublimited to one full treaty limit of coverage for all acts of terrorism. 

OneBeacon closely monitors and manages its concentration of risk for terrorism losses by geographic area. OneBeacon controls its exposures so that the total maximum expected loss from a terrorism event within any half-mile radius in a metropolitan area or around a target risk will not exceed $450 million on a pre-tax basis before considering the federal government participation under the Terrorism Act. Reports monitoring OneBeacon&#8217;s terrorism exposures are generated quarterly. In addition, OneBeacon&#8217;s underwriting process evaluates all potential new business to determine if it would add exposure to an already existing concentration of risk or would individually add significant risk. As a result, OneBeacon believes that it has appropriately limited its exposure to losses from terrorist attacks. Nonetheless, risks insured by OneBeacon remain exposed to terrorist attacks and, even considering the coverage provided by the Terrorism Act, the possibility remains that losses resulting from future terrorist attacks could prove to be material. 

Loss and LAE Reserves 

OneBeacon establishes loss and LAE reserves that are estimates of amounts needed to pay claims and related expenses in the future for insured events that have already occurred. The process of estimating reserves involves a considerable degree of judgment by management and, as of any given date, is inherently uncertain. See &#8220;CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES &#8212; Loss and LAE Reserves &#8212; OneBeacon&#8221; &#32;on page 76 for a full discussion regarding OneBeacon&#8217;s loss reserving process. 

The following information presents (1) OneBeacon&#8217;s reserve development over the preceding ten years and (2) a reconciliation of reserves on a regulatory basis to reserves determined in accordance with GAAP, each as prescribed by Securities Act Industry Guide No. 6. 

Section I of the 10 year table shows the estimated liability that was recorded at the end of each of the indicated years for all current and prior accident year unpaid loss and LAE. The liability represents the estimated amount of loss and LAE for claims that were unpaid at the balance sheet date, including incurred but not reported (&#8220;IBNR&#8221;) reserves. In accordance with GAAP, the liability for unpaid loss and LAE is recorded in the balance sheet gross of the effects of reinsurance with an estimate of reinsurance recoverables arising from reinsurance contracts reported separately as an asset. The net balance represents the estimated amount of unpaid loss and LAE outstanding as of the balance sheet date, reduced by estimates of amounts recoverable under reinsurance contracts. 

Section II shows the cumulative amount of net loss and LAE paid relating to recorded liabilities as of the end of each succeeding year. Section III shows the re-estimated amount of the previously recorded net liability as of the end of each succeeding year. Estimates of the liability for unpaid loss and LAE are increased or decreased as payments are made and more information regarding individual claims and trends, such as overall frequency (the average number of claims submitted per policy during a given period of time) and severity (the average value per claim during a given period of time) patterns, becomes known. Section IV shows the cumulative net (deficiency)/redundancy representing the aggregate change in the liability from original balance sheet dates and the re-estimated liability through December 31, 2015 . Section V shows the re-estimated gross liability and re-estimated reinsurance recoverables through December 31, 2015 . Section VI shows the cumulative gross (deficiency)/redundancy representing the aggregate change in the liability from original balance sheet dates and the re-estimated liability through December 31, 2015 .

OneBeacon&#8217;s Senior Notes 

In November 2012, OneBeacon U.S. Holdings, Inc. (&#8220;OBH&#8221;), an intermediate holding company of OneBeacon, issued $275 million face value of senior unsecured notes (the &#8220;OBH Senior Notes&#8221;) through a public offering, at an issue price of 99.9%. The net proceeds from the issuance of the OBH Senior Notes were used to repurchase OBH&#8217;s existing outstanding senior notes that were issued in May 2003. The OBH Senior Notes, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed as to the payment of principal and interest by OneBeacon Ltd., bear an annual interest rate of 4.6%, payable semi-annually in arrears on May 9 and November 9 until maturity on November 9, 2022. See Note 7 - &#8220;Debt&#8221; &#32;for more details regarding the OBH Senior Notes. 

HG GLOBAL/BAM 

The first mutual bond insurance company in the United States, BAM is owned by and operated for the benefit of the municipal issuers that use its municipal bond insurance. BAM, which is domiciled in New York, provides insurance on municipal bonds issued to support essential U.S. public purposes such as schools, utilities, core governmental functions and existing transportation facilities. BAM&#8217;s mission is to deliver market access and substantial interest cost savings for issuers of municipal bonds and durable protection against loss for municipal bondholders. HG Global is domiciled in Bermuda and was established to fund the startup of BAM, and through its subsidiary, HG Re, to provide reinsurance to BAM. In 2012, HG Global was capitalized with $609 million to purchase surplus notes from BAM and to fund HG Re. 

BAM charges a premium for the issuance of each municipal bond insurance policy. A portion of the premium is a member&#8217;s surplus contribution (&#8220;MSC&#8221;), which gives the issuer the right to receive dividends (subject to regulatory approval), and the remainder is a risk premium to compensate for the cost of risk. In the event of a refunding, MSC from the original issuance will be reutilized and serve as a credit toward the insurance cost on the refunding bonds. 

White Mountains believes that municipal bonds insured by BAM have strong appeal to retail investors, who buy smaller, less liquid issues, have less portfolio diversification and have fewer credit differentiation skills and analytical resources. BAM focuses on underwriting small-to-medium sized investment grade bonds, primarily in the AA-, A and BBB categories. BAM seeks to provide insurance to the municipal bond market while building a relatively low risk insurance portfolio with conservative single risk limits (initially the aggregate par value of the insured bonds with a common revenue stream is limited to $117 million or less, depending on rating). 

BAM launched in July 2012 after securing an &#8220;AA/stable&#8221; rating from Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s Financial Services LLC (&#8220;Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s&#8221;) (&#8220;AA&#8221; is the third highest of twenty-one financial strength ratings assigned by Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s). HG Global, together with its subsidiaries, funded the initial capitalization of BAM through the purchase of $503 million of BAM Surplus Notes. BAM and HG Re entered into a first loss reinsurance treaty (&#8220;FLRT&#8221;), under which HG Re will provide first loss protection up to 15% of par outstanding on each bond insured by BAM in exchange for 60% of the risk premium, net of a ceding commission, charged by BAM. 

HG Re&#8217;s obligations under the FLRT are satisfied by the assets in two collateral trusts: a Regulation 114 Trust and a Supplemental Trust. Losses required to be reimbursed to BAM by HG Re are subject to an aggregate limit equal to the assets held in the collateral trusts at any point in time. The Regulation 114 Trust target balance is equal to ceded unearned premiums and unpaid ceded loss and LAE expenses, if any. The Supplemental Trust target balance is equal to approximately $400 million. The collateral trust balances must be at target levels before excess capital can be distributed out of the Supplemental Trust to HG Re. At any point in time, if the sum of the Regulation 114 Trust balance and the Supplemental Trust balance equal zero, BAM may choose to terminate the FLRT on a runoff basis. However, HG Re can elect to continue the FLRT by depositing into the Regulation 114 Trust assets with a fair market value not less than the greater of (i) $100 million or (ii) 10% of the then Regulation 114 Trust target balance. At inception, the Supplemental Trust contained $300 million of BAM Surplus Notes and $100 million of cash and fixed income securities. As the BAM Surplus Notes are repaid over time, the BAM Surplus Notes will be replaced in the Supplemental Trust by cash and fixed income securities. 

&#160; 

The FLRT is perpetual with an initial term of 10 years. The FLRT can be amended after the first 10-year period and after each subsequent 5-year period on a prospective basis. If the parties are unable to mutually agree to amended terms, the dispute is resolved through arbitration, with the arbitrator determining amendments that would best achieve BAM and HG Global&#8217;s joint expectation of certain basic principles including maintenance of BAM&#8217;s rating, the provision to BAM of reliable first loss reinsurance, and HG Global achieving an equitable rate of return. Amended contract terms must be approved by the New York State Department of Financial Services (&#8220;NYDFS&#8221;). Should BAM consider the amended terms to be unacceptable, it has the option to purchase HG Re, or cause another reinsurer to purchase HG Re, at fair value. Pursuant to the FLRT, BAM&#8217;s underwriting guidelines may only be amended with the consent of HG Re. In addition, HG Global has the right to designate two directors for election to BAM&#8217;s board of directors. 

As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, White Mountains owned 96.9% &#32;of HG Global's preferred equity and 88.4% &#32;of its common equity. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , HG Global had $739 million &#32;and $704 million &#32;of total assets and $558 million and $583 million of shareholders&#8217; equity, $17 million &#32;and $18 million &#32;of which is included in non-controlling interest. 

As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , White Mountains reported $503 million and $488 million of total assets and $(140) million &#32;and $(122) million &#32;of members&#8217; equity related to BAM, all of which is included in non-controlling interest. 

Competition 

The municipal bond insurance industry is highly competitive. BAM competes for business with Assured Guaranty (&#8220;Assured&#8221;), National Public Finance Guarantee (&#8220;National&#8221;), the dedicated municipal insurance subsidiary of MBIA, Inc., and Berkshire Hathaway Assurance, although it has not been active recently. 

Pricing is heavily influenced by competition. BAM, Assured and National participate in a competitive marketplace and seek to differentiate themselves from one another in a number of ways, including financial strength ratings, claims paying resources and underwriting strategies. Over time, the strength of the mutual model gives BAM the ability to become the low cost industry utility, serving the municipal market exclusively. BAM believes it has a competitive advantage because unlike its competitors, it has no insured exposure to mortgage-backed bonds, derivatives or other structured financings and its insured portfolio consists only of essential public purpose U.S. municipal bonds issued by municipalities qualifying under Section 115 of the Internal Revenue Code that are within BAM&#8217;s low single risk limits. In addition, BAM seeks to increase the level of transparency with respect to its insured portfolio and each insured issuer. In order to allow issuers and investors in BAM-insured bonds to monitor financial strength first-hand, BAM periodically publishes Credit Profiles on every insured issuer. Credit Profiles are accessible by CUSIP, obligor, state or sector on BAM&#8217;s website. 

Pricing is also driven by credit spreads. Credit spread is the incremental yield that investors demand for taking credit risk. When the difference in credit spreads is narrow between higher and lower rated bonds, municipal bond insurance provides less cost savings to issuers than it would during periods when the difference in credit spreads between higher and lower rated bonds is wide, which results in decreased demand and/or lower premium levels for municipal bond insurance.

OTHER OPERATIONS 

White Mountains&#8217;s Other Operations segment consists of the Company and its intermediate holding companies, its wholly-owned investment management subsidiary (WM Advisors), its variable annuity reinsurance business (WM Life Re), which is in runoff, its ownership positions in Tranzact, MediaAlpha, Wobi and Star &#38; Shield, as well as various other investments and entities. 

&#160; 

WM Advisors 

WM Advisors is a registered investment adviser that manages substantially all of White Mountains&#8217;s investment portfolio, which consists of fixed maturity investments, short-term investments, common equity securities and other long-term investments, including hedge funds and private equity funds. Other long-term investments also include direct investments in privately held common and convertible securities and the OneBeacon surplus notes issued in connection with the Runoff Transaction (&#8220;OneBeacon Surplus Notes&#8221;). WM Advisors also has investment management agreements with third parties, most notably with Symetra Financial Corporation (&#8220;Symetra&#8221;). As of December 31, 2015 , WM Advisors had approximately $28 billion in assets under management, $6 billion of which related to consolidated subsidiaries of White Mountains and $22 billion of which related to Symetra. 

On February 1, 2016, Symetra closed its definitive merger agreement with Sumitomo Life. The sale of Sirius Group is expected to close in the first quarter of 2016 and is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. WM Advisors will continue to manage the investment portfolios of both Symetra and Sirius Group for a transition period after each respective sale. WM Advisors expects that the assets under management for both Symetra and Sirius Group will decrease in multiple stages over time and eventually result in the termination of the investment management agreements with both Symetra and Sirius Group. 

Tranzact 

In October 2014, White Mountains purchased 63.2% of Tranzact for a purchase price of $178 million. Immediately after the closing, Tranzact completed a recapitalization that allowed for the return of $44 million to White Mountains. Tranzact is a New Jersey-based provider of comprehensive direct-to-consumer customer acquisition solutions for leading insurance carriers. Tranzact has developed a technology-enabled platform to provide sophisticated direct marketing solutions, fully-provisioned sales and/or robust customer management systems to brand-focused insurance companies seeking to target and acquire a large number of customers on a direct basis. Tranzact currently operates in the health, life, and property &#38; casualty insurance verticals. Tranzact generates revenues through commissions and technology licensing, maintenance, and professional fees. In September 2015, Tranzact acquired 100.0% of the outstanding share capital of TruBridge, Inc. and TruBroker, LLC (collectively &#8220;TruBridge&#8221;) for a purchase price of $31 million plus an amount that is contingent on the marketing expense reimbursements expected to be received in 2016 and 2017, which as of December 31, 2015 is equal to $10 million. Tranzact acquired TruBridge primarily to expand its presence in the Medicare Advantage segment of the health insurance vertical. 

&#32;As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, White Mountains reported total assets of $368 million and $326 million related to Tranzact, including $320 million and $288 million of goodwill and intangible assets ($202 million and $170 million net of non-controlling interests), and common shareholders&#8217; equity of $216 million and $224 million ($136 million net of non-controlling interests in both periods). 

MediaAlpha 

In March 2014, White Mountains acquired 60% of the outstanding Class A common units of MediaAlpha for total consideration of approximately $36 million. MediaAlpha is an advertising technology company that develops programmatic platforms that bring transparency and efficiency to the buying and selling of insurance and other vertical-specific performance media (clicks, calls and leads). MediaAlpha&#8217;s exchange technology and sophisticated analytical tools facilitate transparent, real-time transactions between advertisers (buyers of advertising inventory) and publishers (sellers of advertising inventory). MediaAlpha works with over 200 advertisers and 200 publishers across a number of insurance (auto, motorcycle, home, renter, health, and life) and non-insurance (travel, education) verticals. 

As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , White Mountains reported total assets of $63 million and $66 million related to MediaAlpha, including $43 million and $51 million of goodwill and intangible assets ($25 million and $30 million net of non-controlling interests), and shareholders&#8217; equity of $36 million and $57 million ($22 million and $34 million net of non-controlling interests). 

Wobi 

Wobi is the only price comparison/aggregation business in Israel, with an insurance carrier panel that represents 85% of the premiums written in the Israeli insurance market. Wobi sells four insurance lines of business, primarily personal auto, and operates as an agency, charging upfront commissions on all insurance policy sales. Wobi also offers a pension products comparison service for Israeli customers and is paid transaction fees when customers use the service to connect to companies that sell those pension products. In February 2014, White Mountains acquired 54% of the outstanding common shares of Wobi for NIS 14 million ($4 million based upon the foreign exchange spot rate at the date of acquisition). During 2014, in addition to the common shares, White Mountains also purchased NIS 32 million ($9 million based upon the foreign exchange spot rates at the dates of acquisition) of newly-issued convertible preferred shares of Wobi. 

During 2015, White Mountains purchased NIS 80 million (approximately $21 million based upon the foreign exchange spot rate at the dates of acquisition) of convertible preferred shares of Wobi. In addition, during 2015 White Mountains also purchased NIS 12 million (approximately $3 million based upon the foreign exchange spot rate at the date of acquisition) of common shares of Wobi. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, White Mountains&#8217;s ownership share of Wobi was 96.1% and 63.3% on a fully converted basis. 

&#32;During 2015, Wobi acquired the outstanding share capital of Tnuva Financit Ltd., the owner of Cashboard, an Israeli company that provides online price comparisons of pension products, for total consideration of NIS 36 million (approximately $9 million). The acquisition of Cashboard accelerated Wobi's development of its pension products comparison service. 

As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , White Mountains reported total assets of $23 million and $16 million related to Wobi, including $10 million and $8 million of intangible assets ($10 million and $5 million net of non-controlling interests), and shareholders&#8217; equity of $15 million and $15 million ($14 million and $9 million net of non-controlling interests). 

Star &#38; Shield 

In January 2014, White Mountains acquired certain assets and liabilities of Star &#38; Shield Holdings LLC, including Star &#38; Shield Services LLC, Star &#38; Shield Risk Management LLC and Star &#38; Shield Claims Services LLC (collectively &#8220;Star &#38; Shield&#8221;) for a purchase price of $2 million. Star &#38; Shield provides management services for a fee to SSIE, a Florida-domiciled reciprocal insurance exchange that provides private passenger auto insurance to members of the public safety professional community and their families. 

During 2015 and 2014, White Mountains also purchased $4 million and $17 million of surplus notes issued by SSIE. Principal and interest on the SSIE Surplus Notes are payable to White Mountains only with approval from the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation. GAAP requires White Mountains to consolidate SSIE&#8217;s results in its financial statements. However, since SSIE is a reciprocal insurance exchange owned by its policyholders, its results do not affect White Mountains&#8217;s adjusted book value per share as they are attributed to non-controlling interests. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , Star &#38; Shield had $1 million and $2 million of total assets and $(1) million and $1 million of common shareholder&#8217;s equity. In addition, White Mountains reported $14 million and $13 million of assets and $(16) million and $(12) million of members&#8217; equity related to SSIE as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , all of which is included in non-controlling interest. 

WM Life Re 

WM Life Re reinsures death and living benefit guarantees associated with certain variable annuities issued in Japan. WM Life Re is in runoff and all of the underlying annuity contracts mature by June 30, 2016. WM Life Re has assumed the risk related to a shortfall between the account value and the guaranteed value that must be paid by the ceding company to an annuitant or to an annuitant&#8217;s beneficiary in accordance with the underlying annuity contracts. The guaranteed value of the annuity contracts is equal to the initial single premium paid by the annuitant. The annuity accounts are invested in four index funds: a Japanese government bond fund indexed to the Nomura Bond Performance Index (&#8220;Nomura BPI&#8221;) (roughly 35%), a foreign government bond fund indexed to the Citi World Group Government Bond Index, excluding Japan (&#8220;WGBI&#8221;) (roughly 35%), a Japanese equity fund indexed to the TOPIX Total Return Index (roughly 15%) and a foreign equity fund indexed to the MSCI Kokusai Total Return Index (roughly 15%). The account is rebalanced monthly to maintain these same investment allocations. The guarantee made by the ceding company to its annuitants was economically equivalent to guaranteeing that the underlying investment accounts would earn a return of approximately 2.7% per annum. The average account value of annuity contracts covered by WM Life Re was approximately 104% of their guarantee value at the inception of the reinsurance contracts. Accordingly, the guarantee made in WM Life Re&#8217;s contracts was economically equivalent to guaranteeing that the underlying investment accounts would earn a return of approximately 2.3% per annum. 

WM Life Re reinsured &#165;200 billion (approximately $1.7 billion at the then current exchange rate) of guarantees in September 2006 and an additional &#165;56 billion (approximately $0.5 billion at the then current exchange rate) in March 2007. WM Life Re has not subsequently written any additional business. During the second quarter of 2015, the variable annuity contracts reinsured by WM Life Re began to mature. As of December 31, 2015 , the total guarantee value was approximately &#165;51 billion (approximately $421 million at exchange rates on that date). The average annual premium charged by WM Life Re under these contracts is equal to 109% times the total guarantee value. 

WM Life Re uses derivative instruments, including put options, interest rate swaps, total return swaps on bond and equity indices, forward contracts and futures contracts on major equity indices, currency pairs and government bonds, to mitigate the market risks associated with changes in the fair value of the reinsured variable annuity guarantees. WM Life Re measures its net exposure to changes in relevant interest rates, foreign exchange rates, implied volatilities and equity markets on a daily basis and adjusts its economic hedge positions within risk guidelines established by a risk committee that contains members of White Mountains&#8217;s and WM Life Re&#8217;s senior management. WM Life Re continually records its liability and the related hedge assets at fair value. The guarantee is economically substantially similar to having sold put options on a basket of the four index funds. WM Life Re also monitors the effects of annuitant related experience against actuarial assumptions (surrender and mortality rates) on a weekly basis and adjusts relevant assumptions and economic hedge positions if required. 

Under the terms of its reinsurance contracts, WM Life Re is required to hold eligible assets (generally cash, short-term investments, fixed income securities, and hedge assets such as options and futures) equal to the fair value of the liability, as defined in the reinsurance contracts, for the benefit of the cedant. Increases in the fair value of the liability in excess of the increase in value of the hedge assets, such as occurs in the case of decreases in surrender assumptions or underperformance of the hedging portfolio, must therefore be funded on a current basis while the actual amounts that must be paid to settle the contracts may not be known and generally will not become payable for a number of months. White Mountains and Life Re Bermuda entered into a keep-well agreement, which obligates White Mountains to make capital contributions to Life Re Bermuda in the event that Life Re Bermuda&#8217;s shareholder&#8217;s equity falls below $75 million , provided however that in no event shall the amount of all capital contributions made by White Mountains under this agreement exceed $127 million . White Mountains contributed $8 million in 2015 and $70 million in 2013 into WM Life Re to fulfill this requirement and did not contribute any capital during 2014. As of December 31, 2015 , Life Re Bermuda had $77 million &#32;of shareholder&#8217;s equity and White Mountains&#8217;s maximum capital commitment under the keep-well agreement was $111 million . 

See &#8220;CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES - Fair Value Measurements&#8221; &#32;on page 86 for a discussion of the sensitivity of WM Life Re&#8217;s results to changes in market and annuitant-related variables. 

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS 

On July 24, 2015, White Mountains entered into an agreement to sell Sirius Group to CM International Holding PTE Ltd. (&#8220;CMIH&#8221;), the Singapore-based investment arm of CMI (&#8220;the Sirius Group Transaction&#8221;). CMIH has the option to make the purchase through its wholly owned Bermuda subsidiary, CM Bermuda Ltd. The purchase price will be paid in cash in an amount equal to 127.3% of Sirius Group&#8217;s closing date tangible common shareholder&#8217;s equity, plus $10 million. The Sirius Group Transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2016 and is subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. 

In December 2014, OneBeacon completed the Runoff Transaction and sold the Runoff Business to Armour. The sale included the transfer of certain legal entities that contain the assets, liabilities (including gross and ceded loss reserves) and capital supporting the Runoff Business as well as certain infrastructure, such as staff and office space. Additionally, as part of the Runoff Transaction, OneBeacon provided financing in the form of surplus notes. 

See Note 22&#8212;&#8220;Discontinued Operations&#8221; &#32;of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for details of amounts included in net assets held for sale, net income (loss) from discontinued operations and gains (losses) from sales of discontinued operations. 

Sirius Group 

Sirius Group provides reinsurance and insurance products for property, accident and health, aviation and space, trade credit, marine, agriculture, and certain other exposures on a worldwide basis through its subsidiary, Sirius International. Sirius International, which is the largest reinsurance company domiciled in Scandinavia based on gross written premiums, owns Sirius America and sponsors Syndicate 1945. Sirius Global Solutions, formerly known as White Mountains Solutions, also specializes in the acquisition and management of runoff liabilities for insurance and reinsurance companies both in the United States and internationally. In 2014, Sirius Group established Sirius Bermuda Insurance Company Ltd. (&#8220;Sirius Bermuda&#8221;) as a class 3A licensed Bermuda insurer. 

&#32;Sirius Group has offices in Australia, Belgium, Bermuda, Connecticut, Hamburg, London, Miami, New York, Singapore, Stockholm, Toronto and Zurich.

Catastrophe Risk Management 

Sirius Group has exposure to losses caused by hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, winter storms, windstorms, floods, tsunamis, terrorist acts and other catastrophic events. In the normal course of business, Sirius Group regularly manages its concentration of exposures to catastrophic events, primarily by limiting concentrations of exposure to what it deems acceptable levels and, if necessary, purchasing reinsurance. In addition, Sirius Group seeks to limit losses that might arise from acts of terrorism in its insurance and reinsurance contracts by exclusionary provisions where available. Sirius Group has significant exposure to European weather-related events and United States windstorms and earthquakes. 

Sirius Group licenses third-party global property catastrophe models from AIR, EQECAT, Inc. (&#8220;EQE&#8221;) and Risk Management Solutions Inc. (&#8220;RMS&#8221;), which are three of the leading vendors of industry-standard catastrophe modeling software and also utilizes its own proprietary models to calculate expected probable maximum loss estimates (&#8220;PML&#8221;) from various property natural catastrophe scenarios. Sirius Group prices its property catastrophe contracts using the aforementioned third-party software and internal models and other methods. Sirius Group also uses a proprietary property underwriting and pricing tool (&#8220;GPI&#8221;), which consolidates and reports on all its worldwide property exposures. GPI is used to calculate individual and aggregate PMLs by statistically blending multiple third-party and proprietary models for property, accident and health, and marine. For business that Sirius Group determines to have exposure to natural catastrophic perils, as part of its underwriting process it models and assesses the exposure to quantify the appropriate premium for the exposure. 

The following table provides an estimate of Sirius Group&#8217;s three largest PML zones on a per occurrence basis for 1-in-100 and 1-in-250 year events at January 2016 as measured by net after-tax exposure:

Adjusted GAAP capital and common shareholder&#8217;s equity as of December 31, 2015 &#32;for Sirius Group is determined on a legal-entity basis. 

In addition to the above, Sirius Group also has significant exposure to United States Gulf Coast windstorms (i.e., Florida to Texas), California earthquakes, New Madrid earthquakes, and, to a lesser extent, Asia/Pacific, Latin American and Canadian windstorms and earthquakes. 

AIR, EQE and RMS provide new versions of their models on a periodic basis, usually annually or every other year. Sirius Group may implement these new versions for use in the underwriting and risk management process after having engaged in appropriate testing and achieving comfort with the model enhancements. With GPI, Sirius Group&#8217;s PML reporting methodology for exposures in the United States approximates an averaging of AIR and RMS, further adjusted for each treaty by underwriting judgment regarding the specific exposures underlying each cedant's portfolio. For exposures in countries other than the United States, Sirius Group chooses either AIR, EQE, or RMS for PML reporting based on underwriting and actuarial assessment as to the integrity of the model by territory and underlying data availability. The model of choice is then further adjusted in GPI for each treaty by underwriting judgment regarding the specific exposures underlying each cedant's portfolio. 

Catastrophe modeling is dependent upon several broad economic and scientific assumptions, such as storm surge (the water that is pushed toward the shore by the force of a windstorm), demand surge (the localized increase in prices of goods and services that often follows a catastrophe) and zone density (the percentage of insured perils that would be affected in a region by a catastrophe). Third-party modeling software does not provide information for all territories or perils (e.g., tsunami) for which Sirius Group writes business. Sirius Group uses its own proprietary models in these situations. 

Catastrophe modeling is inherently uncertain due to process risk (i.e., the probability and magnitude of the underlying event) and parameter risk (i.e. the probability of making inaccurate model assumptions). See &#8220;Risk Factors - Unpredictable catastrophic events could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition&#8221; &#32;for a further discussion. 

Sirius Group does not believe that it can rely solely upon catastrophe modeling to measure its exposure to natural catastrophe risk. For example, the losses arising from hurricane Katrina for both Sirius Group and the industry were substantially in excess of losses previously predicted by third-party models from such an event. This was due to issues such as inadequate storm surge and demand surge assumptions in the models, as well as flooding from levees breaking which was not fully contemplated in these models. Sirius Group monitors gross and net property catastrophe occurrence limits by country and region globally. Occurrence limits for peak zones in Europe, Japan, and the United States are assessed versus modeled catastrophe risk as another measure in understanding total property catastrophe exposure to large events. 

Reinsurance Protection 

Sirius Group&#8217;s ongoing reinsurance program primarily consists of proportional, excess of loss and industry loss warranty (&#8220;ILW&#8221;) protections to cover accident &#38; health, aviation, trade credit, energy &#38; marine and property exposures. Attachment points and coverage limits vary by region around the world. 

Additionally, in connection with the Sirius Group Transaction, White Mountains required Sirius Group to purchase ILW contracts to mitigate the potential impact of major natural catastrophe events on Sirius Group's balance sheet pending the close of the sale to CMI (the &#8220;ILW Covers&#8221;). The cost and potential economic benefit provided by the coverage under the ILW Covers inure to White Mountains. The majority of the contracts expire in May or June 2016.

INVESTMENTS 

White Mountains&#8217;s investment philosophy is to maximize long-term total returns (after-tax) while taking prudent levels of risk and maintaining a diversified portfolio, subject to White Mountains&#8217;s investment guidelines and various regulatory restrictions. Under White Mountains&#8217;s philosophy, each dollar of after-tax investment income or investment gains (realized or unrealized) is valued equally. 

White Mountains&#8217;s investment portfolio as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 consisted in large part of high-quality, short-duration, fixed maturity investments and short-term investments. White Mountains also maintains an equity portfolio that consisted of common equity securities and other long-term investments, including hedge funds, private equity funds, direct investments in privately held common and convertible securities and the OneBeacon surplus notes. White Mountains&#8217;s management believes that prudent levels of investments in common equity securities and other long-term investments are likely to enhance long-term after-tax total returns. See &#8220;Portfolio Composition&#8221; &#32;on page 62. 

White Mountains&#8217;s fixed maturity investment strategy is to purchase securities that are attractively priced in relation to their investment risks. White Mountains also actively manages the average duration of the portfolio. Duration was about 2.2 years including short-term investments and about 2.4 years excluding short-term investments as of December 31, 2015 . 

White Mountains looks to enhance long-term after tax total returns by investing a portion of the portfolio in common equity securities and other long-term investments. White Mountains has established relationships with third party registered investment advisers to manage its publicly-traded common equity securities. As of December 31, 2015, the largest of these relationships were with Lateef Investment Management (&#8220;Lateef&#8221;) and Silchester International Investors (&#8220;Silchester&#8221;). White Mountains also owns exchange traded funds (ETFs) that seek to provide investment results that, before expenses, correspond to the performance of the S&#38;P 500 Index, Russell 1000 and Russell 1000 Value Indices. 

Symetra 

In 2004, White Mountains, Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. (&#8220;Berkshire&#8221;) and several other private investors capitalized Symetra in order to purchase the life and investment operations of Safeco Corporation for $1.35 billion. Symetra focuses mainly on group insurance, individual life insurance, structured settlements and retirement services. White Mountains invested $195 million in Symetra in exchange for 17.4 million common shares, as adjusted for stock splits, of Symetra. In addition, White Mountains and Berkshire each received warrants to acquire an additional 9.5 million common shares of Symetra at $11.49 per share, as adjusted for stock splits. In June 2013, White Mountains executed a cashless exercise of its Symetra warrants, which resulted in the net issuance of 2.65 million common shares of Symetra in exchange for the warrants. During 2015, pursuant to the redemption of White Mountains's investments in the Prospector Funds, 513,500 common shares of Symetra were distributed to White Mountains. As of December 31, 2015, White Mountains owned $653.2 million, or 17.7%, of Symetra&#8217;s outstanding common shares. Symetra&#8217;s common shares were traded under the symbol &#8220;SYA&#8221; on the New York Stock Exchange. 

In August 2015, Symetra announced it had entered into a definitive merger agreement with Sumitomo Life Insurance Company (&#8220;Sumitomo Life&#8221;) pursuant to which Sumitomo Life would acquire all of the outstanding shares of Symetra. Following the announcement and Symetra shareholders' November 5, 2015 meeting to approve the transaction, White Mountains relinquished its representation on Symetra&#8217;s board of directors. As a result, White Mountains changed its accounting for Symetra common shares from the equity method to fair value. The carrying value per Symetra share used in the calculation of White Mountains&#8217;s adjusted book value per share rose to $31.77 at December 31, 2015 from $18.65 at December 31, 2014. Including dividends, Symetra produced $264 million of adjusted comprehensive income for White Mountains in 2015, of which $241 million was recognized as an after-tax unrealized investment gain in the fourth quarter. On February 1, 2016, Symetra closed its definitive merger agreement with Sumitomo Life and White Mountains received proceeds of $658 million, or $32 per common share. 

Symetra&#8217;s total revenues and net income through September 30, 2015 were $1.6 billion and $90 million. As of September 30, 2015, Symetra had total assets of $35.0 billion and shareholders&#8217; equity of $3.1 billion. Symetra&#8217;s total revenues and net income for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $2.2 billion and $254 million. Symetra&#8217;s total revenues and net income for the year ended December 31, 2013 were $2.1 billion and $221 million. As of December 31, 2014, Symetra had total assets of $33.0 billion and shareholders&#8217; equity of $3.4 billion. Symetra&#8217;s shareholders&#8217; equity excluding unrealized gains (losses) from its fixed maturity investments was $2.4 billion as of December 31, 2014. Since inception, White Mountains received a total of $149.0 million in cash dividends recorded as a reduction of White Mountains investment in Symetra under the equity method. White Mountains received a cash dividend of $2.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 recorded within net investment income. 

REGULATION 

United States 

White Mountains&#8217;s U.S.-based insurance and reinsurance operating subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision in each of the states where they are domiciled and licensed to conduct business. Generally, state regulatory authorities have broad supervisory and administrative powers over such matters as licenses, standards of solvency, premium rates, policy forms, investments, statutory deposits, methods of accounting, form and content of financial statements, reserves for unpaid loss and LAE, reinsurance, minimum capital and surplus requirements, dividends and other distributions to shareholders, annual and other report filings and other market conduct. In general, such regulation is for the protection of policyholders rather than shareholders. White Mountains believes that it is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations pertaining to its business that would have a material effect on its financial position in the event of non-compliance. 

State Accreditation and Monitoring 

All states have laws establishing standards that an insurer must meet to maintain its license to write business. In addition, all states have enacted laws substantially similar to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners&#8217; (&#8220;NAIC&#8221;) risk-based capital (&#8220;RBC&#8221;) standards for property and casualty companies, which are designed to determine minimum capital requirements and to raise the level of protection that statutory surplus provides for policyholder obligations. The RBC formula for property and casualty insurance companies measures three major areas of risk facing property and casualty insurers: underwriting, which encompasses the risk of adverse loss developments and inadequate pricing; declines in asset values arising from market and/or credit risk; and off-balance sheet risk arising from adverse experience from non-controlled assets, guarantees for affiliates or other contingent liabilities and excessive premium growth. Under laws adopted by individual states, insurers having less total adjusted capital than that required by the RBC calculation will be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action, depending on the level of capital inadequacy. The current RBC ratios of White Mountains&#8217;s active U.S.-based insurance and reinsurance operating subsidiaries are satisfactory and such ratios are not expected to result in any adverse regulatory action. White Mountains is not aware of any current recommendations by regulatory authorities that would be expected to have a material effect on its results of operations or liquidity. 

The NAIC has a set of financial relationships or tests known as the Insurance Regulatory Information System (&#8220;IRIS&#8221;) to assist state insurance regulators in monitoring the financial condition of insurance companies and identifying companies that require special regulatory attention. Insurance companies generally submit data annually to the NAIC, which in turn analyzes the data using prescribed financial data ratios (&#8220;IRIS ratios&#8221;), each with defined "usual ranges." Generally, regulators will begin to investigate or monitor an insurance company if its IRIS ratios fall outside the usual ranges for four or more of the ratios. If an insurance company has insufficient capital, regulators may act to reduce the amount of insurance it can issue or, in severe situations, assume control of the company. White Mountains currently believes that all of its U.S.-based insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are within an acceptable IRIS range, and is not aware of any IRIS-related regulatory investigations related to its U.S.-based insurance and reinsurance operating subsidiaries. 

Many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurer's ability to exit a market. For example, certain states prohibit an insurer from withdrawing from one or more lines of insurance business in the state without providing prior notice to or obtaining the state regulator's approval. State regulators may refuse to approve withdrawal plans on the grounds that they could lead to market disruption, or for other reasons, including political and tax-related reasons. Some states also limit canceling or non-renewing certain policies for specific reasons. 

State insurance laws and regulations include numerous provisions governing marketplace activities of insurers, including provisions governing marketing and sales practices, policyholder services, claims management and complaint handling. State regulatory authorities generally test and enforce these provisions through periodic market conduct examinations. 

The NAIC&#8217;s Annual Financial Reporting Model Regulation, or the Model Audit Rule (&#8220;MAR&#8221;), which includes provisions that are similar to certain Sarbanes-Oxley requirements for public companies, requires certain insurance companies to appoint audit committees to oversee accounting and financial reporting processes as well as oversee the audit of the insurer&#8217;s statutory financial statements. Audit committees also are required to appoint independent auditors, among other things. The appointed audit committee receives reports regarding significant deficiencies, material weaknesses and solvency concerns at the insurance company level. Certain insurance companies are also required to annually file a management report on internal control over financial reporting. 

Regulators in states that adopted the NAIC&#8217;s 2010 amendment to the Model Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act (the &#8220;Model Holding Company Act&#8221;) have enhanced authority to regulate insurers as well as their affiliated entities. The amendment to the Model Holding Company Act requires the ultimate controlling person in an insurer&#8217;s holding company structure to identify and report to state insurance regulators material risks within the structure that could pose enterprise risk to the insurer. 

Guaranty Funds and Mandatory Shared Market Mechanisms 

As a condition of their license to do business in certain states, White Mountains&#8217;s U.S.-based insurance and reinsurance operating subsidiaries are required to participate in guaranty funds, in which licensed insurers within the state bear a portion of the loss suffered by claimants due to the insolvency of other insurers in that state. Certain states also impose mandatory shared market mechanisms, with each state dictating the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be provided. The most common type of shared market mechanism in which White Mountains is required to participate is an assigned risk plan. These plans require insurers licensed within the applicable state to accept applications for insurance policies from customers who are unable to obtain insurance in the voluntary market. The total number of such policies an insurer is required to accept is based on its market share of voluntary business in the state. Underwriting results related to assigned risk plans are typically adverse. Accordingly, White Mountains may be required to underwrite policies with a higher risk of loss than it would otherwise accept. 

Reinsurance facilities are another type of shared market mechanism. Reinsurance facilities require an insurance company to accept all applications submitted by certain state designated agents. The reinsurance facility then allows the insurer to cede some of its business to the reinsurance facility and the facility will reimburse the insurer for claims paid on ceded business. Typically, however, reinsurance facilities operate at a deficit, which is funded through assessments against the same insurers. As a result, White Mountains could be required to underwrite policies with a higher risk of loss than it would otherwise voluntarily accept. 

Pricing, Investments and Dividends 

Nearly all states have insurance laws requiring property and casualty insurance companies to file their rates, rules and policy or coverage forms with the state&#8217;s regulatory authority. In most cases, such rates, rules and forms must be approved prior to use. While pricing laws vary from state to state, their objectives are generally to ensure that rates are not excessive, unfairly discriminatory or used to engage in unfair price competition. The ability and timing of White Mountains&#8217;s U.S.-based insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries to increase rates are dependent upon the regulatory requirements in each state. 

White Mountains&#8217;s U.S.-based insurance and reinsurance operating subsidiaries are subject to state laws and regulations that require investment portfolio diversification and that dictate the quality, quantity and general types of investments they may hold. Non-compliance may cause non-conforming investments to be non-admitted when measuring statutory surplus and, in some instances, may require divestiture. White Mountains&#8217;s investment portfolio as of December 31, 2015 &#32;complied with such laws and regulations in all material respects. 

One of the primary sources of cash inflows for the Company and certain of its intermediate holding companies is dividends received from its insurance and reinsurance operating subsidiaries. Under the insurance laws of the domiciliary states under which White Mountains&#8217;s U.S.-based insurance and reinsurance operating subsidiaries are domiciled, an insurer is restricted with respect to the timing or the amount of dividends it may pay without prior approval by regulatory authorities. See &#8220;Dividend Capacity&#8221; &#32;on page 64 for further discussion. 

Holding Company Structure 

White Mountains is subject to regulation under certain state insurance holding company acts. These regulations contain reporting requirements relating to the capital structure, ownership, financial condition and general business operations of White Mountains&#8217;s insurance and reinsurance operating subsidiaries. These regulations also contain special reporting and prior approval requirements with respect to certain transactions among affiliates. Since the Company is an insurance holding company, the domiciliary states of its insurance and reinsurance operating subsidiaries impose regulatory application and approval requirements on acquisitions of White Mountains&#8217;s common shares which may be deemed to confer control over those subsidiaries, as that concept is defined under the applicable state laws. Acquisition of 10% of White Mountains&#8217;s common shares, or in some states as little as 5%, may be deemed to confer control under the insurance laws of some jurisdictions, and the application process for approval can be extensive and time consuming. 

Legislation 

Although the federal government does not directly regulate the insurance business, federal legislation and administrative policies impact the industry. In addition, legislation has been introduced in recent years that, if enacted, could result in the federal government assuming a more direct role in the regulation of the insurance industry. Notably, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;) created the Federal Insurance Office (&#8220;FIO&#8221;) within the Treasury Department, which is responsible for gathering information and monitoring the insurance industry to identify gaps in the regulation of insurers that could contribute to a systemic crisis in the insurance industry or U.S. financial system. 

White Mountains&#8217;s U.S.-based insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are impacted by other federal regulations targeted at the insurance industry, such as the Terrorism Act, which established a federal &#8220;backstop&#8221; for commercial property and casualty losses. (See &#8220;ONEBEACON &#8212; Terrorism&#8221; &#32;on page 10 for a further discussion of the Terrorism Act). For example, the generally applicable levels of reinsurance support that the federal government provides to authorized carriers could be reduced by legislation. A number of additional enacted and pending legislative measures could lead to increased consolidation and increased competition for business and for capital in the financial services industry. White Mountains cannot predict whether any state or federal measures will be adopted to change the nature or scope of the regulation of the insurance business or what effect such measures may have on its insurance and reinsurance operations. 

In addition to emerging federal regulation, many states are adopting laws that attempt to strengthen the ability of regulators to understand and regulate the risk management practices of insurers and insurance groups. For example, many states have adopted measures related to the NAIC&#8217;s Solvency Modernization Initiative (&#8220;SMI&#8221;), which requires insurers to summarize their key risks and risk management strategies to regulators. The SMI resulted in a 2010 amendment to the NAIC&#8217;s Model Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act (the &#8220;Model Holding Company Act&#8221;), which requires the ultimate controlling person in an insurer&#8217;s holding company structure to identify and report material enterprise risks to the state insurance regulator. The SMI also produced the NAIC Risk Management and Own Risk Solvency Model Act (&#8220;ORSA&#8221;), which requires insurers meeting premium thresholds to: 1) maintain a risk management framework; and 2) annually submit a comprehensive report designed to assess the adequacy of an insurer&#8217;s risk management practices, including risks related to the insurer&#8217;s future solvency position. ORSA requirements became effective in 2015 in all of the domiciliary states of White Mountains&#8217;s U.S.-based insurance company subsidiaries and the first ORSA report was submitted to the relevant domiciliary regulators in 2015. 

WM Advisors is a registered investment adviser and is regulated by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission under the United States Investment Advisers Act of 1940. 

Europe 

Sweden 

Sirius International is subject to regulation and supervision by the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority (the &#8220;Swedish FSA&#8221;). As Sweden is a member of the European Union (the &#8220;EU&#8221;), the Swedish FSA supervision of branches is recognized across all locations within the EU. Generally, the Swedish FSA has broad supervisory and administrative powers over such matters as licenses, governance and internal control, standards of solvency, investments, methods of accounting, form and content of financial statements, minimum capital and surplus requirements, and annual and other report filings. In general, such regulation is for the protection of policyholders rather than shareholders. White Mountains believes that it is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations pertaining to its business that would have a material effect on its financial position in the event of non-compliance. 

Subject to certain limitations under Swedish law, Sirius International is permitted to transfer pre-tax income amounts into an untaxed reserve referred to as a safety reserve. See Note 15 - &#8220;Statutory Capital and Surplus&#8221; &#32;of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further description. 

United Kingdom 

The financial services industry in the United Kingdom is regulated by two agencies, the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority (collectively, the &#8220;UK Regulators&#8221;). The UK Regulators regulate insurers, insurance intermediaries and Lloyd&#8217;s. The UK Regulators and Lloyd&#8217;s have common objectives in ensuring that the Lloyd&#8217;s market is appropriately regulated. Lloyd&#8217;s is required to implement certain rules prescribed by the UK Regulators by the powers it has under the Lloyd&#8217;s Act of 1982 (&#8220;Lloyd&#8217;s Act&#8221;) relating to the operation of the Lloyd&#8217;s market. In addition, each year the UK Regulators require Lloyd&#8217;s to satisfy an annual solvency test that measures whether Lloyd&#8217;s has sufficient assets in the aggregate to meet all the outstanding liabilities of its members. 

Lloyd&#8217;s permits its corporate and individual members (&#8220;Members&#8221;) to underwrite insurance risks through Lloyd&#8217;s syndicates. Members of Lloyd&#8217;s may participate in a syndicate for one or more underwriting years by providing capital to support the syndicate&#8217;s underwriting. All syndicates are managed by Lloyd&#8217;s approved managing agents. Managing agents receive fees and profit commissions in respect of the underwriting and administrative services they provide to the syndicates. Lloyd&#8217;s prescribes, in respect of its managing agents and Members, certain minimum standards relating to their management and control, solvency and various other requirements. Sirius Group participates in the Lloyd&#8217;s market through the 100% ownership of Sirius International Corporate Member Limited, a Lloyd&#8217;s Corporate Member, which in turn provides underwriting capacity to Syndicate 1945. 

Solvency II 

The European Solvency II regulatory framework for insurance business is effective from January 1, 2016. It will impose economic risk-based solvency requirements across all EU Member States. The aim of the Solvency II framework is to ensure that insurance and reinsurance undertakings are financially sound and can withstand adverse events in order to protect policyholders and the stability of the financial system as a whole. It also aims at the creation of a single European rule book and harmonized supervision. In addition to quantitative requirements, such as capital requirements (Pillar 1), insurance and reinsurance companies will be required to meet qualitative requirements relating to governance and risk-management (Pillar 2), as well as to regularly disclose extensive information to supervisors and to the public (Pillar 3). Sirius International and its wholly-owned insurance subsidiaries, such as Sirius America, Star Re or any other insurance subsidiaries, will be required, when and where applicable, to comply with Solvency II requirements. 

The Solvency II framework is set out in a complex structure of regulations headed by an EU Directive. It also includes a Delegated Act and Implementing Technical Standards adopted by the EU Commission and Guidelines issued by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA). The Solvency II Directive is implemented into local laws and complemented by local regulations and guidelines. Although the Directive was adopted already in 2009, parts of the regulation have not been finalized until late 2015. Sirius International has had an internal project running for many years to prepare for the Solvency II framework. 

Bermuda 

Insurance Regulation 

The Insurance Act 1978 of Bermuda and related regulations, as amended (the &#8220;Insurance Act&#8221;), regulates the insurance businesses of Sirius Bermuda, Alstead Reinsurance Ltd. (&#8220;Alstead Re&#8221;), the Bermuda branch of Sirius International, Star Re Ltd., White Shoals, Split Rock, Life Re Bermuda and HG Re, and provides that no person may carry on any insurance business in or from within Bermuda unless registered as an insurer under the Insurance Act by the Bermuda Monetary Authority (&#8220;BMA&#8221;). The BMA, in deciding whether to grant registration, has broad discretion to act as it thinks fit in the public interest. The BMA is required by the Insurance Act to determine whether the applicant is a fit and proper body to be engaged in the insurance business and, in particular, whether it has, or has available to it, adequate knowledge and expertise to operate an insurance business. In addition, the BMA is required by the Insurance Act to determine whether a person who proposes to control 10 percent, 20 percent, 33 percent or 50 percent (as applicable) of the voting powers of a Bermuda registered insurer or its parent company is a fit and proper person to exercise such degree of control. 

The continued registration of an applicant as an insurer is subject to the applicant complying with the terms of its registration and such other conditions as the BMA may impose from time to time. The Insurance Act also grants to the BMA powers to supervise, investigate and intervene in the affairs of insurance companies. 

The Insurance Act imposes solvency and liquidity standards on Bermuda insurance companies, as well as auditing and reporting requirements. White Mountains believes that it is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations pertaining to its business that would have a material effect on its financial position in the event of non-compliance. 

Certain Other Bermuda Law Considerations 

The Company is an exempted company organized under the Companies Act 1981 of Bermuda (the &#8220;Companies Act&#8221;). As a result, the Company is required to comply with the provisions of the Companies Act regulating the payment of dividends and making of distributions from contributed surplus. A company is prohibited from declaring or paying a dividend, or making a distribution out of contributed surplus, if there are reasonable grounds for believing that: 

(1) 

the company is, or would after the payment be, unable to pay its liabilities as they become due; or 

(2) 

the realizable value of the company&#8217;s assets would thereby be less than its liabilities. 

Under the Company&#8217;s bye-laws, each common share is entitled to dividends if, and when, dividends are declared by its board of directors, subject to any preferred dividend rights of the holders of any preference shares. Issued share capital is the aggregate par value of the company&#8217;s issued shares, and the share premium account is the aggregate amount paid for issued shares over and above their par value. Share premium accounts may be reduced in certain limited circumstances. In addition, the Companies Act regulates return of capital, reduction of capital and any purchase or redemption of shares by the Company. 

Although the Company is incorporated in Bermuda, it has been designated as a non-resident of Bermuda for exchange control purposes by the BMA. Pursuant to its non-resident status, the Company may hold any currency other than Bermuda dollars and convert that currency into any other currency, other than Bermuda dollars, without restriction. 

Shares may be offered or sold in Bermuda only in compliance with the provisions of the Investment Business Act 2003 and the Exchange Control Act 1972, and related regulations of Bermuda which regulate the sale of securities in Bermuda. In addition, specific permission is required from the BMA pursuant to the provisions of the Exchange Control Act 1972 and related regulations, for all issuances and transfers of securities of Bermuda companies, other than in cases where the BMA has granted a general permission. The BMA in its policy dated June 1, 2005 provides that where any equity securities, including the Company&#8217;s common shares, of a Bermuda company are listed on an appointed stock exchange, general permission is given for the issue and subsequent transfer of any securities of a company from and/or to a non-resident, for as long as any equity securities of such company remain so listed. The New York Stock Exchange is deemed to be an appointed stock exchange under Bermuda law. Notwithstanding the above general permission, the BMA has granted the Company permission to, subject to its common shares being listed on an appointed stock exchange, (a) issue and transfer its shares, up to the amount of its authorized capital from time to time, to persons resident and non-resident of Bermuda for exchange control purposes; (b) issue and transfer options, warrants, depositary receipts, rights, and other securities; and (c) issue and transfer loan notes and other debt instruments and options, warrants, receipts, rights over loan notes and other debt instruments to persons resident and non-resident of Bermuda for exchange control purposes. 

Under Bermuda law, exempted companies are companies formed for the purpose of conducting business outside Bermuda from a principal place in Bermuda. As an exempted company, the Company may not, without the express authorization of the Bermuda legislature or under a license granted by the Bermuda Minister of Finance, participate in various specified business transactions, including 

&#8226; 

the acquisition or holding of land in Bermuda, except land held by way of lease or tenancy agreement which is required for the Company&#8217;s business and held for a term not exceeding 50 years, or which is used to provide accommodation or recreational facilities for the Company&#8217;s officers and employees and held with the consent of the Bermuda Minister of Finance, for a term not exceeding 21 years; 

&#8226; 

the taking of mortgages on land in Bermuda in excess of $50,000; 

&#8226; 

the acquisition of any bonds or debentures secured by any land in Bermuda, other than certain types of Bermuda government or public authority securities; or 

&#8226; 

subject to some exceptions, the carrying on of business of any kind in Bermuda for which the Company is not licensed in Bermuda. 

Under Bermuda law, non-Bermudians (other than spouses of Bermudians, holders of permanent resident certificates and holders of working resident certificates) may not engage in any gainful occupation in Bermuda without an appropriate governmental work permit. Work permits may be granted or extended by the Bermuda government upon showing that, after proper public advertisement in most cases, no Bermudian (or spouse of a Bermudian or a holder of a permanent resident&#8217;s certificate or holder of a working resident&#8217;s certificate) is available who meets the minimum standard requirements for the advertised position. A waiver from advertising is automatically granted in respect of any chief executive officer position and other chief officer positions. 

RATINGS 

Insurance companies are evaluated by various rating agencies in order to measure each company&#8217;s financial strength. Higher ratings generally indicate financial stability and a stronger ability to pay claims. White Mountains believes that strong ratings are important factors in the marketing and sale of insurance products and services to agents and consumers and ceding companies.
