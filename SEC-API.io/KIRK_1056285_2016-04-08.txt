 Item 1. Business General 

We are a specialty retailer of home d&#233;cor and gifts in the United States, operating 376 stores in 35 states as of January 30, 2016, as well as an e-Commerce enabled website, www.kirklands.com. Our stores present a broad selection of distinctive merchandise, including framed art, mirrors, wall d&#233;cor, candles and related items, lamps, decorative accessories, accent furniture, textiles, garden-related accessories and artificial floral products. Our stores also offer an extensive assortment of holiday merchandise during seasonal periods as well as items carried throughout the year suitable for gift-giving. In addition, we use innovative design and packaging to market home d&#233;cor items as gifts. We provide our predominantly female customers an engaging shopping experience characterized by a diverse, ever-changing merchandise selection reflecting current styles at prices which provide discernible value. This combination of ever-changing and stylish merchandise, value pricing and a stimulating store experience has led to our emergence as a leader in home d&#233;cor and enabled us to develop a strong customer franchise. 

Business Strategy 

Our goal is to be the leading specialty retailer of home d&#233;cor and accessories in each of our markets. We believe the following elements of our business strategy both differentiate us from our competitors and position us for growth: 

Product mix differentiation. While our stores contain items covering a broad range of complementary product categories, we emphasize traditionally-styled, quality merchandise within each category, striving to combine steady-selling, everyday &#147;core&#148; items with trend-appropriate fashion and seasonal items. Our buyers work closely with our merchandise vendors to identify and develop stylish products that appeal to a broad base of customers while reflecting the latest trends. These products are often proprietary, the result of the development and collaboration between our buyers and our vendors. In most cases, this exclusive merchandise is the result of our buying team&#146;s experience in interpreting market and merchandise trends in a way that appeals to our customers. For these reasons, we believe our buying process yields a merchandise assortment that is differentiated from our competition. We also test-market products where appropriate and monitor individual item sales, which enables us to identify and quickly reorder bestselling items in order to maximize sales. 

Ever-changing merchandise mix. We believe our ever-changing merchandise mix creates an inviting store environment, encouraging strong customer loyalty and frequent return visits to our stores. The merchandise in our stores is traditionally-styled for broad market appeal, yet it reflects an understanding of our customer&#146;s desire for fashion and novelty. Our information systems permit close tracking of individual item sales, enabling us to react quickly to both fast-selling and slow-moving items. Accordingly, our inventory turns rapidly and we actively change our merchandise assortment throughout the year in response to market trends, sales results and changes in seasons. We also strategically increase selling space devoted to gifts and seasonal merchandise in advance of holidays. 

Stimulating store experience. Through our in-store visual presentation, marketing and promotions, and customer service, we seek to make customers feel welcome and &#147;at home.&#148; Our merchandise presentation effort is geared toward helping our customers visualize our products in their own homes and inspire decorating and gift-giving ideas. We creatively group complementary merchandise throughout the store. We believe this cross-category merchandising encourages customers to browse for longer periods of time, promoting add-on sales. We adjust our visual presentation frequently to take advantage of sales trends, enhance our ever-changing merchandise mix, and support our promotional strategies. Our store associates support this environment through their engagement with our customers, knowledge of our products, and passion for customer service. 

Strong value proposition. Our customers regularly experience the satisfaction of paying noticeably less for items similar to those sold by other retail stores or through other retail channels. This strategy of providing a combination of style, quality and value is an important element in making Kirkland&#146;s a destination store. While we carry some items in our stores that sell for several hundred dollars, most items sell for under $20 and are perceived by our customers as very affordable home d&#233;cor, accessories and gifts. Our longstanding relationships with vendors and our ability to place and sell-through large orders of a single item enhance our ability to attain favorable product pricing from vendors. 

Broad market appeal. Our stores operate successfully across different geographic regions and market sizes. The flexibility of our concept enables us to select the most promising real estate opportunities that meet requisite economic and demographic criteria within the target markets where our customers live and shop. In addition to our stores, we sell direct-to-customer (&#147;DTC&#148;) and facilitate orders for in-store pickup (&#147;ISP&#148;) through our website at www.kirklands.com . We view our on-line channel as a crucial part of our overall business strategy, allowing us to introduce our concept to new customers and complement our &#147;brick-and-mortar&#148; business for a true multi-channel brand experience. 

&#160;

Brick-and-mortar store growth. With only 376 stores in 35 states as of the end of fiscal 2015, we view expansion of our physical store locations as a large opportunity for growth. During fiscal 2016, we expect to increase our total retail square footage by approximately 6% to 8%. We will focus on infill opportunities in some of our core markets, as well as expansion opportunities in under-penetrated markets in the United States such as the Mid-Atlantic states, the Midwest, portions of the Northeast, and California. We expect to open 35 to 40 new locations during fiscal 2016, and expect to close approximately 10 to 15 locations. The new store openings and closings during fiscal 2016 are expected to be weighted towards the first half of the year. Longer-term, we see an opportunity to grow our square footage 10% annually, with an intermediate goal of 500 total store units in the next three to five years. 

e-Commerce growth. As customers increasingly turn to the web for their shopping, we expect our e-Commerce channel to provide another growth opportunity. We are continuing to capture additional market share by attracting new customers via the website. We launched third-party drop shipping in fiscal 2015 to give our customers a wider assortment of product offerings. We plan on expanding our third-party drop shipping product offerings in fiscal 2016. Additionally, we are continuing to use the on-line channel to enrich the brick-and-mortar store experience, and have plans to improve our ship to store options to support the blending of the two channels into one unique brand experience. For fiscal 2015, our e-Commerce channel accounted for approximately $38.6 million in revenue, or about 6.9% of our total revenue, a 37.8% increase over fiscal 2014. We expect our e-Commerce business to continue to grow at a pace greater than brick-and-mortar for the foreseeable future, with an interim goal of 10% of the overall business. 

Merchandising 

Merchandising strategy. Our merchandising strategy is to (i) offer unique, distinctive and often exclusive, quality home d&#233;cor products and gifts at affordable prices representing great value to our customers, (ii) maintain a breadth of productive merchandise categories, (iii) provide a carefully edited selection of core items within targeted categories, (iv) emphasize new and fresh-to-market merchandise by continually updating our merchandise mix, and (v) present merchandise in a visually appealing manner to create an inviting atmosphere which inspires decorating and gift-giving ideas and encourages frequent store visits. 

Our information systems permit close tracking of individual item sales, which enables us to react quickly to market trends and best or slow sellers. This daily sales and product margin information helps us to maximize the productivity of successful products and categories, and minimize the accumulation of slow-moving inventory. The composition of our merchandise assortment is relatively consistent across the chain. We address regional differences where applicable by tailoring inventories to geographic considerations and specific store sales results in selected categories and classes of product. 

We continuously introduce new and often exclusive products to our merchandise assortment in order to (i) maintain customer interest by providing freshness in our product selections, encouraging frequent return visits to our stores and website, (ii) enhance our reputation as a source for identifying and developing quality, fashionable products, and (iii) allow merchandise which has peaked in sales to be quickly discontinued and replaced by new items. In addition, we strategically manage the selling space devoted to gifts and holiday merchandise throughout the year. Our flexible store design and display fixtures allow us to adjust our selling space as needed to capitalize on sales trends. 

Our average store generally carries approximately 4,700 Stock Keeping Units (&#147;SKUs&#148;). Online we carry approximately 3,800 SKUs, of which 1,400 are exclusively online. We regularly monitor the sell-through on each item, therefore, the number and make-up of our active SKUs is continuously changing based on changes in selling trends. We purchase merchandise from approximately 200 vendors and our buying team works closely with vendors to differentiate Kirkland&#146;s merchandise from that of our competitors. For products that are not manufactured specifically for Kirkland&#146;s, we may create custom packaging as a way to differentiate our merchandise offering and reinforce our brand. Exclusive or proprietary products distinguish us from our competition, enhance the value of our merchandise and provide the opportunity to improve our net sales and gross margin. 

Product assortment. Our major merchandise categories include wall d&#233;cor, art, mirrors, lamps, decorative accessories, accent furniture, textiles, fragrance and accessories, frames, housewares, impulse and personal accessories, outdoor living, and artificial floral products. Our stores also offer an extensive assortment of holiday merchandise, as well as items carried throughout the year suitable for gift-giving.

&#160;

&#160; Value proposition. We continually strive to increase the perceived value of Kirkland&#146;s products to our customers through our distinctive merchandising, carefully coordinated in-store signage, visual presentation and product packaging. Our shoppers regularly experience the satisfaction of paying noticeably less for items similar to those sold by other retail stores, through catalogs, or on the Internet. Our stores typically have two major semi-annual sale events, one in January and one in July. We also use temporary promotions throughout the year featuring specific items or categories of merchandise. We believe our value-oriented pricing strategy, coupled with an adherence to high quality standards, is an important element in establishing our distinct brand identity and solidifying our connection with our customers. 

Buying and Inventory Management 

Merchandise sourcing and product development. Our merchandise team purchases inventory on a centralized basis to take advantage of our consolidated buying power and our technology to closely control the merchandise mix in our stores. Our buying team selects all of our products, negotiates with vendors and works closely with our planning and allocation team to optimize store-level merchandise quantity and mix by category, classification and item. 

Approximately 86% of our total purchases are from importers of merchandise manufactured primarily in China and other South-Asian countries, with the balance purchased from domestic manufacturers and wholesalers. For our purchases of merchandise manufactured abroad, we have historically bought from importers or U.S.-based representatives of foreign manufacturers rather than dealing directly with foreign manufacturers. This process has enabled us to maximize flexibility and minimize product liability and credit risks. 

Planning and allocation. Our merchandise planning and allocation team works closely with our buying team, field management and store personnel to meet the requirements of individual stores for appropriate merchandise in sufficient quantities. This team also manages inventory levels, allocates merchandise to stores and replenishes inventory based upon information generated by our information systems. Our inventory control systems monitor current inventory levels at each store, by operating district, and for the total company. We also continually monitor recent selling history within each store by category, classification and item to properly allocate future purchases to maximize sales and gross margin. 

Each of our stores is internally classified for merchandising purposes based on certain criteria including sales volume, size, location and historical performance. Although our stores carry similar merchandise, the variety and depth of products in a given store may vary depending on the store&#146;s rank and classification. Where applicable, inventory purchases and allocation are also tailored based on regional or demographic differences between stores in selected categories. 

Store Operations 

General. In addition to corporate management and three Regional Directors, approximately 29 Multi-Unit Managers (who generally have responsibility for approximately 10 to 16 stores within a geographic district) manage store operations. A Store Manager and one to three Assistant Managers manage individual stores. The Store Manager is responsible for the day-to-day operation of the store, including sales, customer service, merchandise display, human resource functions and store security. A typical store operates seven days a week with an average of 12 to 16 employees, including a combination of full and part-time employees, depending on the volume of the store and the season. Additional part-time employees are typically hired to assist with increased traffic and sales volume in the fourth quarter of the calendar year. 

&#160;

Merchandise presentation. Merchandise is generally displayed according to guidelines and directives given to each store from the Merchandise Presentation team with input from Store Operations. This procedure promotes somewhat uniform display standards throughout the chain depending upon store configuration. Using multiple types of fixtures, we group complementary merchandise creatively throughout the store, and also display certain products strictly by category or product type. 

Because of the nature of our merchandise and our focus on identifying and developing best-selling items, we emphasize our merchandise presentation standards. Our Merchandise Presentation team provides Store Managers with recommended directives such as photographs, diagrams and placement guides. Augmenting this centralized approach, each Store Manager has flexibility to creatively highlight those products that are expected to have the greatest appeal to local shoppers. Effective and consistent visual merchandising enhances a store&#146;s ability to reach its full sales potential. 

Personnel recruitment and training. We believe our continued success is dependent in part on our ability to attract, retain and motivate quality employees. In particular, our success depends on our ability to promote and/or recruit qualified Multi-Unit and Store Managers and maintain quality full-time and part-time employees. Multi-Unit Managers are primarily responsible for recruiting new Store Managers. Store Managers are responsible for the hiring and training of new associates, assisted where appropriate by a Human Resources Manager. We constantly look for motivated and talented people to promote from within Kirkland&#146;s, in addition to recruiting outside Kirkland&#146;s. All employees are trained utilizing the &#147;8 Steps to Success&#148; training program. Multi-Unit Managers and Store Managers receive an additional 5 to 10 days of training at a designated &#147;training store&#148; at which they work directly with a qualified Training Store Manager. 

Compensation and incentives. Multi-Unit and Store Managers are compensated with a base salary or on an hourly basis, plus a monthly sales bonus combined with a quarterly performance bonus based on store-level profit contribution. Sales associates are compensated on an hourly basis. In addition, we periodically run a variety of contests that reward associates for outstanding achievement in sales and other corporate initiatives. 

Real Estate 

Strategy. Our real estate strategy is to identify dominant retail properties that are convenient and attractive to our target female customer. The flexibility and broad appeal of our stores and our merchandise allow us to operate successfully in major metropolitan markets such as Houston, Texas and Atlanta, Georgia; middle markets such as Nashville, Tennessee and Kansas City, Missouri; and smaller markets such as Palmdale, California and Amarillo, Texas. As we execute our store growth strategy, we are focused on infill opportunities in some of our existing markets as well as expansion opportunities in under-penetrated markets in the United States such as the Mid-Atlantic states, the Midwest, portions of the Northeast, and California to provide us with the unit growth to achieve our goals. 

Formats. We operate stores in a variety of off-mall venues and enclosed malls. As of January 30, 2016, we operated 30 stores in enclosed malls, of which ten were outward-facing, and 346 stores in off-mall venues. Off-mall stores included 305 in &#147;power&#148; strip centers and &#147;lifestyle&#148; centers, 11 in outlet centers and 30 freestanding locations. The average size of the new stores we opened in fiscal 2015 was approximately 8,200 square feet, and we currently expect our fiscal 2016 new stores to be primarily in off-mall shopping centers of similar average size. 

Site selection. Our site selection strategy is to locate our stores in venues which are destinations for large numbers of shoppers and which reinforce our image and brand. To assess potential new locations, we review financial and demographic criteria and infrastructure for access. We also analyze the quality and relative location of co-tenants and competitive factors, square footage availability, frontage space and other relevant criteria to determine the overall acceptability of a property and the optimal locations within it. 

The following table provides a history of our store openings and closings for the last five fiscal years.

Distribution and Logistics 

We have implemented a comprehensive approach to the management of our merchandise supply chain. This approach encompasses all parts of the supply chain, from the manufacturer overseas to the store selling floor. Our 771,000-square-foot distribution center in Jackson, Tennessee was built to our specifications in May 2004, and our warehouse management system and material handling equipment streamline the flow of goods within the distribution center. 

We currently utilize third-party carriers to transport merchandise from our distribution center to our stores. Approximately 97% of our stores utilize direct, full truckload deliveries, which results in lower distribution costs and allows our field personnel to better schedule store associates for the receiving process. The optimal delivery method for a given store depends on the store&#146;s sales volume, square footage, geographic location and other factors. 

In fiscal 2015, we used approximately 200,000 square feet of the distribution facility to support the pick-and-pack operation used in e-Commerce fulfillment. To support the anticipated growth in the e-Commerce business, we entered into a three-year lease in March 2015 for a 303,000 square feet facility in Jackson, Tennessee which will primarily serve as the fulfillment center for e-Commerce starting in early fiscal 2016. We also lease additional overflow warehouse space in Jackson, Tennessee as needed. We continue to evaluate the impact of our multi-channel strategies on our business, and are currently implementing enhancements to our supply chain infrastructure to support our store unit growth and multi-channel goals. 

Information Systems 

Our store information systems include a server in each store that runs our automated point-of-sale (&#147;POS&#148;) application on multiple POS registers. The server provides Store Managers with convenient access to detailed sales and inventory information for the store. Our POS registers provide a price look-up function (all merchandise is bar-coded), time and attendance, and automated check, credit card, debit card and gift card processing. Through nightly two-way electronic communication with each store, we upload SKU-level sales, gross margin information and payroll hours to our home office system and download new merchandise pricing, price changes for existing merchandise, purchase orders and system maintenance tasks to the store server. Based upon the evaluation of information obtained through this daily information exchange, our planning and allocation team implements merchandising decisions regarding inventory levels, reorders, price changes and allocation of merchandise to our stores. During fiscal 2015, we implemented a new payroll planning tool which allows us to improve our efficiency managing time and attendance and employee scheduling within stores. 

During the second half of 2012, we completed the implementation of a new merchandise management system. This software provides us with tools to better manage aspects of our merchandise assortment and integrates all merchandising and inventory management applications; including category, classification and SKU inventory tracking, purchase order management, automated ticket making, and sales audit. During fiscal 2013 and 2014, we implemented a host of merchandise modules within our new merchandise management system including merchandise financial planning, allocation, and replenishment tools. In 2014, we implemented an order management system, which supports our multi-channel initiatives by providing a flexible foundation for handling orders, directing omni-channel traffic, and servicing the customer. During fiscal 2015, we implemented our third-party &#147;drop-ship&#148; vendor program allowing our vendors to ship product directly to our customers&#146; homes. 

Our financial system applications, including general ledger and accounts payable, were upgraded in February 2011. Our e-Commerce platform was implemented in the fall of 2010, when we re-launched our website for DTC selling. Concurrent with the move into our distribution center in 2004, we implemented a warehouse management system (&#147;WMS&#148;). The WMS was tailored to our specifications and provides us with a fully automated solution for all operations within the distribution center. 

Marketing 

Although our overall marketing efforts encompass various techniques, in recent years, we have had a significant focus on e-mail communication. We now manage a database of approximately 3.3 million active e-mail addresses that have been provided by our customers, primarily through in-store collection processes and various contests and initiatives designed to drive e-mail sign-ups. We use this database to communicate frequently with our loyal customer base about new products, in-store events and special offers. We are beginning to utilize other means of media advertising to enhance the visibility of our products and our brand. We are continuously evaluating other forms of advertising as we seek to further develop the brand of the Company while we execute our growth strategy. Our marketing efforts inside the store emphasize signage, store and window banners, displays and other techniques to attract customers and provide an exciting shopping experience. The growth of our e-Commerce business has also increased our investment in online marketing channels such as paid search and affiliate marketing. 

During the third quarter of fiscal 2013, we implemented a new customer loyalty program called K Club. K Club allows members to earn one point for every dollar spent on eligible product purchases and receive a ten dollar reward certificate for every three hundred points earned. In addition to the K Club, we provide our customers with the option to utilize Kirkland&#146;s private-label credit card. Kirkland&#146;s credit card holders earn two points for every dollar spent. This program is administered by a third-party, who 

&#160;

bears the credit risk associated with the card program without recourse to us. Customers using the Kirkland&#146;s private-label credit card visit our stores and purchase merchandise more frequently, as well as spend more money per visit, than our customers not using the card. As of the end of fiscal 2015, we had approximately 6.7 million loyalty members in the K Club program. 

Internet and Social Media 

We believe the Internet offers opportunities to complement our &#147;brick-and-mortar&#148; stores, increase sales and increase consumer brand awareness of our products. Our website at www.kirklands.com provides our customers with the ability to purchase Kirkland&#146;s merchandise online and have it delivered directly to their homes or their nearest Kirkland&#146;s store. Customers may also use the website as a resource to locate a store, preview our merchandise, join our K Club loyalty program, apply for a Kirkland&#146;s credit card, and purchase gift cards online. We are also very active in social media and maintain a presence on Facebook, where we have over 942,000 followers. For Twitter, Pinterest and Instagram, we have over 29,400, 85,500 and 128,000 followers, respectively. 

The information contained or incorporated in our websites is not a part of this Form 10-K. 

Trademarks 

All of our stores operate under the names &#147;Kirkland&#146;s&#148;, &#147;Kirkland&#146;s Home&#148;, &#147;Kirkland&#146;s Home Outlet&#148;, &#147;Kirkland&#146;s Outlet,&#148; and &#147;The Kirkland Collection.&#148; 

We have registered several trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office on the Principal Register that are used in connection with the Kirkland&#146;s stores, including KIRKLAND&#146;S &#174; logo design, KIRKLAND&#146;S &#174; , THE KIRKLAND COLLECTION &#174; , KIRKLAND&#146;S OUTLET &#174; , KIRKLAND&#146;S HOME &#174; , MARKET AND VINE tm and LOVE THE POSSIBILITIES, LOVE THE PRICE &#174; . These marks have historically been important components in our merchandising and marketing strategy. We are not aware of any claims of infringement or other challenges to our right to use our marks in the United States. 

Competition 

The retail market for home d&#233;cor and gifts is highly competitive. Accordingly, we compete against a diverse group of retailers, including specialty stores, department stores, discount stores, catalog and Internet-based retailers, which sell similar lines of merchandise to those carried by us. Our product offerings also compete with a variety of national, regional and local retailers, including such retailers as HomeGoods, Bed, Bath &#38; Beyond, Cost Plus World Market, Hobby Lobby, Pier 1 Imports, Target, Ebay, Amazon and Wayfair. Department stores typically have higher prices than our stores for similar merchandise. Specialty retailers tend to have higher prices and a narrower assortment of home d&#233;cor products. Wholesale clubs may have lower prices than our stores, but the product assortment is generally more limited. We believe that the principal competitive factors influencing our business are merchandise novelty, quality and selection, price, customer service, visual appeal of the merchandise and the store, and the convenience of our store locations. The number of companies offering a selection of home d&#233;cor products that overlaps generally with our product assortment has increased over the last 10 to 15 years. However, we believe that our stores still occupy a distinct niche in the marketplace: traditionally-styled, quality merchandise, reflective of current market trends, offered at a value price combined with a unique store experience. We believe we compete effectively with other retailers due to our experience in identifying a broad collection of distinctive merchandise, pricing it to be attractive to the target Kirkland&#146;s customer, presenting it in a visually appealing manner, and providing a quality shopping experience. 

In addition to competing for customers, we compete with other retailers for suitable store locations and qualified management personnel and sales associates. Many of our competitors are larger and have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. See Item 1A of this Form 10-K, captioned &#147;Risk Factors.&#148; 

Employees 

We employed 6,821 employees at March 14, 2016. The number of employees fluctuates with seasonal needs. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that we maintain a positive relationship with our employees. 

Seasonality 

We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, substantial seasonal fluctuations in our net sales and operating results, which are typical of many specialty retailers and common to most retailers generally. Due to the importance of the fall selling season, which includes Thanksgiving and Christmas, the last quarter of our fiscal year has historically contributed, and is expected to continue to contribute, a disproportionate amount of our net sales, net income and cash flow for the entire fiscal year. We expect this pattern to continue during the current fiscal year and anticipate that in subsequent fiscal years, the last quarter of our fiscal year will continue to contribute disproportionately to our operating results and cash flow.
