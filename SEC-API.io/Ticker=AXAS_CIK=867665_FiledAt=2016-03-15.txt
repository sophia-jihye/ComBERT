 Item 1. Business 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

We are an independent energy company primarily engaged in the acquisition, exploration, development and production of oil and gas. At December 31, 2015, our estimated net proved reserves were 43.2 MMBoe, of which 39.8% were classified as proved developed, 71% were oil and NGL and 95% of which (on a PV-10 basis) were operated by us. Our daily net production for the year ended December 31, 2015 was 5,975 &#32;Boepd, of which 77% &#32;was oil or liquids. Abraxas Petroleum Corporation was incorporated in Nevada in 1990. Our address is 18803 Meisner Drive, San Antonio, Texas 78258 and our phone number is (210) 490-4788. 

Our oil and gas assets are located in three operating regions, the Rocky Mountain, Permian Basin and onshore Gulf Coast. The following table sets forth certain information related to our properties as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015:

_____________________ 

Our properties in the Rocky Mountain region are located in the Williston Basin of North Dakota and Montana and in the Green River, Powder River and Uinta Basins of Wyoming and Utah. In this region, our wells produce oil and gas from various reservoirs, primarily the Turner, Bakken, Three Forks and Red River formations. Well depths range from 7,000 feet down to 14,000 feet. 

&#160; 

Our properties in the Permian Basin region are primarily located in two sub-basins, the Delaware Basin and the Eastern Shelf. In the Delaware Basin, our wells are located in Pecos, Reeves, and Ward Counties, Texas and produce oil and gas from multiple stacked formations from the Bell Canyon at 5,000 feet down to the Ellenburger at 16,000 feet. In the Eastern Shelf, our wells are principally located in Coke, Scurry, Mitchell and Nolan Counties, Texas and produce oil and gas from the Strawn Reef formation at 5,000 to 7,500 feet and oil from the shallower Clearfork formation at depths ranging from 2,300 to 3,300 feet. 

&#160; 

Our properties in the onshore Gulf Coast region are located along the Edwards trend in DeWitt and Lavaca Counties, Texas, the Eagle Ford shale in Atascosa and McMullen Counties, Texas and in the Portilla field in San Patricio County, Texas. In the Edwards trend, our wells produce gas from the Edwards formation at a depth of 14,000 feet. In the Eagle Ford, our wells produce from the Eagle Ford shale from 8,000 to 11,000 feet, and in the Portilla field, our wells produce oil and gas from the Frio sands and the deeper Vicksburg from depths of approximately 7,000 to 9,000 feet. 

2016 Outlook 

Market prices for oil, gas and NGL are inherently volatile. Accordingly, we cannot predict with certainty the future prices for the commodities we produce and sell. Current market fundamentals indicate prices for oil, gas and NGL will continue to be depressed for much of 2016. Although changes in OPEC production strategies, geopolitical risks or other factors could impact current forecasts, we anticipate weak commodity prices throughout 2016. Depressed prices for oil and gas will likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and liquidity. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flow from operations and borrowings under our credit facility. Cash flow from operations is sensitive to many variables, the most volatile of which is the price of the oil, gas and NGL we produce and sell. Our consolidated cash flow from operations decreased in 2015 as a result of the significant decrease in commodity prices. Availability under our credit facility is currently subject to a borrowing base of $165.0 million. The borrowing base is subject to scheduled semiannual (April 1 and October 1) and other elective borrowing base redeterminations. The amount of the borrowing base is calculated by the lenders based upon their valuation of our proved reserves securing the facility utilizing these reserve reports and their own internal decisions. The lenders under our credit facility can unilaterally adjust the borrowing base and the borrowings permitted to be outstanding under our credit facility. Given the ongoing decline in commodity prices for oil, gas and NGL, it is likely that reductions in our borrowing base could arise in 2016. 

In 2015, as a result of the sharp decline in commodity prices, we incurred an impairment to our proved properties of $128.6 million. We expect to record additional impairments of our oil and gas properties during 2016 as a result of declining oil and gas prices. Based on the 12-month average oil and gas prices through March 1, 2016 of $46.04 per Bbl of oil and $2.48 per Mcf of gas being held constant for the trailing 12-month period, we estimate that we will record a ceiling test write down on our existing assets of approximately $30.1 million &#32;at March 31, 2016 and if such prices do not change during the remainder of 2016 an additional write down of $72.7 million &#32;for the remainder of the year ending December 31, 2016. However, whether the amount of any such impairments will be similar in amount to such estimates, is contingent upon many factors such as the price of oil, gas and NGL for the remainder of 2016, increases or decreases in our reserve base, changes in estimated costs and expenses, and oil and gas property acquisitions, which could increase, decrease or eliminate the need for such impairments. 

While we will continue to operate and develop our portfolio of assets, we are committed to protecting our balance sheet and managing our capital programs to be within our cash flow from operations. As a result, we are significantly reducing our capital budget in response to lower commodity prices. We are also committed to reducing our G&#38;A and field-level operating costs commensurate with our reduced, but focused, activity level. Effective February 1, 2016, the named executive officers of Abraxas took a voluntary salary reduction of 20% and other employees, depending on salary thresholds, took voluntary cuts of 10% - 20%. It is anticipated that these reductions will reduce G&#38;A cost by approximately $0.8 million during 2016. 

Strategy 

Our business strategy is to focus our capital and resources on our core operated basins, maintain financial flexibility and profitably and to grow production and reserves. Key elements of our business strategy include: 

Focusing our capital and resources on our core operated basins. Our core basins consist of the Williston Basin (Bakken/Three Forks), onshore Gulf Coast (Eagle Ford shale), which primarily produce oil and liquids, and the Permian Basin and Powder River Basin, which primarily produce gas. Given the disparity which has existed during the past several years and which continues currently between oil and gas prices, the economics of drilling oil wells is far superior to drilling gas wells. Thus, substantially all of our 2016 estimated capital expenditures will be in completing wells which have already been drilled in the Bakken, Three Forks. As part of our efforts to focus our property portfolio, we are continually marketing assets we have deemed non-core. These include assets with a low working interest that are non-operated and/or that fall outside of our four core basins. Any proceeds from these asset sales will be used to reduce our indebtedness and/or redeployed into our core operating basins. 

Maintaining financial flexibility . Our primary sources of capital are availability under our credit facility and cash flow from operations. At December 31, 2015 we had approximately $31.0 million &#32;of availability under our credit facility and for the year ended December 31, 2015, we generated approximately $7.0 million &#32;of cash flow from operations. Availability under our credit facility is subject to a borrowing base which is determined semi-annually by our lenders. The next borrowing base redetermination is scheduled to be effective on April 1, 2016. We seek to reduce the volatility of our cash flow from operations by hedging a portion of our production. We plan on deploying our available capital in a cost-effective manner. We seek to operate a high percentage of our properties which allows us to better control costs. At December 31, 2015, we operated properties comprising 95% of our proved developed reserves on a PV-10 basis. We intend to maintain 

our liquidity and the strength of our balance sheet during 2016 by adjusting our capital budget and seeking to reduce G&#38;A and other expenses. 

Profitably grow production and reserves . We have a substantial low-decline legacy production base as evidenced by our over 21 year reserve life as of year-end 2015. Our capital is currently being deployed largely into unconventional oil assets with relatively predictable production profiles, yet steep initial decline rates. Therefore, the economics of these oil wells are highly dependent on both near term commodity prices and strong operational cost control. Cost savings achieved through efficiencies of using our rig in the Williston Basin, and heightened focus on cost control in all of our operated positions both contribute to our history of adding low cost barrels to our production base. 

&#160; 

2016 Budget and Drilling Activities 

&#160; 

Our capital expenditure budget for 2016 is approximately $40.0 million. This budget assumes an improvement in commodity prices by the summer of 2016, and re-starting the Raven Rig #1. However, if commodity prices stay at current levels or decline further and we elect to keep the Raven Rig #1 idled, our capital expenditures could be approximately $17.5 million which we intend to fund primarily with cash flows from operations. Substantially all of the $17.5 million would be spent on completing previously drilled wells in the Bakken/Three Forks in the Rocky Mountain region. These wells are classified as PDNP as of December 31, 2015. The 2016 capital expenditure budget is subject to change depending upon a number of factors, including the availability of sufficient capital resources including under our credit facility, the availability and costs of drilling and service equipment and crews, economic and industry conditions at the time of drilling, prevailing and anticipated prices for oil and gas, the results of our exploitation efforts, and our ability to obtain permits for drilling locations. 

Markets and Customers 

&#160; 

The revenue generated by our operations is highly dependent upon the prices we receive for our oil and gas. Historically, the markets for oil and gas have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future. The prices we receive for our oil and gas production are subject to wide fluctuations and depend on numerous factors beyond our control including seasonality, the condition of the United States economy (particularly the manufacturing sector), foreign imports, political conditions in other petroleum producing countries, the actions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, domestic regulation, legislation and policies. Decreases in the prices we receive for our oil and gas have had, and could have in the future, an adverse effect on the carrying value of our proved reserves, our revenue, profitability and cash flow from operations. Refer to &#8220;Risk Factors &#8211; Risks Related to Our Industry &#8212; Market conditions for oil and gas, and particularly volatility of prices for oil and gas, could adversely affect our revenue, cash flows, profitability and growth&#8221; and &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Critical Accounting Policies&#8221; for more information relating to the effects that decreases in oil and gas prices have on us. To help mitigate the impact of commodity price volatility, we hedge a portion of our production through the use of fixed price swaps and three way collars. See &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; General &#8211; Commodity Prices and Hedging Arrangements&#8221; and Note 11 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our derivative activities. 

&#160; 

Substantially all of our oil and gas is sold at current market prices under short-term arrangements, as is customary in the industry. During the year ended December 31, 2015, one &#32;purchaser of production accounted for approximately 54% &#32;of our oil and gas sales. During the year ended December 31, 2014, two &#32;purchasers of production accounted for approximately 62% &#32;of our oil and gas sales. We believe that there are numerous other purchasers available to buy our oil and gas and that the loss of any of these purchasers would not materially affect our ability to sell our oil and gas. Furthermore, the largest purchasers of our oil and gas have changed from year to year from 2013 to 2015. 

Regulation of Oil and Gas Activities 

&#160; 

The exploration, production and transportation of all types of hydrocarbons are subject to significant governmental regulations. Our properties are affected from time to time in varying degrees by political developments and federal, state and local laws and regulations. In particular, oil and gas production operations and economics are, or in the past have been, affected by industry specific price controls, taxes, conservation, safety, environmental and other laws relating to the petroleum industry, and by changes in such laws and by periodically changing administrative regulations. 

&#160; 

Federal, state and local laws and regulations govern oil and gas activities. Operators of oil and gas properties are required to have a number of permits in order to operate such properties, including operator permits and permits to dispose of salt water. We possess all material requisite permits required by the states and other local authorities in which we operate 

properties. In addition, under federal law, operators of oil and gas properties are required to possess certain certificates and permits in order to operate such properties such as hazardous materials certificates, which we have obtained. 

&#160; 

Development and Production 

&#160; 

The operations of our properties are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local levels. These types of regulations include requiring the operator of oil and gas properties to possess permits for the drilling and development of wells, post bonds in connection with various types of activities, and file reports concerning operations. Most states, and some counties and municipalities in which we operate, regulate one or more of the following: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

the location of wells; 

&#8226; 

the method of drilling and casing wells; 

&#8226; 

the flaring of gas; 

&#8226; 

the method of completing and fracture stimulating wells; 

&#8226; 

the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled; 

&#8226; 

the plugging and abandoning of wells; and 

&#8226; 

the notice to surface owners and other third parties. 

Some states regulate the size and shape of development and spacing units or proration units for oil and gas properties. Some states allow forced pooling or unitization of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases. In some instances, forced pooling or unitization may be implemented by third parties and may reduce our interest in the unitized properties. In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum allowable rates of production from oil and gas wells, generally prohibit the venting or flaring of gas and impose requirements regarding the ratability of production. These laws and regulations may limit the amount of oil and gas we can produce from our wells or limit the number of wells or the locations at which our wells can be drilled. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, gas and NGLs within its jurisdiction. 

&#160; 

Operations on Federal or Indian oil and gas leases must comply with numerous regulatory restrictions, including various non-discrimination statutes, and certain of such operations must be conducted pursuant to certain on-site security regulations and other permits issued by various tribal and federal agencies, including the Bureau of Land Management and the Office of Natural Resources Revenue, which we refer to as ONRR, (formerly Minerals Management Service). ONRR establishes the basis for royalty payments due under federal oil and gas leases through regulations issued under applicable statutory authority. State regulatory authorities establish similar standards for royalty payments due under state oil and gas leases. The basis for royalty payments established by ONRR and the state regulatory authorities is generally applicable to all federal and state oil and gas leases. Accordingly, we believe that the impact of royalty regulation on the operations of our properties should generally be the same as the impact on our competitors. We believe that the operations of our properties are in material compliance with all applicable regulations as they pertain to Federal or Indian oil and gas leases. 

&#160; 

The failure to comply with these rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties, including lease suspension or termination in certain cases. The regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases our cost of doing business and, consequently, affects our profitability. Our competitors in the oil and gas industry are subject to the same regulatory requirements and restrictions that affect us. 

&#160; 

Regulation of Transportation and Sale of Gas in the United States 

&#160; 

Historically, the transportation and sale for resale of gas in interstate commerce have been regulated pursuant to the Natural Gas Act of 1938, as amended, which we refer to as NGA, the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, as amended, which we refer to as NGPA, and regulations promulgated thereunder by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which we refer to as FERC, and its predecessors. In the past, the federal government has regulated the prices at which gas could be sold. Deregulation of wellhead gas sales began with the enactment of the NGPA. In 1989, Congress enacted the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act, as amended, which we refer to as the Decontrol Act. The Decontrol Act removed all NGA and NGPA price and non-price controls affecting wellhead sales of gas effective January 1, 1993. While sales by producers of gas can currently be made at unregulated market prices, Congress could reenact price controls in the future. 

&#160; 

Since 1985, FERC has endeavored to make gas transportation more accessible to gas buyers and sellers on an open and non-discriminatory basis. FERC has stated that open access policies are necessary to improve the competitive structure of the interstate gas pipeline industry and to create a regulatory framework that will put gas sellers into more direct contractual relations with gas buyers by, among other things, unbundling the sale of gas from the sale of transportation and storage services. Beginning in 1992, FERC issued Order No. 636 and a series of related orders, which we refer to collectively as Order No. 636, to implement its open access policies. As a result of the Order No. 636 program, the marketing and pricing of gas have been significantly altered. The interstate pipelines&#8217; traditional role as wholesalers of gas has been eliminated and replaced by a structure under which pipelines provide transportation and storage service on an open access basis to others who buy and sell gas. FERC continues to regulate the rates that interstate pipelines may charge for such transportation and storage services. Although FERC&#8217;s orders do not directly regulate gas producers, they are intended to foster increased competition within all phases of the gas industry. 

&#160; 

In 2000, FERC issued Order No. 637 and subsequent orders, which we refer to, collectively, as Order No. 637, which imposed a number of additional reforms designed to enhance competition in gas markets. Among other things, Order No. 637 effected changes in FERC regulations relating to scheduling procedures, capacity segmentation, penalties, rights of first refusal and information reporting. Most major aspects of Order No. 637 have been upheld on judicial review, and most pipelines&#8217; tariff filings to implement the requirements of Order No. 637 have been accepted by the FERC and placed into effect. 

&#160; 

The Energy Policy Act of 2005, which we refer to as EP Act 2005, gave FERC increased oversight and penalty authority regarding market manipulation and enforcement. EP Act 2005 amended the NGA to prohibit market manipulation and also amended the NGA and the NGPA to increase civil and criminal penalties for any violations of the NGA, NGPA and any rules, regulations or orders of FERC to up to $1,000,000 per day, per violation. In addition, FERC issued a final rule effective January 26, 2006, regarding market manipulation, which makes it unlawful for any entity, in connection with the purchase or sale of gas or transportation service subject to FERC jurisdiction, to defraud, make an untrue statement, or omit a material fact or engage in any practice, act, or course of business that operates or would operate as a fraud. This final rule works together with FERC&#8217;s enhanced penalty authority to provide increased oversight of the gas marketplace. 

The gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated; therefore, there is no assurance that the less stringent regulatory approach currently pursued by FERC will continue. However, we do not believe that any action taken will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way it affects other gas producers, gatherers and marketers. 

&#160; 

Generally, intrastate gas transportation is subject to regulation by state regulatory agencies, although FERC does regulate the rates, terms, and conditions of service provided by intrastate pipelines that transport gas subject to FERC&#8217;s NGA jurisdiction pursuant to Section 311 of the NGPA. The basis for state regulation of intrastate gas transportation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate gas pipeline rates and services varies from state to state. Insofar as such regulation within a particular state will generally affect all intrastate gas shippers within the state on a comparable basis, we believe that the regulation of similarly situated intrastate gas transportation in any states in which we operate and ship gas on an intrastate basis will not affect the operations of our properties in any way that is materially different from the effect of such regulation on our competitors. 

Gas Gathering in the United States 

&#160; 

Section 1(b) of the NGA exempts gas gathering facilities from the jurisdiction of the FERC. FERC has developed tests for determining which facilities constitute jurisdictional transportation facilities under the NGA and which facilities constitute gathering facilities exempt from FERC&#8217;s NGA jurisdiction. From time to time, FERC reconsiders its test for defining non-jurisdictional gathering. FERC has also permitted jurisdictional pipelines to &#8220;spin down&#8221; exempt gathering facilities into affiliated entities that are not subject to FERC jurisdiction, although FERC continues to examine the circumstances in which such a &#8220;spin down&#8221; is appropriate and whether it should reassert jurisdiction over certain gathering companies and facilities that previously had been &#8220;spun down.&#8221; We cannot predict the effect that FERC&#8217;s activities in this regard may have on the operations of our properties, but we do not expect these activities to affect the operations in any way that is materially different from the effect thereof on our competitors. 

&#160; 

State regulation of gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental, and in some circumstances, non-discriminatory take or service requirements, but does not generally entail rate regulation. In the United States, gas gathering has received greater regulatory scrutiny at both the state and federal levels in the wake of the interstate pipeline restructuring under FERC Order 636. For example, the Texas Railroad Commission enacted a Natural Gas Transportation Standards and Code of Conduct to provide regulatory support for the state&#8217;s more active review of rates, services and 

practices associated with the gathering and transportation of gas by an entity that provides such services to others for a fee, in order to prohibit such entities from unduly discriminating in favor of their affiliates. 

&#160; 

Regulation of Transportation of Oil in the United States 

&#160; 

Sales of oil, condensate and gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at negotiated prices. The transportation of oil in common carrier pipelines is subject to rate regulation. FERC regulates interstate oil pipeline transportation rates under the Interstate Commerce Act. In general, interstate oil pipeline rates must be cost-based, although settlement rates agreed to by all shippers are permitted and market-based rates may be permitted in certain circumstances. Effective January 1, 1995, FERC implemented regulations establishing an indexing system (based on inflation) for transportation rates for oil that allowed for an increase or decrease in the cost of transporting oil to the purchaser. A review of these regulations by FERC in 2000 was successfully challenged on appeal by an association of oil pipelines. On remand, FERC, in February 2003, increased the index slightly, effective July 2001. Intrastate oil pipeline transportation rates are subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions. The basis for intrastate oil pipeline regulations, and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate oil pipeline rates varies from state to state. Insofar as effective interstate and intrastate rates are equally applicable to all comparable shippers, we believe that the regulation of oil transportation rates will not affect the operations of our properties in any way that is materially different from the effect of such regulation on our competitors. 

&#160; 

Further, interstate and intrastate common carrier oil pipelines must provide service on a non-discriminatory basis. Under this open access standard, common carriers must offer service to all shippers requesting service on the same terms and under the same rates. When oil pipelines operate at full capacity, access is governed by prorationing provisions set forth in the pipelines&#8217; published tariffs. Accordingly, we believe that access to oil pipeline transportation services generally will be available to us to the same extent as to our competitors. 

All of our oil is sold on lease, at which time custody transfers, either by truck or pipeline. We are not able to determine how much of our oil production is ultimately shipped to market centers using rail transportation facilities owned and operated by third parties. The U.S. Department of Transportation&#8217;s (&#8220;U.S. DOT&#8221;) Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (&#8220;PHMSA&#8221;) establishes safety regulations relating to transportation of oil by rail transportation. In addition, third party rail operators are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board of the U.S. DOT, the Federal Railroad Administration (&#8220;FRA&#8221;) of the DOT, OSHA, as well as other federal regulatory agencies. Additionally, various state and local agencies have jurisdiction over disposal of hazardous waste and seek to regulate movement of hazardous materials in ways not preempted by federal law. 

In response to rail accidents occurring between 2002 and 2008, the U.S. Congress passed the Rail Safety and Improvement Act of 2008, which implemented regulations governing different areas related to railroad safety. Recently, in response to train derailments occurring in 2013, U.S. regulators have been implementing or considering new rules to address the safety risks of transporting oil by rail. On January 23, 2014, the National Transportation Safety Board (&#8220;NTSB&#8221;) issued a series of recommendations to the FRA and PHMSA to address safety risks, including (i) requiring expanded hazardous material route planning for railroads to avoid populated and other sensitive areas, (ii) developing an audit program to ensure rail carriers that carry petroleum products have adequate response capabilities to address worst-case discharges of the entire quantity of product carried on a train, and (iii) auditing shippers and rail carriers to ensure they are properly classifying hazardous materials in transportation and that they have adequate safety and security plans in place. Additionally, on February 25, 2014 the DOT issued an emergency order requiring all persons, prior to offering oil into transportation, to ensure such product is properly tested and classed and to assure all shipments by rail of oil be handled as a Packing Group I or II hazardous material. 

We do not currently own or operate rail transportation facilities or rail cars; however, the adoption of any regulations that impact the testing or handling of shipments of oil by rail transportation could increase our costs of doing business and limit our ability to transport and sell our oil at favorable prices at market centers throughout the United States, the consequences of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the potential impact on our business if new federal or state rail transportation regulations are enacted. 

Environmental Matters 

&#160; 

Oil and gas operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations controlling the generation, use, treatment, storage and disposal of materials and the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations may: 

&#8226; 

require the acquisition of a permit or other authorization before construction or drilling commences; 

&#8226; 

impose design and construction requirements on facilities in conjunction with oil and gas operations, including the construction of pollution control devices; 

&#8226; 

require protective measures to prevent drilling fluids from coming into contact with ground water; 

&#8226; 

restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling, production, and gas processing activities; 

&#8226; 

suspend, limit or prohibit construction, drilling and other activities in certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, and areas inhabited by threatened or endangered species and other protected areas; 

&#8226; 

require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from historical and on-going operations such as the use of pits and plugging of abandoned wells; 

&#8226; 

require disclosure of chemicals injected into wells in conjunction with hydraulic fracturing operations; 

&#8226; 

restrict injection of liquids into subsurface strata that may contaminate groundwater; 

&#8226; 

restrict the availability of water necessary for hydraulic fracturing operations; 

&#8226; 

impose substantial penalties for violations of environmental rules or pollution resulting from our operations; and 

&#8226; 

curtail production in association with exceeding gas flaring limits. 

Environmental permits that the operators of properties are required to possess may be subject to revocation, modification, and renewal by issuing authorities. Governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with their regulations and permits, and violations are subject to injunction, civil fines, and even criminal penalties. Our management believes that we are in substantial compliance with current environmental laws and regulations, and that we will not be required to make material capital expenditures to comply with existing laws. Nevertheless, changes in existing environmental laws and regulations or interpretations thereof could have a significant impact on our operations as well as the oil and gas industry in general, and thus we are unable to predict the ultimate cost and effects of future changes in environmental laws and regulations. 

&#160; 

We are not currently involved in any administrative, judicial or legal proceedings arising under federal, state, or local environmental protection laws and regulations, or under federal or state common law, which would have a material adverse effect on our respective financial positions or results of operations. Moreover, we maintain insurance against the costs of clean-up operations, but we are not fully insured against all such risks. A serious incident of pollution may result in the suspension or cessation of operations in the affected area. 

&#160; 

The following is a discussion of the current relevant environmental laws and regulations that relate to our operations. 

&#160; 

Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act. &#32;The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, also known as Superfund, and which we refer to as CERCLA, and comparable state statutes impose strict joint, and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of conduct, on certain classes of persons who are considered to have contributed to the release of a &#8220;hazardous substance&#8221; into the environment. These persons include among others, the current and former owners or operators of a disposal site or sites where a release occurred and companies that arranged for the transportation or disposal of the hazardous substances released at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons or companies may be retroactively liable for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources, and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA authorizes the EPA, and in some cases third parties, to take actions in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring land owners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury, property damage, and recovery of response costs allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. 

&#160; 

In the course of our ordinary operations, certain wastes may be generated that may fall within CERCLA&#8217;s definition of a &#8220;hazardous substance.&#8221; We may be liable under CERCLA or comparable state statutes for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which these wastes have been disposed. Although CERCLA currently contains a &#8220;petroleum exclusion&#8221; 

from the definition of &#8220;hazardous substance,&#8221; state laws affecting our operations impose cleanup liability relating to petroleum and petroleum related products, including oil cleanups. 

We currently own or lease, and have in the past owned or leased, numerous properties that for many years have been used for the exploration and production of oil and gas. Although we have utilized standard industry operating and disposal practices at the time, hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties we owned or leased or on or under other locations where such wastes have been taken for disposal. In addition, many of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes was not under our control. These properties and the wastes disposed thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA (as defined below), and analogous state laws. Under these laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes, including wastes disposed or released by prior owners or operators; to clean up contaminated property, including contaminated groundwater; or to perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination. 

&#160; 

Oil Pollution Act of 1990. Federal regulations also require certain owners and operators of facilities that store or otherwise handle oil to prepare and implement spill response plans relating to the potential discharge of oil into surface waters. The Federal Oil Pollution Act, which we refer to as OPA, and analogous state laws, contain numerous requirements relating to prevention of, reporting of, and response to oil spills into waters of the United States. A failure to comply with OPA&#8217;s requirements or inadequate cooperation during a spill response action may subject a responsible party to civil or criminal enforcement actions. We are not aware of any action or event that would subject us to liability under OPA, and we believe that compliance with OPA&#8217;s financial responsibility and other operating requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. 

&#160; 

Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, which we refer to as RCRA, is the principal federal statute governing the treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous solid wastes. RCRA imposes stringent operating requirements and liability for failure to meet such requirements, on a person who is either a &#8220;generator&#8221; or &#8220;transporter&#8221; of hazardous waste or an &#8220;owner&#8221; or &#8220;operator&#8221; of a hazardous waste treatment, storage or disposal facility. Analogous state laws further impose requirements associated with the management of solid wastes. At present, RCRA includes a statutory exemption that allows most oil and gas exploration and production wastes to be classified and regulated as non-hazardous wastes. A similar exemption is contained in many of the state counterparts to RCRA. At various times in the past, proposals have been made to amend RCRA to rescind the exemption that excludes oil and gas exploration and production wastes from regulation as hazardous wastes. Repeal or modification of the exemption by administrative, legislative or judicial process, or modification of similar exemptions in applicable state statutes, would increase the volume of hazardous waste we are required to manage and dispose and would cause us to incur increased operating expenses. Also, in the ordinary course of our operations, we generate small amounts of ordinary industrial wastes, such as paint wastes, waste solvents and waste oils that may be regulated as hazardous wastes. We believe that our operations comply in all material respects with the requirements of RCRA and its state counterparts. 

&#160; 

Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials, which we refer to as NORM, are materials not covered by the Atomic Energy Act, whose radioactivity is enhanced by technological processing such as mineral extraction or processing through exploration and production conducted by the oil and gas industry. NORM wastes are regulated under the RCRA framework, but primary responsibility for NORM regulation has been a state function. Standards have been developed for worker protection; treatment, storage and disposal of NORM waste; management of waste piles, containers and tanks; and limitations upon the release of NORM contaminated land for unrestricted use. We believe that the operations of our properties are in material compliance with all applicable NORM standards established by the various states in which we operate wells. 

&#160; 

Clean Water Act. The Clean Water Act, which we refer to as the CWA, and analogous state laws, impose restrictions and controls on the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by EPA or an analogous state agency. The CWA regulates storm water run-off from oil and gas facilities and requires a storm water discharge permit for certain activities. Such a permit requires the regulated facility to monitor and sample storm water run-off from its operations. The CWA and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit discharges of dredged and fill material in wetlands and other waters of the United States unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure requirements of the CWA require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of waters of the United States in the event of a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have adopted a rule that arguably expands the scope of &#8220;waters of the United States&#8221; that are regulated under the CWA. This rule could impact our operations by subjecting new waters to regulation; however, enforcement of the rule has been stayed while it is undergoing legal challenge in the federal courts. The CWA and comparable state statutes provide for civil, criminal and administrative penalties for unauthorized discharges of oil and other pollutants and impose liability on parties responsible for those discharges for the costs of cleaning 

up any environmental damage caused by the release and for resource damages resulting from the release. We believe that the operations of our properties comply in all material respects with the requirements of the CWA and state statutes enacted to control water pollution. 

Safe Drinking Water Act. &#32;Our operations also produce wastewaters that are disposed via underground injection wells. These activities are regulated by the Safe Drinking Water Act, which we refer to as the SDWA, and analogous state and local laws. Underground injection is the subsurface placement of fluid through a well, such as the reinjection of brine produced and separated from oil and gas production. The main goal of the SDWA is the protection of usable aquifers. The primary objective of injection well operating requirements is to ensure the mechanical integrity of the injection apparatus and to prevent migration of fluids from the injection zone into underground sources of drinking water. Injection well operations are strictly controlled, and certain wastes, absent an exemption, cannot be injected into underground injection control wells. In most states, no underground injection may take place except as authorized by permit or rule. In addition, subsurface injection of water or other produced fluids from drilling or hydraulic fracturing processes have come under increased public and governmental scrutiny. Some jurisdictions, Texas for example, have adopted new rules for injection wells aimed at reducing the potential for earthquakes associated with injection activities. We currently own and operate various underground injection wells. Failure to comply with our permits could subject us to civil and/or criminal enforcement. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with the requirements of applicable state underground injection control programs and our permits. 

&#160; 

Clean Air Act. The Clean Air Act, which we refer to as the CAA, and state air pollution laws and regulations provide a framework for national, state and local efforts to protect air quality. The operations of our properties utilize equipment that emits air pollutants which may be subject to federal and state air pollution control laws. These laws require utilization of air emissions abatement equipment to achieve prescribed emissions limitations and ambient air quality standards, as well as operating permits for existing equipment and construction permits for new and modified equipment. In the past few years, EPA has adopted new more restrictive regulations governing air emissions from oil and gas operations and has proposed rules that are still under review, including regulations which impose new restrictions on emissions of methane, volatile organic compounds and hazardous air pollutants. 

&#160; 

Permits and related compliance obligations under the CAA, as well as changes to state implementation plans for controlling air emissions in regional non-attainment areas may require oil and gas exploration and production operators to incur future capital expenditures in connection with the addition or modification of existing air emission control equipment and strategies. EPA has adopted a new ozone standard which will result in additional areas being designated as nonattainment and therefore subject to more stringent rules and permitting requirements. In addition, some oil and gas facilities may be included within the categories of hazardous air pollutant sources, which are subject to increasing regulation under the CAA. Failure to comply with these requirements could subject a regulated entity to monetary penalties, injunctions, conditions or restrictions on operations and enforcement actions. Oil and gas exploration and production facilities may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment in connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals for air emissions. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with the requirements of applicable federal and state air pollution control laws. 

&#160; 

Hydraulic Fracturing. &#32;Most of our current operations depend on the use of hydraulic fracturing to enhance production from oil and gas wells. This technology involves the injection of fluids&#8212;usually consisting mostly of water but typically including small amounts of chemical additives&#8212;as well as sand, or other proppants, into a well under high pressure in order to create fractures in the rock that allow oil or gas to flow more freely to the wellbore. Many of our newer wells would not be economical without the use of hydraulic fracturing to stimulate the formation to enhance production from the well. Hydraulic fracturing operations have historically been overseen by state regulators as part of their oil and gas regulatory programs. However, bills such as the Fracturing Responsibility and Awareness of Chemicals (FRAC) Act of 2015 have been introduced in Congress to subject hydraulic fracturing to federal regulation under laws such as the Safe Drinking Water Act. If adopted, these bills could result in additional chemical disclosure and permitting requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations as well as various restrictions on those operations. These requirements and restrictions could result in delays in operations at existing and new well sites as well as increased costs to make our wells productive. Moreover, these bills would require the public disclosure of information regarding the chemical makeup of hydraulic fracturing fluids, many of which are proprietary to the service companies that perform the hydraulic fracturing operations. If enacted, these laws could make it easier for third parties to initiate litigation against us in the event of perceived problems with drinking water wells in the vicinity of an oil or gas well or other alleged environmental problems. In May 2015 the EPA released its draft report, assessment of the Potential Impacts of Hydraulic Fracturing on Drinking Water Resources. This report has been under public and EPA review and has not yet been finalized. Also, in March 2015, the U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management (&#8220;BLM&#8221;) released final regulations, in 2015, concerning hydraulic fracturing on federal and tribal lands, including chemical disclosure. These rules are currently under judicial challenge. In addition to these federal 

legislative and regulatory proposals, some states and local governments have considered imposing, or have adopted various conditions and restrictions on hydraulic fracturing operations, including but not limited to requirements regarding chemical disclosure, casing and cementing of wells, withdrawal of water for use in high-volume hydraulic fracturing of horizontal wells, baseline testing of nearby water wells, and restrictions on the type of additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations. In some states, including Texas, water use may also be regulated and potentially curtailed by local groundwater management districts which could impact water available for hydraulic fracturing. If these types of conditions are widely adopted, we could be subject to increased costs and possibly limits on the productivity of certain wells. Some states in which we operate have implemented disclosure requirements for chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. Additional information concerning hydraulic fracturing is included under Item 1A. related to risk factors. 

&#160; 

Climate Change Legislation and Greenhouse Gas Regulation. &#32;Studies over recent years have indicated that emissions of certain gases may be contributing to warming of the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere. In response to these studies, many nations have agreed to limit emissions of &#8220;greenhouse gases&#8221; or &#8220;GHGs&#8221; pursuant to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and the &#8220;Kyoto Protocol.&#8221; Methane, a primary component of natural gas, and carbon dioxide, a byproduct of the burning of oil, gas, and refined petroleum products, are considered &#8220;greenhouse gases&#8221; regulated by the Kyoto Protocol. In December 2015, the U.S. participated in the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France. The Paris Agreement (adopted at the conference) calls for nations to undertake efforts with respect to global temperatures and GHG emissions. If ratified, the Paris Agreement will take effect in 2020. It is possible that the Paris Agreement and subsequent domestic and international regulations will have adverse effects on the market for oil, gas and other fossil fuel products as well as adverse effects on the business and operations of companies engaged in the exploration for, and production of, oil, gas and other fossil fuel products. We are unable to predict the timing, scope and effect of any currently proposed or future investigations, laws, regulations or treaties regarding climate change and GHG emissions that may arise from the Paris Agreement, but the direct and indirect costs of such investigations, laws, regulations and treaties (if enacted) could materially and adversely affect our operations, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, several states have adopted legislation and regulations to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Restrictions on emissions of methane or carbon dioxide that may be imposed in various states could adversely affect our operations and demand for our products. As a result of the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts, et al. v. EPA , on December 7, 2009, the EPA issued a finding that serves as the foundation under the Clean Air Act to issue other rules that would result in federal greenhouse gas regulations and emissions limits under the Clean Air Act, even without Congressional action. As part of this array of new regulations, the EPA has issued a GHG monitoring and reporting rule that requires certain parties, including participants in the oil and gas industry, to monitor and report their GHG emissions, including methane and carbon dioxide, to the EPA. These regulations may apply to our operations. The EPA has adopted other rules that would regulate GHGs, one of which would regulate GHGs from stationary sources, and may affect sources in the oil and gas exploration and production industry and the pipeline industry. Moreover, in January 2015, the Obama Administration announced that it would directly regulate methane emissions from the oil and gas industry as part of its climate strategy. Although the announcement gave no details on the upcoming regulations, it warned that the oil and gas sector will need to reduce its methane emissions by 40 to 50 percent from 2012 emission levels by 2025. Subsequently, on September 18, 2015, the EPA proposed three rules and issued a notice of availability of a draft Control Techniques Document relating to air emissions from the oil and gas industry. Further, on November 27, 2015, the EPA requested information related to hazardous air pollutant emissions from oil and gas operations. Additional rules from the EPA, BLM, and Department of Energy are expected under the EPA's methane plan. The EPA&#8217;s finding, the greenhouse gas reporting rule, the methane plan and the other rules to regulate the emissions of greenhouse gases may affect the cost of our operations and also affect the outcome of other climate change lawsuits pending in United States federal courts in a manner unfavorable to our industry. 

&#160; 

Although various climate change legislative measures have been under consideration by the U.S. Congress, it is not possible at this time to predict when, or if, Congress will act on climate change legislation. Finally, some states, either individually or through multi-state regional initiatives, have begun implementing legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs, primarily through the planned development of emission inventories or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs. Depending on the particular jurisdiction of our operations, we could be required to purchase and surrender allowances for GHG emissions resulting from our operations. Any of the climate change regulatory and legislative initiatives described above could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Additional information concerning climate change is included under Item 1A. related to risk factors. 

&#160; 

National Environmental Policy Act. Oil and gas exploration and production activities on federal lands are subject to the National Environmental Policy Act, which we refer to as NEPA. NEPA requires federal agencies, including the Department of Interior, to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency will prepare an Environmental Assessment that assesses the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project and, if necessary, will prepare a more detailed Environmental Impact Statement that may be made available for public review and comment. If we were to conduct any exploration and production 

activities on federal lands in the future, those activities would need to obtain governmental permits that are subject to the requirements of NEPA. This process has the potential to delay the development of oil and gas projects. 

&#160; 

Endangered Species Act. The Endangered Species Act, which we refer to as the ESA, restricts activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats. While some of our properties may be located in areas that may be designated as habitat for endangered or threatened species, we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the ESA. Looking forward, we expect more listings of such species to occur, in light of consent decrees involving the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service which require the agency to decide whether or not to list, as endangered or threatened, approximately 251 candidate species by 2016. Included in this group are a number of species which, if listed, could include habitat in areas where we operate or plan to operate. Further, some of the species could become subject to voluntary rangeland conservation plans that could affect our operations. Such listing of additional species, or the discovery of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species, or the adoption of conservation plans, could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions, construction delays, or bans on operating in the affected areas. 

&#160; 

Abandonment Costs. All of our oil and gas wells will require proper plugging and abandonment at some time in the future. We have posted bonds with most regulatory agencies to ensure compliance with our plugging responsibility. Plugging and abandonment operations and associated reclamation of the surface site are important components of our environmental management system. We plan accordingly for the ultimate disposition of properties that are no longer producing. 

Title to Properties 

&#160; 

As is customary in the oil and gas industry, we make only a cursory review of title to undeveloped oil and gas leases at the time we acquire them. However, before drilling commences, we make a thorough title search, and any material defects in title are remedied prior to the time actual drilling of a well begins. To the extent title opinions or other investigations reflect title defects, we, rather than the seller/lessor of the undeveloped property, are typically obligated to cure any title defect at our expense. If we were unable to remedy or cure any title defect of a nature such that it would not be prudent to commence drilling operations on the property, we could suffer a loss of our entire investment in the property. We believe that we have good title to our properties, some of which are subject to immaterial encumbrances, easements and restrictions. The oil and gas properties we own are also typically subject to royalty and other similar non-cost bearing interests customary in the industry. We do not believe that any of these encumbrances or burdens will materially affect our ownership or use of our properties. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

We operate in a highly competitive environment. The principal resources necessary for the exploration and production of oil and gas are leasehold prospects under which oil and gas reserves may be discovered, drilling rigs and related equipment and services to explore for such reserves and knowledgeable personnel to conduct all phases of oil and gas operations. We must compete for such resources with both major oil and gas companies and independent operators. Many of these competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than ours. Although we believe our current operating and financial resources are adequate to preclude any significant disruption of our near term operations, we cannot assure you that such materials and resources will be available to us in the future. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of March 10, 2016, we had 99 full-time employees. We retain independent geological, land, marketing and engineering consultants from time to time and expect to continue to do so in the future.
