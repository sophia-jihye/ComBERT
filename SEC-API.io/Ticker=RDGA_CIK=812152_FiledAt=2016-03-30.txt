 ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

&#160;

Ridgefield Acquisition Corp. (the &#34;Company&#34;) was incorporated as a Colorado corporation on October 13, 1983 under the name Ozo Diversified, Inc. On June 23, 2006, the Company filed Articles of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada that effected the merger between the Company and a wholly-owned subsidiary formed under the laws of the State of Nevada (&#34;RAC-NV&#34;), pursuant to the Articles of Merger, whereby RAC-NV was the surviving corporation. The merger changed the domicile of the Company from the State of Colorado to the State of Nevada. Furthermore, as a result of the Articles of Merger the Company is authorized to issue 35,000,000 shares of capital stock consisting of 30,000,000 shares of common stock, $.001 par value per share and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $.01 par value per share.

&#160;

On March 9, 1999, the Company completed the sale of substantially all of its assets to JOT Automation, Inc. (the &#34;JOT Transaction&#34;). As a result of the JOT Transaction, the Company's historical business, the depaneling and routing business, was considered to be a &#34;discontinued operation&#34; and, consequently, provides no benefit to persons seeking to understand the Company's financial condition or results of operations. Following the JOT Transaction the Company devoted its efforts to the development of a prototype micro-robotic device (the &#34;micro-robotic device&#34;) to manipulate organic tissues on an extremely small scale. Due to the inability to complete the micro-robotic device, the Company determined that it would cease the development of the micro-robotic device and, as of June 30, 2000, the capitalized costs related to the patent underlying the micro-robotic device were written off by the Company.

&#160;

On March 19, 2002, the Company was awarded United States Patent No. US 6,358,749 B1 for the &#34;Automated System for Chromosome Microdissection and Method of Using Same&#34; (the &#34;Patent&#34;). During the first quarter of 2003, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized the formation of a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company for the purposes of owning, developing and exploiting the Patent. On March 3, 2003, the Company filed Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada to form Bio-Medical Automation, Inc., a Nevada corporation wholly-owned by the Company (&#34;Bio-Medical&#34; or the &#34;Subsidiary&#34;). In May 2003, the Company transferred the Patent to the Subsidiary in exchange for 100% of the outstanding shares of the common stock of the Subsidiary. The Company never derived any revenues from the Patent.

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, Bio-Medical had 35,000,000 shares of capital stock authorized for issuance consisting of (1) 30,000,000 shares of common stock par value $.001 per share; and (2) 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock par value $.01 per share. Bio-Medical has 1,140,773 shares of its common stock issued and outstanding, all of which are owned by the Company. Bio-Medical has no shares of preferred stock issued or outstanding. A copy of the Articles of Incorporation and bylaws of Bio-Medical are attached to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-KSB for the year ended December 31, 2005 as Exhibit 3.6 and Exhibit 3.7, respectively, and such documents are incorporated herein by reference.

&#160;

Since July 2000, the Company has suspended all operations, except for necessary administrative matters relating to the timely filing of periodic reports as required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Accordingly, during the year ended December 31, 2015 the Company has earned no revenues other than interest income.

Acquisition Strategy 

&#160;

The Company's plan of operation is to arrange for a merger, acquisition, business combination or other arrangement by and between the Company and a viable operating entity. The Company has not identified a viable operating entity for a merger, acquisition, business combination or other arrangement, and there can be no assurance that the Company will ever successfully arrange for a merger, acquisition, business combination or other arrangement by and between the Company and a viable operating entity.

&#160;

The Company anticipates that the selection of a business opportunity will be a complex process and will involve a number of risks, because potentially available business opportunities may occur in many different industries and may be in various stages of development. Due in part to depressed economic conditions in a number of geographic areas, rapid technological advances being made in some industries and shortages of available capital, management believes that there are numerous firms seeking either the limited additional capital which the Company will have or the benefits of a publicly traded corporation, or both. The perceived benefits of a publicly traded corporation may include facilitating or improving the terms upon which additional equity financing may be sought, providing liquidity for principal shareholders, creating a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees, providing liquidity for all shareholders and other factors.

&#160;

In some cases, management of the Company will have the authority to effect acquisitions without submitting the proposal to the shareholders for their consideration. In some instances, however, the proposed participation in a business opportunity may be submitted to the shareholders for their consideration, either voluntarily by the Board of Directors to seek the shareholders' advice and consent, or because of a requirement of state law to do so.

&#160;

In seeking to arrange a merger, acquisition, business combination or other arrangement by and between the Company and a viable operating entity, management's objective will be to obtain long-term capital appreciation for the Company's shareholders. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to complete any merger, acquisition, business combination or other arrangement by and between the Company and a viable operating entity.

&#160;

The Company may need additional funds in order to effectuate a merger, acquisition or other arrangement by and between the Company and a viable operating entity, although there is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain such additional funds, if needed. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional funds there is no assurance that the Company will be able to effectuate a merger, acquisition or other arrangement by and between the Company and a viable operating entity.

&#160;

Investment Strategy 

&#160;

On August 25, 2003, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized the Company to invest a portion of the Company's cash in marketable securities in an effort to realize a greater rate of return than the Company had been earning in light of historically low interest rates. The Board directed that management maintain at least $40,000 of the Company's cash in a federally insured bank or money market account.

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, the Company held no investments in marketable securities. While the Company will endeavor to invest in securities that have a potential for gain, there can be no assurances that the Company will not suffer losses based on its Investment Strategy.

As of March 24, 2016, the Company had 1 employee, Steven N. Bronson, who serves as the Company's President. The Company does not have any employees that are represented by a union or other collective bargaining group.
