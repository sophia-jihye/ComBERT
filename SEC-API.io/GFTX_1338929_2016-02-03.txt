 ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS OUR COMPANY 

&#160; 

Our principal offices are located at 2001 RT 46, Suite 201, Parsippany, New Jersey 07054. Our telephone number is 973-291-8900 

Since our formation in 2004, we had operated as a magazine publishing company until 2007 when we ceased all publishing operations. We had operated principally through out two wholly-owned subsidiaries Sobe Life LLC and Poker Life LLC. Our publications included &#8220;Trump Magazine,&#8221; &#8220;Poker Life Magazine&#8221; and several poker oriented magazines we prepared and published for several on-line gaming companies. Thru the present date we have incurred losses of $8,485,689 from operations principally from the former magazine operations. 

&#160; 

Current Business Plan 

&#160; 

Since ceasing the publishing operations of the former company and management, our operations consist solely of utilizing the expertise of our Board Members and outside agents to further the efforts our Advisory Services business plan thru a wholly-owned subsidiary known as Trident Merchant Group, Inc which generates revenue through both cash and/or equity owned in the client company. 

In 2012 Direct LED a client of our Company via Trident Merchang Group filed an S-1 registration statement which was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission in January of 2013 and we expect to file a 15c2-11 with FINRA in the future to begin trading in the common stock. Trough Trident Merchant Group, the Company maintains an equity position in Direct LED. 

During 2014, Trident Merchang Group continued to advise its client, Flex Fuel Technologies. 

In addition, during 2013 Trident Merchant Group signed an advisory agreement with Hispanica Delights of America which is now trading on the OTC Pink. Although Trident Merchant Group&#8217;s services have been completed for Hispanica Delights of America, the Company still maintains an equity position in Hispanica Delights of America.

&#160; 

Although it is hopeful that the client companies will establish a public market for their common stock and if successful would be beneficial for Global Fashion Technologies, Inc. and its shareholders, there can be no assurance that such events will be successful. 

In 2014, Global Fashion Technologies, Inc. stopped developing a footprint in the apparel business due to cash restraints and logistics and during the current year we ceased agreements with all third parties to distribute their products into SE Asia and China 

We also dissolved our majority owned joint venture with Cabe Studio a US based Couture Fashion designer 

We continue to use our limited resources to pay for our minimal operations as well as for our legal, accounting and professional services required to prepare and file our reports with the SEC in our efforts to stay a &#8220;fully reporting&#8221; company. Our financial resources will only be sufficient to sustain our operations for the short-term or until the point that we can either obtain additional financing and/or monetize our equity interest(s) in one or more of our client companies. 

There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing, monetize our equity interest(s) or even identify an acceptable operating company to combine with and complete an acquisition, nor that any business we could acquire will generate profits or increase the value of the Company and or the common stock price. If we are unable to locate additional financing within the short-term, we may be forced to suspend all public reporting with the SEC and in the extreme case possibly liquidate or dissolve the corporation.. 

Our indebtedness is substantial and as of December 31, 2014, we were still in the process of resolving any outstanding indebtedness. 

We have written down a substantial portion of our vendor debt in order to further the efforts of cleaning up our balance sheet. 

We have also eliminated thru conversions the vast majority of the Unsecured Convertible Note Holders. The total stock issued in conjunction with the conversions in 2014 was 89,000 shares. 

We are now in the process of transitioning from an advisory company to a corporate uniform manufacturing and supply Company thru an exclusive license we signed with Pure System International, LLC a global leader in the fiber recycling field. The Company plans on spending all of its efforts in developing this as its sole business in 2016 and beyond. The financing of such business opportunity we expect to complete in 2016
