 Item 1. Business 

&#160; 

Introduction 

&#160; 

We are a blank check company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands as a business company with limited liability. This means that our shareholders have no additional liability for the company&#8217;s liabilities over and above the amount paid for their shares. We were formed for the purpose of acquiring, engaging in a share exchange, share reconstruction and amalgamation, contractual control arrangement with, purchasing all or substantially all of the assets of, or engaging in any other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities. 

&#160; 

Prior to January 11, 2016, our efforts have been limited to organizational activities, our initial public offering, and the search for a suitable acquisition target. On January 11, 2016, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the &#8220;Share Exchange Agreement&#8221;) with Adrie Global Holdings Limited, a business company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands with limited liability (&#8220;Adrie&#8221;), each of Adrie&#8217;s shareholders (collectively, the &#8220;Sellers&#8221;), the Company&#8217;s sponsor, DeTiger Holdings Limited, in the capacity as the representative for the Company&#8217;s shareholders prior to the closing of the Business Combination (as defined below) (the &#8220;DT Representative&#8221;), and Li Jingping in the capacity as the representative for the Sellers (the &#8220;Seller Representative&#8221;), pursuant to which, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, the Company will effect an acquisition of Adrie and its subsidiaries, including certain wholly foreign-owned enterprises registered in China which contractually control Urumqi Feng Hui Direct Lending Limited, a registered company in Xinjiang China (&#8220;China Lending&#8221; and collectively with Adrie and their respective subsidiaries and variable interest entities , the &#8220;China Lending Group&#8221;) by acquiring from the Sellers all outstanding equity interests of Adrie (the &#8220;Business Combination&#8221;). 

&#160; 

We intend to hold a special meeting of shareholders to approve the Business Combination. On June 21, 2016 we filed a definitive proxy statement (the &#8220;Proxy Statement&#8221;) on Schedule 14A containing information about the Business Combination. If the Business Combination is approved, then concurrently with the Business Combination, we will provide our shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares for cash equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust. The description of the Share Exchange Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Share Exchange Agreement which was filed with the SEC on the Company&#8217;s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on January 13, 2016 and the Proxy Statement filed on June 21, 2016. You are urged to read the entire Share Exchange Agreement and the other exhibits attached thereto. 

&#160; 

Additional information about the proposed Business Combination, the business of China Lending Group and the special meeting are available, without charge, at the SEC&#8217;s website ( http://www.sec.gov ). Other than specific references to the Business Combination, the discussion in this Annual Report is as of March 31, 2016. 

&#160; 

Business Strategy 

&#160; 

Our efforts in identifying prospective target businesses were not limited to a particular country, although we sought to capitalize on the global network and investing and operating experience of our management team and board of directors to identify, acquire and operate one or more businesses that have their primary operations located in Asia (with an emphasis on China). 

&#160; 

Our team consists of experienced financial services professionals, senior operating executives, directors of Asian companies, and specifically a Certified Public Accountant (&#8220;CPA&#8221;) and a China Certified Tax Accountant (&#8220;CTA&#8221;). Our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer (&#8220;CEO&#8221;), and directors have decades of experience in mergers, acquisitions and divestures of privately and publicly-held companies. Both our Chairman and CEO have been actively engaged in cross-border investments/divestments between the U.S. and Asia (with an emphasis on China) for several decades, while also assisting U.S. companies with expansion in China and vice versa since the early 1990s. In addition, our CEO has had significant prior experience with China-focused blank check companies, from 2005 to 2010. Our independent directors are Chinese and Hong Kong natives who have decades of experience in entrepreneurship, asset management/advisory services, and accounting &#38; tax practices in Mainland China and Hong Kong. We believe we will benefit from their accomplishments in Asia, and specifically their current activities in China, in identifying attractive acquisition opportunities. However, there is no assurance that we will complete a business combination. 

&#160; 

There was no restriction in the geographic location of targets we could pursue, however we prioritized geographic locations in Asia, and specifically China. We sought to identify targets that are likely to provide attractive financial returns through business combinations.

&#160; 

Significant Activities Since Inception 

&#160; 

On October 6, 2014, we consummated our initial public offering of 6,000,000 units, each unit consisting one ordinary share, no par value per share (&#8220;Ordinary Share&#8221;), one right (&#8220;Right&#8221;) to receive one-tenth (1/10) of one Ordinary Share upon consummation of an initial business combination and one warrant (&#8220;Warrant&#8221;) to purchase one-half of one Ordinary Share at an exercise price of $12.00 per full share, pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-197187). The units were sold in our initial public offering at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $60,000,000 (before underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses). Simultaneously with the consummation of our initial public offering, we completed a private placement of (i) 320,000 units in the aggregate to the underwriter and our sponsor at $10.00 per unit and (ii) 1,800,000 warrants to our sponsor at a price of $0.50 per warrant, generating total proceeds of $4,100,000. 

&#160; 

On October 14, 2014, the underwriter exercised its over-allotment option in part and purchased 860,063 Over-Allotment Units, which were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $8,600,630. Simultaneously with the sale of the Over-Allotment Units, we consummated the private sale of an additional 32,253 private units at a price of $10.00 per unit, for an aggregate purchase price of $322,530, and 258,007 warrants to our sponsor, at a price of $0.50 per warrant, for an aggregate purchase price of $129,004. Since the underwriter exercised the over-allotment option in part, and purchased 860,063 of the total possible 900,000 additional Units, the sponsor forfeited 9,985 shares. 

&#160; 

A total of $69,972,643 from the net proceeds from our initial public offering (including the Over-Allotment Units), and the private placements on October 6, 2014 and October 14, 2014, were placed in a trust account established for the benefit of our public stockholders. 

&#160; 

The units began trading on October 1, 2014 on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol &#8220;CADTU&#8221;. Commencing on October 22, 2014, the securities comprising the units began to trade separately. The units, ordinary shares, warrants and rights are trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbols &#8220;CADTU,&#8221; &#8220;CADT,&#8221; &#8220;CADTW&#8221; and &#8220;CADTR,&#8221; respectively. 

&#160; 

After the payment of approximately $440,000 in expenses relating to our initial public offering (other than underwriting commissions), approximately $69,972,643 of the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the private placement of the units (or approximately $10.20 per unit sold in our initial public offering) was deposited in a trust account with Continental Stock Transfer &#38; Trust Company as trustee. 

&#160; 

In connection with the Company&#8217;s March 31, 2016 meeting of shareholders to approve an extension of the date to complete an initial business combination from April 6, 2016 to July 6, 2016 (the &#8220;Extension Meeting&#8221;), a total of 5,255,657 ordinary shares were redeemed. On April 1, 2016, our sponsor deposited into the trust account approximately $96,000 (the &#8220;Contribution&#8221;), which amount was equal to $0.06 for each of the 1,604,406 public shares of the Company that were not redeemed in connection with the extension. As a result of the Contribution and following redemption of the public shares in connection with the extension, the pro rata portion of the funds available in the trust account for the public shares that were not redeemed increased from approximately $10.20 per share to approximately $10.26 per share. 

&#160; 

All proceeds in the trust account may be invested in either U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and that invest solely in U.S. Treasuries. Except for a portion of the interest income (net of taxes payable) that may be released to us to fund our working capital requirements, none of the funds held in the trust account will be released until the earlier of the completion of our initial business combination and the redemption of 100% of our public shares if we are unable to consummate a business combination by July 6, 2016. The net proceeds deposited into the trust account in the initial public offering and in connection with the Extension Meeting and Contribution remain on deposit in the trust account earning interest. As of March 31, 2016, there was approximately $70.0 million held in the trust account, including accrued interest of approximately $111,000, and $53,115 held outside the trust account for working capital purposes. As of March 31, 2016, no funds had been withdrawn from the trust account for taxes or working capital purposes. As of June 20, 2016, there was approximately $16.5 million held in the trust account following the release of $53,607,701 for redemptions, plus approximately $111,000 in accrued interest withdrawn from the trust account for taxes or working capital purposes. 

&#160; 

Share Exchange Agreement 

&#160; 

As discussed above, on January 11, 2016, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with Adrie, Sellers, our sponsor, and Li Jingping, pursuant to which, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, the Company will effect an acquisition of China Lending Group by acquiring from the Sellers all outstanding equity interests of Adrie. 

&#160; 

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of Adrie, the Company will issue 20 million ordinary shares of DT Asia to the Sellers (&#8220;Exchange Shares&#8221;), with 8 million of such Exchange Shares (&#8220;Escrow Shares&#8221;) being deposited in escrow at the closing of the Business Combination and subject to forfeiture (along with dividends and other earnings otherwise payable with respect to such Escrow Shares) in the event that the post-combination company fails to meet certain minimum financial performance targets or in the event that the DT Representative successfully brings an indemnification claim under the Share Exchange Agreement on behalf of the Company&#8217;s pre-combination shareholders. The Exchange Shares, including the Escrow Shares, will be allocated among the Sellers pro-rata based on each Seller&#8217;s ownership of Adrie prior to the Business Combination. 

&#160; 

The Escrow Shares will be held in an escrow account maintained by Continental Stock Transfer &#38; Trust Company (&#8220;Continental&#8221;), as escrow agent (the &#8220;Escrow Agent&#8221;). While the Escrow Shares are held in escrow, any dividends and other distributions otherwise payable with respect to the Escrow Shares will be held back by us and not paid until the Escrow Shares are released from escrow to the Sellers in proportion to their respective equity interests in Adrie immediately prior to the closing of the Business Combination, but the Sellers will be entitled to vote the Escrow Shares. Subject to indemnification claims, one-third of the Escrow Shares (along with the related accrued dividends and distributions) shall be released upon the post-combination company obtaining certain specified adjusted consolidated net income targets in each of calendar years 2016, 2017 and 2018, and with the Sellers also able to earn the Escrow Shares for any fiscal years where the target was not met through an alternative earn-out payment if the average adjusted consolidated net income for all three years combined meets a certain specified target. If the respective targets are met, the applicable Escrow Shares will be released on or before the 130 th day after the subject year end. The adjusted consolidated net income targets are based on the cash available at the closing from the trust funds (after giving effect to the redemptions) and the shares issued in the PIPE Preferred Investment, net of our transaction expenses and deferred initial public offering fees (also referred to herein as the net closing proceeds), with the scale range of the net closing proceeds being from $0 million to $69.0 million, and the target adjusted consolidated net income ranging in 2016 from $20.2 million at the bottom to $32.0 million at the top, in 2017 from $22.6 million at the bottom to $38.0 million at the top, and in 2018 from $25.6 million at the bottom to $44.0 million at the top, and with the average adjusted consolidated net income target for the alternative earn-out payment ranging from $23.3 million at the bottom to $40.0 million at the top. The targets will also be reduced based on the date of the closing of the Business Combination, with the 2016 target reduced by an amount equal to 50% of the 2016 target multiplied by a fraction based on the number of days in the 2016 calendar year prior to the closing date as compared to the number of days in the 2016 calendar year, and with the average adjusted consolidated net income target being reduced by 1/3 of the amount by which the 2016 target is reduced. So long as the upper limit for the annual rate of private borrowing and lending allowed in Xinjiang, China is four times the Peoples&#8217; Bank of China base interest rate, the targets are further adjusted based on the change in the Peoples&#8217; Bank of China base interest rate from the June 30, 2015 rate of 4.85%. The actual targets for purposes of determining adjusted consolidated net income will be expressed in their RMB equivalent based on the June 30, 2015 US dollar/CNY exchange rate of 6.1088 (as of January 22, 2016, the US dollar/CNY exchange rate was 6.5788). The adjusted consolidated net income will be determined using the post-combination company&#8217;s consolidated net income as determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, expressed in RMB based upon the June 30, 2015 exchange rate, and with such amounts subject to adjustment to exclude the effects of any new businesses that we acquire after the closing, any extraordinary gains or losses or extraordinary income or expenses and any non-recurring revenue earned outside of the ordinary course of business. 

&#160; 

Sellers will not transfer, assign or sell the remaining 12.0 million Exchange Shares for a period of one year from the closing of the Business Combination (which period may be shortened under certain circumstances). 

&#160; 

PIPE Preferred Investment Financing 

&#160; 

As a condition to the Business Combination, we intend to sell a minimum of at least $12 million (and up to $24 million, and potentially more with the consent of BVICo) of new Series A Convertible Preferred Stock to be created by us prior to the closing in a private placement to certain investors (also referred to herein as the PIPE Preferred Investment) at a per share price of $12.00. Such Series A Convertible Preferred Stock will be sold contingent upon the closing of the Business Combination with China Lending Group and may be subject to certain other conditions to be negotiated during the period between the signing of the Share Exchange Agreement and the closing of the Business Combination. We intend to use the net proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes for the combined business after the Business Combination. As of June 28, 2016, the Company has received executed subscription agreements for an aggregate subscription amount of $10,320,000 for the PIPE Preferred Investment, of which $8,239,212 had been received into escrow. We expect to receive the balance of the funds into escrow prior to the closing of the Business Combination.

&#160; 

Special Meeting of Shareholders 

&#160; 

We intend to hold a special meeting of shareholders on July 5, 2016 to approve the Business Combination. It is anticipated that, following completion of the Business Combination and if there are no additional redemptions, DT Asia&#8217;s existing shareholders, including our sponsor, will retain an ownership interest of approximately 18.4% of the Company, and Sellers will own approximately 81.6% of the Company. These percentages are calculated based on a number of assumptions (as described in the Proxy Statement filed on June 21, 2016) and are subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the Share Exchange Agreement. &#160; 

&#160;

Effecting our Initial Business Combination 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

We are not presently engaged in any operations. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination by issuing ordinary shares as the consideration to the sellers of the acquired business.. 

&#160; 

We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination, and we may effectuate our initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the trust account. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would consummate such financing only simultaneously with the consummation of our business combination. In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing the business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law or the Nasdaq Capital Market, we would seek shareholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our initial business combination. As discussed above, in connection with the Business Combination, we intend to sell a minimum of $12 million of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock in the PIPE Preferred Investment. As of June 28, 2016, the Company has received executed subscription agreements for an aggregate subscription amount of $10,320,000 for the PIPE Preferred Investment, of which $8,239,212 had been received into escrow. We expect to receive the balance of the funds into escrow prior to the closing of the Business Combination.

&#160; 

Investment Criteria 

&#160; 

We had identified the following general criteria and guidelines, which we believed were important in evaluating prospective target businesses. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Middle-Market Growth Business. We sought to acquire one or more growth businesses with a total enterprise value in excess of $300,000,000. We believed that there were a substantial number of potential target businesses within this valuation range that could benefit from new capital for scalable operations to yield significant revenue and earnings growth. We do not intend to acquire either a start-up company or a company with negative cash flow. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Companies with Opportunity to Strengthen Management and Add Value. We sought to acquire one or more businesses that provides a platform for the existing management team to leverage the experience of our management team. We believe that the operating expertise of our management team is well suited to complement and, if beneficial, replace the target&#8217;s management team. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Companies in Business Segments that are Strategically Significant to China. We sought to acquire those businesses with strong technological know-how, distribution networks and/or business practices in economic sectors that are currently experiencing significant Asia/China outbound investing. Such sectors include: Energy and resources, food processing, retail, manufacturing, and high technology business segments. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Business with Revenue and Earnings Growth Potential. We sought to acquire one or more businesses that have the potential for significant revenue and earnings growth through a combination of brand and new product development, increased production capacity, expense reduction and synergistic follow-on acquisitions resulting in increased operating leverage. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Companies with Potential for Strong Free Cash Flow Generation. We sought to acquire one or more businesses that have the potential to generate strong, stable and increasing free cash flow. We focused on businesses that had predictable revenue streams and definable low working capital and capital expenditure requirements. We also sought to leverage cash flow in order to enhance shareholder value. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Benefit from Being a Public Company. We intended to only acquire a business or businesses that would benefit from being publicly traded and which could effectively utilize access to broader sources of capital and a public profile that are associated with being a publicly traded company. &#160; 

These criteria were not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may have been based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may have deemed relevant. 

&#160; 

Sources of target businesses 

&#160; 

From the date of our initial public offering through execution of a non-binding letter of intent with Adrie on March 10, 2015, we had identified and evaluated over 60 acquisition target companies. In doing so, we followed the initial set of criteria and guidelines outlined above, which we believed were important in evaluating prospective targets. 

&#160; 

Target business candidates were brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers, venture capital funds, private equity groups, leveraged buyout funds, management buyout funds and other members of the financial community. Target businesses were brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources also introduced us to target businesses in which they thought we might be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources had read our SEC filings and knew what types of businesses we were targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as their affiliates, also brought to our attention target business candidates that they became aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. In addition, we received a number of proprietary deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the business relationships of our officers and directors. 

&#160; 

We were not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that was affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we sought to complete our initial business combination with such a company, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that such an initial business combination is fair to our unaffiliated shareholders from a financial point of view. 

&#160; 

&#160; 9 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Selection of a target business and structuring of our initial business combination 

&#160; 

Subject to the requirement that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses or assets having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any taxes) at the time of the agreement to enter into such initial business combination, our management had virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we were not permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations. In any case, we would only consummate an initial business combination in which we become the majority shareholder of the target (or control the target through contractual arrangements in limited circumstances for regulatory compliance purposes as discussed below) or were otherwise not required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. 

&#160; 

In evaluating a prospective target business, and in evaluating China Lending Group in particular, we have conducted a thorough due diligence review which has encompassed, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information which will be made available to us. 

&#160; 

The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty; however, assuming that shareholders approve the Business Combination at our special meeting of shareholders by July 6, 2016, and all conditions to closing are met or otherwise waived, we expect to close the Business Combination shortly thereafter. 

&#160; 

Alternative structures to comply with regulations in certain Chinese industries 

&#160; 

The PRC government has restricted or limited direct foreign ownership of certain kinds of assets and companies operating in a wide variety of industries, including certain aspects of telecommunications, advertising, financial institutions, food production, and heavy equipment manufacturers. As a result, it is not uncommon to employ alternative structures to acquire a target company in such acquired. The competent PRC authorities (i.e. the National Development &#38; Reform Commission and Ministry of Commerce) have been issuing and updating a Catalogue of Industry for the Guidance of Foreign Investment listing the encouraged, restricted and forbidden industries for foreign investment (originally issued in 2002 and amended in 2004, 2007, 2011 and 2015). It is seen from the evolution of such catalogue more industries have become open to foreign investment, though there can be restrictions on the foreign ownership of businesses that are determined from time to time to be in &#8220;important industries&#8221; that may affect the national economic security or having &#8220;famous Chinese brand names&#8221; or &#8220;well established Chinese brand names&#8221;. Subject to the review requirements of the Ministry of Commerce and other relevant agencies for acquisitions of assets and companies in China and subject to the various percentage ownership limitations that exist from time to time, acquisitions involving foreign investors and parties in the various restricted categories of assets and industries may nonetheless sometimes be consummated using contractual arrangements with permitted Chinese parties which could, for example, result in a structure where, in exchange for our payment of the acquisition consideration, the target business would be majority or wholly owned by Chinese residents whom we designate, and the target business would continue to hold the requisite licenses necessary to operate its business. To the extent such agreements are employed, they may be for control of specific assets such as intellectual property or control of blocks of the equity ownership interests of a company. The agreements would be designed to secure for us economic benefits and to assume risk of losses and control over the subject assets or equity interests similar to the rights of full ownership, while leaving the technical ownership in the hands of Chinese parties. 

&#160; 

For example, these contracts could result in a structure where, in exchange for our payment of the acquisition consideration: (i) the target company would be majority owned by Chinese residents whom would be likely designated by us and the target company would continue to hold the requisite licenses for the target business and (ii) we would establish a new subsidiary in China which would provide technology, technical support, consulting and related services to the target company in exchange for fees, which would transfer to us substantially all of the economic benefits of ownership of the target company. 

&#160; 

These contractual arrangements would be designed to provide the following: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Our exercise of effective control over the target company; &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; We will assume economic benefits and risk of losses of the target company that are substantially similar to full ownership; &#160; 

&#160; 10 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; The shareholders of the target company would grant us a pledged interest in all of the issued and outstanding interests of the target company, including the right to vote such shares, as security for the performance of the target company&#8217;s obligations under the contractual arrangements; &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; The shareholders of the target company would grant us an irrevocable proxy for the maximum period permitted by law, to vote the shareholders&#8217; shares in the target company in such manner and for or against such proposals as we may determine; and &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; We, or our designee, would have an exclusive option to purchase all or part of the equity interests in the target company owned by the Chinese residents whom we designate, or all or part of the assets of the target company, in each case when and to the extent permitted by PRC regulations. &#160; 

While we cannot predict the terms of any such contract that we will be able to negotiate, at a minimum, any contractual arrangement would need to provide us with effective control over the target&#8217;s operations and management either directly through board control or through affirmative and/or negative covenants and veto rights with respect to matters such as entry into material agreements, management changes and issuance of debt or equity securities, among other potential control provisions. We have not, however, established specific provisions which must be in an agreement in order to meet the definition of business combination. 

&#160; 

These agreements likely also would provide for increased ownership or full ownership and control by us when and if permitted under PRC law and regulation. If we choose to effect our initial business combination that employs the use of these types of control arrangements, we may have difficulty in enforcing our rights. Therefore, these contractual arrangements may not be as effective in providing us with the same economic benefits, accounting consolidation or control over a target business as would direct ownership through a merger or shares exchange. For example, if the target business or any other entity fails to perform its obligations under these contractual arrangements, we may have to incur substantial costs and expend substantial resources to enforce such arrangements, and rely on legal remedies under PRC law, including seeking specific performance or injunctive relief, and claiming damages, which we cannot assure you will be sufficient to off-set the cost of enforcement and may adversely affect the benefits we expect to receive from the business combination. 

&#160; 

While we believe under such contractual arrangement, we will be considered the primary beneficiary and be able to consolidate financial results of the target company in our consolidated financial statements. In the event that in the future generally accepted accounting policies in the United States and the SEC accounting regulations change and we are deemed not to be the primary beneficiary by controlling the target company through such contractual arrangement, we would not be able to consolidate line by line the target company&#8217;s financial results in our consolidated financial statements. 

&#160; 

Moreover, we expect that the contractual arrangements upon which we would be relying would be governed by PRC law and would be the only basis of providing resolution of disputes which may arise through either arbitration or litigation in China. Accordingly, these contracts would be interpreted in accordance with PRC law and any disputes would be resolved in accordance with PRC legal procedures. Uncertainties in the Chinese legal system could limit our ability to enforce these contractual arrangements. In the event we are unable to enforce these contractual arrangements, we may not be able to exert the effective level of control over the target business. 

&#160; 

China Lending Group utilizes the contractual arrangements described above and therefore, if we consummate the Business Combination, we would be subject to the uncertainties described above. As discussed in further detail in the Proxy Statement, we and our PRC counsel believe the ownership structure of China Lending Group, both currently and immediately after giving effect to the Business Combination, does not and will not violate any applicable PRC law or license currently in effect; and the contractual agreements by and among the China Lending Group entities and their respective shareholders are valid, binding and enforceable in accordance with their terms and applicable PRC laws and regulations currently in effect and will not violate any applicable PRC law currently in effect such as the PRC Laws regarding foreign ownership of Chinese businesses. However, there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of current PRC laws. Accordingly, the PRC regulatory authorities and PRC courts may in the future take a view that is contrary to our views and the views of our PRC legal counsel. If the PRC courts or regulatory authorities determine that the contractual agreements violate applicable PRC laws, our contractual arrangements will become invalid or unenforceable.

Circular of State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) on Foreign Exchange Administration over Overseas Investment and Financing and Round-trip Investment by Domestic Residents via Overseas Special Purpose Vehicles (Circular 37) 

&#160; 

If any contractual arrangements as mentioned above were used in an acquisition and one or several direct or indirect shareholders holds shares in the bidding company is a PRC resident, such acquisition would be subject to requirement under Circular 37 and other relevant SAFE regulations. Circular 37 became effective as of July 4 2014 to replace the SAFE Circular No75 on Relevant Issues concerning Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Residents to Engage in Financing and in Return Investment via Overseas Special Purpose Vehicles dated October 21, 2005. According to Circular 37, a PRC resident can conduct a round-trip investment into a PRC enterprise via overseas special purpose vehicles provided that such resident shall make relevant registration with SAFE.

Security review system for inbound mergers and acquisitions 

&#160; 

On February 3, 2011, the State Council issued the Notice of the General Office of the State Council on the Establishment of the Security Review System for Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors (No.6 [2011] of the General Office of the State Council) which stipulate a review system for mergers and acquisitions of domestic enterprise by foreign investors. Unlike criteria under anti-trust law and relevant regulations, security review mainly focuses on the influence of mergers and acquisitions on the national security, the stable operation of the national economy, the order of basic social welfare and the capacity of research and development of key technologies involving national security. The security review system covers a wide range of sensitive areas and the foreign investment into such areas is required to be subject to such security review system. 

&#160; 

Fair market value of target business or businesses 

&#160; 

The target business or businesses or assets with which we effect our initial business combination must have a collective fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding taxes) at the time of the agreement to enter into such initial business combination. If we acquired less than 100% of one or more target businesses in our initial business combination, the aggregate fair market value of the portion or portions we acquire must have equaled at least 80% of the value of the trust account at the time of the agreement to enter into such initial business combination. However, we would always acquire at least a controlling interest in a target business. The fair market value of a portion of a target business or assets would likely be calculated by multiplying the fair market value of the entire business by the percentage of the target we acquire. We could have sought to consummate our initial business combination with an initial target business or businesses with a collective fair market value in excess of the balance in the trust account. In order to consummate such an initial business combination, we could have issued a significant amount of debt, equity or other securities to the sellers of such business and/or seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt, equity or other securities. If we issued securities in order to consummate such an initial business combination, our shareholders could end up owning a minority of the combined company&#8217;s voting securities as there is no requirement that our shareholders own a certain percentage of our company (or, depending on the structure of the initial business combination, an ultimate parent company that may be formed) after our business combination. 

&#160; 

The fair market value of a target business or businesses or assets would be determined by our board of directors based upon standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as actual and potential gross margins, the values of comparable businesses, earnings and cash flow, book value and, where appropriate, upon the advice of appraisers or other professional consultants. If our board of directors was not able to independently determine that the target business or assets has a sufficient fair market value to meet the threshold criterion, we will obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated, independent investment banking firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criterion. In the case of China Lending Group, we obtained a fairness opinion from Cassel Salpeter &#38; Co., LLC. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless we consummated a business combination with an affiliated entity, we were not required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that the price we were paying was fair to our shareholders. 

&#160; 

Lack of business diversification 

&#160; 

For an indefinite period of time after consummation of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success might depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it was probable that we would not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By consummating our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination, and &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services. &#160; 

&#160; 12 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Redemption rights for public shareholders upon consummation of our initial business combination 

&#160; 

We intend to seek shareholder approval for the Business Combination with China Lending Group and related transactions at our July 5, 2016 special meeting of shareholders. We will provide our shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares upon the consummation of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account was initially anticipated to be $10.20 per share. In connection with the Extension Meeting, a total of 5,255,657 ordinary shares were redeemed. On April 1, 2016, our sponsor deposited into the trust account approximately $96,000, which amount was equal to $0.06 for each of the 1,604,406 public shares of DT Asia that were not redeemed in connection with the extension. As a result of the Contribution and following redemption of the public shares in connection with the extension, the pro rata portion of the funds available in the trust account for the public shares that were not redeemed, net of taxes payable, increased from approximately $10.20 per share to approximately $10.26 per share. Our sponsor has agreed to waive its right to receive liquidating distributions if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within the requisite time period. However, if our sponsor or any of our officers, directors or affiliates acquires public shares after our initial public offering, they will be entitled to receive liquidating distributions with respect to such public shares if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within the required time period. 

&#160; 

Manner of Conducting Redemptions 

&#160; 

We will provide our shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of the Business Combination in connection with the July 5, 2016 shareholder meeting called to approve the business combination. 

&#160; 

We intend to hold a shareholder vote in connection with the Business Combination. In such case, we will conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies. We have distributed proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provided our public shareholders with the redemption rights described above upon consummation of the Business Combination. 

&#160; 

If we seek shareholder approval, we will consummate our Business Combination only if a majority of the outstanding ordinary shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. In such case, our sponsor has agreed to vote its founder shares and any of its public shares purchased after our initial public offering in favor of our initial business combination and our officers and directors have also agreed to vote any public shares purchased during or after our initial public offering in favor of the Business Combination. Currently, our sponsor, certain of its affiliates and our independent directors, together with the underwriter in our initial public offering, own approximately 54.7% of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares, including all of the founder shares. Each public shareholder may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. In addition, our sponsor has agreed to waive its redemption rights with respect to its founder shares and public shares in connection with the consummation of the Business Combination. 

&#160; 

Many blank check companies would not be able to consummate an initial business combination if the holders of the company&#8217;s public shares voted against a proposed business combination and elected to redeem more than a specified maximum percentage of the shares sold in such company&#8217;s initial public offering, which percentage threshold has typically been between 19.99% and 39.99%. As a result, many blank check companies have been unable to complete business combinations because the amount of shares voted by their public shareholders electing redemption exceeded the maximum redemption threshold pursuant to which such company could proceed with our initial business combination. Since we have no such specified maximum redemption threshold, our structure is different in this respect from the structure that has been used by many blank check companies. However, in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. Furthermore, the redemption threshold may be further limited by the terms and conditions of our initial business combination. In such case, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares and the related business combination. 

&#160; 

&#160; 13 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Limitation on redemption rights upon consummation of our initial business combination if we seek shareholder approval 

&#160; 

If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our memorandum and articles of association provides that a public shareholder, individually or together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a &#8220;group&#8221; (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering. We believe this restriction will discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder&#8217;s shares are not purchased by us or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our shareholders&#8217; ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to consummate our initial business combination, particularly in connection with our initial business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. We will resolve any disputes relating to whether a public shareholder is acting in concert or as a &#8220;group&#8221; either by requiring certifications under the penalty of perjury to such effect by public shareholders or via adjudication in court. 

&#160; 

Permitted purchases of our securities by our affiliates 

&#160; 

If we seek shareholder approval of our business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either prior to or following the consummation of our initial business combination. Such a purchase would include a contractual acknowledgement that such shareholder, although still the record holder of our shares is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. In the event that our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public shareholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling shareholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. Although very unlikely, our initial shareholders, officers, directors and their affiliates could purchase sufficient shares so that the initial business combination may be approved without the majority vote of public shares held by non-affiliates. It is intended that purchases will comply with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, which provides a safe harbor for purchases made under certain conditions, including with respect to timing, pricing and volume of purchases. 

&#160; 

&#160; 14 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

The purpose of such purchases would be to (1) increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the business combination or (2) to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of the business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. This may result in the consummation of an initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. 

&#160; 

As a consequence of any such purchases, the public &#8220;float&#8221; of our ordinary shares may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to obtain the listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange. 

&#160; 

Tendering share certificates in connection with a tender offer or redemption rights 

&#160; 

We will require our public shareholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in &#8220;street name,&#8221; to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the expiration date set forth in the tender offer documents or proxy materials mailed to such holders, or in the event we distribute proxy materials, up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination in the event we distribute proxy materials, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Company&#8217;s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder&#8217;s option. Accordingly, a public shareholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two days prior to the vote on the business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for shareholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares. 

&#160; 

There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $45.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. 

&#160; 

The foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the shareholders&#8217; vote on our initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such shareholder to arrange for him to deliver his certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the shareholder then had an &#8220;option window&#8221; after the consummation of the business combination during which he could monitor the price of the company&#8217;s shares in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he could sell his shares in the open market before actually delivering his shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which shareholders were aware they needed to commit before the shareholder meeting, would become &#8220;option&#8221; rights surviving past the consummation of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming holder&#8217;s election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved. 

&#160; 

Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the tender offer materials or the date of the shareholder meeting set forth in our proxy materials, as applicable. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our initial business combination. 

&#160; 

If our proposed Business Combination with China Lending Group is not consummated, we will not have enough time to consummate our initial business combination with a different target before our expiration date of July 6, 2016. 

&#160; 

&#160; 15 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Redemption of public shares and liquidation if no initial business combination 

&#160; 

We must complete our initial business combination by July 6, 2016. If we are unable to consummate the Business Combination with China Lending Group by July 6, 2016, we will, as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than five business days thereafter, distribute the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (less up to $50,000 of the net interest earned thereon to pay dissolution expenses), pro rata to our public shareholders by way of redemption and cease all operations except for the purposes of winding up of our affairs. This redemption of public shareholders from the trust account shall be done automatically by function of our memorandum and articles of association and prior to any voluntary winding up, although at all times subject to the Companies Act. 

&#160; 

Following the redemption of public shares, we intend to enter &#8220; voluntary liquidatio n&#8221; which is the statutory process for formally closing and dissolving a company under the laws of the British Virgin Islands. Given that we intend to enter voluntary liquidation following the redemption of public shareholders from the trust account, we do not expect that the voluntary liquidation process will cause any delay to the payment of redemption proceeds from our trust account. In connection with such a voluntary liquidation, the liquidator would give notice to creditors inviting them to submit their claims for payment, by notifying known creditors (if any) who have not submitted claims and by placing a public advertisement in at least one newspaper published in the British Virgin Islands newspaper and in at least one newspaper circulating in the location where the company has its principal place of business, and taking any other steps he considers appropriate to identify the company&#8217;s creditors, after which our remaining assets would be distributed. As soon as the affairs of the company are fully wound-up, the liquidator must complete his statement of account and make a notificational filing with the Registrar. We would be dissolved once the Registrar issues a Certificate of Dissolution. 

&#160; 

Our sponsor has agreed to waive its redemption rights with respect to its founder shares if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within the applicable period from the closing of our initial public offering. 

&#160; 

However, if our sponsor, or any of our officers, directors or affiliates acquire public shares after our initial public offering, they will be entitled to redemption rights with respect to such public shares if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within the required time period. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our rights or warrants, which will expire worthless in the event we do not consummate our initial business combination by July 6, 2016. We will pay the costs of our liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover these costs and expenses, we may request the trustee to release to us an amount of up to $50,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses. However, the liquidator may determine that he or she requires additional time to evaluate creditors&#8217; claims (particularly if there is uncertainty over the validity or extent of the claims of any creditors). Also, a creditor or shareholder may file a petition with the BVI court which, if successful, may result in our liquidation being subject to the supervision of that court. Such events might delay distribution of some or all of our remaining assets. 

&#160; 

Additionally, in any liquidation proceedings of the company under British Virgin Islands law, the funds held in our trust account may be included in our estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any such claims deplete the trust account, we may not be able to return to our public shareholders the liquidation amounts payable to them. 

&#160; 

If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of our initial public offering, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders upon our dissolution would be $10.26. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors, which would have higher priority than the claims of our public shareholders. The actual per-share redemption amount received by shareholders may be less than $10.26, plus interest (net of any taxes payable). 

&#160; 

Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party&#8217;s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. In order to protect the amounts held in the trust account, Ms. Winnie Lai Ling Ng agreed that she will be liable to us, if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amounts in the trust account to below $10.26 per share, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, Ms. Ng will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims. However, Ms. Ng may not be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our other officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. We have not independently verified whether Ms. Ng. has sufficient funds to satisfy her indemnity obligations. We believe the likelihood of Ms. Ng having to indemnify the trust account is limited because we will endeavor to have all vendors and prospective target businesses as well as other entities execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. 

&#160; 

&#160; 16 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below $10.26 per share and Ms. Ng asserts that she is unable to satisfy any applicable obligations or that she has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against Ms. Ng to enforce her indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against Ms. Ng to enforce her indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, due to claims of creditors, the actual value of the per-share redemption price may be less than $10.26 per share. 

&#160; 

We will seek to reduce the possibility that Ms. Ng will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. To date, with the exception of EarlyBird Capital, UHY LLP and FTO Consulting, each of BVICo and DT Asia&#8217;s vendors has agreed that it will not have any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies in our trust account, and will not make any claim against our trust account (including any distributions therefrom). Ms. Ng will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. As of March 31, 2016, we had access to $53,115 not placed in the trust account, and the interest income earned on the balance of the trust account (net of taxes payable) with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately $50,000). In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, shareholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors. 

&#160; 

If we are deemed insolvent for the purposes of the Insolvency Act (i.e. (i) we fail to comply with the requirements of a statutory demand that has not been set aside under section 157 of the Insolvency Act; (ii) execution or other process issued on a judgment, decree or order of a British Virgin Islands Court in favor of a creditor of the company is returned wholly or partly unsatisfied; or (iii) either the value of the company&#8217;s liabilities exceeds its assets, or the company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due), then there are very limited circumstances where prior payments made to shareholders or other parties may be deemed to be a &#8220;voidable transaction&#8221; for the purposes of the Insolvency Act. A voidable transaction would include, for these purposes, payments made as &#8220;unfair preferences&#8221; or &#8220;transactions at an undervalue&#8221;. A liquidator appointed over an insolvent company who considers that a particular transaction or payment is a voidable transaction under the Insolvency Act could apply to the British Virgin Islands Courts for an order setting aside that payment or transaction in whole or in part. 

&#160; 

Additionally, if we enter insolvent liquidation under the Insolvency Act, the funds held in our trust account will likely be included in our estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any insolvency claims deplete the trust account you may not be able to return to our public shareholders the liquidation amounts due them. 

&#160; 

Our public shareholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only in the event of a redemption to public shareholders prior to any winding up in the event we do not consummate our initial business combination or our liquidation or if they redeem their shares in connection with an initial business combination that we consummate. In no other circumstances shall a shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek shareholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a shareholder&#8217;s voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a shareholder&#8217;s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such shareholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have significant experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, the requirement that we acquire a target business or businesses having a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the trust account at the time of the agreement to enter into the business combination, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights and the number of our outstanding rights and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating our initial business combination. 

&#160; 

&#160; 17 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

We currently have one executive officer. This individual is not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but he intends to devote as much of his time as he deems necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time he will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of our initial business combination. 

&#160; 

Periodic Reporting and Financial Information 

&#160; 

We have registered our units, ordinary shares, rights and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants. 

&#160; 

We will provide shareholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to shareholders to assist them in assessing the target business. In all likelihood, these financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with GAAP. A particular target business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate may not have financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with GAAP. To the extent that this requirement cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential acquisition candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material. 

&#160; 

We will be required to have our internal control procedures evaluated for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2016 required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.

We are an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not &#8220;emerging growth companies&#8221; including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We will remain an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; for up to five years after the date of the closing of our initial public offering, although if our non-convertible debt issued within a three year period or revenues exceeds $1 billion, or if the market value of our ordinary shares that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million on the last day of our second fiscal quarter, we would cease to be an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; as of the following fiscal year.
