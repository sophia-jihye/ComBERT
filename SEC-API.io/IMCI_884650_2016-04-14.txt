 Item 1. Business 

&#160; 

Business Overview 

&#160; 

Headquartered in Pittsford, New York, we provide IT solutions that are intended to deliver measurable results to small and medium sized businesses (SMBs), government agencies, and large commercial enterprises. We provide: 

&#9679; 

Cloud computing; 

&#9679; 

Managed services that include managing leading edge operations and implementing complex programs in advanced server management; 

&#9679; 

Remote desktop and remote server monitoring and remediation; 

&#9679; 

Help desk and call center services; 

&#9679; 

Third party data storage; 

&#9679; 

Cyber security services; 

&#9679; 

Third party software licenses for our SMB partners; and 

&#9679; 

Project management. 

&#160; 

We derived approximately 84% of our sales in 2015 and 80% in 2014 from federal, state and local government contracts as either a prime contractor or a subcontractor. 

&#160; 

During 2015, we derived approximately 60% of our sales from one client, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, including sales under subcontracts for services to several of its end clients including a large enterprise Fortune 100 company and a major establishment of the U.S. Government (the &#8220;U.S. Government Entity&#8221;) for which we manage one of the nation&#8217;s largest Microsoft Windows environments. We have been providing this service to the U.S. Government Entity under a long-standing subcontract, which has been renewed annually since 2004. Our team of server experts supports approximately 3,000 servers and 250,000 client stations from facilities in Maryland and Colorado. Operating 24 hours per day and seven days per week, we consistently meet or exceed the requirements of our service level agreements. We refer to this as our Advanced Server Management (ASM) team. 

&#160; 

We provide support to professional service organizations of software companies and commercial entities that need additional skilled resources when implementing solutions. We provide cloud computing solutions that include public and private cloud architectures along with hybrid scalable cloud hosting, server virtualization and desktop virtualization solutions. Our technical support personnel maintain leading edge certifications and qualifications in the respective software applications. During 2015, we provided professional services to these clients from whom we derived approximately 26% of our sales. Sales to our principal client, VMware, Inc., consisted of sales under subcontracts for services to their end clients of which approximately 70% are U.S. Government agencies and 30% are commercial entities. Our experience with cloud and virtualization computing related software has placed us in a position to take advantage of a growing trend towards Managed IT Services, particularly in the SMB space. We believe that the cloud and virtualization experience that we gained from working with large institutions and government agencies differentiates us from our competition, particularly within the SMB space. Accordingly, increasing our revenues from direct sales to SMBs is one of our priorities. 

&#160; 

We focus on aligning business processes with technology for delivery of solutions meeting our clients&#8217; needs and providing expert management services to the lifecycle of technology-based projects. For example, during 2014, we managed a bar code system implementation project for a manufacturing company that integrated production, inventory control and product delivery. This required developing a hardware solution, modifying software code to integrate information reporting and to interface delivery with customer systems. We also act as IT Director overseeing all aspects of IT on a daily basis including new systems development and implementation. 

&#160; &#160; 3 

&#160; 

During 2015, we continued to provide expert management services to customers in a number of sectors including manufacturing. We leveraged existing bar-code technology to improve plant productivity by eliminating repetitious, manual operations. Expansion of this technology throughout the year continued to reduce errors while improving production operations and inventory control. By partnering with several business units, we introduced methods that streamlined processes and delivered key, automated reports which improved forecasting while reducing manual effort, all resulting in increased efficiency. Strategic deployment of technology-based solutions within the customer enterprise has positioned our customer for continued growth with a positive impact to their bottom line. 

&#160; 

During 2014, we performed system characterizations and internal and external vulnerability network scans using third-party proprietary software known as &#220;berScan. In February 2015, we purchased all rights to the software from &#220;berScan, LLC and hired a Director of CyberSecurity who has expertise in designing, developing, marketing, and selling network security assessment services using the &#220;berScan software. We increased our cybersecurity sales using our proprietary &#220;berScan software by selling cybersecurity services directly to end customers. We provide technical and executive summary reports of ongoing risks, identify and prioritize security vulnerabilities and communicate remediation recommendations to end customers. During 2015, we invested in software development and upgraded and added to the feature sets in &#220;berScan software to improve its current and future marketability. We also created a new cybersecurity product, &#220;berGuard, that we began to market in late 2015. During 2016, we have continued to add features and created a new version. We are now marketing &#220;berGuard as a product that assesses vulnerabilities in a computer network using scanning technology to capture a comprehensive view of the security exposure of a network and infrastructure. The system initiates and runs custom internal and external vulnerability scans, generates reports, and manages remediation from one interface. It also centralizes, creates and updates a user&#8217;s cybersecurity policies. We market &#220;berGuard with an annual license fee. 

&#160; 

Our professionals are located at our headquarters in Pittsford, New York and in Colorado, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia. We are able to provide onsite service to most locations around the world including military bases. 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 69 full-time employees and information technology independent contractors. Approximately 15% of our employees hold U.S. Government security clearances. We possess certifications with our business and technology partners and our personnel maintain numerous certifications and qualifications. 

&#160; 

We had sales of approximately $7.9 million in 2015 and approximately $8.6 million in 2014. We generated an operating loss of approximately $455,000 in 2015 as compared to an operating loss of approximately $52,000 in 2014. 

&#160; 

We have experience in U.S. Government agencies, state government, Fortune 500 companies, and SMBs. We believe that the quality and consistency of our services and IT expertise has allowed us to maintain long-term relationships with our major clients. 

&#160; 

Information Technology (IT) Solutions and Services - Our Core Strengths 

&#160; 

We strategically built our business to deliver IT solutions and services that are intended to address challenges common to many U.S. Government agencies, state and local governments and commercial companies, including SMBs. 

The Company has established four pillars or business groups to focus on: 

&#9679; 

Cybersecurity bringing innovative solutions to market such as &#220;berGuard and performing cybersecurity projects; 

&#9679; 

The commercial SMB market by bringing IT solutions to the Company&#8217;s channel partners such as Webroot, which provides endpoint and mobile protection and cloud backup solutions, and &#220;berStore, a cloud-based backup and recovery solution; 

&#9679; 

Managed services by providing optimization and continuity planning, operational support services, internal automation, platform management as a service, virtualization services, and management of server, network and mobile devices; and 

&#9679; 

Product development including on demand software engineering and development of proprietary products to fit current customer needs.

&#160; 

Government Contract Vehicles 

&#160; 

A government contract vehicle is a mechanism for conducting business with government entities which helps to significantly reduce such entities&#8217; lead time for procuring products or services and lowers agency acquisition costs associated with managing complex bid procedures. &#160; Our strategy has been to bid for contract vehicles that facilitate Federal and State governments&#8217; procurement requirements which allow us to compete further on task orders issued under the contract vehicles. We believe that possessing contract vehicles will facilitate sales growth if we are successful at bidding and winning business within task orders generated under these vehicles. However, the amount of sales that we may generate is not determinable until a specific project award is made. 

&#160; 

Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Eagle II. In September 2013, DHS made awards to prime contractors under its seven-year $22 billion Enterprise Acquisition Gateway for Leading Edge Solutions II (EAGLE II) program . Contracts are Multiple Award, Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) to provide information technology solutions through performance of a wide range of support services. DHS issued the solicitation for EAGLE II in November 2010. &#160; We bid for work under EAGLE II with teaming members and are a specifically named small business partner with one of the prime contractor awardees. This provides us with new opportunities to generate sales to DHS. Although we have earned no revenues to date, EAGLE II task orders are expected to be issued in future periods. 

&#160; 

Federal Supply Schedule Contract. In 2003, we were awarded a Federal Supply Schedule Contract by the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) for IT consulting services (Schedule 70). Our Schedule 70 contract was extended through May 2019. Having a Schedule 70 allows us to compete for and secure prime contracts with all executive agencies of the U.S. Government, as well as other national and international organizations. Our Schedule 70 contract encompasses 95 different labor categories. We have used the Schedule 70 as a basis for pricing our current and proposed work. 

&#160; 

Certifications and Partner Agreements 

&#160; 

VMware Enterprise Solution Provider and Consulting Subcontractor. Since 2007, we have been approved as a VMware Authorized Consultant (VAC) by VMware, Inc. a subsidiary of EMC Corporation. VMware is recognized as the industry leader in virtualization technology. As a VAC, we are trained and certified to deliver consulting services and solutions leveraging VMware technology. 

&#160; 

We recognized an increasing demand for VMware related services in the public sector (U.S. Government and state marketplace) and joined VMware&#8217;s Consulting and Integration Partner (CIPP), a program, specifically targeted toward highly skilled and committed partners. We have grown to become one of VMware&#8217;s largest providers of outsourced consulting, having completed over 700 projects around the globe and in market sectors including U.S. Government, state governments, education, and commercial corporations. 

&#160; 

During 2015, we became a VMware Enterprise Level Solution Provider (ESP) where we still have the benefits of an architect, integration and service partner along with the ability to sell VMware licenses. We believe that this has positioned us to create our own opportunities to sell VMware licenses directly to end customers and still service the customer under our current relationship with the VMware Professional Services Organization. We are registered with the U.S. Federal and Education Specializations within VMware. 

&#160; 

These certifications are examples of our concerted effort to grow and expand our virtualization practice. Recently, VMware designated us as one of an elite group of partners that will be authorized to sell VMware licenses to State and Local government and Education (SLED) customers throughout New York State under their 2016 New York State Information Technology Service (ITS) Manufacturer Umbrella Contract. We are working with a number of current and potential clients. We believe that our virtualization experience and expertise with VMware will offer opportunities to increase sales, particularly in the cloud computing market. 

&#160; 5 

&#160; 

Microsoft Silver Certified Partner . We are part of Microsoft's Accredited Online Cloud Services program. We have successfully been certified in sales, pricing and technical delivery of Office 365 which combines the familiar Office desktop suite with cloud-based versions of the next-generation communications and collaboration services: Exchange Online, SharePoint Online and Lync Online. These services are already providing real world benefits to our existing clients while allowing us to offer clear guidelines for transitioning new users to hybrid-cloud-based solutions. We have also received certification for Windows Intune which provides complete remote desktop support capabilities enhancing our overall goal of providing complete solutions for virtualization and cloud based Software as a Service (SaaS). What once required expensive hardware and time consuming deployments can now be delivered seamlessly, including web conferencing, collaboration, document management, messaging, customer relationship management and productive office web applications all with lower total cost of ownership and quicker return on investment. We believe our Microsoft competencies assist our business development personnel when presenting solutions that, if accepted, will increase our sales. 

&#160; 

Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) Global Procurement Master Terms Agreement. We are a member of a select group of suppliers that enables HPE to purchase products and services from us under a global procurement master agreement and as specified in a statement of work. HPE has many tools and resources to help us generate new sales streams, and improve our mutual profitability, while at the same time adding unique value for our joint clients. The program comprises practical tools and services that we anticipate will help us in the key areas of marketing and selling our solutions, optimizing the technology, and collaborating with other organizations within our industry in order to generate more revenue. Our global procurement master agreement with HPE runs to January 2019. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

We compete with other IT professional services firms operating in the U.S. Government, state and local government and commercial marketplace. We obtain a portion of our business on the basis of proposals submitted in response to requests from potential and current clients, who typically also receive proposals from other firms. 

&#160; 

In the U.S. Government market, many of our proposed services are included with proposals of large prime contractors, where a specific area for our participation has been identified based on our expertise and experience. Certain large prime contractors in the U.S. Government market are required to allocate a portion of their contract to small businesses and we are able to fill that role. We also face indirect competition from certain government agencies that perform services for themselves similar to those we market. 

&#160; 

We have entered into subcontracts with systems integrators holding multi-year, multi-million dollar contracts with various agencies of the U.S. Government. In such cases, our competition is mainly with other IT services companies classified as small business entities by government standards. For prime contracts with the U.S. Government, we anticipate that our competition will range from small business set aside contractors to full and open competition with large firms such as Northrop Grumman Information Technologies, Science Applications International Corp., Computer Sciences Corp., Unisys, IBM, Booz Allen Hamilton, SRA International, Inc. and Serco Services Inc. We also have competition from cyber security providers who provide security vulnerability assessments and sell IT security software such as AlienVault, FireEye and Tenable. 

&#160; 

Because of the diverse requirements of U.S. Government clients and the highly competitive nature of large procurements, corporations frequently form teams to pursue contract opportunities. The same companies listed as competitors will often team with us or subcontract to us in the pursuit of new business. We believe that the major competitive factors in our market are distinctive technical competencies, successful past contract performance, price of services, reputation for quality, and key management with domain expertise. 

&#160; 

We face competition in the commercial markets from other IT service providers, large and small in all of the markets we target. 

&#160; 

Our competitors, in general, have substantially greater capital resources, research and development staffs, sales and marketing resources, facilities and experience than we do.

Employees 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015, we have 69 full-time employees and independent contractors, including 54 in information technology services, two in executive management, five in accounting, finance and administration, and eight in marketing and sales. We are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements and we believe that our relations with our employees are good. We believe that we are currently staffed at an appropriate level to administratively implement and carry out our business plan for the next 12 months. However, we expect to add positions in information technology services as we expand our sales. 

&#160; 

Our ability to develop and market our services, and to establish and maintain a competitive position in our businesses will depend, in large part, upon our ability to attract and retain qualified technical, marketing and managerial personnel, of which there can be no assurance. 

&#160;
