 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

General 

The Company is a publicly-owned financial holding company incorporated on June 14, 1996 under the laws of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, providing a full range of banking and financial services through its subsidiaries. The Company is subject to the provisions of the U.S. Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, (the &#8220;BHC Act&#8221;) and accordingly, subject to the supervision and regulation of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &#8220;Federal Reserve Board&#8221;). 

The Company provides comprehensive banking and financial services to its clients through a complete range of banking and financial solutions, including commercial, consumer, auto, and mortgage lending; checking and savings accounts; financial planning, insurance, financial services, and investment brokerage; and corporate and individual trust and retirement services. The Company operates through three major business segments: Banking, Wealth Management, and Treasury, differentiating the Oriental brand through customer segmentation and innovative solutions, primarily in Puerto Rico. The Company provides these services through various subsidiaries including, a commercial bank, Oriental Bank, a securities broker-dealer, Oriental Financial Services Corp. (&#8220;Oriental Financial Services&#8221;), an insurance agency, Oriental Insurance, LLC (&#8220;Oriental Insurance&#8221;), previously known as Oriental Insurance Inc., and a retirement plan administrator, Oriental Pension Consultants, Inc. (&#8220;OPC&#8221;), previously known as Caribbean Pension Consultants, Inc. All of our subsidiaries are based in San Juan, Puerto Rico, except for OPC which is based in Boca Raton, Florida. The Company has 48 branches in Puerto Rico. The Company&#8217;s long-term goal is to strengthen its banking and financial services franchise by expanding its lending businesses, increasing the level of integration in the marketing and delivery of banking and financial services, maintaining effective asset-liability management, growing non-interest revenue from banking and financial services, and improving operating efficiencies. 

The Company&#8217;s strategy involves: 

&#183; &#160; Strengthening its banking and financial services franchise by expanding its ability to attract deposits and build relationships with customers by refining the service delivery and providing innovative banking technologies for day-to-day customer transactions, and achieving sustainable levels of differentiation in the market; 

&#183; &#160; Focusing on greater growth in commercial, consumer and mortgage lending, trust and financial services and insurance products; 

&#183; &#160; Improving operating efficiencies, and continuing to maintain effective asset-liability management; 

&#183; &#160; Implementing a broad ranging effort to instill in employees and make customers aware of the Company&#8217;s determination to effectively serve and advise its customer base in a responsive and professional manner; and 

&#183; &#160; Matching its portfolio of investment securities with the related funding to achieve favorable spreads, and primarily investing in U.S. government-sponsored agency obligations. 

Together with a highly experienced group of senior and mid-level executives and the benefits from the acquisitions of Eurobank Puerto Rico and the Puerto Rico operations of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, S.A. (&#8220;BBVA&#8221;), this strategy has resulted in sustained growth in the Company&#8217;s deposit-taking activities, commercial, consumer and mortgage lending and financial service activities, allowing the Company to distinguish itself in a highly competitive industry. The Company is not immune from general and local financial and economic conditions. Past experience is not necessarily indicative of future performance, but given market uncertainties and on a reasonable time horizon of three to five years, this strategy is expected to maintain its steady progress towards the Company&#8217;s long-term goal. 

&#160; 

On December 18, 2012, the Company purchased from BBVA, all of the outstanding common stock of each of (i) BBVAPR Holding Corporation (&#8220;BBVAPR Holding&#8221;), the sole shareholder of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria Puerto Rico (&#8220;BBVAPR Bank&#8221;), a Puerto Rico chartered commercial bank, and BBVA Seguros, Inc. (&#8220;BBVA Seguros&#8221;), a subsidiary offering insurance services, and (ii) BBVA Securities of Puerto Rico, Inc. (&#8220;BBVA Securities&#8221;), a registered broker-dealer. This transaction is referred to as the &#8220;BBVAPR Acquisition&#8221; and BBVAPR Holding, BBVAPR Bank, BBVA Seguros and BBVA Securities are collectively referred to as the &#8220;BBVAPR Companies&#8221; or &#8220;BBVAPR.&#8221; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s principal funding sources are branch deposits, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, Federal Home Loan Bank (&#8220;FHLB&#8221;) advances, Federal Reserve Bank (&#8220;FRB&#8221;) advances, wholesale deposits, and subordinated capital notes. Through its branch network, Oriental Bank offers personal non-interest and interest-bearing checking accounts, savings accounts, certificates of deposit, individual retirement accounts (&#8220;IRAs&#8221;) and commercial non-interest bearing checking accounts. The FDIC insures Oriental Bank&#8217;s deposit accounts up to applicable limits. Management makes retail deposit pricing decisions periodically, adjusting the rates paid on retail deposits in response to general market conditions and local competition. Pricing decisions take into account the rates being offered by other local banks, the London Interbank Offered Rate (&#8220;LIBOR&#8221;), and mainland U.S. market interest rates. 

Segment Disclosure 

The Company has three reportable segments: Banking, Wealth Management, and Treasury. Management established the reportable segments based on the internal reporting used to evaluate performance and to assess where to allocate resources. Other factors such as the Company&#8217;s organizational structure, nature of products, distribution channels and economic characteristics of the products were also considered in the determination of the reportable segments. The Company measures the performance of these reportable segments based on pre-established annual goals involving different financial parameters such as net income, interest rate spread, loan production, and fees generated. 

For detailed information regarding the performance of the Company&#8217;s operating segments, please refer to Note 26 in the Company&#8217;s accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

Banking Activities 

Oriental Bank (the &#8220;Bank&#8221;), the Company&#8217;s main subsidiary, is a full-service Puerto Rico commercial bank with its main office located in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The Bank has 48 branches throughout Puerto Rico and was incorporated in October 1964 as a federal mutual savings and loan association. It became a federal mutual savings bank in July 1983 and converted to a federal stock savings bank in April 1987. Its conversion from a federally-chartered savings bank to a commercial bank chartered under the banking law of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, on June 30, 1994, allowed the Bank to more effectively pursue opportunities in its market and obtain more flexibility in its businesses. As a Puerto Rico-chartered commercial bank, it is subject to examination by the FDIC and the Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions of Puerto Rico (the &#8220;OCFI&#8221;). The Bank offers banking services such as commercial, consumer, and mortgage lending, savings and time deposit products, financial planning, and corporate and individual trust services, and capitalizes on its retail banking network to provide commercial and mortgage lending products to its clients. The Bank operates two international banking entities (&#8220;IBE&#8221;) pursuant to the International Banking Center Regulatory Act of Puerto Rico, as amended (the &#8220;IBE Act&#8221;), one is a unit operating within the Bank, named Oriental Overseas (the &#8220;IBE Unit&#8221;), and the other is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bank, named Oriental International Bank, Inc. (the &#8220;IBE Subsidiary&#8221;). The IBE Unit and IBE Subsidiary offer the Bank certain Puerto Rico tax advantages, and their services are limited under Puerto Rico law to persons and assets/liabilities located outside of Puerto Rico. 

Banking activities include the Bank&#8217;s branches and mortgage banking activities with traditional retail banking products such as deposits, commercial loans, consumer loans and mortgage loans. The Bank&#8217;s significant lending activities are with consumers located in Puerto Rico. The Bank&#8217;s lending transactions include a diversified number of industries and activities, all of which are encompassed within four main categories: commercial, consumer, mortgage and auto. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s mortgage banking activities are conducted through a division of the Bank. The mortgage banking activities include the origination of mortgage loans for the Bank&#8217;s own portfolio, and the sale of loans directly into the secondary market or the securitization of conforming loans into mortgage-backed securities. The Bank originates Federal Housing Administration (&#8220;FHA&#8221;) insured mortgages, Veterans Administration (&#8220;VA&#8221;) guaranteed mortgages, and Rural Housing Service (&#8220;RHS&#8221;) guaranteed loans that are primarily securitized for issuance of Government National Mortgage Association (&#8220;GNMA&#8221;) mortgage-backed securities which can be resold to individual or institutional investors in the secondary market. Conventional loans that meet the underwriting requirements for sale or exchange under standard Federal National Mortgage Association (the &#8220;FNMA&#8221;) or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (the &#8220;FHLMC&#8221;) programs are referred to as conforming mortgage loans and are also securitized for issuance of FNMA or FHLMC mortgage-backed securities. The Bank is an approved seller of FNMA, as well as FHLMC, mortgage loans for issuance of FNMA and FHLMC mortgage-backed securities. The Bank is also an approved issuer of GNMA mortgage-backed securities. The Company outsources the servicing of the GNMA, FNMA and FHLMC pools that it issues, and its residential mortgage loan portfolio. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Loan Underwriting 

Auto loans: The Company provides financing for the purchase of new or used motor vehicles. These loans are granted mainly through dealers authorized and approved by the auto credit department committee of the Company. The auto credit department has the specialized structure and resources to provide the service required for this product according to market demands and trends. The auto loan credit policy establishes specific guidance and parameters for the underwriting and origination processes. Underwriting procedures, lending limits, interest rate approval, insurance coverage, and automobile brand restrictions are some parameters and internal controls implemented to ensure the quality and profitability of the auto loan portfolio. The credit scoring system is a fundamental part of the decision process. 

&#160; 

Consumer loans: Consumer loans include personal loans, credit cards, lines of credit and other loans made by banks to individual borrowers. All loan originations must be underwritten in accordance with the Company&#8217;s underwriting criteria, and include an assessment of each borrower&#8217;s personal financial condition, including verification of income, assets, FICO score, and credit reports. 

&#160; 

Residential mortgage loans: All loan originations, regardless of whether originated through the Company&#8217;s retail banking network or purchased from third parties, must be underwritten in accordance with the Company&#8217;s underwriting criteria, including loan-to-value ratios, borrower income qualifications, debt ratios and credit history, investor requirements, and title insurance and property appraisal requirements. The Company&#8217;s mortgage underwriting standards comply with the relevant guidelines set forth by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (&#8220;HUD&#8221;), VA, FNMA, FHLMC, federal and Puerto Rico banking regulatory authorities, as applicable. The Company&#8217;s underwriting personnel, while operating within the Company&#8217;s loan offices, make underwriting decisions independent of the Company&#8217;s mortgage loan origination personnel. 

&#160; 

Commercial loans: Commercial loans include lines of credit and term facilities to finance business operations and to provide working capital for specific purposes, such as to finance the purchase of assets, equipment or inventory. Since a borrower&#8217;s cash flow from operations is generally the primary source of repayment, the Company&#8217;s analysis of the credit risk focuses heavily on the borrower&#8217;s debt-repayment capacity. Commercial term loans generally have terms from one to five years, may be collateralized by the asset being acquired, real estate, or other available assets, and bear interest rates that float with the prime rate, LIBOR or another established index, or are fixed for the term of the loan. Lines of credit are extended to businesses based on an analysis of the financial strength and integrity of the borrowers and are generally secured primarily by real estate, accounts receivables or inventory, and have a maturity of one year or less. Such lines of credit bear an interest rate that floats with a base rate, the prime rate, LIBOR, or another established index. 

Sale of Loans and Securitization Activities 

The Company may engage in the sale or securitization of a portion of the residential mortgage loans that it originates and purchases and utilizes various channels to sell its mortgage products. The Company is an approved issuer of GNMA-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities which involves the packaging of FHA loans, RHS loans or VA loans into pools of mortgage-backed securities for sale primarily to securities broker-dealers and other institutional investors. The Company can also act as issuer in the case of conforming conventional loans in order to group them into pools of FNMA or FHLMC-issued mortgage-backed securities which the Company then sells to securities broker-dealers. The issuance of mortgage-backed securities provides the Company with flexibility in selling the mortgage loans that it originates or purchases and also provides income by increasing the value and marketability of such loans. In the case of conforming conventional loans, the Company also has the option to sell such loans through the FNMA and FHLMC cash-window programs. 

Wealth Management Activities 

Wealth management activities are generated by such businesses as securities brokerage, trust services, retirement planning, insurance, pension administration, and other financial services. 

Oriental Financial Services is a Puerto Rico corporation and the Company&#8217;s subsidiary engaged in securities brokerage activities in accordance with the Company&#8217;s strategy of providing fully integrated financial solutions to the Company&#8217;s clients. Oriental Financial Services, member of FINRA and the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, is a registered securities broker-dealer pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The broker-dealer does not carry customer accounts and is, accordingly, exempt from the Customer Protection Rule (SEC Rule 15c3-3) pursuant to subsection (k)(2)(ii) of such rule. It clears securities transactions through Pershing LLC, a clearing agent that carries the accounts of its customers on a &#8220;fully disclosed&#8221; basis. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Oriental Financial Services offers securities brokerage services covering various investment alternatives such as tax-advantaged fixed income securities, mutual funds, stocks, and bonds to retail and institutional clients. It also offers separately-managed accounts and mutual fund asset allocation programs sponsored by unaffiliated professional asset managers. These services are designed to meet each client&#8217;s specific needs and preferences, including transaction-based pricing and asset-based fee pricing. 

Oriental Financial Services has managed and participated in public offerings and private placements of debt and equity securities in Puerto Rico and has engaged in municipal securities business with the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and its instrumentalities, municipalities, and public corporations. Investment banking revenue from such activities includes gains, losses, and fees, net of syndicate expenses, arising from securities offerings in which it acts as an underwriter or agent. Investment banking revenue also includes fees earned from providing merger-and-acquisition and financial restructuring advisory services. 

Oriental Insurance is a Puerto Rico limited liability company and the Company&#8217;s subsidiary engaged in insurance agency services. It was established by the Company to take advantage of the cross-marketing opportunities provided by financial modernization legislation. Oriental Insurance currently earns commissions by acting as a licensed insurance agent in connection with the issuance of insurance policies by unaffiliated insurance companies and continues to cross market its services to the Company&#8217;s existing customer base. 

OPC, a Florida corporation, is the Company&#8217;s subsidiary engaged in the administration of retirement plans in the U.S., Puerto Rico, and the Caribbean. 

Treasury Activities 

Treasury activities encompass all of the Company&#8217;s treasury-related functions. The Company&#8217;s investment portfolio consists of mortgage-backed securities, obligations of U.S. government-sponsored agencies, Puerto Rico government and agency obligations and money market instruments. Agency mortgage-backed securities, the largest component, consist principally of pools of residential mortgage loans that are made to consumers and then resold in the form of pass-through certificates in the secondary market, the payment of interest and principal of which is guaranteed by GNMA, FNMA or FHLMC. 

Market Area and Competition 

The main geographic business and service area of the Company is in Puerto Rico, where the banking market is highly competitive. Puerto Rico banks are subject to the same federal laws, regulations and supervision that apply to similar institutions in the United States of America. The Company also competes with brokerage firms with retail operations, credit unions, savings and loan cooperatives, small loan companies, insurance agencies, and mortgage banks in Puerto Rico. The Company encounters intense competition in attracting and retaining deposits and in its consumer and commercial lending activities. Management believes that the Company has been able to compete effectively for deposits and loans by offering a variety of transaction account products and loans with competitive terms, by emphasizing the quality of its service, by pricing its products at competitive interest rates, by offering convenient branch locations, and by offering financial planning and financial services at most of its branch locations. The phase-out consolidation of three failed Puerto Rico banks in 2010 and the failure of another Puerto Rico bank in 2015 has created an environment for more rational loan and deposit pricing. The Company&#8217;s ability to originate loans depends primarily on the services that it provides to its borrowers, in making prompt credit decisions, and on the rates and fees that it charges. 

&#160; Regulation and Supervision 

General 

The Company is a financial holding company subject to supervision and regulation by the Federal Reserve Board under the BHC Act, as amended by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#8220; Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;). The qualification requirements and the process for a bank holding company that elects to be treated as a financial holding company requires that a bank holding company and all of the subsidiary banks controlled by it at the time of election must be and remain at all times &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; and &#8220;well managed.&#8221; 

The Company elected to be treated as a financial holding company as permitted by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, if the Company fails to meet the requirements for being a financial holding company and is unable to correct such deficiencies within certain prescribed time periods, the Federal Reserve Board could require the Company to divest control of its depository institution subsidiary or alternatively cease conducting activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies that are not financial holding companies. 

&#160; 

7 &#160; 

&#160; 

Financial holding companies may engage, directly or indirectly, in any activity that is determined to be (i) financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity, or (ii) complementary to a financial activity provided it does not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act specifically provides that the following activities have been determined to be &#8220;financial in nature&#8221;: (a) lending, trust and other banking activities; (b) insurance activities; (c) financial, investment or economic advisory services; (d) securitization of assets; (e) securities underwriting and dealing; (f) existing bank holding company domestic activities; (g) existing bank holding company foreign activities; and (h) merchant banking activities. A financial holding company may generally commence any activity, or acquire any company, that is financial in nature without prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. As provided by the Dodd-Frank Act, a financial holding company may not acquire a company, without prior Federal Reserve Board approval, in a transaction in which the total consolidated assets to be acquired by the financial holding company exceed $10 billion. 

In addition, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act specifically gives the Federal Reserve Board the authority, by regulation or order, to expand the list of financial or incidental activities, but requires consultation with the U.S. Treasury Department and gives the Federal Reserve Board authority to allow a financial holding company to engage in any activity that is complementary to a financial activity and does not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system. 

The Company is required to file with the Federal Reserve Board and the SEC periodic reports and other information concerning its own business operations and those of its subsidiaries. In addition, Federal Reserve Board approval must also be obtained before a bank holding company acquires all or substantially all of the assets of another bank or merges or consolidates with another bank holding company. The Federal Reserve Board also has the authority to issue cease and desist orders against bank holding companies and their non-bank subsidiaries. 

The Bank is regulated by various agencies in the United States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Its main regulators are the OCFI and the FDIC. The Bank is subject to extensive regulation and examination by the OCFI and the FDIC, and is subject to the Federal Reserve Board&#8217;s regulation of transactions between the Bank and its affiliates. The federal and Puerto Rico laws and regulations which are applicable to the Bank regulate, among other things, the scope of its business, its investments, its reserves against deposits, the timing of the availability of deposited funds, and the nature and amount of and collateral for certain loans. In addition to the impact of such regulations, commercial banks are affected significantly by the actions of the Federal Reserve Board as it attempts to control the money supply and credit availability in order to control inflation in the economy. 

The Company&#8217;s mortgage banking business is subject to the rules and regulations of FHA, VA, RHS, FNMA, FHLMC, HUD and GNMA with respect to the origination, processing and selling of mortgage loans and the sale of mortgage-backed securities. Those rules and regulations, among other things, prohibit discrimination and establish underwriting guidelines which include provisions for inspections and appraisal reports, require credit reports on prospective borrowers and fix maximum loan amounts, and, with respect to VA loans, fix maximum interest rates. Mortgage origination activities are subject to, among others, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Truth-in-Lending Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder which, among other things, prohibit discrimination and require the disclosure of certain basic information to mortgagors concerning credit terms and settlement costs. The Company is also subject to regulation by the OCFI with respect to, among other things, licensing requirements and maximum origination fees on certain types of mortgage loan products. 

The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to the rules and regulations of certain other regulatory agencies. Oriental Financial Services, as a registered broker-dealer, is subject to the supervision, examination and regulation of FINRA, the SEC, and the OCFI in matters relating to the conduct of its securities business, including record keeping and reporting requirements, supervision and licensing of employees, and obligations to customers. 

Oriental Insurance is subject to the supervision, examination and regulation of the Office of the Commissioner of Insurance of Puerto Rico in matters relating to insurance sales, including but not limited to, licensing of employees, sales practices, charging of commissions and reporting requirements. 

Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 

The Dodd-Frank Act implements a variety of far-reaching changes and has been described as the most sweeping reform of the financial services industry since the 1930&#8217;s. It has a broad impact on the financial services industry, including significant regulatory and compliance changes, such as: (i) enhanced resolution authority of troubled and failing banks and their holding companies; (ii) enhanced lending limits strengthening the existing limits on a depository institution&#8217;s credit exposure to one borrower; (iii) increased capital and liquidity requirements; (iv) increased regulatory examination fees; (v) changes to assessments to be paid to the FDIC for federal deposit insurance; (vi) prohibiting bank holding companies, such as the Company, from including in regulatory Tier 1 capital future issuances of trust preferred securities or other hybrid debt and equity securities; and (vii) numerous other provisions designed to improve supervision and oversight of, and strengthening safety and soundness for, the financial services sector. 

8 &#160; 

&#160; 

Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act establishes a new framework for systemic risk oversight within the financial system to be distributed among new and existing federal regulatory agencies, including the Financial Stability Oversight Council, the Federal Reserve Board, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the FDIC. Further, the Dodd-Frank Act addresses many corporate governance and executive compensation matters that affect most U.S. publicly traded companies, including the Company. A few provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act became effective immediately, while various provisions have become effective in stages. Many of the requirements called for in the Dodd-Frank Act have been implemented over time and most are subject to implementing regulations. 

The Dodd-Frank Act also created a new consumer financial services regulator, the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (the &#8220;CFPB&#8221;), which assumed most of the consumer financial services regulatory responsibilities previously exercised by federal banking regulators and other agencies. The CFPB&#8217;s primary functions include the supervision of &#8220;covered persons&#8221; (broadly defined to include any person offering or providing a consumer financial product or service and any affiliated service provider) for compliance with federal consumer financial laws. It has primary authority to enforce the federal consumer financial laws, as well as exclusive authority to require reports and conduct examinations for compliance with such laws, in the case of any insured depository institution with total assets of more than $10 billion and any affiliate thereof. The CFPB also has broad powers to prescribe rules applicable to a covered person or service provider identifying as unlawful, unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or service, or the offering of a consumer financial product or service. 

Holding Company Structure 

The Bank is subject to restrictions under federal laws that limit the transfer of funds to its affiliates (including the Company), whether in the form of loans, other extensions of credit, investments or asset purchases, among others. Such transfers are limited to 10% of the transferring institution&#8217;s capital stock and surplus with respect to any affiliate (including the Company), and, with respect to all affiliates, to an aggregate of 20% of the transferring institution&#8217;s capital stock and surplus. Furthermore, such loans and extensions of credit are required to be secured in specified amounts, carried out on an arm&#8217;s length basis, and consistent with safe and sound banking practices. 

Under the Dodd-Frank Act, a bank holding company, such as the Company, must serve as a source of financial strength for any subsidiary depository institution. The term &#8220;source of financial strength&#8221; is defined as the ability of a company to provide financial assistance to its insured depository institution subsidiaries in the event of financial distress at such subsidiaries. This support may be required at times when, absent such requirement, the bank holding company might not otherwise provide such support. In the event of a bank holding company&#8217;s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and be entitled to a priority of payment. In addition, any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank. The Bank is currently the only depository institution subsidiary of the Company. 

Since the Company is a financial holding company, its right to participate in the assets of any subsidiary upon the latter&#8217;s liquidation or reorganization will be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary&#8217;s creditors (including depositors in the case of the Bank) except to the extent that the Company is a creditor with recognized claims against the subsidiary. 

Dividend Restrictions 

The principal source of funds for the Company is the dividends from the Bank. The ability of the Bank to pay dividends on its common stock is restricted by the Puerto Rico Banking Act of 1933, as amended (the &#8220;Banking Act&#8221;), the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended (the &#8220;FDIA&#8221;), and the FDIC regulations. In general terms, the Banking Act provides that when the expenditures of a bank are greater than its receipts, the excess of expenditures over receipts shall be charged against the undistributed profits of the bank and the balance, if any, shall be charged against the required reserve fund of the bank. If there is no sufficient reserve fund to cover such balance in whole or in part, the outstanding amount shall be charged against the bank&#8217;s capital account. The Banking Act provides that until said capital has been restored to its original amount and the reserve fund to 20% of the original capital, the bank may not declare any dividends. In general terms, the FDIA and the FDIC regulations restrict the payment of dividends when a bank is undercapitalized, when a bank has failed to pay insurance assessments, or when there are safety and soundness concerns regarding a bank. 

&#160; 

9 &#160; 

&#160; 

The payment of dividends by the Bank may also be affected by other regulatory requirements and policies, such as maintenance of adequate capital. If, in the opinion of the regulatory authority, a depository institution under its jurisdiction is engaged in, or is about to engage in, an unsafe or unsound practice (that, depending on the financial condition of the depository institution, could include the payment of dividends), such authority may require, after notice and hearing, that such depository institution cease and desist from such practice. The Federal Reserve Board has a policy statement that provides that an insured bank or bank holding company should not maintain its existing rate of cash dividends on common stock unless (i) the organization&#8217;s net income available to common shareholders over the past year has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends and (ii) the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the organization&#8217;s capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition. In addition, all insured depository institutions are subject to the capital-based limitations required by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (&#8220;FDICIA&#8221;). 

Federal Home Loan Bank System 

The FHLB system, of which the Bank is a member, consists of 12 regional FHLBs governed and regulated by the Federal Housing Finance Agency. The FHLB serves as a credit facility for member institutions within their assigned regions. They are funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB system. They make loans (i.e., advances) to members in accordance with policies and procedures established by the FHLB and the boards of directors of each regional FHLB. 

As a system member, the Bank is entitled to borrow from the FHLB of New York (the &#8220;FHLB-NY&#8221;) and is required to invest in FHLB membership and activity-based stock. The Bank must purchase membership stock equal to the greater of $1,000 or 0.15% of certain mortgage-related assets held by the Bank. The Bank is also required to purchase activity-based stock equal to 4.50% of outstanding advances to the Bank by the FHLB. The Bank is in compliance with the membership and activity-based stock ownership requirements described above. All loans, advances and other extensions of credit made by the FHLB to the Bank are secured by a portion of the Bank&#8217;s mortgage loan portfolio, certain other investments, and the capital stock of the FHLB held by the Bank. The Bank is required to maintain a minimum amount of qualifying collateral with a fair value of at least 110% of the outstanding advances. 

Prompt Corrective Action Regulations 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, federal banking agencies have adopted capital rules that became effective January 1, 2014 for advanced approaches banking organizations (i.e., those with consolidated assets greater than $250 billion or consolidated on-balance sheet foreign exposures of at least $10 billion) and January 1, 2015 for all other covered organizations (subject to certain phase-in periods through January 1, 2019) and that will replace their general risk-based capital rules, advanced approaches rule, market risk rule, and leverage rules. 

&#160; 

The new capital rules provide certain changes to the prompt corrective action regulations adopted by the agencies under Section 38 of the FDIA, as amended by FDICIA. These regulations are designed to place restrictions on U.S. insured depository institutions if their capital levels begin to show signs of weakness. The five capital categories established by the agencies under their prompt corrective action framework are: &#8220;well capitalized,&#8221; &#8220;adequately capitalized,&#8221; &#8220;undercapitalized,&#8221; &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; and &#8220;critically undercapitalized&#8221;. 

&#160; 

The new capital rules expand such categories by introducing a common equity tier 1 capital requirement for all depository institutions, revising the minimum risk-based capital ratios and, beginning in 2018, the proposed supplementary leverage requirement for advanced approaches banking organizations. The common equity tier 1 capital ratio is a new minimum requirement designed to ensure that banking organizations hold sufficient high-quality regulatory capital that is available to absorb losses on a going-concern basis. Under the new rules, an insured depository institution is: 

&#160; 

(i) &#8220;well capitalized,&#8221; if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or more, a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8% or more, a common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5% or more, and a tier 1 leverage capital ratio of 5% or more, and is not subject to any written capital order or directive; 

&#160; 

(ii) &#8220;adequately capitalized,&#8221; if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% or more, a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% or more, a common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5% or more, and a tier 1 leverage capital ratio of 4% or more; 

&#160; 

(iii) &#8220;undercapitalized,&#8221; if it has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 8%, a tier 1 risk-based ratio that is less than 6%, a common equity tier 1 capital ratio that is less than 4.5%, or a tier 1 leverage capital ratio that is less than 4%; 

&#160; 

10 &#160; 

&#160; 

(iv) &#8220;significantly undercapitalized,&#8221; if it has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 6%, a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio that is less than 4%, a common equity tier 1 capital ratio that is less than 3%, or a tier 1 leverage capital ratio that is less than 3%; and 

&#160; 

(v) &#8220;critically undercapitalized,&#8221; if it has a ratio of tangible equity (defined as tier 1 capital plus non-tier 1 perpetual preferred stock) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2%. 

&#160; 

The new capital rules also include a policy statement by the agencies that all banking organizations should maintain capital commensurate with their risk profiles , which may entail holding capital significantly above the minimum requirements. They also provide a reservation of authority permitting examiners to require that such organizations hold additional regulatory capital . 

FDICIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fees to its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized. Undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to restrictions on borrowing from the Federal Reserve System. In addition, undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit capital restoration plans. A depository institution&#8217;s holding company must guarantee the capital plan, up to an amount equal to the lesser of 5% of the depository institution&#8217;s assets at the time it becomes undercapitalized or the amount of the capital deficiency when the institution fails to comply with the plan. The federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution&#8217;s capital. Significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets, and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. Critically undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator. 

FDIC Insurance Assessments 

The Bank is subject to FDIC deposit insurance assessments. The Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 (the &#8220;Reform Act&#8221;) merged the Bank Insurance Fund (&#8220;BIF&#8221;) and the Savings Association Insurance Fund (&#8220;SAIF&#8221;) into a single Deposit Insurance Fund, and increased the maximum amount of the insurance coverage for certain retirement accounts, and possible &#8220;inflation adjustments&#8221; in the maximum amount of coverage available with respect to other insured accounts. In addition, it granted a one-time initial assessment credit (of approximately $4.7 billion) to recognize institutions&#8217; past contributions to the fund. As a result of the merger of the BIF and the SAIF, all insured institutions are subject to the same assessment rate schedule. 

The Dodd-Frank Act contains several important deposit insurance reforms, including the following: (i) the maximum deposit insurance amount was permanently increased to $250,000; (ii) the deposit insurance assessment is now based on the insured depository institution&#8217;s average consolidated assets minus its average tangible equity, rather than on its deposit base; (iii) the minimum reserve ratio for the Deposit Insurance Fund was raised from 1.15% to 1.35% of estimated insured deposits by September 30, 2020; (iv) the FDIC is required to &#8220;offset the effect&#8221; of increased assessments on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion; (v) the FDIC is no longer required to pay dividends if the Deposit Insurance Fund&#8217;s reserve ratio is greater than the minimum ratio; and (vi) the FDIC temporarily insured the full amount of qualifying &#8220;noninterest-bearing transaction accounts&#8221; until December 31, 2012. As defined in the Dodd-Frank Act, a &#8220;noninterest-bearing transaction account&#8221; is a deposit or account maintained at a depository institution with respect to which interest is neither accrued nor paid, on which the depositor or account holder is permitted to make withdrawals by negotiable or transferrable instrument, payment orders of withdrawals, telephone or other electronic media transfers, or other similar items for the purpose of making payments or transfers to third parties or others, and on which the insured depository institution does not reserve the right to require advance notice of an intended withdrawal. 

&#160; 

The FDIC amended its regulations under the FDIA, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, to modify the definition of a depository institution&#8217;s insurance assessment base; to revise the deposit insurance assessment rate schedules in light of the new assessment base and altered adjustments; to implement the dividend provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act; and to revise the large insured depository institution assessment system to better differentiate for risk and better take into account losses from large institution failures that the FDIC may incur. Since the new assessment base under the Dodd-Frank Act is larger than the current assessment base, the new assessment rates adopted by the FDIC are lower than the former rates. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

11 &#160; 

&#160; 

Brokered Deposits 

FDIC regulations adopted under the FDIA govern the receipt of brokered deposits by banks. Well capitalized institutions are not subject to limitations on brokered deposits, while adequately capitalized institutions are able to accept, renew or rollover brokered deposits only with a waiver from the FDIC and subject to certain restrictions on the interest paid on such deposits. Undercapitalized institutions are not permitted to accept brokered deposits. As of December 31, 2015, the Bank is a well capitalized institution and is therefore not subject to these limitations on brokered deposits. 

Regulatory Capital Requirements 

Under the Dodd-Frank Act, federal banking regulators are required to establish minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements, on a consolidated basis, for insured institutions, depository institution holding companies, and non-bank financial companies supervised by the Federal Reserve Board. The minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements are to be determined based on the minimum ratios established for insured depository institutions under prompt corrective action regulations. In effect, such provision of the Dodd-Frank Act, which is commonly known as the Collins Amendment, applies to bank holding companies the same leverage and risk-based capital requirements that apply to insured depository institutions. Because the capital requirements must be the same for insured depository institutions and their holding companies, the Collins Amendment generally excludes certain debt or equity instruments, such as cumulative perpetual preferred stock and trust preferred securities, from Tier 1 Capital, subject to a three-year phase-out from Tier 1 qualification for such instruments issued before May 19, 2010, with the phase-out commencing on January 1, 2014 for advanced approaches banking organizations and January 1, 2015 for other bank holding companies with consolidated assets of $15 billion or more as of December 31, 2009. However, such instruments issued before May 19, 2010 by a bank holding company, such as the Company, with a total consolidated assets of less than $15 billion as of December 31, 2009, are not affected by the Collins Amendments, are &#8220;grandfathered&#8221; under the new capital rules, and may continue to be included in tier 1 Capital as a restricted core capital element. 

The new capital rules adopted by the federal banking agencies revise the agencies&#8217; risk-based and leverage capital requirements for banking organizations, and consolidate three separate notices of proposed rulemaking that the OCC, Federal Reserve Board and FDIC published in the Federal Register on August 30, 2012, with selected changes. In particular, and consistent with the framework of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in &#8220;Basel III: A Global Regulatory Framework for More Resilient Banks and Banking Systems,&#8221; the new capital rules include a minimum ratio of common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 4.5% and a common equity tier 1 capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets that apply to all banking organizations. The rules also raise the minimum ratio of tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets from 4% to 6% and include a minimum leverage ratio of 4% for all banking organizations. In addition, for the largest, most internationally active banking organizations, the rules include a new minimum supplementary leverage ratio that takes into account off-balance sheet exposures. The rules incorporate these new requirements into the agencies&#8217; prompt corrective action framework. In addition, the rules establish limits on a banking organization&#8217;s capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the banking organization does not hold a specified amount of common equity tier 1 capital in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. Further, the rules amend the methodologies for determining risk-weighted assets for all banking organizations; introduce disclosure requirements that would apply to top-tier banking organizations domiciled in the United States with $50 billion or more in total assets; and adopt changes to the agencies&#8217; regulatory capital requirements that meet the requirements of Section 171 and Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act. These rules also codify the agencies&#8217; current capital rules, which have previously resided in various appendices to their respective regulations, into a harmonized integrated regulatory framework. 

Failure to meet the capital guidelines could subject an institution to a variety of enforcement actions including the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC and to certain restrictions on its business. At December 31, 2015, the Company was in compliance with all applicable capital requirements. For more information, please refer to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

Safety and Soundness Standards 

Section 39 of the FDIA, as amended by FDICIA, requires each federal banking agency to prescribe for all insured depository institutions standards relating to internal control, information systems, and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, fees and benefits, and such other operational and managerial standards as the agency deems appropriate. In addition, each federal banking agency also is required to adopt for all insured depository institutions standards relating to asset quality, earnings and stock valuation that the agency determines to be appropriate. Finally, each federal banking agency is required to prescribe standards for the employment contracts and other compensation arrangements of executive officers, employees, directors and principal stockholders of insured depository institutions that would prohibit compensation, benefits and other arrangements that are excessive or that could lead to a material financial loss for the institution. If an institution fails to meet any of the standards described above, it will be required to submit to the appropriate federal banking agency a 

12 &#160; 

&#160; 

plan specifying the steps that will be taken to cure the deficiency. If the institution fails to submit an acceptable plan or fails to implement the plan, the appropriate federal banking agency will require the institution to correct the deficiency and, until it is corrected, may impose other restrictions on the institution, including any of the restrictions applicable under the prompt corrective action provisions of FDICIA. 

The FDIC and the other federal banking agencies have adopted Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness that, among other things, set forth standards relating to internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit, underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth and employee compensation. 

Activities and Investments of Insured State-Chartered Banks 

Section 24 of the FDIA, as amended by FDICIA, generally limits the activities and equity investments of FDIC-insured, state-chartered banks to those that are permissible for national banks. Under FDIC regulations of equity investments, an insured state bank generally may not directly or indirectly acquire or retain any equity investment of a type, or in an amount, that is not permissible for a national bank. An insured state bank, such as the Bank, is not prohibited from, among other things, (i) acquiring or retaining a majority interest in a subsidiary engaged in permissible activities, (ii) investing as a limited partner in a partnership, or as a non-controlling interest holder of a limited liability company, the sole purpose of which is direct or indirect investment in the acquisition, rehabilitation or new construction of a qualified housing project, provided that such investments may not exceed 2% of the bank&#8217;s total assets, (iii) acquiring up to 10% of the voting stock of a company that solely provides or reinsures directors&#8217;, trustees&#8217; and officers&#8217; liability insurance coverage or bankers&#8217; blanket bond group insurance coverage for insured depository institutions, and (iv) acquiring or retaining the voting stock of an insured depository institution if certain requirements are met, including that it is owned exclusively by other banks. Under the FDIC regulations governing the activities and investments of insured state banks which further implemented Section 24 of the FDIA, as amended by FDICIA, an insured state-chartered bank may not, directly, or indirectly through a subsidiary, engage as &#8220;principal&#8221; in any activity that is not permissible for a national bank unless the FDIC has determined that such activities would pose no risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund and the bank is in compliance with applicable regulatory capital requirements. 

Transactions with Affiliates and Related Parties 

Transactions between the Bank and any of its affiliates are governed by sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. These sections are important statutory provisions designed to protect a depository institution from transferring to its affiliates the subsidy arising from the institution&#8217;s access to the Federal safety net. An affiliate of a bank is any company or entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the bank, including investment funds for which the bank or any of its affiliates is an investment advisor. Generally, sections 23A and 23B (i) limit the extent to which a bank or its subsidiaries may engage in &#8220;covered transactions&#8221; with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10% of the bank&#8217;s capital stock and surplus, and limit such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20% of such capital stock and surplus, and (ii) require that all such transactions be on terms that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices. The term &#8220;covered transactions&#8221; includes the making of loans, purchase of or investment in securities issued by the affiliate, purchase of assets, acceptance of securities issued by the affiliate as collateral for a loan or extension of credit, issuance of guarantees and other similar types of transactions. The Dodd-Frank Act expanded the scope of transactions treated as &#8220;covered transactions&#8221; to include credit exposure to an affiliate on derivatives transactions, credit exposure resulting from a securities borrowing or lending transaction, or derivative transaction, and acceptances of affiliate-issued debt obligations as collateral for a loan or extension of credit. Most loans by a bank to any of its affiliates must be secured by collateral in amounts ranging from 100% to 130% of the loan amount, depending on the nature of the collateral. In addition, any covered transaction by a bank with an affiliate and any sale of assets or provision of services to an affiliate must be on terms that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies. Regulation W of the Federal Reserve Board comprehensively implements sections 23A and 23B. The regulation unified and updated staff interpretations issued over the years prior to its adoption, incorporated several interpretative proposals (such as to clarify when transactions with an unrelated third party will be attributed to an affiliate), and addressed issues arising as a result of the expanded scope of non-banking activities engaged in by banks and bank holding companies and authorized for financial holding companies under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. 

Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act place restrictions on loans by a bank to executive officers, directors, and principal shareholders. Regulation O of the Federal Reserve Board implements these provisions. Under Section 22(h) and Regulation O, loans to a director, an executive officer and to greater-than-10% shareholders of a bank and certain of their related interests (&#8220;insiders&#8221;), and insiders of its affiliates, may not exceed, together with all other outstanding loans to such person and its related interests, the bank&#8217;s single borrower limit (generally equal to 15% of the institution&#8217;s unimpaired capital and surplus). Section 22(h) and Regulation O also require that loans to insiders and to insiders of affiliates be made on terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to other persons, unless the loans are made pursuant to a benefit or compensation program that (i) is widely available to employees of 

13 &#160; 

&#160; 

the bank and (ii) does not give preference to insiders over other employees of the bank. Section 22(h) and Regulation O also require prior board of directors&#8217; approval for certain loans, and the aggregate amount of extensions of credit by a bank to all insiders cannot exceed the institution&#8217;s unimpaired capital and surplus. Furthermore, Section 22(g) and Regulation O place additional restrictions on loans to executive officers. 

Community Reinvestment Act 

Under the Community Reinvestment Act (&#8220;CRA&#8221;), a financial institution has a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with its safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution&#8217;s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community, consistent with the CRA. The CRA requires federal examiners, in connection with the examination of a financial institution, to assess the institution&#8217;s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by such institution. The CRA also requires all institutions to make public disclosure of their CRA ratings. The Company has a Compliance Department that oversees the planning of products and services offered to the community, especially those aimed to serve low and moderate income communities. 

USA Patriot Act 

Under Title III of the USA Patriot Act, also known as the International Money Laundering Abatement and Anti-Terrorism Financing Act of 2001, all financial institutions, including the Company, Oriental Financial Services, and the Bank, are required in general to identify their customers, adopt formal and comprehensive anti-money laundering programs, scrutinize or prohibit altogether certain transactions of special concern, and be prepared to respond to inquiries from U.S. law enforcement agencies concerning their customers and their transactions. 

&#160; 

The U.S. Treasury Department (the &#8220;US Treasury&#8221;) has issued a number of regulations implementing the USA Patriot Act that apply certain of its requirements to financial institutions. The regulations impose obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing. 

Failure of a financial institution to comply with the USA Patriot Act&#8217;s requirements could have serious legal consequences for the institution. The Company and its subsidiaries, including the Bank, have adopted policies, procedures and controls to address compliance with the USA Patriot Act under existing regulations, and will continue to revise and update their policies, procedures and controls to reflect changes required by the USA Patriot Act and the US Treasury&#8217;s regulations. 

Privacy Policies 

Under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, all financial institutions are required to adopt privacy policies, restrict the sharing of nonpublic customer data with nonaffiliated parties at the customer&#8217;s request, and establish procedures and practices to protect customer data from unauthorized access. The Company and its subsidiaries have established policies and procedures to assure the Company&#8217;s compliance with all privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. 

Sarbanes-Oxley Act 

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (&#8220;SOX&#8221;) implemented a range of corporate governance and accounting measures to increase corporate responsibility, to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies, and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of disclosures under federal securities laws. In addition, SOX established membership requirements and responsibilities for the audit committee, imposed restrictions on the relationship between the Company and external auditors, imposed additional responsibilities for the external financial statements on the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer, expanded the disclosure requirements for corporate insiders, required management to evaluate its disclosure controls and procedures and its internal control over financial reporting, and required the auditors to issue a report on the internal control over financial reporting. 

The Company has included in this annual report on Form 10-K management&#8217;s assessment regarding the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. The internal control report includes a statement of management&#8217;s responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company; management&#8217;s assessment as to the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on management&#8217;s evaluation as of year-end; and the framework used by management as criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. As of December 31, 2015, the Company&#8217;s management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective.

&#160; 

Puerto Rico Banking Act 

As a Puerto Rico-chartered commercial bank, the Bank is subject to regulation and supervision by the OCFI under the Banking Act, which contains provisions governing the incorporation and organization of the Bank, rights and responsibilities of directors, officers and stockholders, as well as the corporate powers, savings, lending, capital and investment requirements and other aspects of the Bank and its affairs. In addition, the OCFI is given extensive rulemaking power and administrative discretion under the Banking Act. The OCFI generally examines the Bank at least once every year. 

The Banking Act requires that a minimum of 10% of the Bank&#8217;s net income for the year be transferred to a reserve fund until such fund (legal surplus) equals the total paid-in capital on common and preferred stock. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, legal surplus amounted to $70.4 million. The amount transferred to the legal surplus account is not available for the payment of dividends to shareholders. 

The Banking Act also provides that when the expenditures of a bank are greater than the receipts, the excess of the former over the latter must be charged against the undistributed profits of the bank, and the balance, if any, must be charged against the reserve fund. If there is no reserve fund sufficient to cover such balance in whole or in part, the outstanding amount must be charged against the capital account and no dividend may be declared until said capital has been restored to its original amount and the reserve fund to 20% of the original capital. 

The Banking Act further requires every bank to maintain a legal reserve which cannot be less than 20% of its demand liabilities, except government deposits (federal, commonwealth and municipal), which are secured by actual collateral. 

&#160; 

The Banking Act also requires change of control filings. When any person or entity will own, directly or indirectly, upon consummation of a transfer, 5% or more of the outstanding voting capital stock of a bank, the acquiring parties must inform the OCFI of the details not less than 60 days prior to the date said transfer is to be consummated. The transfer will require the approval of the OCFI if it results in a change of control of the bank. Under the Banking Act, a change of control is presumed if an acquirer who did not own more than 5% of the voting capital stock before the transfer exceeds such percentage after the transfer. 

The Banking Act permits Puerto Rico commercial banks to make loans to any one person, firm, partnership or corporation, up to an aggregate amount of 15% of the sum of: (i) the bank&#8217;s paid-in capital; (ii) the bank&#8217;s reserve fund; (iii) 50% of the bank&#8217;s retained earnings, subject to certain limitations; and (iv) any other components that the OCFI may determine from time to time. If such loans are secured by collateral worth at least 25% more than the amount of the loan, the aggregate maximum amount will include 33.33% of 50% of the bank&#8217;s retained earnings. Such restrictions under the Banking Act on the amount of loans to a single borrower do not apply to loans: (i) to the government of the United States or the government of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or any of their respective agencies, instrumentalities or municipalities, or (ii) that are wholly secured by bonds, securities and other evidence of indebtedness of the government of the United States or of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or by bonds, not in default, of municipalities or instrumentalities of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. 

The Puerto Rico Finance Board is composed of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions of Puerto Rico; the Presidents of the Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico, the Economic Development Bank for Puerto Rico and the Planning Board; the Puerto Rico Secretaries of Commerce and Economic Development, Treasury and Consumer Affairs; the Commissioner of Insurance; and the President of the Public Corporation for Insurance and Supervision of Puerto Rico Credit Unions. It has the authority to regulate the maximum interest rates and finance charges that may be charged on loans to individuals and unincorporated businesses in the Commonwealth. The current regulations of the Puerto Rico Finance Board provide that the applicable interest rate on loans to individuals and unincorporated businesses is to be determined by free competition. The Puerto Rico Finance Board also has the authority to regulate maximum finance charges on retail installment sales contracts and for credit card purchases. There is presently no maximum rate for retail installment sales contracts and for credit card purchases. 

&#160; 

Puerto Rico Internal Revenue Code 

&#160; 

On July 2014, the Governor signed into law Act No. 77-2014, known as &#8220;Ley de Ajustes al Sistema Contributivo&#8221; (Act of Adjustments to the Tax System). The main purpose of this legislation is to increase government collections in order to alleviate the structural budget deficit. Its most relevant provisions, as applicable to the Company, and effective for transactions held after June 30, 2014, are as follows: (1) the capital tax rate was increased from 15% to 20% and (2) for an asset to be considered long term capital asset, the holding period must be over a year, which before was defined with a holding period of over six months. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

15 &#160; 

&#160; 

On May 29, 2015 the Governor signed Act No. 72 of 2015. The most relevant provisions of the Act No. 72, as applicable to the Company, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2014, are as follows: (1) establishes a new definition of &#8220;large taxpayers,&#8221; which require them to file their tax return following a special procedure established by the Secretary of the Treasury, (2) net operating losses carried forward may be deducted up to 70% of the alternative minimum net income for purposes of computing the alternative minimum tax, and (3) net operating losses carried forward may be deducted up to 80% of the net income for purposes of computing the regular corporate income tax. 

&#160; 

Other Code amendments applicable during 2015 are the increase of the Sales and Use Tax (SUT) from 7% to 11.5% beginning July 1st, 2015 and a special SUT to business to business transactions of 4%, beginning October 1st, 2015. These were implemented as a transitional phase to the enacted Value Added Tax (VAT) of 10.5%, which will be in place on April 1st, 2016, along with a Municipal SUT of 1% on certain taxable items. 

&#160; 

International Banking Center Regulatory Act of Puerto Rico 

&#160; 

The business and operations of the Bank&#8217;s IBE Unit and IBE Subsidiary are subject to supervision and regulation by the OCFI. Under the IBE Act, no sale, encumbrance, assignment, merger, exchange or transfer of shares, interest or participation in the capital of an IBE may be initiated without the prior approval of the OCFI if by such transaction a person would acquire, directly or indirectly, control of 10% or more of any class of stock, interest or participation in the capital of the IBE. The IBE Act and the regulations issued thereunder by the OCFI (the &#8220;IBE Regulations&#8221;) limit the business activities that may be carried out by an IBE. Such activities are limited in part to persons and assets/liabilities located outside of Puerto Rico. The IBE Act provides further that every IBE must have not less than $300 thousand of unencumbered assets or acceptable financial guarantees. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the IBE Act and the IBE Regulations, the Bank&#8217;s IBE Unit and IBE Subsidiary have to maintain books and records of all their transactions in the ordinary course of business. They are also required to submit quarterly and annual reports of their financial condition and results of operations to the OCFI, including annual audited financial statements. 

&#160; 

The IBE Act empowers the OCFI to revoke or suspend, after notice and hearing, a license issued thereunder if, among other things, the IBE fails to comply with the IBE Act, the IBE Regulations or the terms of its license, or if the OCFI finds that the business or affairs of the IBE are conducted in a manner that is not consistent with the public interest. 

&#160; 

In 2012, the IBE Act was superseded by a new law that, among other things, prohibits new license applications to organize and operate an IBE. Any such newly organized entity (now called an &#8220;international financial entity&#8221;) must be licensed under the new law, and such entity (as opposed to existing IBEs organized under the IBE Act, including the Bank&#8217;s IBE Unit and IBE Subsidiary, which are &#8220;grandfathered&#8221;) will generally be subject to a 4% Puerto Rico income tax rate. 

&#160; 

Volcker Rule 

&#160; 

The so-called &#8220;Volcker Rule&#8221; adopted by the federal banking regulatory agencies under Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act generally prohibits insured depository institutions and their affiliates from (i) engaging in short-term proprietary trading of securities, derivatives, commodities futures and options on these instruments for their own account; and (ii) owning, sponsoring or having certain relationships with hedge funds or private equity funds. However, it exempts certain activities, including market making, underwriting, hedging, trading in government and municipal obligations, and organizing and offering a hedge fund or private equity fund, among others. A banking entity that engages in any such covered activity (i.e., proprietary trading or investment activities in hedge funds or private equity funds) is generally required to establish an internal compliance program reasonably designed to ensure and monitor compliance with the Volcker Rule. 

&#160; Employees 

At December 31, 2015, the Company had 1,466 employees. None of its employees is represented by a collective bargaining group. The Company considers its employee relations to be good. 

&#160; Internet Access to Reports 

The Company&#8217;s annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any and all amendments to such reports, filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, are available free of charge on or through the &#8220;Investor Relations&#8221; link of the Company&#8217;s internet website at www.orientalbank.com , as soon as reasonably practicable after the Company electronically files such material with, or furnishes it to, the SEC.
