General 

We are an internally managed real estate investment trust, also known as a REIT, that is primarily focused on the ownership, operation and development of multi-family properties. These activities are primarily conducted through joint ventures in which we typically have an 80% equity interest in the entity owning the property. At September 30, 2016, we own 33 multi-family properties (four of which are wholly-owned) located in ten states with an aggregate of 9,420 units and a net book value of approximately $783.1 million. At November 30, 2016, we own 32 multi-family properties (four of which are wholly owned) located in 11 states with an aggregate of 9,066 units, including a development project at which the construction of a 339 unit multi-family property is contemplated. Most of our properties are located in the Southeast United States and Texas. We commenced our multi-family activities in March 2012. 

For more than the past five years, we also engaged in two other principal business activities: (i) real estate lending; and (ii) the ownership, operation and development of commercial, mixed use and other real estate assets. 

Our real estate lending activities involved originating and holding for investment short-term senior mortgage loans secured by commercial and multi-family real estate property in the United States. These lending activities decreased during the past five years ( i.e ., $0, $0, $5.0 million, $5.5 million and $70.3 million of loan originations in 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively). As of November 1, 2014, we are no longer engaged in real estate lending. 

We also own and operate other real estate assets. During the past several years, these other real estate assets primarily consisted of our interest in a consolidated joint venture, which we refer to as the Newark Joint Venture, which owned several properties (including development sites) in Newark, New Jersey. At September 30, 2015, the net book value of the Newark Joint Venture's real estate assets was $141.4 million. On February 23, 2016, we sold all of our interest in the Newark Joint Venture for $16.9 million, and in the quarter ended March 31, 2016, recognized a $15.5 million gain on this sale. As a result of this sale, the $19.5 million mortgage loan owed to us by the Newark Joint Venture (the "NJV Loan Receivable"), which prior to such sale had been eliminated in consolidation, is reflected on our consolidated balance sheet as a real estate loan. See Notes 1 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements. At September 30, 2016, the net book value of our other real estate assets, including the NJV Loan Receivable, is $30.0 million. See " - Our Other Real Estate Assets and Activities." 

Information regarding our multi-family property and other real estate assets segments is included in Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements and is incorporated herein by this reference. The financial information, including our consolidated financial statements, included herein has been reclassified to present our real estate lending activities and the assets, liabilities and results of operations of the Newark Joint Venture as discontinued operations. See Notes 1 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements. 

We were organized as a business trust under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in June 1972. Our address is 60 Cutter Mill Road, Suite 303, Great Neck, New York 11021, telephone number 516-466-3100. Our website can be accessed at www.brtrealty.com , where copies of our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, can be obtained free of charge. These SEC filings are added to our website as soon as reasonably practicable. 

Unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, all references to (i) "us", "we" or terms of like import refer to BRT Realty Trust and its consolidated subsidiaries and the term "BRT" refers to BRT Realty Trust and its wholly owned subsidiaries, (ii) a year ( e.g ., 2016) refers to the applicable fiscal year ended September 30th, (iii) the sale of properties includes the sale of our partnership interest in a venture that owned Village Green, a Little Rock, AK multi-family property, and (iv) "same store properties" refer to properties that we owned and operated for the entirety of both periods being compared, except for properties that are in the construction or lease-up phase, or properties that are undergoing development or significant redevelopment. We move properties previously excluded from our same store portfolio for these reasons into the same store designation once they have stabilized or the development or redevelopment is complete and such status has been reflected fully in all quarters during the applicable periods of comparison. For newly constructed or lease-up properties or properties undergoing development or significant redevelopment, we consider a property stabilized upon attainment of 90% physical occupancy. 

Our Multi-Family Property Activities 

Generally, our multifamily properties are garden apartment, mid-rise or town home style properties that provide residents with amenities, such as a clubhouse, swimming pool, laundry facilities and cable television access. Residential leases are typically for a one year term and may require security deposits equal to one month's rent. Substantially all of the units at these properties are leased at market rates.

(1) This is a ground-up development project at which the construction of a 339 unit multi-family complex is expected to be completed in various stages from March 2018 to March 2019. 

Our Acquisition Process and Underwriting Criteria 

We identify multi-family property acquisition opportunities primarily through relationships developed over time by our officers with our former borrowers, current joint venture partners, real estate investors and brokers. We are interested in acquiring the following types of multi-family properties: 

&#8226; 

Class B or better properties with strong and stable cash flows in markets where we believe there exists opportunity for rental growth and with potential for further value creation; 

&#8226; 

Class B or better properties that offer significant potential for capital appreciation through repositioning or rehabilitating the asset to drive rental growth; 

&#8226; 

properties available at opportunistic prices providing an opportunity for a significant appreciation in value; and 

&#8226; 

development of Class A properties in markets where we believe we can generate significant returns from the operation and if appropriate, sale of the development. 

Our current goal is to acquire properties with cap rates ranging from 5% to 6.25% and that will provide stable risk adjusted total returns ( i.e. , operating income plus capital appreciation). In identifying opportunities that will achieve such goal, we seek acquisitions that will achieve an approximate 7% to 9% annual return on invested cash and an internal rate of return of approximately 9% to 18%. We have also focused, but have not limited ourselves, to acquiring properties located in the Southeast United States and Texas. Subject to the foregoing, we are opportunistic in pursuing multi-family property acquisitions and do not mandate any specific acquisition criteria, though we take the following into account in evaluating an acquisition opportunity: location, size of the target market, property quality, availability and terms and conditions of long term fixed rate mortgage debt, potential for capital appreciation or recurring income, extent and nature of contemplated capital improvements and property age. We generally acquire properties with a joint venture partner with knowledge and experience in owning and operating multi-family properties in the target market as this enhances our understanding of such market and assists us in managing our risk with respect to a particular acquisition. 

Approvals of the acquisition of a multi-family property are based on a review of property information as well as other due diligence activities undertaken by us and, as applicable, our venture partner. Those activities include a consideration of economic, demographic and other factors with respect to the target market and sub-market (including the stability of its population and the potential for population growth, the economic and employment base, presence of and barriers to entry of alternative housing stock, market prices for comparable properties, the competitive positioning of the proposed acquisition and the regulatory environment ( i.e . applicable rent regulation)), a review of an independent third party property condition report, a Phase I environmental report with respect to the property, a review of recent and projected results of operations for the property prepared by the seller, us or our joint venture partner, an assessment of our joint venture partner's knowledge and expertise with respect to the acquisition and operation of multi-family properties and the relevant market and sub-market, a site visit to the property and the surrounding area, an inspection of a sample of units at the property, the potential for rent increases and the possibility of enhancing the property and the costs thereof. To the extent a property to be acquired requires renovations or improvements, or if we and our joint venture partner believe that improving a property will generate greater rent, funds are generally set aside by us and our joint venture partner at the time of acquisition to provide the capital needed for such renovation and improvements. At September 30, 2016, an aggregate of $7.4 million has been set aside to fund improvements at specific multi-family properties. 

A key consideration in our acquisition process is the evaluation of the availability of mortgage debt to finance the acquisition (or the ability to assume the mortgage debt on the property) and the terms and conditions ( e.g . interest rate, amortization and maturity) of such debt. Typically, approximately 25% to 35% of the purchase price is paid in cash and the balance is financed with mortgage debt. We believe that the use of leverage of up to 75% allows us the ability to earn a greater return on our investment than we would otherwise earn. Generally, the mortgage debt obtained in connection with an acquisition matures five to ten years thereafter, is interest only for one to three years after the acquisition, and provides for a fixed interest rate and for the amortization of the principal of such debt over 30 years. 

Before a property is acquired, the acquisition must be reviewed and approved by our investment committee. Approval requires the assent of not less than four of the seven members of this committee, all of whom are our executive officers. The approval of our board of trustees is required for any single multi-family property acquisition in which our equity investment exceeds $15 million. 

We are partners in two multi-family development opportunities with the same joint venture partner or its affiliates. We pursue these opportunities when we believe the potential higher returns justify the additional risks. The factors considered in pursuing these opportunities generally include the factors considered in evaluating a standard acquisition opportunity, and we place additional emphasis on our joint venture partner's ability to execute a development project. Though we may from time-to-time pursue other development activities, we do not anticipate development properties will constitute a significant part of our portfolio. 

Property Sales &#32; 

We monitor our portfolio to identify appropriate disposition candidates. Factors considered in deciding whether to dispose of a property generally include our evaluation of the current market price of such property to projected economics for such property and adverse changes in the factors considered by us in acquiring such property. We also believe it is important for us to maintain strong relationships with our joint venture partners. Accordingly, we also take into account our partners' desires with 

respect to property sales. If our partners deem it in their own economic interest to dispose of a property at an earlier date than we would otherwise dispose of a property, we may accommodate such request.

Joint Venture Arrangements 

The arrangements with our multi-family property joint venture partners are deal specific and vary from transaction to transaction. Generally, these arrangements provide for us and our partner to receive net cash flow available for distribution in the following order of priority (and in certain cases, we are entitled to these distributions on a senior or preferential basis): 

&#8226; 

a preferred return of 10% on each party's unreturned capital contributions, until such preferred return has been paid in full, 

&#8226; 

the return in full of each party's capital contribution, and 

&#8226; 

the remaining net cash flow is distributed based upon satisfaction of performance hurdles which vary by transaction. 

Though, as noted above, each joint venture operating agreement contains different terms, such agreements generally provide for a buy-sell procedure under specified circumstances, including (i) after the passage of time ( e.g ., two years after the acquisition), (ii) if the partners are unable to agree on major decisions, (iii) upon a change in control of our subsidiary owning the interest in the joint venture, or (iv) one or more of the foregoing. Further, these arrangements may also allow us, and in some cases, our joint venture partner, to force the sale of the property after it has been owned by the joint venture for a specified period ( e.g ., four to five years after the acquisition). 

Property Management 

The day-to-day management of our multi-family properties is overseen by property management companies operating in the market in which the property is located. Some of these management companies are owned by our joint venture partners or their affiliates. Generally, we can terminate these management companies upon specified notice or for cause, subject to the 

approval of the mortgage lender and, in some cases, our joint venture partner. We believe satisfactory replacements for property managers are available, if required.

As of September 30, 2016, the weighted average annual interest rate of the mortgage debt on our 33 multi-family properties is 3.98% and the weighted average remaining term to maturity of such debt is approximately seven years. The mortgage debt associated with our multi-family properties is generally non-recourse to (i) the joint venture that owns the property, subject to standard carve-outs and (ii) to us and our subsidiary acquiring the equity interest in such joint venture. We, at the parent entity level ( i.e ., BRT Realty Trust), are the standard carve-out guarantor with respect to the Avalon, Silvana Oaks,Woodland Trails, Stonecrossing, Pathway and Avondale properties. (The term "standard carve-outs" refers to recourse items to an otherwise non-recourse mortgage and are customary to mortgage financing. While carve-outs vary from lender to lender and transaction to transaction, the carve-outs may include, among other things, a voluntary bankruptcy filing, environmental liabilities, the sale, financing or encumbrance of the property in violation of loan documents, damage to property as a result of intentional misconduct or gross negligence, failure to pay valid taxes and other claims which could create a lien on a property and the conversion of security deposits, insurance proceeds or condemnation awards.) At September 30, 2016, the principal amount of mortgage debt outstanding with respect to the properties at which we are the carve-out guarantor is approximately $83.3 million. 

Insurance 

The multi-family properties are covered by all risk property insurance covering 100% of the replacement cost for each building and business interruption and rental loss insurance (covering up to twelve months of loss). On a case-by-case basis, based on an assessment of the likelihood of the risk, availability of insurance, cost of insurance and in accordance with standard market practice, we obtain earthquake, windstorm, flood, terrorism and boiler and machinery insurance. We carry comprehensive liability insurance and umbrella policies for each of our properties which provide no less than $5 million of coverage per incident. We request certain extension of coverage, valuation clauses, and deductibles in accordance with standard market practice and availability. 

Although we may carry insurance for potential losses associated with our multi-family properties, we may still incur losses due to uninsured risks, deductibles, co-payments or losses in excess of applicable insurance coverage and those losses may be material. In addition, certain insurance coverage is part of blanket policies in which a loss on an unrelated property could affect the coverage limits on a joint venture property.

Competition 

We compete to acquire real estate assets and in particular, multi-family properties, with other owners and operators of such properties including other multi-family REITs, pension and investment funds, real estate developers and private real estate investors. Competition to acquire such properties is based on price and ability to secure financing on a timely basis and complete an acquisition. To the extent that a potential joint venture partner introduces us to a multi-family acquisition opportunity, we compete with other sources of equity capital to participate in such joint venture based on the financial returns we are willing to offer such potential partner and the other terms and conditions of the joint venture arrangement. We also compete for tenants at our multi-family properties&#8212;such competition depends upon various factors, including alternative housing options available in the applicable sub-market, rent, amenities provided and proximity to employment and quality of life venues. 

Many of our competitors possess greater financial and other resources than we possess. 

Environmental Regulation 

We are subject to regulation at the federal, state and municipal levels and are exposed to potential liability should our properties or actions result in damage to the environment or to other persons or properties. These conditions include the presence or growth of mold, potential leakage of underground storage tanks, breakage or leaks from sewer lines and risks pertaining to waste handling. The potential costs of compliance, property damage restoration and other costs for which we could be liable or which could occur without regard to our fault or knowledge, are unknown and could potentially be material. 

In the course of acquiring and owning multi family properties, we or our joint venture partner engage an independent environmental consulting firm to perform a level 1 environmental assessment (and if appropriate, a level 2 assessment) to identify and mitigate these risks as part of the due diligence process. We believe these assessment reports provide a reasonable basis for discovery of potential hazardous conditions prior to acquisition. Should any potential environmental risks or conditions be discovered during our due diligence process, the potential costs of remediation will be assessed carefully and factored into the cost of acquisition, assuming the identified risks and factors are deemed to be manageable and within reason. Some risks or conditions may be identified that are significant enough to cause us to abandon the possibility of acquiring a given property. As of the date of this report, we have no knowledge of any material claims made or pending against us with regard to environmental damage for which we may be found liable, nor are we aware of any potential hazards to the environment related to any of our properties which could reasonably be expected to result in a material loss. 

Our Structure 

We share facilities, personnel and other resources with several affiliated entities including, among others, Gould Investors L.P., a master limited partnership involved primarily in the ownership and operation of a diversified portfolio of real estate assets, and One Liberty Properties, Inc., an NYSE listed equity REIT. Eight individuals (including Jeffrey A. Gould, Chief Executive Officer and President, Mitchell Gould, Executive Vice President and George Zweier, Chief Financial Officer), devote substantially all of their business time to our activities, while our other personnel (including several officers) share their services on a part-time basis with us and other affiliated entities that share our executive offices. (Including our full and part-time personnel , we estimate that we have the equivalent of 12 full time employees. The allocation of expenses for the shared facilities, personnel and other resources is computed in accordance with a Shared Services Agreement by and among us and the affiliated entities. The allocation is based on the estimated time devoted by executive, administrative and clerical personnel to the affairs of each entity that is a party to this agreement. 

In addition, through December 31, 2015, we were party to an Advisory Agreement, as amended, between us and REIT Management Corp., our former advisor. REIT Management is wholly owned by Fredric H. Gould, a member of our Board of Trustees and the former chairman of such board, and he and certain of our executive officers, including our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, received compensation from REIT Management. Pursuant to this agreement, REIT Management furnished advisory and administrative services with respect to our business, including, without limitation, developing and maintaining banking and financing relationships, participating in the analysis and approvals of multi-family property acquisitions and dispositions and providing investment advice. We paid fees pursuant to this agreement of $694,000, $2.4 million and $2.0 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Approximately $214,000 of the 2014 fees, respectively, is included in discontinued operations. 

Effective as of December 31, 2015, the Advisory Agreement terminated. In lieu thereof, we retained related parties to provide the services previously provided pursuant to such agreement (the "Services").
