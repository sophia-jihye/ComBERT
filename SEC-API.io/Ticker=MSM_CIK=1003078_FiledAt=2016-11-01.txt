 ITEM 1. B USINESS. 

General 

MSC Industrial Direct Co., Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, &#8220;MSC,&#8221; the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; or &#8220;us&#8221;) is a leading North American distributor of metalworking and maintenance, repair and operations (&#8220;MRO&#8221;) products and services. 

With a 75-year history of driving innovation in industrial product distribution, we help solve our manufa cturing customers&#8217; metalworking, MRO and operatio nal challenges. Our team of more than 6,000 associates brings deep expertise and insight to not only keep our customers&#8217; manufacturing operations up and running, but also improve their efficiency, productivity and profitability through our technical metalworking expertise and inventory management and other supply chain solutions. 

We serve a broad range of customers throu ghout the United States , Canada and the United Kingdom , from individual machine shops, to Fortune 100 manufacturing companies, to government agencies such as the General Services Administration and the Department of Defense. We operate a sophisticated network of 12 customer fulfil lment centers (eight in the United States , three in Ca nada and one in the U nited Kingdom ) and 85 branch offices (84 in the United States and one in the U.K.) Our primary customer fulfillment centers are located in or near Harrisburg, PA; Atlanta, GA; Elkhart, IN; Reno, NV; and Columbus, OH. In addition, we operate seven smaller customer fulfillment centers in or near Hanover Park, IL; Dallas, TX; Shelbyville, KY (repackaging and replenishment center); Wednesbury, U.K.; Edmonton, Alberta; Beamsvil le, Canada; and Moncton, Canada. 

We o ffer more than 1 million stock &#8209;keeping units (SKUs) thr ough our website, mscdirect.com, as well as through our 4,500-plus page master catalog, known throughout the MRO industry as &#8220;The Big Book&#8221; and a variety of specialty and promotional catalogs, brochures and flyers. We carry many of the products we sell in our inventory, so orders for these in-stock products are processed and fulfilled the day the order is received. &#160; We offer next-day delivery nationwide for qualifying orders placed by 8 p.m. Eastern Time (excluding our Class C Solutions Group ( &#8220;CCSG&#8221; ) business ). &#160; 

Exclusive of U.K. operations, more than 360,000 active customers purchased at least one item during the past 12 months from MSC. Our customers can choose among many convenient ways to place orders: mscdirect.com, eProcurement platforms, call centers or direct communication with our outside sales associates. 

We endeavor to save our customers money when they partner with us for their MRO and metalworking product needs. We do this in multiple ways: 

&#65279; 

&#183; 

our experienced team of more than 6,000 associates includes customer care team members, metalworking specialist s and technical support teams, and sales associates focused on driving our customers&#8217; success by reducing their operational costs; 

&#65279; 

&#160;

&#183; 

our robust systems and transactional data enable us to provide insights to our customers to help them take cost out of their supply chains and operations; 

&#65279; 

&#183; 

our extensive product inventory enables customers to deal with fewer suppliers, streamlining their purchasing work and reducing their administrative costs; 

&#65279; 

&#183; 

timely shipping enables our customers to reduce their inventory investment and carrying costs; 

&#65279; 

&#183; 

we simplify the purchasing process by consolidating multiple purcha ses into a single order, providing a single invoice for multiple purchases over time , and offer ing direct shipments to specific departments and people at one or more facilities. This reduces our customers&#8217; administrative costs; 

&#65279; 

&#183; 

we provide extensive eCommerce capabilities: sophisticated search and transaction capabilities, access to real-time inventory, customer-specific pricing, workflow management tools, customized reporting and other features. We can also interface directly with many purchasing portals, such as ARIBA and Perfect Commerce, in addition to ERP Procurement Solutions, such as Oracle and SAP; and 

&#65279; 

&#183; 

with MSC&#8217;s inventory management solutions, our customers can carry less inventory and still dramatically r educe situations when a critical item is out of stock. 

&#65279; 

Industry Overview 

&#65279; 

MSC operates in a large, fragmented industry. National, regional and local distributors, retail outlets, small distributorships, online distributors, direct mail suppliers, large warehouse stores and manufacturers&#8217; own sales forces all serve MRO customers. 

&#65279; 

Nearly every industrial and service business has an ongoing need for MRO supplies. These businesses, with the exception of the largest industrial plants, often do not have the resources to manage and monitor their MRO inventories effectively. They spend more than necessary to purchase and track their supplies, providing an opportunity for MSC to serve as their one-stop MRO product supplier. 

&#65279; 

Even the larger facilities often store their supplies in multiple locations, so they often carry excess inventories and duplicate purchase orders. In many organizations, multiple people often acquire the same item in small quantities via expensive, one-off purchases, resulting in higher purchasing costs and administrative efforts to keep track of supplies. 

&#65279; 

With limited capital availability, and limited eCommerce capabilities and operating leverage, smaller suppliers to the industrial market are under increasing pressure to consolidate and/or curtail services and product lines to remain competitive. Their challenge represents MSC&#8217;s opportunity. Market surveys validate that we continue to capture increased market share by providing lower total purchasing costs, broader product selection and a higher level of service to our customers. 

&#65279; 

We improve purchasing efficiency and reduce costs for our customers because they can consolidate suppliers, purchase orders and invoices, reduce inventory tracking, stocking decisions, purchases and out-of-stock situations, and adopt sophisticated inventory management solutions, including Vendor Managed Inventory (&#8220;VMI&#8221;), Customer Managed Inventory (&#8220;CMI&#8221;) and vending solutions. 

&#65279; 

Business Strategy 

&#65279; 

MSC&#8217;s business strategy is based on helping our customers become more productive and profitable by reducing their total cost for obtaining, using and maintaining MRO supplies. Our strategy includes the following key elements: 

&#65279; 

Inventory Management Solutions. Our approach starts with a thorough customer assessment. Our expert associates develop and recommend solutions that provide exceptional value to the customer. Depending on the customer&#8217;s size and needs, we customize options to address complexity and processes, as well as specific product, technical issues and cost targets. The options might include eProcurement, CMI, VMI, vending, tool crib control, or part-time or full-time on-site resources. Our world-class sourcing, logistics and business systems provide predictable, reliable and scalable service. 

&#65279; 

Broad Selection of Products. Customers want a full range of product options, even as they look to reduce the number of suppliers they partner with. We provide &#8220;good-better-best&#8221; alternatives, comprising a spectrum of brand name, 

&#160;

MSC exclusive brand and generic MRO products. MSC&#8217;s broad selection of products enables customers to choose the right combination of price and quality on every purchase to meet their needs. &#160; 

&#65279; 

Same-Day Shipping and Next-Day Delivery. We guarantee same-day shipping of our core metalworking and MRO products, enabling customers to reduce supply inventories. We fulfill our same-day shipment guarantee about 99% of the time. We know that our customers value this service, because areas accessible by next-day delivery tend to generate significantly greater sales for MSC than areas where next-day delivery is not available. 

&#65279; 

Superior Customer Service. Our commitment to customer service starts with our over 6,000 associates who share their deep expertise and knowledge of metalworking and MRO products to help our customers achieve greater success. We invest in sophisticated information systems and provide extensive training for our associates so they can better support our customers. Using our proprietary customer support software, our in-bound sales representatives can inform customers on a real-time basis of product availability; recommend substitute products; verify credit information; receive special, custom or manufacturer direct orders; cross &#8209;check inventory items using previously entered customer product codes; and arrange or provide technical assistance. We offer customized billing; customer savings reports; electronic data interchange ordering; eCommerce capabilities; bulk discounts; and stocking of specialty items requested by customers. 

&#65279; 

Technical Support. &#160; We provide technical support and one-on-one service through our field and customer care center representatives. We have a dedicated team of nearly 100 metalworking specialists, who work with customers to improve their manufacturing processes and efficiency, as well as a technical support team that provides assistance to our sales teams and customers via phone and email. Our customers recognize the value of a distributor that can provide technical support to improve their operations and productivity. 

&#65279; 

Commitment to Technological Innovation. We embrace technological innovations to support our growth, improve customer service and reduce our operating costs. The innovations make our buying practices more effective, improve our automated inventory replenishment and streamline order fulfillment. MSC&#8217;s proprietary software helps our customers and sales representatives determine the availability of products in stock in real time and evaluate alternative products and pricing. Our website, mscdirect.com (&#8220;MSC website&#8221;) contains a searchable online catalog with electr onic ordering capabilities. The MSC website also offer s an array of services, workflow management tools and related information. Our information systems help improve turnover and customer service while cutting costs. 

&#65279; 

We also continually upgrade our distribution methods and systems and provide comprehensive electronic ordering capabilities (&#8220;EDI&#8221; and &#8220;XML&#8221;) to support our customers&#8217; purchase order processing. We continue to invest in our VMI, CMI and vending solutions that streamline custo mer replenishment and trim our customers&#8217; inventories . Our vending solutions include different kinds of machines, such as storage lockers or carousels, which can stand alone or be combined with other machines. MSC vending machines use network or web-based software to enable customers to gain inventory visibility, save time and drive profitability. 

&#65279; 

Advanced Technologies and www.mscdirect.com. The MSC website is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, providing personalized real-time inventory availability, superior search capabilities, online bill payment, delivery tracking status and other enhancements, including work-flow management tools. The user-friendly search engine allows customers to find SKUs by keyword, part description, competitive part number, vendor number or brand. The MSC website is a key component of our strategy to reduce customers&#8217; transaction costs and delivery time. &#160; 

&#65279; 

Competitive Pricing. Customers increasingly evaluate their total cost of ownership of industrial supplies and recognize that price is an important aspect of their procurement costs. We make sure our pricing is competitive while reflecting the value that we bring through our comprehensive service. 

&#65279; 

Growth Strategy 

&#65279; 

We continue to show share gains as indicated by growth rates from the markets we serve. Our growth strategy includes a number of strategies to continue to gain market share. 

&#65279; 

Expanding and enhancing our metalworking capabilities to aggressively penetrate customers in heavy and light manufacturing. MSC is a leading distributor of metalworking products in the United States. We have continued to expand our metalworking sales team, increase technical support and enhance supplier relationships. We are developing high-performance metalworking products marketed under MSC exclusive brands, providing high-value product alternatives for our customers. Our metalworking field specialists and centralized technical support team members have diverse backgrounds in machining, programming, management and engineering. They help our customers select the right tool for the job from our deep supplier base. 

&#160;

&#65279; 

Expanding programs for government and national account customers . Although MSC has been providing MRO and metalworking supplies to the commercial sector for 75 years, we have more recently focused on potential government customers and have a large, growing contract business with numerous federal, state, and local/education agencies. We also are attracting government contractor customers and the U.S. Postal Service. We have developed customized government and national account programs. Even with our recent success, we see plenty of opportunity for additional growth. 

&#65279; 

We provide customized national account programs for larger customers, often as enterprise-wide engagements. These national account customers value our ability to support their procurement needs electronically to reduce their transactional costs. Our dedicated national account managers and operations experts provide supply chain solutions that reduce these customers&#8217; total cost s of ownership through increase d visibility into their MRO purchases and improved management. We demonstrate these savings through detailed reporting at both the enterprise and site level. 

&#65279; 

Increasing the size and improving the productivity of our direct sales force. We have invested resources to give our sales representatives more time with our customers and provide increased support during the MRO purchasing process. Our &#160; field sales &#160; and service associate headcount was 2,37 0 and our in-bound sales representative headcount was 1,079 at September 3, 2016. We believe that our sales force investment has played a critical role in boosting our market share. 

&#65279; 

Increasing sales from existing customers and generating new customers with various value &#8209;added programs. Our value &#8209;added programs include business needs analysis, inventory management solutions and workflow management tools. Our customers particularly value our industrial vending solutions that can accommodate a range of products from precision cutting tools to MRO supplies. 

&#65279; 

Increasing the number of product lines and productive SKUs. We are increasing the breadth and depth of our product offerings and pruning non-value-added SKUs. In fiscal year 2016, we added approximately 150,000 SKUs, net of SKU removals, to our searchable database on www.mscdirect.com . This increase brought MSC&#8217;s total, active, saleable SKU count to approximately 1,500,000 SKUs. We plan to continue adding online SKUs in fiscal 2017. 

&#65279; 

The most recent MSC catalog issued in October 2016 merchandises approximately 500,000 core metalworking and MRO products, which are included in the SKU totals above. Approximately 18% of these SKUs are MSC exclusive brands. We have also begun to leverage the depth and breadth of MSC&#8217;s product portfolio within our CCSG sales channel and have extended full access of MSC catalog SKUs to the CCSG sales team. 

&#65279; 

Improving our marketing programs. MSC has built an extensive buyer database, which we use to prospect for new customers. We deliver our master catalogs to the best prospects. We supplement our master catalogs with direct mail, digital and search engine marketing, and email. Our industry-specific expertise allows us to focus our outreach on the most promising growth areas. 

&#65279; 

Enhancing eCommerce capabilities. MSC&#8217;s website is a proprietary, business-to-business, horizontal marketplace serving the metalworking and MRO market. All qualified orders placed online at mscdirect.com are backed by our same-day shipping guarantee, unless otherwise stated. The MSC website utilizes the same highly trained sales force and support services as MSC&#8217;s traditional business, so our customers enjoy added convenience without sacrificing customized service. MSC&#8217;s website is a key component of our strategy to reduce customers&#8217; transaction costs and internal requisition time. Most orders move directly from the customer&#8217;s desktop to our customer fulfillment center floor, removing human error, reducing handling costs and speeding up the transaction flow. MSC continues to evaluate the MSC website and solicit customer feedback, making on -going improvements to ensure that the MSC website remains a premier website in our marketplace. In June 2016, Internet Retailer magazine recognized MSC as the &#8220;B2B eCommerce Player of the Year,&#8221; citing MSC&#8217;s online purchasing experience for customers as a factor for the award. Internet Retailer also ranked MSC as the 30 th largest e-retailer based on annual revenue generated from online sales, growth over the previous five years, and key metrics such as customer conversion rates and average order value by category. Our marketing campaigns continue to raise awareness and drive volume to the MSC website. &#8203; In addition, many large customer accounts transact business with MSC using eProcurement solution providers that sell a suite of eCommerce products. We have associations with many of these providers and continue to evaluate and expand our eProcurement capabilities. 

&#65279; 

Improving our excellent customer support service. MSC consistently receives high customer satisfaction ratings, according to customer surveys. We don&#8217;t just strive to meet our customers&#8217; service needs, we work to anticipate them. This focus on our customers&#8217; needs makes us stand apart in the market. We use customer comment cards, surveys and other customer outreach tools, using their feedback to drive the next generation of improvements to the customer experience. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Selectively pursuing strategic acquisitions. We actively pursue strategic acquisitions that expand or complement our business in new and existing markets or further enhance the value and offerings we provide. We completed our acquisition of Barnes Distribution North America, which we now c all CCSG, in fiscal year 2013. We believe the highly fragmented nature of the MRO supply industry will continue to provide acquisition opportunities. We expect that any future acquisitions will be financed with internally generated funds and/or additional debt. 

&#65279; 

Products 

&#65279; 

Our broad range of MRO products includes cutting tools, measuring instruments, tooling components, metalworking products, fasteners, flat stock, raw materials, abrasives, machinery hand and power tools, safety and janitorial supplies, plumbing supplies, materials handling products, power transmission components, and electrical supplies. Our large and growing number of SKUs makes us an increasingly valuable partner to our customers as they look to trim their supplier base. Our assortment from multiple product suppliers, prices and quality levels enables our customers to select from &#8220;good-better-best&#8221; options on nearly all their purchases. We stand apart from our competitors by offering name brand, exclusive brand, and generic products; depth in our core product lines; and competitive pricing. 

&#65279; 

We purcha se substantially all of our products directly from approximately 3,000 suppliers. No single supplier accounted for more than 6% of ou r total purchases in fiscal 2016, fiscal 2015, or fiscal 2014. 

&#65279; 

Customer Fulfillment Centers 

&#65279; 

A significant number of our products are carried in stock. Approximately 79% of s ales are fulfilled from our 12 custo mer fulfillment centers and 85 branch offices. Some specialty or custom items and very large orders are shipped directly f rom the manufacturer. We manage our primary customer fulfillment centers via computer &#8209;based SKU tracking systems and radio frequency devices that locate specific stock items to make the selection process more efficient. 

&#65279; 

Sales and Marketing 

&#65279; 

We serve individual machine shops, Fortune 100 companies, government agencies and manufacturers of all sizes. We focus on relatively higher-margin, lower-volume products. With the addition of our CCSG business, we have increased our presence in the fastener and Class C (&#8220;Consumables&#8221;) product categories and significantly increased our presence in the VMI space. VMI involves not only the selling of the maintenance consumables by our associates, but also the management of appropriate stock levels for the customer, writing the necessary replenishment orders, putting away the stock, and maintaining a clean and organized inventory area. 

&#65279; 

We serve durable and non-durable goods manufacturing (which accounted for a substantial portion of our revenue in fiscal 2016), education, and health care markets, among others. We also have government and national account programs designed to address the needs of these customers. 

&#65279; 

Federal government customers include large and small military bases, Veterans Affairs hospitals, federal correctional facilities, the U.S. Postal Service and the Department of Defense. We have individual state contracts but also are engaged in several state cooperatives. 

&#65279; 

Our national account program also includes Fortune 1000 companies, large privately held companies, and international companies doing business in the United States. We have identified hundreds of additional national account prospects and have given our sales team tools to ensure we are targeting prospective customers that best fit the MSC model. 

&#160; 

We have implemented advanced analytics and significantly increased the return on our direct marketing investments designed to acquire new customers and increase our share of business with current customers. While master catalogs, promotional catalogs and brochures continue to play an important role in our efforts, we accelerated a shift to search engine marketing, email marketing and online advertising to address changes in our customers&#8217; buying behavior. We use our own database of over 3 million contacts together with external mailing lists to target buyers with the highest likelihood to buy from MSC. By applying new analytics and moving expenditures to more efficient online tactics, we reduced publication circulation while significantly increasing revenue contribution. 

&#65279; 

Our sales representatives are highly trained individuals who build relationships with customers, assist customers in reducing costs, provide technical support, coordinate special orders and shipments with vendors and update customer account profiles in our information systems databases. Our approach is based on the ability of the sales representative, armed with our comprehensive databases as a resource, to respond effectively to the customer&#8217;s needs. When a customer places a call to MSC, the sales representative on the other end of the line has immediate access to that customer&#8217;s company and specific 

&#160;

buyer profile, which includes billing and purchasing track records and plant and industry information. Meanwhile, the sales representative has access to inventory levels on every SKU we carry. 

&#65279; 

Our in-bound sales representatives at our customer care centers undergo an intensive seven-week training course, followed up by regular on-site training seminars and workshops. They are monitored and evaluated at regular intervals, and they receive technical training from our in-house specialists and product vendors. We maintain a separate technical support group dedicated to answering customer inquiries, assisting them with product operation and finding the most efficient solutions to manufacturing problems. 

As of September 3, 2016, we had 2,370 &#160; field sales &#160; and service associates working throughout North America and the U.K. Our field sales representatives are responsible for increasing sales per customer and servicing existing accounts. They are a touch point with the customer and provide MSC with feedback on the competitive landscape and purchasing trends. &#160; 

&#65279; 

Branch Offices 

&#65279; 

We operate 85 branch offices. There are 84 branch offices within the United States located in 39 stat es, and one location in the U.K. We have experienced higher sales growth and market penetration in areas around our branch offices and believe they play an integral role in obtaining new accounts and penetrating existing on es. During fiscal 2016, we were able to consolidate s ome branch offices that were relatively close in proximity in order to gain leverage, operational effectiveness and cost savings. There were no new branch openings during fiscal 2016. 

&#65279; 

Publications 

&#65279; 

Our primary reference publications are our master catalogs, which are supported by specialty and promotional catalogs and brochures. MSC produces two annual catalogs: the MSC Big Book, which contains a comprehensive offering across all product lines, and the MSC Metalworking catalog . We use specialty and promotional publications to target customers in specific areas, such as metal fabrication, facilities management, safety and janitorial. Specialty and promotional catalogs, targeted to our best prospects, offer a more focused selection of products at a lower catalog production cost and more efficient use of advertising space. 

&#65279; 

We periodically balance ongoing strategies to improve direct marketing productivity and increase return on advertising dollars spent against programs to increase revenue and lifetime value. As such, our mailing volume will fluctuate from year to year.

Customer Service 

&#65279; 

One of our goals is to make purchasing our products as convenient as possible. Customers submit m ore than 50% of our orders digitally through our technology platform (website, vending machines, and eProcurement). The remaining orders are placed via telephone, fax and mail. The efficient handling of orders is a critical aspect of our business. Order entry and fulfillment occurs at each o f our branches and our main customer care centers, mostly located at our customer fulfi llment centers. Customer care phone representatives enter orders into computerized order processing systems. In the event of a local or regional breakdown, a call can usually be re-routed to an alternative location. When an order enters the system, a credit check is performed; if the credit is approved, the order is usually transmitted to the customer fulfillment center closest to the customer. Customers are invoiced for merchandise, shipping and handling promptly after shipment. 

&#65279; 

Information Systems 

&#65279; 

Our information systems enable us to centralize management of key functions, including communication links between customer fulfillment centers, inventory and accounts receivable, purchasing, pricing, sales and distribution, and the 

&#160;

preparation of daily operating control reports. These systems help us ship on a same-day basis, respond quickly to order changes, provide a high level of customer service, and reduce costs. Our eCommerce environment is built upon a combined platform of our own intellectual property, state-of-the-art software from the world&#8217;s leading internet technology providers and world-class product data. This powerful combination of resources helps us deliver a superior online shopping experience with extremely high levels of reliability. 

&#65279; 

Most of our information systems operate in real time over a wide area network, letting each customer fulfillment center and branch office share information and monitor daily progress on sales activity, credit approval, inventory levels, stock balancing, vendor returns, order fulfillment and other performance measures. We maintain a sophisticated buying and inventory management system that monitors all of our SKUs and automatically purchases inventory from vendors for replenishment based on projected customer ordering models. We also maintain an Electronic Data Interchange (&#8220;EDI&#8221;) purchasing program with our vendors to boost order placement efficiency, reduce order cycle processing time, and increase order accuracy. 

&#65279; 

In addition to developing the proprietary computer software programs for use in the customer service and distribution operations, we also provide a comprehensive EDI and Extensible Markup Language (&#8220;XML&#8221;) ordering system to support our customer-based purchase order processing. We also maintain a proprietary hardware and software platform to support our VMI program, which allows customers to integrate scanner &#8209;accumulated orders directly into our Sales Order Entry system and website. Our CMI program enables customers to simply and effectively replenish inventory by submitting orders directly to our website. Our customized vending systems are used by customers in manufacturing plants across the United States to help them achieve supply chain and shop floor optimization, through inventory management and reduced tooling and labor costs. Our VMI, CMI and vending capabilities function directly as front-end ordering systems for our e-Portal based customers. These solutions take advantage of advanced technologies built upon the latest innovations in wireless and cloud based computing. 

&#65279; 

Our core business systems run in a highly distributed computing environment and utilize world-class software and hardware platforms from key partners. We utilize disaster recovery techniques and procedures, which are consistent with best practices in enterprise IT. Given such a distributed IT environment, we regularly review and upgrade our systems. We believe that our current systems and practice of implementing regular updates are adequate to support our current needs. In fiscal 2016, we initiated the upgrade of our core financial systems, including the receivables, payables, treasury, fixed assets and general ledger. 

&#65279; 

With the advent of advanced mobile technologies such as smart phones and tablets, access to information and decision-making can now be made anytime, anywhere. Recognizing this need, we have deployed technology to securely manage and maintain access to enterprise information from mobile devices that meet our security standards. Our sales representatives are equipped with proprietary mobile technology that allows them to tap into MSC&#8217;s supply chain directly from our customers&#8217; manufacturing plants and make sure that critical inventory is always on site and available. In addition, we are enhancing our customer websites and portals to reflect this new mobile reality at a pace in line with customer adoption of mobile technology. 

&#65279; 

Competition 

&#65279; 

The MRO supply industry is a large, fragmented industry that is highly competitive. We face competition from traditional channels of distribution, such as retail outlets; small dealerships; regional or national distributors utilizing direct sales forces; manufacturers of MRO supplies; large warehouse stores; and larger direct mail distributors. We also face emerging competitors primarily in the online distribution space that compete with price transparency . We believe that sales of MRO supplies will become more concentrated over the next few years, which may make MRO supply distribution more competitive. Some of our competitors challenge us with a large variety of product offerings, financial resources, services or a combination of all of these factors. In the industrial products market, customer purchasing decisions are based primarily on one or more of the following criteria: price, product selection, product availability, technical support relationship, level of service and convenience. We believe we compete effectively on all such criteria. 

&#65279; 

Seasonality 

&#65279; 

During any given time period, we may be impacted by our industrial customers&#8217; plant shutdowns (particularly during the summer months or our fourth fiscal quarter). In addition, we may be impacted by weather-related disruptions. 

&#65279; 

&#160;

Compliance with Health and Safety and Environmental Protection Laws 

&#65279; 

Our operations are subject to and affected by a variety of federal, state, local and non-U.S. health and safety and environmental laws and regulations relating to the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal, investigation and remediation of certain materials, substances and wastes. We continually assess our compliance status and management of environmental matters to ensure that our operations are in compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. 

&#65279; 

Operating and maintenance costs, associated with environmental compliance and management of sites, are a normal and recurring part of our operations. With respect to all other matters that may currently be pending, in the opinion of management, based on our analysis of relevant facts and circumstances, compliance with applicable environmental laws is not likely to have a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. 

&#65279; 

Associates 

&#65279; 

As of September 3, 2016, we emplo yed 6,462 ass ociates , w hich includes our U.K. and Canada operations. No associate is represented by a labor union. We consider our relationships with associates to be good and have experienced no work stoppages. 

&#65279; 

Available Information 

&#65279; 

We file annual, quarterly and current reports, and other reports and documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;). The public may read and copy any materials we file with the SEC at the SEC&#8217;s Public Reference Room at Station Place, 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC also maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. The address of that website is www.sec.gov.
