 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

A. GENERAL DESCRIPTION 

Heartland Financial USA, Inc. (individually referred to herein as "Parent Company" and collectively with all of its subsidiaries and affiliates referred to herein as "Heartland," "we," "us," or "our") is a multi-bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "BHCA"), that was originally formed in the state of Iowa in 1981 and reincorporated in the State of Delaware in 1993. Heartland's headquarters are located at 1398 Central Avenue, Dubuque, Iowa. Our website address is www.htlf.com . You can access, free of charge, our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and any other amendments to those reports, at our website under the Investor Relations tab, or at the SEC website at www.sec.gov . Proxy materials for our upcoming 2016 Annual Shareholders Meeting to be held on May 19, 2016, will be available electronically via a link on our website at www.htlf.com . 

At December 31, 2015, Heartland had total assets of $7.69 billion , total loans of $5.00 billion &#32;and total deposits of $6.41 billion . Heartland&#8217;s total capital as of December 31, 2015, was $663.2 million . Net income available to common stockholders for 2015 was $59.2 million . 

Heartland conducts a community banking business through independently chartered community banks (collectively, the "Bank Subsidiaries") operating in the states of Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin, New Mexico, Arizona, Montana, Colorado, Minnesota, Kansas, Missouri, Texas and California. All Bank Subsidiaries are members of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC"). Listed below are our current ten Bank Subsidiaries, which operate a total of 108 banking locations serving approximately 210,000 business and consumer households:

DB&#38;T Insurance, Inc., a multi-line insurance agency. 

&#8226; 

DB&#38;T Community Development Corp., a community development company with the primary purpose of partnering in low-income housing and historic rehabilitation projects. 

Heartland has three active non-bank subsidiaries as listed below: 

&#8226; 

Citizens Finance Parent Co., a consumer finance company with two wholly-owned subsidiaries: 

&#9702;

&#8226; 

Heartland Financial USA, Inc. Insurance Services, a multi-line insurance agency with the primary purpose of providing online insurance products to consumers and small business clients in Bank Subsidiary markets.

All of Heartland&#8217;s subsidiaries were wholly owned as of December 31, 2015. 

The principal business of our Bank Subsidiaries consists of making loans to and accepting deposits from businesses and individuals. Our Bank Subsidiaries provide full service commercial and retail banking in their communities. Both our loans and our deposits are generated primarily through strong banking and community relationships, and through management that is actively involved in the community. Our lending and investment activities are funded primarily by core deposits. This stable source of funding is achieved by developing strong banking relationships with customers through value-added product offerings, competitive market pricing, convenience and high-touch personal service. Deposit products, which are insured by the FDIC to the full extent permitted by law, include checking and other demand deposit accounts, NOW accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts, certificates of deposit, individual retirement accounts, health savings accounts and other time deposits. Loan products include commercial and industrial, commercial real estate, small business, agricultural, real estate mortgage, consumer, and credit cards for commercial, business and personal use. 

We supplement the local services of our Bank Subsidiaries with a full complement of ancillary services, including wealth management, investment and insurance services. We provide convenient electronic banking services and client access to account information through business and personal online banking, mobile banking, bill payment, remote deposit capture, treasury management services, debit cards and automated teller machines. 

Business Model and Operating Philosophy 

Heartland&#8217;s operating philosophy is to maximize the benefits of a community banking model by: 

1. 

Creating strong community ties through local bank delivery of products and services. 

&#8226; 

Deeply rooted local leadership and boards 

&#8226; 

Local community knowledge and relationships 

&#8226; 

Local decision-making 

&#8226; 

Independent charters 

&#8226; 

Locally recognized brands 

&#8226; 

Commitment to an exceptional customer experience 

2. 

Providing extensive banking services to increase revenue. 

&#8226; 

Full range of commercial products, including government guaranteed lending, treasury management services and private client services 

&#8226; 

Convenient and competitive retail products and services, including consumer finance 

&#8226; 

Residential mortgage origination 

&#8226; 

Providing added client value through consultative relationship building 

3. 

Centralizing back-office operations for efficiency. 

&#8226; 

Leverage expertise across all Bank Subsidiaries 

&#8226; 

Leading edge technology for account processing and delivery systems 

&#8226; 

Efficient back-office support for loan processing and deposit operations 

&#8226; 

Centralized loan underwriting and collections 

&#8226; 

Centralized loss management and risk analysis 

&#8226; 

Centralized support for other professional services, including human resources, marketing, legal, compliance, finance, administration, internal audit, investment management, customer support and facilities 

We believe the personal and professional service we offer to our customers provides an appealing alternative to the service provided by the "megabanks" resulting from mergers and acquisitions in the financial services industry. While we employ a community banking philosophy, we believe our size, combined with our full line of financial products and services, is sufficient to effectively compete in our respective market areas. To remain price competitive, we also believe that we must manage expenses and gain economies of scale by centralizing back office support functions. Although each of our Bank Subsidiaries operates under the direction of its own board of directors, we have standard operating policies regarding asset/liability management, liquidity management, investment management, and lending and deposit structure management. 

Another component of our operating strategy is to encourage all directors, officers and employees to maintain a strong ownership interest in Heartland. We have established ownership guidelines for our directors and executive management and have made an employee stock purchase plan available to employees since 1996. 

We maintain a strong community commitment by encouraging the active participation of our employees, officers and board members in local charitable, civic, school, religious and community development activities. 

Acquisition and Expansion Strategy 

Our primary objectives are to increase profitability and diversify our market area and asset base by expanding existing subsidiaries through acquisitions and to grow organically by increasing our customer base in the markets we serve. In the current environment, we are seeking opportunities for growth through acquisitions. Although we are focused on opportunities in our existing and adjacent markets, we would consider acquisitions in new growth markets if they fit our business model, provide a sufficient return on investment and would be accretive to earnings within the first year of combined operations. We typically consider acquisitions of established financial services organizations, primarily commercial banks or thrifts. We have also formed de novo &#32;banking institutions in locations determined to have market potential and management with banking expertise and a philosophy similar to our own. 

In recent years, we have focused on markets with growth potential in the Midwestern and Western regions of the United States with a strategic goal to expand our presence in Western markets to 50% of total assets. Our strategy is to balance the growth in our Western markets with the stability of our Midwestern markets. As of December 31, 2015, Heartland had approximately 43% of its assets in Western markets. 

Through acquisition and organic growth, our goal is to reach $1 billion in assets in each state where Heartland operates. To that end, as of December 31, 2015, Dubuque Bank and Trust Company, New Mexico Bank &#38; Trust, and Wisconsin Bank &#38; Trust have assets over $1 billion. 

In the fourth quarter of 2015, we announced the acquisition of CIC Bancshares, Inc., the parent company of Centennial Bank, a Colorado bank headquartered in Denver, Colorado with assets of approximately $749.0 million, outstanding loans of approximately $582.0 million and deposits of approximately $656.0 million as of December 31, 2015. The CIC Bancshares, Inc. acquisition was completed on February 5, 2016, with the systems integration planned for the second quarter of 2016. Upon closing, Centennial Bank merged into Summit Bank &#38; Trust with the resulting institution operating as Centennial Bank and Trust. 

As noted in the table below, Heartland completed four acquisitions in 2015, including Community Bank &#38; Trust (Sheboygan, Wisconsin), Community Bank (Santa Fe, New Mexico), First Scottsdale Bank, N.A., (Scottsdale, Arizona) and Premier Valley Bank (Fresno, California). These acquisitions, in the aggregate, increased Heartland's total assets by approximately $1.51 billion, total loans outstanding by approximately $939.0 million and total deposits by approximately $1.27 billion.

Primary Business Lines 

General 

The Bank Subsidiaries provide a wide range of commercial and consumer banking services to businesses, including public sector and non-profit entities, and to individuals. These activities include credit and deposit products along with treasury management, investment management, trust, retirement plans, and brokerage and investment services. 

Our bankers actively solicit the business of new companies entering their market areas as well as established companies in their respective business communities. We believe that the Bank Subsidiaries are successful in attracting new customers in their markets through professional service, competitive pricing, innovative credit facilities, convenient locations and proactive communications. 

Commercial Banking 

The Bank Subsidiaries have a strong commercial loan base generated primarily through contacts and relationships in the communities they serve. The current portfolios of the Bank Subsidiaries reflect the businesses in those communities and include a wide range of business loans, including lines of credit for working capital and operational purposes and term loans for the acquisition of equipment and real estate. Although most loans are made on a secured basis, loans may be made on an unsecured basis where warranted by the overall financial condition of the borrower. Terms of commercial business loans generally range from one to five years. 

Commercial bankers at the Bank Subsidiaries provide a relationship management approach to deliver a consistent set of values in an organized and efficient manner both for the client and the bank. Bankers are trained and experienced in providing consultative solutions to clients to assist them in accomplishing their objectives. The services used to accompany this approach are targeted to be at the highest level in the industry and can be customized to fit the objectives of the client. 

Closely integrated with our loan programs is a significant emphasis on treasury management services that enhance our business clients' ability to monitor, accumulate and disburse funds efficiently. Treasury management has five basic functions: collection; disbursement; management of cash; information reporting; and fraud detection and prevention. Our treasury services include online banking and bill payment, automated clearing house ("ACH") services, wire transfer, zero balance accounts, transaction reporting, lock box services, remote deposit capture, accounts receivable solutions, commercial purchasing cards, merchant credit card services, investment sweep accounts, reconciliation services, foreign exchange and several fraud prevention services, including check and electronic positive pay, and virus/malware protection service. 

Many of the businesses in the communities we serve are small to mid-sized businesses, and commercial lending to small businesses has been, and continues to be, an emphasis for the Bank Subsidiaries. The table below shows the certifications granted to the Bank Subsidiaries from the United States Small Business Administration ("SBA") and United States Department of Agriculture (the "USDA") Rural Development Business and Industry loan program.

(1) As a result of our acquisition of CIC Bancshares, Inc. and the merger of Centennial Bank into Summit Bank &#38; Trust on February 5, 2016, the name was changed from Summit Bank &#38; Trust on such date. 

Our commercial loans and leases are primarily made based on the identified cash flow of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. We value the collateral for most of these loans and leases based upon its estimated fair market value and require personal guarantees in most instances. The primary repayment risks of commercial loans and leases are that the cash flow of the borrowers may be unpredictable, and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. 

In 2012, Heartland announced that we had teamed with BluePath Finance LLC to provide upfront financing for the installation of energy-efficient building products used by commercial and industrial companies, as well as entities in the non-profit and public sectors. We believe our relationship with BluePath can help our customers become more energy efficient. BluePath can provide the financial model to accomplish this objective and help companies realize a bottom-line benefit by reducing costs and increasing profits. 

In order to limit underwriting risk, we attempt to ensure that all loan personnel are well trained. We use the RMA Diagnostic Assessment in assessing the credit skills and training needs for our loan personnel and have developed specific individualized training as well. All new lending personnel are expected to complete a similar diagnostic training program. We assist all of the commercial and agricultural lending officers of the Bank Subsidiaries in the analysis and underwriting of credit through centralized staff in the credit administration department. 

Although the lending personnel of the Bank Subsidiaries report to their respective board of directors each month, we use an internal loan review function to analyze credits of the Bank Subsidiaries and provide periodic reports to their boards of directors. We have attempted to identify problem loans early and to aggressively seek resolution of credit problems. 

The economic downturn that negatively impacted our overall asset quality between 2008 and 2011 resulted in the formation of an internal Special Assets group to focus on resolving problem assets. Commercial or agricultural loans in a default or workout status are assigned to the Special Assets group. Special Assets personnel are also responsible for marketing repossessed properties and meet with representatives from each Bank Subsidiary on a monthly basis. 

Small Business Banking 

In 2013, Heartland established a Small Business Lending Center dedicated to serving the credit needs of small businesses with annual sales generally under $5 million. The Center is designed to provide quick turnaround on customer credit requests on a wide variety of credit products. We believe that small businesses are an underserved market segment and see additional opportunity in serving this market with deposit and electronic banking services as well as wealth management and brokerage services. The Bank Subsidiaries have designated business bankers and banking center managers that serve the distinct banking needs of this customer segment. 

Agricultural Loans 

Agricultural loans are emphasized by those Bank Subsidiaries with operations in and around rural areas, including Dubuque Bank and Trust Company, Rocky Mountain Bank, Wisconsin Bank &#38; Trust's Monroe and Platteville banking centers, New Mexico Bank &#38; Trust&#8217;s Clovis banking offices and the Morrill &#38; Janes Bank &#38; Trust Company's northeast Kansas banking offices. Dubuque Bank and Trust Company is one of the largest agricultural lenders in the State of Iowa. Agricultural loans constituted approximately 9% of our total loan portfolio at December 31, 2015. Dubuque Bank and Trust Company, Wisconsin Bank &#38; Trust and Morrill &#38; Janes Bank and Trust Company are designated as Preferred Lenders by the USDA Farm Service Agency (the "FSA"). In making agricultural loans, we have policies designating a primary lending area for each Bank Subsidiary, in which a majority of its agricultural operating and real estate loans are made. Under this policy, loans in a secondary market area must be secured by real estate. 

Agricultural loans, many of which are secured by crops, machinery and real estate, are provided to finance capital improvements and farm operations as well as acquisitions of livestock and machinery. Agricultural loans present unique credit risks relating to adverse weather conditions, loss of livestock due to disease or other factors, declines in market prices for agricultural products and the impact of government regulations. The ultimate repayment of agricultural loans is dependent upon the profitable operation or management of the agricultural entity. 

In underwriting agricultural loans, the lending officers of the Bank Subsidiaries work closely with their customers to review budgets and cash flow projections for the ensuing crop year. These budgets and cash flow projections are monitored closely during the year and reviewed with the customers at least annually. The Bank Subsidiaries also work closely with governmental agencies, including the FSA, to help agricultural customers obtain credit enhancement products such as loan guarantees or interest assistance. 

Residential Real Estate Mortgage Lending 

Mortgage lending remains a focal point for Heartland as we continue to strengthen our residential real estate lending business. As long-term interest rates have remained at low levels during the past several years, many customers have elected mortgage loans that are fixed rate with fifteen- year or thirty-year maturities. We generally sell these loans into the secondary market and retain servicing rights. We believe that mortgage servicing on loans sold in the secondary market provides a relatively steady source of fee income compared to fees generated solely from mortgage origination operations. Moreover, the retention of servicing provides an opportunity to maintain ongoing contact with borrowers and to cross-sell a wide variety of additional services such as checking, savings, consumer loans, wealth management and investment products. At December 31, 2015, residential real estate mortgage loans serviced, primarily for government sponsored entities ("GSEs"), totaled $4.06 billion. 

As with agricultural and commercial loans, we encourage participation in lending programs sponsored by U.S. government agencies when justified by market conditions. Loans insured or guaranteed under programs through the Veterans Administration (the "VA") and the Federal Home Administration (the "FHA") are offered at all of the Bank Subsidiaries. 

Our mortgage unit provides residential mortgage lending services at all Bank Subsidiaries. Operating under the brand, "National Residential Mortgage," our mortgage unit serves non-Heartland markets in California, Nevada, and Idaho. Administrative and back office support for these operations is performed by "Heartland Mortgage," a division of our lead bank, Dubuque Bank and Trust Company. 

Dubuque Bank and Trust Company has been a Ginnie Mae ("GNMA") issuer since 2012 for the GNMA I and II single-family mortgage-backed securities program. As a GNMA issuer, Dubuque Bank and Trust Company is allowed to pool and securitize FHA loans, VA loans, and Department of Agriculture's Rural Development loans, which provides an avenue for increasing growth in our portfolio of loans serviced for others. 

Retail Banking 

A wide variety of retail banking services are delivered through our 108 banking centers. Services include checking, savings, money market accounts, certificates of deposit, IRAs and HSAs. Brokerage services, including fixed rate annuity products are also provided in many locations. Consumer lending services of the Bank Subsidiaries include a broad array of consumer loans, including motor vehicle, home improvement, home equity lines of credit ("HELOC"), fixed rate home equity and personal lines of credit. Consumer loans typically have shorter terms, lower balances, higher yields and higher risks of default than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. Consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower&#8217;s continuing financial stability, and are therefore more likely to be affected by adverse personal circumstances. 

Consumer Finance 

Our consumer finance subsidiary, Citizens Finance Parent Co., specializes in consumer lending and currently serves the consumer credit needs of nearly 13,000 customers from 14 locations in Iowa, Illinois and Wisconsin. Citizens Finance Parent Co., through its subsidiaries Citizens Finance Co. and Citizens Finance of Illinois Co., typically lends to borrowers with past credit problems or limited credit histories. Heartland expects to incur a higher level of credit losses on Citizens' loans compared to consumer loans originated by the Bank Subsidiaries. Correspondingly, returns on these loans are higher than those at the Bank Subsidiaries.

B. MARKET AREAS 

Heartland is a geographically diversified company with a Midwestern and Western franchise, which balances the risk of regional economic fluctuations. In general, we view our Midwest markets as stable with slower growth prospects and the West as offering greater opportunities for growth accompanied by the potential of wider economic swings. We focus on markets with growth potential in the Midwestern and Western regions of the United States with a strategic goal to expand our presence in Western markets to 50% of total assets. We strive to balance the growth in our Western markets with the stability of our Midwestern markets. As of December 31, 2015, Heartland had approximately 43% of its assets in Western markets.

C. COMPETITION 

We encounter competition in all areas of our business. To compete effectively, develop our market share, maintain flexibility, and keep pace with changing economic and social conditions, we continuously refine and develop our products and services. The principal methods of competing in the financial services industry are through product selection, personal service, convenience and technology. 

The market areas of the Bank Subsidiaries are highly competitive. Many financial institutions based in the communities surrounding the Bank Subsidiaries actively compete for customers within our market area. We also face competition from finance companies, insurance companies, mortgage companies, securities brokerage firms, money market funds, loan production offices and other providers of financial services. Under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, effective in 2000, securities firms and insurance companies that elect to become financial holding companies may acquire banks and other financial institutions. As a result of the enactment of the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act") in 2010, substantial changes to the regulation of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries have occurred and will continue to occur as the Dodd-Frank Act is fully implemented. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the Dodd-Frank Act have significantly changed the competitive environment in which we operate. The financial services industry is also likely to become more competitive as technological advances enable more companies to provide financial services. These technological advances may diminish the importance of depository institutions and other financial intermediaries in the transfer of funds between parties. 

We compete for loans principally through the range and quality of the services we provide, with an emphasis on building long-lasting relationships. Our strategy is to serve our customers above and beyond their expectations through excellence in customer service and needs-based selling. We believe that our long-standing presence in the communities we serve and the personal service we emphasize enhance our ability to compete favorably in attracting and retaining individual and business customers. We actively solicit deposit-oriented clients and compete for deposits by offering personal attention, combined with electronic banking convenience, professional service and competitive interest rates. 

D. EMPLOYEES 

At December 31, 2015, Heartland employed 1,799 &#32;full-time equivalent employees. We place a high priority on staff development, which involves extensive training in a variety of areas, including customer service and sales training. New employees are selected based upon their technical skills and customer service capabilities. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We offer a variety of employee benefits, and we consider our employee relations to be excellent. 

E. INTERNET ACCESS 

Heartland maintains an Investor Relations website at www.htlf.com . We offer our Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and other reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, free of charge from our website. 

F. SUPERVISION AND REGULATION 

General 

Financial institutions, their holding companies, and their affiliates are extensively regulated under federal and state law. As a result, the growth and earnings performance of Heartland may be affected not only by management decisions and general economic conditions, but also by the requirements of federal and state statutes and by the regulations and policies of various bank regulatory authorities. 

As a bank holding company with subsidiary banks chartered under the laws of ten different states, Heartland is regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve"). Each of the Bank Subsidiaries is regulated by the FDIC as its principal federal regulator and one of the following as its state regulator: the Arizona State Banking Department (the "Arizona Department"); the California Department of Business Oversight, Division of Financial Institutions (the "California Division"); the Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies, Division of Banking (the "Colorado Division"); the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (the "Illinois DFPR"); the Iowa Superintendent of Banking (the "Iowa Superintendent"); the State Bank Commissioner of Kansas Division of Banking (the "Kansas Division"); the Minnesota Department of Commerce: Division of Financial Institutions (the "Minnesota Division"); the Montana Division of Banking and Financial Institutions (the "Montana Division"); the New Mexico Financial Institutions Division (the "New Mexico FID"); and the Division of Banking of the Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions (the "Wisconsin DFI"). 

Heartland also operates a consumer finance company, Citizens Finance Parent Co., with state licenses in Iowa, Illinois and Wisconsin. Citizens Finance Parent Co. is subject to regulation by the state banking authorities of those states. Further, the Dodd-Frank Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the "CFPB"), which has direct supervisory authority for compliance with federal consumer financial service laws over banks with assets of more than $10 billion and over nonbank entities that provide consumer financial services and products. The CFPB has direct supervisory authority over Citizens Finance Parent Co., and rulemaking authority for federal laws covering the consumer financial services and products offered by all Heartland subsidiaries. 

As a participant in the Small Business Lending Fund (the "SBLF") established by the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, Heartland is also subject to direct supervision by the United States Department of the Treasury (the "U.S. Treasury"). 

Federal and state laws and regulations generally applicable to financial institutions regulate, among other things, the scope of business, the kinds and amounts of investments, reserve requirements, capital levels, the establishment of branches, mergers and consolidations and the payment of dividends. This system of supervision and regulation establishes a comprehensive framework for the respective operations of Heartland and its subsidiaries and is intended primarily for the protection of the FDIC-insured deposits and depositors of the Bank Subsidiaries, rather than stockholders. 

The following is a summary of material elements of the regulatory framework that applies to Heartland and its subsidiaries. It does not describe all of the statutes, regulations and regulatory policies that apply to us, nor does it disclose all of the requirements of the statutes, regulations and regulatory policies requirements that are described. Any change in regulations or regulatory policies including further changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act, or further change in applicable law, may have a material effect on the business of Heartland and its subsidiaries. 

Heartland 

General 

Heartland, as the sole shareholder of Dubuque Bank and Trust Company, New Mexico Bank &#38; Trust, Rocky Mountain Bank, Wisconsin Bank &#38; Trust, Illinois Bank &#38; Trust, Arizona Bank &#38; Trust, Centennial Bank and Trust, Minnesota Bank &#38; Trust, Morrill &#38; Janes Bank and Trust Company and Premier Valley Bank, is a bank holding company. As a bank holding company, Heartland is registered with, and is subject to regulation by, the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act ("BHCA"). In accordance with Federal Reserve policy, Heartland is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to the Bank Subsidiaries and to commit resources to support the Bank Subsidiaries in circumstances where Heartland might not otherwise do so. In addition, under the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC has backup enforcement authority over a depository institution holding company, such as Heartland, if the conduct or threatened conduct of the holding company poses a risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund, although such authority may not be used if the holding company is in sound condition and does not pose a foreseeable and material risk to the insurance fund. 

Under the BHCA, Heartland is subject to periodic examination by the Federal Reserve. Heartland is also required to file with the Federal Reserve periodic reports of Heartland's operations and such additional information regarding Heartland and its subsidiaries as the Federal Reserve may require. 

Acquisitions, Activities and Change in Control 

The primary purpose of a bank holding company is to control and manage banks. &#160; The BHCA generally requires the prior approval of the Federal Reserve for any merger involving a bank holding company or any acquisition by a bank holding company. Subject to certain conditions (including certain deposit concentration limits established by the BHCA), the Federal Reserve may allow a bank holding company to acquire banks located in any State of the United States. In approving interstate acquisitions, the Federal Reserve is required to give effect to applicable state law limitations on the aggregate amount of deposits that may be held by the acquiring bank holding company and its insured depository institution affiliates in the state in which the target bank is located (provided that those limits do not discriminate against out-of-state depository institutions or their holding companies). 

The BHCA generally prohibits Heartland from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company that is not a bank and from engaging in any business other than that of banking, managing and controlling banks, or furnishing services to banks and their subsidiaries. This general prohibition is subject to a number of exceptions. The principal exception allows bank holding companies to engage in, and to own shares of companies engaged in, certain businesses found by the Federal Reserve to be "so closely related to banking ... as to be a proper incident thereto." This authority permits Heartland to engage in a variety of banking-related businesses, including consumer finance, equipment leasing, mortgage banking, brokerage, and the operation of a computer service bureau (which may engage in software development). Under the Dodd-Frank Act, however, any non-bank subsidiary would be subject to regulation no less stringent than the regulation applicable to the lead bank of the bank holding company. The BHCA generally does not place territorial restrictions on the domestic activities of non-bank subsidiaries of bank holding companies. 

Additionally, bank holding companies that meet certain eligibility requirements prescribed by the BHCA and elect to operate as financial holding companies may engage in, or own shares in companies engaged in, a wider range of nonbanking activities. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Heartland has not applied for approval to operate as a financial holding company. 

Federal law also prohibits any person or persons acting in concert from acquiring "control" of an FDIC-insured institution or its holding company without prior notice to the appropriate federal bank regulator or any other company from acquiring "control" without Federal Reserve approval to become a bank holding company. "Control" is conclusively presumed to exist upon the acquisition of 25% or more of the outstanding voting securities of a bank or bank holding company, but may exist at 10% ownership levels for public companies, such as Heartland, and under certain other circumstances. Each of the Bank Subsidiaries is generally subject to similar restrictions on changes in control under the law of the state granting its charter. 

Capital Requirements 

Bank holding companies are required to maintain minimum levels of capital in accordance with Federal Reserve capital adequacy guidelines, separate from and in addition to the capital requirements applicable to subsidiary financial institutions. If a bank holding company is not well-capitalized, it will have difficulty engaging in acquisition transactions, and, if its capital levels fall below the minimum required levels, a bank holding company, among other things, may be denied approval to acquire or establish additional banks or non-bank businesses. 

In general, the regulations of the Federal Reserve and the FDIC as the primary regulator of state banks, separate capital into two components, Tier 1 or "Core" capital and Tier 2 or "Supplementary" capital, and test these capital components based on their ratio to assets and to "risk weighted assets." Beginning January 1, 2015, when the Basel III regulations became applicable to Heartland, 

a third category of capital, "Common Equity Tier 1 capital," has been added. It is tested against risk weighted assets. Tier 1 capital generally consists of (a) common stockholders' equity, qualifying noncumulative preferred stock, and to the extent they do not exceed 25% of total Tier 1 capital, qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock and trust preferred securities, and (b) among other things, goodwill and specified intangible assets, credit enhancing strips and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries. Tier 2 capital includes, to the extent not in excess of Tier 1 capital, the allowance for loan and lease losses, other qualifying perpetual preferred stock, certain hybrid capital instruments, qualifying term subordinated debt and unrealized gains on equity securities. Risk weighted assets include the sum of specific assets of an institution multiplied by risk weightings for each asset class. 

Until the implementation of the Basel III requirements, the Federal Reserve's capital guidelines applicable to bank holding companies, like the regulations applicable to subsidiary banks, required holding companies with less than $10 billion of assets to comply with three capital ratios: (i) a leverage requirement consisting of a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets (the "Leverage Ratio") of 3.0% for the most highly-rated banks with a minimum requirement of at least 4.0% for all others; (ii) a risk-based capital requirement consisting of a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to total risk-weighted assets (the "Tier1 Capital Ratio") of 4.0% and (iii) a risk-based capital requirement consisting of a minimum ratio of total capital to total risk-weighted assets (the "Total Capital Ratio") of 8.0%. The Basel III regulations, which became effective for Heartland and the Bank Subsidiaries on January 1, 2015, (1) increased the minimum Leverage Ratio to 4.0% for all banks, (2) increased the Tier 1 Capital Ratio to 6.0% on January 1, 2015 and will increase the Tier 1 Capital Ratio to 8.5% on January 1, 2019, and (3) created a new requirement to maintain a ratio of Common Equity Tier 1 capital ("Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio") to risk-weighted assets of 4.5% as of January 1, 2015, gradually increasing to 7.0% on January 1, 2019. The Basel III Rules require inclusion in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital of the effects of other comprehensive income adjustments, such as gains and losses on securities held to maturity, that are currently excluded from the definition of Tier1 capital, but allow institutions, such as Heartland, to make a one-time election not to include those effects. Heartland and its subsidiary banks elected not to include the effects of other comprehensive income in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital. Further, under the Basel III rules, if an institution grows beyond $15 billion in assets and makes an acquisition, its ability to include trust preferred securities in Tier 1 capital is phased out. However, the trust preferred securities issued by Heartland, as a holding company with less than $15 billion in assets, is grandfathered as Tier 1 capital by the Dodd-Frank Act. 

Further, federal law and regulations provide various incentives for financial institutions to maintain regulatory capital at levels in excess of minimum regulatory requirements. For example, a financial institution generally must be "well-capitalized" to engage in acquisitions, and well-capitalized institutions may qualify for exemptions from prior notice or application requirements otherwise applicable to certain types of activities and may qualify for expedited processing of other required notices or applications. Additionally, one of the criteria that determines a bank holding company's eligibility to operate as a financial holding company is a requirement that both the holding company and all of its financial institution subsidiaries be "well-capitalized." Under current federal regulations, in order to be "well-capitalized" a financial institution must maintain a Total Capital Ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 Capital Ratio of 6.0% or greater and a Leverage Ratio of 5.0% or greater. In order to be "well-capitalized" under the new Basel III Rules, a bank or bank holding company will be required to have a Total Capital Ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 Capital Ratio of 8.0% or greater, a Leverage Ratio of 5.0% or greater, and a Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of 6.5% or greater. As of December 31, 2015, Heartland had regulatory capital in excess of the Federal Reserve's minimum requirements. 

Treasury Regulation 

Bank holding companies that received financing from the SBLF are subject to direct regulation by the U.S. Treasury. Heartland applied for and received SBLF funding on September 15, 2011, issuing 81,698 shares of its Senior Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series C (the "Series C Preferred Stock"), to the U.S. Treasury. The Series C Preferred Stock initially required quarterly dividends payable to the U.S. Treasury equal to 5.00% of the liquidation value of the Preferred Stock. The dividend rate payable under the Series C Preferred Stock was subject to reduction during the second to tenth quarters after issuance (through December 31, 2013, for Heartland) based upon increases in Heartland's qualified small business lending ("QSBL") over a baseline amount. Based upon increases in its QSBL through September 30, 2013, the dividend rate payable by Heartland was fixed in the first quarter of 2014 at 1.00% through March 15, 2016, but will increase to 9.00% if the SBLF funding has not been redeemed by March 16, 2016. Heartland has received all necessary regulatory approvals from the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve to redeem the Series C Preferred Stock. 

The terms of the Series C Preferred Stock also prohibit Heartland from paying dividends on its shares of common stock, or repurchasing such shares, to the extent that, after payment of such dividends or repurchases, Heartland's Tier 1 Capital would be less than $247.7 million. If Heartland fails to declare and pay dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock in a given quarter, then Heartland may not pay dividends on or repurchase any common stock for the next three quarters, except in very limited circumstances. If any Series C Preferred Stock remains outstanding on the tenth anniversary of issuance, Heartland may not pay any further dividends on its common stock or any other junior stock until the Series C Preferred Stock is redeemed in full. 

Dividend Payments 

In addition to the restrictions imposed under the SBLF, Heartland's ability to pay dividends to its stockholders may be affected by both general corporate law considerations, and policies of the Federal Reserve applicable to bank holding companies . As a Delaware corporation, Heartland is subject to the limitations of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), which allows Heartland to pay dividends only out of its surplus (as defined and computed in accordance with the provisions of the DGCL) or, if Heartland has no such surplus, out of its net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year. In addition, policies of the Federal Reserve suggest that a bank holding company should not pay cash dividends unless its net income available to common stockholders over the past year has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with its capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition. The Federal Reserve also possesses enforcement powers over bank holding companies and their non-bank subsidiaries to prevent or remedy actions that represent unsafe or unsound practices or violations of applicable statutes and regulations. Among these powers is the ability to proscribe the payment of dividends by banks and bank holding companies. 

The Bank Subsidiaries 

General 

All of the Bank Subsidiaries are state chartered, non-member banks, which means that they are all formed under state law and are not members of the Federal Reserve System. As a result, each Bank Subsidiary is subject to direct regulation by the banking authorities in the state in which it was chartered, as well as by the FDIC as its primary federal regulator.

Deposit Insurance 

The FDIC is an independent federal agency that insures the deposits, up to $250,000 per depositor, of federally insured banks and savings institutions and safeguards the safety and soundness of the commercial banking and thrift industries. 

As FDIC-insured institutions, the Bank Subsidiaries are required to pay deposit insurance premium assessments to the FDIC using a risk-based assessment system based upon average total consolidated assets minus tangible equity of the insured bank. 

The Dodd-Frank Act directed that the minimum deposit insurance fund reserve ratio would increase from 1.15% to 1.35% by September 30, 2020, and the cost of the increase will be borne by depository institutions with assets of $10 billion or more. The Dodd-Frank Act also provides the FDIC with discretion to determine whether to pay rebates to insured depository institutions when its deposit insurance reserves exceed certain thresholds. Previously, the FDIC was required to give rebates to depository institutions equal to the excess once the reserve ratio exceeded 1.50%, and was required to rebate 50% of the excess over 1.35% but not more than 1.50% of insured deposits. In October 2015, the FDIC proposed rules implementing the reserve ratio requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. Under the proposed rules, banks with assets of less than $10 billion would receive assessment credits for the portion of their assessments that contribute to the increase in the reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35%, and these credits would reduce the regular assessments of these banks by up to 2 basis points annually when their reserve ratio is at or above 1.40%. 

In addition, all institutions with deposits insured by the FDIC are required to pay assessments to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation, an agency of the federal government established to recapitalize the predecessor to the Savings Association Insurance Fund. Since December 31, 2013, the assessment rate was 0.01450% of total deposits. These assessments will continue until the Financing Corporation bonds mature in 2019. 

Supervisory Assessments 

Each of the Bank Subsidiaries is required to pay supervisory assessments to its respective state banking regulator to fund the operations of that agency. In general, the amount of the assessment is calculated on the basis of each institution's total assets. During 2015, the Bank Subsidiaries paid supervisory assessments totaling $902,000. 

Capital Requirements 

Like Heartland, under current federal regulations, each Bank Subsidiary is required to maintain the minimum Leverage Ratio, Tier1 Capital Ratio and Total Capital Ratio described under the caption "Heartland-Capital Requirements " &#32;above, and effective January 1, 2015, was required to comply with the enhanced capital requirements under the Basel III regulations, as well as the new Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio. The capital requirements described above are minimum requirements and higher capital levels may be required if warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profiles of individual institutions. For example, federal regulators regularly require new institutions to maintain higher capital ratios during the first few years after their formation, and may require additional capital to take adequate account of, among other things, interest rate risk or the risks posed by concentrations of credit, nontraditional activities or securities trading activities. 

Federal law also provides the federal banking regulators with broad power to take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of undercapitalized institutions. The extent of the regulators' powers depends on whether the institution in question is "adequately capitalized," "undercapitalized," "significantly undercapitalized" or "critically undercapitalized," in each case as defined by regulation. Depending upon the capital category to which an institution is assigned, the regulators' corrective powers include: (i) requiring the institution to submit a capital restoration plan; (ii) limiting the institution's asset growth and restricting its activities; (iii) requiring the institution to issue additional capital stock (including additional voting stock) or to be acquired; (iv) restricting transactions between the institution and its affiliates; (v) restricting the interest rate the institution may pay on deposits; (vi) ordering a new election of directors of the institution; (vii) requiring that senior executive officers or directors be dismissed; (viii) prohibiting the institution from accepting deposits from correspondent banks; (ix) requiring the institution to divest certain subsidiaries; (x) prohibiting the payment of principal or interest on subordinated debt; and (xi) ultimately, appointing a receiver for the institution. 

As of December 31, 2015: (i) none of the Bank Subsidiaries was subject to a directive from its primary federal regulator to increase its capital; (ii) each of the Bank Subsidiaries exceeded its minimum regulatory capital requirements under applicable capital adequacy guidelines; (iii) each of the Bank Subsidiaries was "well-capitalized," as defined by applicable regulations; and (iv) each of the Bank Subsidiaries subject to a directive to maintain capital higher than the regulatory capital requirements, as discussed below under the caption "Safety and Soundness Standards," complied with the directive. 

Liability of Commonly Controlled Institutions 

Under federal law, institutions insured by the FDIC may be liable for any loss incurred by, or reasonably expected to be incurred by, the FDIC in connection with the default of commonly controlled FDIC-insured depository institutions or any assistance provided 

by the FDIC to commonly controlled FDIC-insured depository institutions in danger of default. Because Heartland controls each of the Bank Subsidiaries, the Bank Subsidiaries are commonly controlled for purposes of these provisions of federal law. 

Anti-Money Laundering 

The Bank Secrecy Act, the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the "PATRIOT Act") and other related federal laws and regulations require financial institutions, including the Bank Subsidiaries, to implement policies and procedures relating to anti-money laundering, customer identification and due diligence requirements and the reporting of certain types of transactions and suspicious activity. 

Dividend Payments 

The primary source of funds for Heartland is dividends from the Bank Subsidiaries. In general, the Bank Subsidiaries may only pay dividends either out of their historical net income after any required transfers to surplus or reserves have been made or out of their retained earnings. 

The payment of dividends by any financial institution is affected by the requirement to maintain adequate capital pursuant to applicable capital adequacy guidelines and regulations, and a financial institution generally is prohibited from paying any dividends if, following payment thereof, the institution would be undercapitalized. As described above, each of the Bank Subsidiaries exceeded its minimum capital requirements under applicable guidelines as of December 31, 2015. 

As of December 31, 2015, approximately $112.5 million &#32;was available in retained earnings at the Bank Subsidiaries for payment of dividends to Heartland under the regulatory capital requirements to remain well-capitalized. Notwithstanding the availability of funds for dividends, however, the FDIC may prohibit the payment of any dividends by the Bank Subsidiaries. 

Transactions with Affiliates 

The Federal Reserve regulates transactions between Heartland and its subsidiaries. Generally, the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, limit lending and other "covered transactions" between the Bank Subsidiaries and their affiliates. The aggregate amount of covered transactions a Bank Subsidiary may enter into with an affiliate may not exceed 10% of the capital stock and surplus of the Bank Subsidiary. The aggregate amount of covered transactions with all affiliates may not exceed 20% of the capital stock and surplus of the Bank Subsidiary. 

Covered transactions with affiliates are also subject to collateralization requirements and must be conducted on arm&#8217;s length terms. Covered transactions include (a) a loan or extension of credit by the Bank Subsidiary, including derivative contracts, (b) a purchase of securities issued to a Bank Subsidiary, (c) a purchase of assets by the Bank Subsidiary unless otherwise exempted by the Federal Reserve, (d) acceptance of securities issued by an affiliate to the Bank Subsidiary as collateral for a loan, and (e) the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit by the Bank Subsidiary on behalf of an affiliate. 

Insider Transactions 

The Bank Subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions imposed by federal law on extensions of credit to Heartland and its subsidiaries, on investments in the stock or other securities of Heartland and its subsidiaries and the acceptance of the stock or other securities of Heartland or its subsidiaries as collateral for loans made by the Bank Subsidiaries. Certain limitations and reporting requirements are also placed on extensions of credit by each of the Bank Subsidiaries to its directors and officers, to directors and officers of Heartland and its subsidiaries, to principal stockholders of Heartland and to &#8220;related interests&#8221; of such directors, officers and principal stockholders. In addition, federal law and regulations may affect the terms upon which any person who is a director or officer of Heartland or any of its subsidiaries or a principal stockholder of Heartland may obtain credit from banks with which the Bank Subsidiaries maintain correspondent relationships. 

Safety and Soundness Standards 

The federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines that establish operational and managerial standards to promote the safety and soundness of federally insured depository institutions. The guidelines set forth standards for internal controls, information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, fees and benefits, vendor and model risk management, asset quality and earnings. In general, the safety and soundness guidelines prescribe the goals to be achieved in each area, and each institution is responsible for establishing its own procedures to achieve those goals. If an institution fails to comply with any of the standards set forth in the guidelines, the institution's primary federal regulator may require the institution to submit a plan for achieving and maintaining compliance. If an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan, or fails in any material respect to implement a compliance plan that has been accepted by its primary federal regulator, the regulator is required to issue an order directing the institution to cure the deficiency. Until the deficiency cited in the regulator's order is cured, the regulator may restrict the institution's rate of growth, require the institution to increase its capital, restrict the rates the institution pays on deposits or require the institution to take any action the regulator 

deems appropriate under the circumstances. Noncompliance with the standards established by the safety and soundness guidelines may also constitute grounds for other enforcement action by the federal banking regulators, including cease and desist orders and civil money penalty assessments. 

Branching Authority 

Each of the Bank Subsidiaries has the authority, pursuant to the laws under which it is chartered, to establish branches anywhere in the state in which its main office is located, subject to the receipt of all required regulatory approvals. 

Federal law permits state and national banks to merge with banks in other states subject to: (i) regulatory approval; (ii) federal and state deposit concentration limits; and (iii) state law limitations requiring the merging bank to have been in existence for a minimum period of time (not to exceed five years) prior to the merger. 

State Bank Investments and Activities 

Each of the Bank Subsidiaries generally is permitted to make investments and engage in activities directly or through subsidiaries as authorized by the laws of the state under which it is chartered. However, under federal law and FDIC regulations, FDIC-insured state banks are prohibited, subject to certain exceptions, from making or retaining equity investments of a type, or in an amount, that are not permissible for a national bank. Federal law and FDIC regulations also prohibit FDIC-insured state banks and their subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions, from engaging as principal in any activity that is not permitted for a national bank, unless the bank meets, and continues to meet, its minimum regulatory capital requirements and the FDIC determines the activity would not pose a significant risk to the deposit insurance fund of which the bank is a member. 

Incentive Compensation Policies and Restrictions 

In July 2010, the federal banking agencies issued guidance that applies to all banking organizations supervised by the agencies. Pursuant to the guidance, to be consistent with safety and soundness principles, Heartland's incentive compensation arrangements should: (1) appropriately balance risk and financial reward; (2) be compatible with effective controls and risk management; and (3) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by Heartland's board of directors. 

In addition, in March 2011, the federal banking agencies, along with the Federal Housing Finance Agency, and the Securities and Exchange Commission, released a proposed rule intended to ensure that regulated financial institutions design their incentive compensation arrangements to account for risk. Specifically, the proposed rule would require compensation practices for Heartland to be consistent with the principles described above. In addition, financial institutions with $1 billion or more in assets would be required to have policies and procedures to ensure compliance with the rule and would be required to submit annual reports to their primary federal regulator. The comment period has closed and a final rule has not yet been published; however, Heartland believes it is in compliance with the rule as currently proposed. 

The Volcker Rule and Proprietary Trading 

In December 2013, federal banking regulators jointly issued a final rule to implement Section 13 of the BHCA (adopted as part 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act), which prohibits banking entities (including Heartland and the Bank Subsidiaries) from engaging in proprietary trading of securities, derivatives and certain other financial instruments for the entity's own account, and prohibits certain interests in, or relationships with, a hedge fund or private equity fund. It also imposes rules regarding compliance programs. Commonly referred to as the "Volcker Rule," the final rule as originally adopted was effective on April 1, 2014 and would have required banking entities to conform their activities to its requirements by July 21, 2015. However, based upon announcements of the Federal Reserve Board in December 2014, certain key elements that require sale of investment in private equity and hedge funds will not be effective until July 21, 2017. Heartland does not believe that it engages in any significant amount of proprietary trading, as defined in the Volcker Rule, and believes that any impact of the Volcker Rule would be minimal. Heartland has reviewed its investment portfolio to determine if any investments meet the Volcker Rule's definition of covered funds. Based on the review, Heartland believes that any impact related to investments considered to be covered funds would not have a significant effect on its financial condition or results of operations. 

Federal Reserve Liquidity Regulations 

Federal Reserve regulations, as presently in effect, require depository institutions to maintain non-interest earning reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily NOW and regular checking accounts), as follows: (i) for transaction accounts aggregating $10.7 million or less, there is no reserve requirement; (ii) for transaction accounts over $10.7 million and up to $55.2 million, the reserve requirement is 3% of total transaction accounts; and (iii) for transaction accounts aggregating in excess of $55.2 million, the reserve requirement is $1.3 million plus 10% of the aggregate amount of total transaction accounts in excess of $55.2 million. These reserve requirements are subject to annual adjustment by the Federal Reserve. The Bank Subsidiaries are in compliance with the foregoing requirements. 

Community Reinvestment Act Requirements 

The Community Reinvestment Act imposes a continuing and affirmative obligation on each of the Bank Subsidiaries to help meet the credit needs of their respective communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, in a safe and sound manner. The FDIC and the respective state regulators regularly assess the record of each Bank Subsidiary in meeting the credit needs of its community. Applications for additional acquisitions would be subject to evaluation of the effectiveness of the Bank Subsidiaries' in meeting their Community Reinvestment Act requirements. 

Consumer Protection &#32; 

In July 2015, the Department of Defense issued a final rule amending regulations that implement the Military Lending Act. The Military Lending Act, among other things, imposes disclosure requirements and an interest rate cap for covered credit products &#32; (generally those offered to service members or their immediate family). The amended regulations, among other things, significantly expand the scope of the Military Lending Act to all credit products covered by the Truth in Lending Act ("TILA") and provide a safe harbor from compliance only when information from the Department of Defense database or from a nationwide consumer reporting agency is used to verify borrower status and indicates that the Military Lending Act does not apply. The amended regulations will increase the costs of compliance, both in terms of verifying borrower status and complying with all applicable requirements, if the Military Lending Act does apply. 

The CFPB has been publishing complaints submitted by consumers regarding consumer financial products and services in a publicly-accessible online portal. In June 2015, the CFPB also began publishing complaint narratives from consumers that opted to have their narratives made public. The publication of complaint narratives could affect the Bank Subsidiaries in the following ways: (i) complaint data might be used by the CFPB to make decisions regarding regulatory, enforcement or examination issues; and (ii) the publication of such narratives may have a negative effect on the reputation of those institutions that are the subject of complaints. 

The CFPB has issued proposed rules or is considering proposing rules with respect to a number of areas that could ultimately impact Heartland and the Bank Subsidiaries. In November 2014, the CFPB issued a proposed rule to regulate prepaid products &#32; which would, among other things, impose disclosure requirements, consumer liability limits and restrictions regarding prepaid products with overdraft services or credit features. However, at present, it does not seem likely the rule would cover bank products offered by the Bank Subsidiaries. In March 2015, the CFPB issued proposed rules regarding payday lending that would apply to payday loans, deposit advance products and certain other credit products. These proposed rules, among other things, would impose ability to repay determination requirements and rollover/reborrowing restrictions with respect to covered credit products. The CFPB has also announced it is considering proposing rules with respect to arbitration (which could ban or restrict consumer financial companies from using arbitration clauses in consumer agreements), overdraft services and debt collection. Until final rules are issued, it is not entirely clear whether and how these rules will ultimately impact Heartland and the Bank Subsidiaries. 

Mortgage Operations 

Each of the Bank Subsidiaries is subject to a number of laws and rules affecting residential mortgages, including the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act ("HMDA") and Regulation C and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ("RESPA") and Regulation X. Over the last year, the CFPB and other federal agencies have proposed and finalized a number of rules affecting residential mortgages. These rules implement the Dodd-Frank Act amendments to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, TILA and RESPA. The final rules, among other things, impose requirements regarding procedures to ensure compliance with "ability to repay" requirements, policies and procedures for servicing mortgages, and additional rules and restrictions regarding mortgage loan originator compensation and qualification and registration requirements for individual loan originator employees. These rules also impose new or revised disclosure requirements, including a new integrated mortgage origination disclosure that combines disclosures currently required under TILA and RESPA. 

Regulation C requires lenders to report certain information regarding home loans. In October 2015, the CFPB issued a final rule amending Regulation C which, among other things, revises tests for determining what financial institutions and credit transactions are covered under HMDA and imposes reporting requirements for new data points identified in the Dodd-Frank Act or identified by the CPFB as necessary to carry out the purposes of HMDA. The final rule requires more detailed information from lenders and requires lenders to deliver certain information about mortgage loan underwriting and pricing. 

&#160; 

Ability-to-Repay and Qualified Mortgage Rule 

Effective on January 10, 2014, Regulation Z was amended to require mortgage lenders to make a reasonable and good faith determination based on verified and documented information that a consumer applying for a mortgage loan has a reasonable ability to repay the loan according to its terms. Mortgage lenders are required to determine consumers&#8217; ability to repay in one of two ways. The first alternative requires the mortgage lender to consider the following eight underwriting factors when making the credit decision: (1) current or reasonably expected income or assets; (2) current employment status; (3) the monthly payment on the covered transaction; (4) the monthly payment on any simultaneous loan; (5) the monthly payment for mortgage-related 

obligations; (6) current debt obligations, alimony, and child support; (7) the monthly debt-to-income ratio or residual income; and (8) credit history. Alternatively, the mortgage lender can originate "qualified mortgages," which are entitled to a presumption that the creditor making the loan satisfied the ability-to-repay requirements. In general, a "qualified mortgage" is a mortgage loan without negative amortization, interest-only payments, balloon payments, or terms exceeding 30 years. In addition, to be a qualified mortgage, the points and fees paid by a consumer cannot exceed 3% of the total loan amount. Qualified mortgages that are "higher-priced" (e.g., subprime loans) have a rebuttable presumption of compliance with the ability-to-repay rules, while qualified mortgages that are not "higher-priced" (e.g., prime loans) are given a safe harbor of compliance. Heartland primarily originates compliant qualified mortgages. 

Risk Retention and Qualified Residential Mortgage Rule 

In October 2014, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve and four other federal regulatory agencies issued a final rule to implement amendments to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that impose risk retention requirements on asset-backed securities. The final rule generally requires a sponsor of an asset-backed securitization to retain not less than 5% of the credit risk of the underlying asset. Certain securitizations that are comprised of "qualified residential mortgages" are exempt from the risk retention requirements, with qualified residential mortgage defined to be consistent with the definition of qualified mortgages. The final rule for residential securitizations was effective December 24, 2015, and rules for all other categories of covered asset-based securitizations will be effective December 24, 2016. The requirements and impact of the final rules are still being assessed, but particularly since the Bank Subsidiaries primarily originate qualified residential mortgages, the operations of the Bank Subsidiaries will likely not be materially impacted by the final rule. 

Data Security 

In January 2015, new legislative proposals and administration efforts regarding privacy and cybersecurity were announced which, among other things, propose a national data breach notification standard. Legislation regarding data security with respect to security breach notifications and sharing cybersecurity threat information has also been proposed. In 2015, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council developed the Cybersecurity Assessment Tool to help institutions identify their risks and determine their preparedness for cybersecurity threats. New laws or guidance with respect to data security could impact card issuers and increase compliance costs related to credit card or debit card products. However, it is currently uncertain what (if any) impact these developments will have on the Bank Subsidiaries. 

Increased Supervision for Bank Holding Companies with Consolidated Assets of $10 Billion or More 

Heartland currently has total consolidated assets of approximately $7.69 billion . If Heartland&#8217;s assets increase and exceed $10 billion, Heartland will become subject to direct regulation by the CFPB, increased insurance assessments required to maintain the minimum deposit insurance fund and more accelerated implementation of increased capital requirements. 

Under the Durbin Amendment of the Dodd-Frank Act, which applies to banks and bank holding companies with $10 billion or more in assets, the Federal Reserve was required to establish a cap on the interchange fees that merchants pay banks for electronic clearing of debit transactions. The final rules of the Durbin Amendment were effective October 1, 2011, and, among other things, established standards for assessing whether debit card interchange fees received by debit card issuers were reasonable and proportional to the costs incurred by issuers and established maximum permissible interchange fees. 

On October 12, 2012, the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule that requires publicly traded U.S. bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more to establish enterprise-wide risk committees and to conduct annual company-run stress tests using data as of September 30 of each year and scenarios provided by the Federal Reserve. Bank holding companies with stress tests that indicate undue risk may be required to maintain an additional capital buffer and could cause the Federal Reserve to impose restrictions on proposed payments of dividends or stock repurchases. The capital conservation buffer requirements were phased in beginning in January 2016 and will be fully implemented by January 2019.
