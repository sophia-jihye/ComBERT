 ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Overview

&#160;

Amerityre incorporated as a Nevada corporation on January 30, 1995 under the name American Tire Corporation and changed its name to Amerityre Corporation in December 1999.

&#160;

Amerityre engages in the research and development, manufacturing, and sale of polyurethane tires. We believe that we have developed unique polyurethane formulations that allow us to make products with superior performance characteristics in the areas of abrasion resistance, energy efficiency and load-bearing capabilities, in comparison to conventional rubber tires. We also believe that our manufacturing processes are more energy efficient than the traditional rubber tire manufacturing processes, in part because our polyurethane compounds do not require the multiple processing steps, extreme heat, and high pressure that are necessary to cure rubber. Using our polyurethane technologies, we believe tires can be produced which last longer, are less susceptible to failure and are friendly to the environment. 

&#160;

Products

Our polyurethane material technology is based on two proprietary formulations; closed-cell polyurethane foam, a lightweight material with high load-bearing capabilities for low duty cycle applications, and Elastothane&#174;, a high performance polyurethane elastomer with high load-bearing capabilities for high duty &#160; applications. &#160; We are concentrating on three segments of the tire market: closed-cell polyurethane foam tires, polyurethane elastomer industrial tires and tires for agricultural applications.

&#160;

Closed-Cell Polyurethane Foam Tires

&#160;

We currently manufacture closed-cell polyurethane foam tires for bicycles, &#160; hand trucks, lawn and garden, wheelbarrow, personnel carriers, and medical mobility products. Our closed-cell polyurethane foam products are often referred to as flat-free because they have no inner tube, do not require inflation and will not go flat even if punctured. Our tires are mounted on a wheel rim in much the same way as a pneumatic tire. Our closed-cell polyurethane foam products are virtually maintenance free, non-toxic, provide extended tire life, and offer superior energy efficiency compared to rubber based tires. Closed cell foam tires and components accounted for 53% of fiscal 2016 revenues.

Polyurethane Elastomer Industrial Tires

&#160;

We have developed solid polyurethane industrial tires made of Elastothane&#174;. We currently produce over 20 sizes for Class 1, 4 and 5 forklifts. We have also developed polyurethane elastomer tires for scissor lifts. We believe our tires are superior to rubber tires as they are non-marking, more energy efficient, carry greater load weight, operate in lower temperature environments and have longer service life. Elastomer industrial tires accounted for 1% of fiscal 2016 revenues.

&#160;

Agricultural Tires

&#160;

Amerityre has developed three products for the agricultural tire market, flat-free pivot tires used in irrigation systems, seeder tires, and a hay baler tire. These products have successfully field tested and we developed strategies to increase the distribution of these products into the market. Agricultural tires accounted for 46% of fiscal 2016 revenues.

Raw Materials and Supplies

The two principal chemical raw materials required to manufacture our products are known generically as polyols and isocyanates. In addition, we purchase various chemical additives that are mixed with the polyols and isocyanates. We purchase our chemical raw materials from multiple suppliers to assure adequate supply and price competition.

In addition to the chemical raw materials, we purchase steel and plastic wheel components for use in tire and wheel assemblies. We purchase these components from domestic and overseas suppliers. 

&#160;

Operations/Manufacturing

&#160;

Our closed-cell polyurethane foam products are primarily manufactured utilizing multiple&#8211;stationed, carousel centrifugal molding presses. We produce closed-cell foam products by pouring a proprietary polyurethane formula into a mold, which then spreads out in the mold through centrifugal force. The molding process occurs by reacting monomeric diphenylmethanediisocyanate (MDI) with polyol and other chemicals. The chemical reaction causes a cross linking of the chemicals, which cures into a solid. The closed-cell polyurethane foam product is then removed from the mold and the process is repeated.

&#160;

All of our products are inspected prior to shipment to ensure quality. Any closed-cell foam products considered by our quality control personnel to be defective are disposed of through traditional refuse disposal services. 

Information Systems

&#160;

We use commercial computer aided design (CAD) and finite element analysis (FEA) software tools in the engineering and design of our products. This software allows us to integrate our proprietary manufacturing and production data with our design technology, enabling our engineering department to leverage our previous manufacturing and test results to predict the performance characteristics of new product designs and product improvements. For general business purposes, we use commercially available software for financial, distribution, manufacturing, customer relationships and payroll management.

&#160;

Sales, Marketing and Distribution

&#160;

Amerityre utilizes independent manufacturer representatives with tire industry experience to promote and sell our products. These representatives sell all of our products in a designated sales territory. These independent sales professionals complement our in-house sales department in Boulder City. 

We currently distribute our products directly from our manufacturing facility in Boulder City, Nevada. 

&#160;

Internationally, we have several distribution partners established in Canada, Australia, and Europe. We continue to seek additional international sales and marketing partners to expand the worldwide sales and distribution of our products.

Customers

&#160;

We have three customers who accounted for 21% of our sales for the year ended June 30, 2016 and two customers who accounted for 27% of our sales for the year ended June 30, 2015. In general, our customers are OEMs of lawn and garden products and outdoor power equipment, regional tire distributors, retail cooperatives, agricultural tire distributors, and retailers of lawn and garden products, bicycle tires and hand truck tires.

&#160;

Competition

&#160;

There are several companies that produce not-for-highway-use or light-use tires from polyurethane foam such as Greentyre, who manufactures in the UK; Carefree Tire, who manufactures in China; Marastar (a division of Carlstar), who manufactures in China, and; Custom Engineered Wheels and Krypton Industries, who manufacture in India. We believe our closed-cell polyurethane foam tires are superior to the polyurethane foam tires offered by the aforementioned competitors because our products contain millions of closed-cell versus open-cell air bubbles. The closed cell technology gives our products higher load bearing characteristics than competitor tire products that have open-cell polyurethane foam, while producing a ride quality comparable to a pneumatic tire.

&#160;

In addition to manufacturers of polyurethane foam tires, we compete directly with companies that manufacture and market traditional not-for-highway-use, low-duty pneumatic, semi-pneumatic, and solid tires made from rubber. The not-for-highway use tire industry historically has been highly competitive, and several of our competitors have financial resources that substantially exceed ours. In addition, many of our competitors are very large companies, such as Kenda, Taiwan; Maxxis International, Taiwan; Cheng Shin, China; and Carlstar. These competitors have established brand name recognition, distribution networks for their products, and have strong consumer loyalty to their products.

In the agricultural tire market, the market leader is Titan Tire USA, a global manufacture of agriculture pneumatic tire and wheel assemblies. In addition, Rhino Gator, BB Metal Works, and Mach II are North American competitors offering various types of flat free pivot tire solutions. There are various domestic and international competitors in the seeder tire and hay baler tire markets.

&#160;

Employees

&#160;

As of September 15, 2016, we had 18 full-time employees and 1 part-time employee, including 5 salaried and 13 hourly employees. We may hire temporary labor for manufacturing needs as required. We believe that we will be able to hire a sufficient quantity of qualified laborers in the local area to meet our employment needs. Our manufacturing process does not require special skills, other than training to our production techniques and specific equipment. Our employees are not represented by a labor union or a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.

Research and Development

&#160;

Our current research and development activities are focused primarily on product improvement (i.e., forklift tires and agriculture tires) and maintaining cost efficient manufacturing processes. We continue to investigate new &#8220;low cost&#8221; polyurethane foam formulations to supplement our premium formulations and increase the Company&#8217;s competitive position in specific market segments. Due to the Company&#8217;s limited resources, tire projects which are contingent on additional development, such as composite and automotive tires, have been put on hold and will be revisited at a later date when sufficient resources are available. Research and development expenses of an external testing nature were $58,319 and $23,058, for fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. All research and development expenses of the Company including internal and external expenses were $222,094 and $200,753, for fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively.
