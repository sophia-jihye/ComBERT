&#160; Corporate History 

&#160;

The Company was organized August 26, 2010 (Date of Inception) under the laws of the State of Nevada, as JA Energy. The Company was incorporated as a subsidiary of Reshoot Production Company, a Nevada corporation. Reshoot Production Company was incorporated October 31, 2007, and, at the time of spin off was listed on the Over the Counter Bulletin Board. In April of 2012 the Company removed the Shell Status. On November 21, 2016, the Company changed its corporate name to UBI Blockchain Internet, LTD, and changed the state of incorporation from the State of Nevada to the State of Delaware pursuant to a plan of conversion in connection with which the Company adopted a new certificate of incorporation under the laws of the State of Delaware.

&#160;

From August 2010 to May 2014 the Company was in the business of designing a suite of modular, self-contained, fully automated, climate controlled units for distributed production of energy. While some of these products were proven to be technologically viable, none were ever developed to the point where they were ready for introduction to the marketplace.

&#160;

At a meeting of the Stockholders of the Company on September 30, 2014 the Stockholders approved a resolution to urge the Board of Directors of the Company spin-off the Company&#8217;s assets and liabilities into a wholly-owned subsidiary and for each shareholder of the Company to receive a pro-rata share ownership of the spin-off company. Further, the spin-off subsidiary would operate as an independent entity separate from the Company with new management operating the current core business of the Company for the benefit of the original stockholders. Additionally, the effect of this action would allow the Company to explore new business opportunities without the burden of the liabilities currently on the books.

&#160;

On September 30, 2014, the Board of Directors passed a resolution to form a new company called Peak Energy Holdings (Peak) with each shareholder in the Company receiving one share of common of Peak for each share of common stock in the Company and one share of preferred stock of Peak for each share of preferred share of the Company.

&#160;

In November 9, 2014, JA Energy (the &#34;Company&#34;) entered into an Irrevocable Asset and Liability Exchange Agreement. The Agreement deals with the dividend spin-off of JA Energy's wholly owned subsidiary, Peak Energy Holdings. At the JA Energy annual shareholder meeting, held on September 30, 2014, the shareholders of the Company approved the transfer all of the assets and liabilities of the Parent into a wholly own subsidiary. The subsidiary will have the same characteristics and number of authorized and issued shares as the Parent, whereby all Preferred and Common shareholders in the Parent will receive a pro-rata stock dividend in the subsidiary that is equal to the number of shares they owned in the Parent on a one-for-one (1:1) basis. The major shareholders of the Company, entered into a separate agreement with regards to the dividend spin-off. They agreed to and put into effect the following points upon the dividend spin-off of the Peak Energy Holdings from JA Energy:

&#183; Mr. James Lusk [the largest debtor of JA Energy] transferred as of March 31, 2014, all assets and liabilities from JA Energy to the Subsidiary to the extent legally assignable. &#160;

&#183; Two of the major shareholder in JA Energy transferred all ownership of their Preferred and Common stock held in the subsidiary to Mr. James Lusk. &#160;

&#183; Mr. James Lusk transferred all of the common stock ownership he owned and controlled in JA Energy to the major shareholders. &#160;

&#183; Mr. James Lusk provided a notarized signed letter addressed to the Company and auditor that he agreed to transfer as of March 31, 2014, all assets and liabilities from the Parent to the Subsidiary to the extent legally assignable. &#160;

&#183; JA Energy warranted that any new liabilities incurred on the books of JA Energy after April 1, 2014 would not be transferred to the subsidiary. &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; JA Energy represented and warranted that there were no liabilities, actual or contingent, created in the subsidiary. Prior to the effective time of the transfer, the subsidiary would have no assets nor liabilities. &#160;

&#183; JA Energy warranted that since April 1, 2014, with the exception of the Preferred voting shares, no other shares were issued, awarded or pledged to be issued. The number of common shares issued and outstanding in JA Energy at March 31, 2014 were the same number of the shares issued at the date of transfer. &#160;

&#183; Upon the completion of the transfer of assets and liabilities shares were exchanged and the subsidiary was divested from JA Energy and now operates independent as a separate entity of JA Energy with its own management; &#160;

&#183; Mr. James Lusk took control of the Peak Energy Holdings, independent of JA Energy. &#160;

&#183; All Parties indemnified and held harmless the other Parties from and against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, resulting or arising from these transactions &#160;

The Agreement did not affect the other shareholders in the Company who maintained their share ownership of JA Energy, and have pro-rata ownership in Peak Energy Holdings following the dividend spin-off.

&#160;

On January 20, 2016, the Company effected a 1-for-200 reverse stock split of its outstanding common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the &#34;Reverse Stock Split&#34;). As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, each two hundred shares of the Company&#8217;s Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Reverse Stock Split were automatically combined into and became one share of common stock. No fractional shares were issued as a result of the Reverse Stock Split and any stockholder who otherwise would have been entitled to receive fractional shares received an additional share. Also, as a result of the Reverse Stock Split, the per share exercise price of, and the number of shares of common stock underlying our warrants outstanding immediately prior to the Reverse Stock Split were automatically proportionally adjusted based on the 1-for-200 split ratio in accordance with the terms of such warrants. Share and per-share amounts of the Company&#8217;s common stock and warrants included herein have been adjusted to give effect to the Reverse Stock Split. The Reverse Stock Split did not alter the par value of the Common Stock, $0.001 per share, or modify any voting rights or other terms of the common stock.

&#160;
