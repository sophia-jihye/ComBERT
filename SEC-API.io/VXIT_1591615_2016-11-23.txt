Introduction 

&#160;

Poverty Dignified, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 27, 2013, and is headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina. The Company established itself as a business incubation company developing micro-franchise business concepts designed to affect the individual, community and local economy in rural and peri-urban areas across the globe. My Power Solutions, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Poverty Dignified, Inc., was incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 13, 2014 as a franchise business opportunity with Franchise Disclosure Documents for franchise sales in both the United States and South African markets. Africhise, Inc., a Delaware Corporation, was formed on August 28, 2015 to be the franchise management arm of My Power Solutions, Inc's franchise operations in Africa. These entities are collectively referred herein to as Poverty Dignified, or the Company.

&#160;

The report of our independent registered public accounting firm on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended August 31, 2016 contains an explanatory paragraph regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. Our business will require significant amounts of capital to sustain operations and make the investments we need to execute our longer term business plan. Our net loss for the year ended August 31, 2016 was $860,204 and the deficit accumulated by us amounts to $8,244,672 from the period of inception through August 31, 2016. This raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying audited consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.

&#160;

In order to continue as a going concern and achieve a profitable level of operations, we will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management&#8217;s plan to continue as a going concern includes raising capital through increased sales and growing operations to profitability and through additional debt and/or equity financing. However, management cannot provide any assurances that we will be successful in accomplishing any of our plans of raising additional funds or increasing sales. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our management&#8217;s ability to successfully implement the plans described above. Management cannot provide any assurance that unforeseen circumstances that may occur at any time within the next twelve months or thereafter will not increase the need for us to raise additional capital on an immediate basis. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to raise funds in subsequent debt or equity financings, in which case the Company may be unable to meet its obligations.

&#160;

Our Corporate History and Background 

&#160;

We were incorporated in the state of Nevada on September 27, 2013 and commenced our planned principal operations shortly thereafter. The Company selected August 31 as its fiscal year end. To date, we have invested in developing our business plan, developing relationships with a variety of potential marketplaces, developing our charging station for our wholly owned subsidiary, My Power Solutions, Inc, and developing our franchise agreement. On March 30, 2015, we sold our first franchise. On June 18, 2015, our filing under Form S-1 was declared effective.

&#160;

Our Industry and Concept 

&#160;

Poverty Dignified, Inc. is a micro-franchise business incubation company servicing the energy needs of poor households in rural and peri-urban areas across the globe. These needs have presented many opportunities for innovative technologies that support the micro-franchise business environment as a means to solve essential problems and enhance the quality of life for millions of people. Two such technologies are phone charging and solar lantern and lighting systems. To this, end, Poverty Dignified&#8217;s wholly owned subsidiary, My Power Solutions, Inc., intends to provide such services. Poverty Dignified plans to position itself at the heart of the solutions these technologies present and build out innovative micro-franchise business concepts that empower individuals, communities and local economies. 

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s guiding principles are to provide economic, educational and faith-based opportunities and resources in order to offer solutions to the challenges faced by mankind in remote indigenous areas that need innovation and sustainability to move forward. 

&#160; &#160; 4 

&#160;

Economic opportunities: 

&#160;

In each remote area we plan to enter, one of our guiding principles is to create economic opportunity. In order to accomplish this we first must create jobs at the franchise level. By recruiting and training employees to operate a given franchise model, they will in turn spend that money locally stimulating the local economy. They will also learn entrepreneurial skills that will facilitate the birth of new, innovative business concepts that solve local problems, create new jobs and sustainability. We call this our &#8220;economic opportunity cycle&#8221;.

&#160;

Educational Opportunities: 

&#160;

In each remote area we plan to enter, one of our guiding principles is to create educational opportunity. We believe that change starts with education, and in remote areas education is a challenge. We see the solution being two-fold 1) Education Delivery and 2) Educational Content. To solve the delivery problem we provide mini-tablets that can be loaded with school curriculum, teaching series, books, music and entertainment. To solve the content problem we have created a library of materials to educate kids in remote areas from grades one to twelve. We also have various self-help and vocational teaching series as well as books, music and entertainment.

&#160;

Faith-Based Opportunities and Resources: 

&#160;

In each remote area we plan to enter, one of our guiding principles is to create faith-based opportunities and resources. In order to achieve this we seek to partner with faith-based organizations to compile download content, which will be loaded on to our mini-tablets that are in the hands of people in remote areas. We believe that by creating synergistic relationships within the faith-based community we can compile content that addresses the health and wellbeing of the whole man and foster innovative thinking. 

&#160;

Business Incubation 

&#160;

Business incubation is a business support process that accelerates the successful development of start-up and fledgling companies by providing entrepreneurs with an array of targeted resources and services. These services are usually developed, or orchestrated, by management and offered both in the business incubation environment and through its network of contacts. A business incubator&#8217;s main goal is to produce successful companies that will leave the program financially viable and freestanding. These &#8220;incubator graduates&#8221; have the potential to create jobs, revitalize neighborhoods, commercialize new technologies, and strengthen local and national economies.

&#160;

We hope that our business incubation process serves to nurture the development of entrepreneurial companies, helping them survive and grow during the start-up period, when they are most vulnerable. Our program is designed to provide clients with business support services and resources tailored to start-up companies. The general goals of our incubation program is to create jobs in a community, enhance the local entrepreneurial climate, retain businesses in a community setting that they know and understand, and to assist in building or accelerating growth and diversification in local economies.

&#160;

Critical to the definition of an incubator is the provision of management guidance, technical assistance and consulting tailored to young growing companies. We provide clients with access to technology support services, accounting, and assistance in obtaining the financing necessary for company growth. Clients are at the forefront of developing new and innovative technologies &#8211; creating products and services that improve the quality of lives in communities around the world.

&#160;

To lay the groundwork for a successful incubation program, we first invest time and money in a feasibility study. An effective feasibility study will help determine whether the proposed project has a solid market, a sound financial base and strong community support &#8211; all critical factors in the success of a start-up. Once established, our model business incubation programs commit to industry best practices such as structuring for financial sustainability, recruiting and appropriately compensating management with company-growing skills, building an effective board of directors, and placing the greatest emphasis on client assistance.

&#160;

&#160; 5 

&#160;

Two core principles characterize effective business incubation &#8211; 1) We aspire to have a positive impact on a community&#8217;s economic health by maximizing the success of the emerging companies with which we choose to work, and 2) We focus on building, into each project, a dynamic model of sustainable, efficient business operations with solid profitability.

&#160;

Business incubation program can be distinguished by our commitment to incorporate industry best practices with a commitment to the following:

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Institutionalizing the two core principles of business incubation.

&#160;

&#183; 

Obtaining consensus on a mission that defines the start-up company&#8217;s role in the community, and developing a strategic plan containing quantifiable objectives to achieve the program mission.

&#160;

&#183; 

Structuring solid financial sustainability by developing and implementing a realistic business plan that is embraced by an effective and realistic capitalization plan.

&#160;

&#183; 

Recruiting and building a solid management team capable of achieving the company&#8217;s mission and having the ability to ensure growth.

&#160;

&#183; 

Building an effective board of directors committed to the company&#8217;s mission and to maximizing management&#8217;s role in developing successful implementation strategies.

&#160;

&#183; 

Prioritizing management&#8217;s time to place the greatest emphasis on client assistance, including proactive advising and guidance that results in company success and wealth creation.

&#160;

&#183; 

Developing resources, methods and tools that contribute to the effective delivery of business assistance to the company in a way that addresses the developmental needs.

&#160;

&#183; 

Possessing a passionate desire to integrate the company&#8217;s activities into the fabric of the community and its broader economic development goals and strategies.

&#160;

&#183; 

Developing stakeholder support , including a resource network that supports the company&#8217;s mission and operations.

&#160;

&#183; 

Maintaining a management information system that collects statistics and other information necessary for ongoing evaluation, thus improving effectiveness and allowing the needs of the company to organically evolve.

&#160;

The Nexus of Business Incubation and Franchising: Context for Opportunity 

&#160;

PD&#8217;s business model takes advantage of and synergizes two existing business models &#8211; business incubation and franchising. These two are by no means new.

&#160;

In the case of business incubation, the first business incubator on record in the United States was established in 1959. Business incubation is still a growing sector and has evolved significantly since 1959. It has gone through three significant waves. The first wave (1950s-1980s) focused on infrastructure and economies of scale for entrepreneurs and SMEs by offering office space and common equipment. The second wave (1980s-1990s) added another focus, which was accelerating the learning curve by offering intense training and coaching programs as an example. In the third wave (1990s-present), we see the focus being placed on providing access to external resources, networks, and knowledge. Access to technical, professional, and financial networks is common.

&#160;

Best practices for successful business incubation programs include:

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Management of the program &#8211; 1) conduct a feasibility study before starting a program, 2) Develop a consensus-driven mission statement, 3) Collect outcome data, 4) Provide networking opportunities between client firms, 5) establish effective tools to deliver support services, 6) Build networks with area business service providers, and 7) market incubators beyond the entrepreneurial community, i.e., embed the program into the fabric of the host community.

&#160;

&#183; 

Key entrepreneurial support services &#8211; 1) business plan writing and business basics, 2) legal assistance, including but not limited to general legal services, intellectual property protection, incorporation or other legal business structure, and import and export requirements, 3) access to capital, 4) access to broadband high-speed Internet, 5) mentoring boards for clients with area business service providers, 6) close ties with higher education institutions where possible, 7) accounting and financial management services, 8) networking with other entrepreneurs, particularly other clients, 9) networking with area business community, 10) assistance in developing presentation skills, and 11) assistance with developing business etiquette.

&#160;

&#183; 

Additional key services &#8211; 1) technology commercialization assistance, 2) access to specialized equipment and laboratories at reduced rates, and 3) intellectual property management assistance.

&#160; &#160; 6 

&#160;

For an entrepreneur on his or her own, developing a business no less a franchise is difficult, time consuming, and daunting. This creates the perfect opportunity for PD. There are few, if any, business incubators that specialize in franchise development anywhere in the world.

&#160;

While the opportunity to serve entrepreneurs with business incubation is there, profitability is a questionable. Over and over again, business incubation programs have been proven to be unsustainable as a for-profit venture. The vast majority of successful business incubators are non-profit. While this is a challenge for PD, it is also an opportunity to innovate a sustainable model for business incubation. This is where focusing on business ideas that can be developed as franchises from the onset can be the game changer.

&#160;

PD is not just a for-profit enterprise, it is also a social enterprise. Social enterprises are those that use for-profit opportunities to do social good. In this case, PD strives to spur local economic development. PD has chosen a product/service mix that works to achieve its social mandate. Both business incubation and franchising models are seen as tools by governments and development agencies to enhance and catalyze economic development.

&#160;

PD synergizes the business incubation/franchising models by developing indigenous business ideas into micro-franchises to create wealth in local communities to eliminate poverty. A micro-franchise is a small or micro enterprise that can easily be replicated by following proven marketing and operational concepts. Micro-franchising differs from franchising in the following ways:

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Run by low-income micro-entrepreneurs as opposed to middle class or wealthy entrepreneurs

&#160;

&#183; 

Micro-franchisees work directly in the business, possibly as sole employees, whereas franchisees might own multiple outlets and not work in the business on a daily basis.

&#160;

&#183; 

Because micro-franchising is aimed at providing opportunities for the unemployed or highly underemployed, micro-franchises do not generally have a high price and loans might be underwritten by the micro-franchisor or a microfinance institution.

&#160;

&#183; 

Training offered to micro-franchisees covers the business operation and basic business skills, whereas training for franchisees tends to focus only on business specific training.

&#160;

&#183; 

Micro-franchises normally focuses on providing products and services that are essential or socially useful and NGOs may distribute their products through franchisees, whereas the product range for franchises range widely from essentials to luxury goods.

&#160;

Micro-franchise business models can be a better means of improving the livelihoods of low-income people in communities because, as opposed to a typical BOP business, micro-franchisees generally have access to suppliers and markets; lower business risk; a business model that emerged from a defined market need; and receive transfer of business tools, skills, and knowledge. PD&#8217;s model for synergizing business incubation and franchise, particularly micro-franchise, development involves identifying and incubating potentially profitable, sustainable business ideas that can be developed as micro-franchises like My Power Solutions.

&#160; &#160; 7 

&#160;

Market Overview 

&#160;

PD&#8217;s market focus is global, but specific to those regions that are growing the fastest overall and have fast growing middle classes. Therefore, Africa, Asia, India and Latin America will be regions the company will focus on.

&#160;

The initial region for market penetration is Africa. Africa has the fastest growing population and has maintained positive growth rates, exceeding the global and developed nation average, for over 10 years.

&#160;

Africa also has the fastest growing middle class. It has a young demographic with over 65% of Africa&#8217;s population being under the age of 40, with a significant number of this young population is under 21. Africa has hit its youth bulge.

&#160;

Unfortunately, much of the population lives in poverty with high unemployment, particularly among youth. In addition to the social and economic duress of poverty, this creates a governance issue as high rates of youth unemployment have the potential to cause youth movements that can de-stabilize communities and nations. Social, government, and even business entities in Africa are looking for ways to address the poverty and high unemployment and see spurring new entrepreneurs and supporting existing entrepreneurs as mechanisms to address the problems.

&#160;

The Company believes entrepreneurs in Africa face daunting challenges compared to other regions in the world with a lack of sufficient resources, skill, capital, and support services for them. It is PD&#8217;s belief that franchising and business incubation are seen as solutions to address these challenges.

&#160;

Concerning the relevance of business incubation in Africa, World Bank&#8217;s Info Dev says, &#8220;African policymakers are increasingly view business incubation as an important tool to unleash human ingenuity, enable competitive enterprises and create sustainable jobs. Business incubators can also be instrumental in developing new economic sectors.&#8221; Info Dev actually provides financial and technical support to business incubators across Africa and it is driving African Incubator Network (AIN).

&#160;

Concerning the relevance of franchising, the African Development Bank&#8217;s paper, &#8220;Study on Franchising Opportunities in Africa,&#8221; says that franchising can contribute to the Continent&#8217;s economic development by: 1) promotion of entrepreneurship, 2) transfer of technologies and know-how, 3) growth of small and medium enterprise sector, 4) creation of direct and indirect employment, 5) enhancement of foreign exchange earnings, and 6) contribute to poverty reduction. The paper also says that it is not only foreign-owned franchises, but also indigenous franchises and &#8220;branchises&#8221; (chain operations that are converted to franchise models), that provide significant opportunities to catalyze economic development.

&#160;

As an incubation company, PD aims to cultivate indigenous ideas into micro-franchise businesses, strategically designed to turn poverty into prosperity. These micro-franchises are also designed to serve the needs of communities, so they address both business and social goals. In Africa, business and social development are key imperatives that are interlinked due to the high poverty rate. 

&#160;

Client Overview &#160;

&#160;

The primary clients (direct and indirect) of PD&#8217;s incubation services are indigenous Africans. First, PD provides opportunities for African entrepreneurs with unique ideas for serving the needs of people and communities through business to see their idea transformed into a profitable, sustainable micro-franchise concept. Second, once the micro-franchise concept is developed local Africans are hired as managers/operators who have the opportunity to acquire their own franchise after completing a one- to two-year training, mentoring, and coaching program. Third, each micro-franchise location hires staff to manage the operations. Additional opportunities also exist with some micro-franchise concepts for mobile franchisees who extend the service reach of micro-franchise location further into the community geographically and socially.

&#160;

The demographics of these clients are diverse. Clients can be from any socioeconomic stratum. Clients can be male or female. Clients can be well-educated or with minimal education. Increasingly, PD also has secondary client of anyone who has a unique idea that can be developed into a sustainable, profitable business. In the near future, PD plans to leverage the infrastructure it has developed in Africa to broaden its client base and geographic reach.

&#160; &#160; 8 

&#160;

Model for Incubation 

&#160;

First of all, PD&#8217;s business model is for-profit. PD believes that companies can make money while solving social issues in communities. To date, the company has sold three franchises, one of which is currently operational.

&#160;

Second, PD&#8217;s model for incubation focuses more on process and support than a specific physical space that provides basic services. It is more attuned to the second and third waves of business incubation models that focus on accelerating the learning process and providing access to external resources, networks, and capital. However, PD&#8217;s incubation mode is comprehensive and addresses even physical infrastructure and equipment needs.

&#160;

Third, PD raises its own capital for incubated businesses through the public stock markets in the United States. Liquidity and exit strategies in Africa are low compared to other regions and investors want to be able to exit at their convenience. To achieve this, PD is a publicly traded company traded on the OTCBB.

&#160;

Fourth, PD plans to provide all the support to develop the idea into a micro-franchise concept, including laboratories for technology business ideas, professional services (e.g. accounting, legal, and marketing), corporate and business process and procedure development, board of directors development, training, coaching, and mentoring, and access to capital.

&#160;

Fifth, PD intends to act as a conglomerate structure in which incubated business and/or franchise is a subsidiary of PD. Poverty Dignified&#8217;s incubation model falls within two categories: 1) An existing business outside of the Poverty Dignified umbrella of wholly owned subsidiaries, that have not been able to capitalize their idea, concept or technology and desire to partner with Poverty Dignified through an incubation agreement; 2) An internal business idea, concept or technology birthed solely from within Poverty Dignified as a wholly owned subsidiary. When Poverty Dignified enters into an incubation agreement with a business outside of the Poverty Dignified umbrella of wholly owned subsidiaries, it seeks a significant minority share (up to 49%) and plans to hold that stake indefinitely. Such business will remain organizationally intact and will not be reorganized under the Poverty Dignified umbrella as a subsidiary. PD is more inclined to remain as a minority shareholder than to sell its position in the incubated businesses, but leaves its options open should selling its minority share and exiting be in the best interest of Poverty Dignified, Inc. and its shareholders. Management and affiliates will and can provide equity or other support to incubated businesses, but not independent of Poverty Dignified, Inc. When Poverty Dignified&#8217;s equity, support or resources are deployed in the incubation process, the company will be directly compensated for the resources consumed.

&#160;

Sixth, PD intends to become a part of the management team that develops and runs the incubated business not just a group that provides consulting and support. When PD brings in a business for incubation, it considers itself to be part of the business&#8217; internal team not a distant support structure.

&#160;

Seventh, each incubated business is intended to be designed and developed for franchising and scaling from the beginning.

&#160;

Incubation Process 

&#160;

The incubation process has two key objectives &#8211; developing a business model that will succeed in its market objectives, as well as reducing risk and increasing value in the enterprise for the stakeholders. PD&#8217;s incubation process starts with the indigenous idea and ends when the micro-franchise concept is rolled out after a pilot period. We expect this process to typically last from one to two years.

&#160;

While PD is open to any submission, PD has entry criteria for both the idea and the entrepreneur that will be followed. After the submission is made, PD plans to do a review of the idea and see if there is potential. Once the idea and entrepreneur are admitted into the PD process, the entrepreneur plans to go through an orientation and training period before the official incubation begins.

&#160; &#160; 9 

&#160;

The incubation process starts with refining the concept so that it can be tested. Some call this pre-feasibility. The goal is to build as much into the business model before additional resources are allocated for the micro-franchise concept development. The goal is to model a sustainable business venture with minimum cost.

&#160;

The next step is the proof-of-concept which seeks to implement the proposed business model on a small, but significant scale. This allows PD and the entrepreneur to test, evaluate, and refine the various components of the business model under realistic, but manageable conditions. The proof-of-concept phase could be anywhere from six months to two years, however, PD will begin the final development process during this period and do iterative improvements as feedback is received from the proof-of-concept location.

&#160;

If the proof-of-concept proves successful, the venture then goes through the final development process of refining the business model and building all the necessary components to operate the business at the corporate level and micro-franchise level. The proof-of-concept location remains in operation during this time so that PD and the entrepreneur can continue to test aspects of the business and receive feedback. During this period, discussions begin with external stakeholders like local partners to get initial feedback and insight about how to deploy in the local market.

&#160;

Once the venture has been deemed a valid &#8220;franchise,&#8221; PD begins the process of planning the in-country set-up, pilot, and full rollout. External suppliers and partners are engaged at this stage of the incubation process. This stage is expected to last three to six months and begins at least six months prior to the launch date of the micro-franchise concept.

&#160;

The pilot of the micro-franchise is expected to last from six months to a year, but after the first three months the regular rollout of locations will begin. Typically, the new micro-franchise concepts will launch with corporate branches/locations rather than micro-franchisees so that PD and the entrepreneur retain control while issues that may arise because of the &#8220;newness&#8221; of the micro-franchise concept can be addressed more efficiently and effectively. As the model matures, branches will be converted to micro-franchise locations and new micro-franchises will be available to interested parties.

&#160;

Our first microfranchise: My Power Solutions, Inc. 

&#160;

My Power Solutions, Inc. (&#8220;MPS&#8221;) was originally organized in the State of Nevada in 2014 and wholly owned by Poverty Dignified and is the first microfranchise proposed by the Company. On March 30, 2015, we sold our first franchise based on our Franchise and Trademark agreement for our prototype of the charging station in Africa designed by Poverty Dignified discussed below. As of the date of this filing, we have sold three franchises.

&#160;

According to our Franchise and Trademark Agreement, once a franchisee has been approved and the purchase complete with a signed Franchise and Trademark Agreement and payment of the franchise fee, the site selection process begins. From this point forward, we as a company have a legal responsibility to assist with this process. As stated in Article 2, Section 2.2 Selection of Location for New Business: &#8220;If this Agreement is for a new Business, you agree to propose a location for your Business in the Territory within 90 days after the Agreement Date. Your proposed location must conform to our site selection guidelines and requirements and is subject to our approval.&#8221; Currently our first franchisee is completing the site location process. The very act of approving a new franchisee places a legal responsibility on the company to fulfill all its responsibilities as a franchisor under the Franchise Disclosure Document, and set in operation events such as the training program. Once the site location has been approved, training begins as stated in Article 5, Section 5.1 Training Programs: &#8220;If you (or, if applicable, your Operating Partner) have not previously attended and successfully completed our initial training program, then prior to opening or operating your Business, you (or your Operating Partner) must attend and successfully complete an initial training program on the operation of a My Power Solutions Business.&#8221; Once training is complete, the franchise unit is setup and equipped according to Article 7, Operating Standards, which includes all products and equipment being ordered and delivered and involves our procurement team operating in their roles and responsibilities to ensure the franchise business opens successfully and on time. Operations officially commenced to fulfill our legal Franchisor responsibilities on March 30, 2015 with the sale of our first franchise. This franchise is now operational and we have sold a total of three franchises as of the date of this filing.

&#160;

&#160; 10 

&#160;

When Poverty Dignified started in the Kibera Slums, it started with a pilot program to prove the concept and test the model. From the success of the pilot program in the Kibera Slums, Poverty Dignified then designed and built, through its Research and Development, the full franchise business model and the prototype of the charging station that was then sent to Africa to scale and is in commercial operation. The My Power Solutions charging unit is a distinct business concept that brings electricity to developing regions of the world through the use of battery charging stations that are run on solar power. At the present time we determined that the most immediate viable markets for this service are the regions in Africa where approximately 600 million people are without conventional electricity facilities. Each My Power Solutions franchise consists of the operation of one charging container (&#8220;Charging Station&#8221;) located in a designated territory that will be granted to a franchisee in a franchise. The Charging Station has the capacity to charge up to 500 portable batteries at one time, through a solar powered charging station. Each customer of a My Power Solutions Charging Station buys a power package (&#8220;Power Package&#8221;) that includes two pocket-size portable batteries, LED diode lights, and an mp3 player. At the time that the customer purchases its Power Package it will purchase recharging and other services for a designated period of time. The service provided to the customer permits it to bring the batteries contained in the My Power Solutions Power Package to the My Power Solutions Charging Power station near where it lives in order to recharge the batteries. In most instances the customer will drop off one battery to be charged while retaining the other charged battery for use at its residence. The charged battery can drive the LED light and mp3 player for a designated amount of time before recharging is necessary. There may be other services offered to the customer at the My Power Solutions Charging Station.

&#160;

PD and MPS do not have any affiliates that offer franchises in any other lines of business or provide products or services to franchisees.

&#160;

We intend to offer qualified persons the right to own and operate a My Power Solutions franchise at an agreed upon location under our standard form Franchise and Trademark Agreement. Prospective franchisees for a My Power Solutions location must sign our standard form franchise application before signing the franchise agreement.

&#160;

We have developed and intend to make available to franchisees comprehensive business methods and systems for developing and operating a My Power Solutions unit, including technical information and expertise relating to authorized products and services we authorize, site selection criteria, sales, marketing and advertising programs and management information and techniques.

&#160;

This particular business is unique in that a franchisee can only operate a My Power Solutions in a developing region of the world that does not yet have access to conventional power sources like a conventional power grid. At the current time the only countries that we intend to offer My Power Solutions are the countries located on the continent of Africa, specifically South Africa and Kenya. There are no My Power Solutions that will be offered to operate in North America. Franchisee competitors will be electrical companies that offer conventional power to a customer&#8217;s home, and retailers that offer generators or other mobile power sources. We are not aware of any other franchises or businesses that offer the power stations that are the focus of our franchise system.

&#160;

Certain aspects of this offering may be regulated by the laws of the different countries where the My Power Solutions franchise units are to be located. From time to time we may enter into Area Development Agreements of the type contained in our draft franchisee application. Under this type of agreement, we will grant an exclusive right to a franchisee to develop a specific geographic area to place and operate My Power Solutions units in exchange for the payment by the franchisee of an area development fee in addition to the initial franchise fee and continuing royalties and advertising contributions. We have not yet granted any Area Development Agreements to any one or legal entity.

&#160;

We are in the process of negotiating a Master Franchise relationship with certain African nationals that will have the right also to develop My Power Solutions franchises in certain countries in Africa, specifically Kenya.

&#160; &#160; 11 

&#160;

The Purpose of My Power Solutions 

&#160;

Africa has a big problem with energy access. Of the close to 1.14 billion people on the continent less than 50% have access to electricity, especially in rural communities. Without it, people have to limit their activities in terms of quality and time. This affects education, productivity, cell phone usage, etc.

&#160;

My Power Solutions intends to provide lighting, cell phone recharging, and educational content in one package. The equipment includes portable lighting, mp3 player, and educational and informational audio and video content. The package includes daily battery recharges and new educational content each month. The solution is designed to be sustainable, affordable, portable, durable, simple to use, and convenient. Its target market is areas without electricity, particularly rural. This solution reduces the need for paraffin or candles, as well as reducing the need for kerosene, minimizing exposure to unhealthy and unsafe practices.

&#160;

We intend to place microfranchise stores in high-traffic locations in communities within walking distance of customers, so it is convenient for them to get battery recharges and customer support every day. This removes the loss of time, money, convenience, and productivity in having to go to a location that requires transport to access. Because of its portability, we believe a new store can be deployed quickly to areas without lighting. We currently have one operational franchise.

&#160;

We intend for each to store to hire indigenous people, providing jobs for twelve people. Our model calls for training and coaching of staff. We intend to provide store managers with entrepreneurial training, coaching and mentoring and the opportunity to graduate to owning their own micro-franchises. Also we intend to distribute 10% of the gross sales from each unit to re-investment initiatives in the local community. We have sold three franchises but have recognized revenues on only one. We do not expect to generate any significant revenues until the first or second quarters of fiscal 2017, of which there is no guarantee.

&#160;

We intend for the primary revenue generation for a My Power Solutions micro-franchise store to be selling the My Power Solutions starter kit, recharging batteries, and providing new media content downloads. In-country financial institutions will also provide loans with affordable payment plans.

&#160;

Africhise, Inc., a Delaware Corporation, was formed on August 28, 2015 to be the franchise management arm of My Power Solutions, Inc&#8217;s franchise operations in Africa. Africhise, Inc. is planning to succeed as a service oriented company, having the ability to grow by consistently improving and continuously enhancing its services to franchisees. By taking advantage of a use of franchising as a business strategy, Africhise, Inc. will have a distinct competitive edge in the African marketplace. Africhise, Inc. hopes to develop the capacity on the ground in Africa to provide guidance for successful franchise rollouts. Africhise, Inc. plans to develop a robust eco-system focused on providing the most efficient site selection, employee recruitment, training and operational oversight found anywhere in Africa. Africhise, Inc. had no operational activity in fiscal 2016.

The Market 

&#160;

We have commenced operations in South Africa and intend to deploy microfranchises in the country of Kenya, which offers:

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Kenya&#8217;s market-based economy enjoys some of the strongest industries in East Africa, including the financial and manufacturing, and the ICT industries. Nairobi and the Port of Mombasa are respectively the biggest city and port between Cairo and Johannesburg, making Kenya the commercial and transportation hub in East Africa.

&#160;

&#183; 

Although Kenya&#8217;s mineral resources are limited, the country has a potentially important source of high-value mineral commodities such as titanium. The larger East African region is now one of the fastest emerging oil and gas frontier regions in the world, with Kenya expected to become an oil producer in the near future.

&#160;

&#183; 

Kenya has a young, well-educated and English-speaking human resource pool (especially in the urban areas). Almost 70% of the 44.3 million are under 35 years old.

&#160;

&#183; 

The recent general elections and new constitution in 2013 have ushered in a new type of governance system that provides hope for political stability.

&#160;

&#183; 

The agricultural sector is the largest employer in Kenya, contributing 25.3 percent of GDP. The tourism industry in Kenya is not only the third largest industry, but is also one of the most successful of its kind in the world.

&#160;

&#183; 

The information communications technology (ICT) is one of Kenya&#8217;s fastest growing business sectors. The most noteworthy advancements include some of the highest Internet access rates across sub-Saharan Africa, as well as their leading value-added mobile services.

&#160; &#160; 12 

&#160;

Expected Milestones 

&#160;

The following are our expected milestones for the next 12 months:

&#160;

&#183; We sold our first franchise on March 30, 2015. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; In fiscal year 2016, we opened our first offices in South Africa and started franchise development in South Africa. Our first franchise unit is currently open and operational. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; By end of fiscal 2016, we had sold three franchises, with one of them being operational. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; In June 2017, we hope to have an additional fifteen franchise units open for a total of 18 units. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; In September 2017, we to hope to open an additional fifty franchise units for a total of 68 units. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; By December 2017, we hope have 100 total franchise units open in Africa. 

&#160;

We developed these milestones and the expected timeframes utilizing various factors. These factors include internal projections developed by our Director of Operations in Africa based on the status of the organizing activities in Africa, completion of our Franchise Disclosure Documents for the US, completion of our African Franchise Disclosure Document which allows us to sell franchises in Africa, combined with our knowledge that we have seen interest and received invitations to present our Franchise opportunity to organizations in the US who have verbally represented to us they are interested in multiple units for purchase, our Director of Operations in Africa is currently in negotiations to purchase multiple franchise Units in Africa, and our success in selling three franchises as of the date of this filing.

&#160;

Additionally, we have had some initial indications of interest from two companies and one government organization in Africa to discuss entering into a pilot program to include franchise locations in the nine provinces of South Africa. If those discussions lead to the installation of a pilot program, and the pilot and program is rolled out successfully, we estimate that between 81 and 270 additional franchise units could be added in the nine provinces.

&#160;

The projected milestones above are influenced by numerous factors that are both uncertain and also subject to revision as more information becomes available. Due to the uncertainty of the factors involved, the timelines and the actual sales of franchise units may be subject to unforeseen delays or may not occur at all.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

Our business model is one that has been primarily carried out by non-profit organizations. We believe we will have a competitive advantage by presenting a traditional non-profit model but encouraging profit and an entrepreneurial spirit. To date, we have been unable to identify direct, for profit, competitors.

&#160;

Because we are a for profit enterprise, we may not receive the same favor and treatment as our non-profit competitors. Therefore, we may find it more difficult to enter into countries or marketplaces. We may also be more expensive than our non-profit counterparts.

&#160;

Government Regulation 

&#160;

The Franchise Disclosure Requirement 

&#160;

Under the Federal Trade Commission&#8217;s (FTC) &#8220;Franchise Rule,&#8221; franchisors must provide prospective franchisees with certain information regarding the franchise. The Franchise Rule specifies the form and content of the disclosures a franchisor must give. The disclosures are shown in a &#8220;Franchise Disclosure Document,&#8221; or an &#8220;FDD.&#8221; The predecessor of the FDD was the &#8220;Uniform Franchise Offering Circular,&#8221; or the &#8220;UFOC.&#8221; The Franchise Rule also specifies the timing of delivery of the FDD. 

&#160;

The FDD must disclose facts about the franchisor, the franchise transaction, and the franchise documents. These facts are consolidated into sections of the FDD called &#8220;Items.&#8221; The FDD must contain 23 Items, including:

&#160;

&#183; 

a description of the franchisor and any parents, predecessors, and affiliates;

&#183; 

profiles of key management and staff personnel, and their business experience;

&#183; 

the franchisor&#8217;s litigation and bankruptcy history;

&#183; 

initial and ongoing fees required to operate the franchised business;

&#183; 

the amount of the franchisee&#8217;s initial investment;

&#183; 

restrictions on the franchisee&#8217;s purchases of goods and services;

&#183; 

the franchisee&#8217;s obligations;

&#183; 

financing, if any, that the franchisor may offer prospective franchisees;

&#183; 

assistance the franchisor provides;

&#183; 

the parties&#8217; territorial rights and obligations;

&#183; 

the intellectual property, like trademarks and copyrights, associated with the franchise;

&#183; 

renewal and termination provisions;

&#183; 

information about franchised and company-owned outlets; and

&#183; 

audited financial statements.

&#160;

There are some exemptions where the franchisor does not have to comply with the Franchise Rule when selling a franchise. These exemptions include:

&#160;

&#183; 

Minimum payment exemption - where required payments to a franchisor total less than $500 during the first six months of operation;

&#183; 

Fractional franchise exemption - where the franchisee&#8217;s management already has experience in the business being franchised and the sales of the franchise will be 20% or less of the franchisee&#8217;s revenues;

&#183; 

Large franchise investment exemption - where the investment in the franchise is at least $1 million, excluding the cost of land and franchisor-provided financing; and

&#183; 

Large franchisee exemption - where the franchisee is likely to be a particularly sophisticated business operator.

&#160;

&#160;

State Franchise Law 

&#160;

While every franchise business is subject to the franchise rules laid out by the FTC, franchises are also subject to state franchise laws and regulations. While the FTC franchise rule is aimed at all types of franchises, many state regulations are industry-specific. Further, franchise law is not a completely separate body of law, since it also involves other state laws such as trademark, intellectual property, and commercial laws. This means that there can be many different nuances between franchise laws from state to state.

&#160;

Some states have comprehensive franchise regulations. The franchise laws in these states usually require the franchisor to register with the state government. While the FTC rule states that a FDD must be given to the franchisee, many states with comprehensive franchise laws will have further rules on what must be provided to a potential franchisee. Various states may also require the franchisor to file the necessary documents with the state. States with comprehensive franchise laws will also generally review the franchisor's financial information as well as any documents it plans to give to a potential franchisee.

&#160;

A primary intention of these high-regulation states is to reduce fraudulent business practices. A state can deny the registration of a franchise business if it determines that franchise documents contain false or misleading information. These states may also deny registration if there are circumstances in which selling the franchise would be deceptive in some manner. The FTC website has information about which states currently have registration or notice requirements.

&#160;

There are other various franchise laws that apply in certain states. Many states have laws that regulate the relationship between the franchisor and the franchisee, called franchise relationship laws. These relationship laws typically require, for example, that the franchisor have &#8220;good cause&#8221; in order to refuse to renew a franchise contract with the franchisee. &#160; 

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of November 23, 2016, we have six full time employees. We plan to use consultants, attorneys, accountants, and technology personnel, as necessary and do not plan to engage any additional full-time employees in the near future. We believe the use of non-salaried personnel allows us to expend our capital resources as a variable cost as opposed to a fixed cost of operations. In other words, if we have insufficient revenues or cash available, we are in a better position to only utilize those services required to generate revenues as opposed to having salaried employees. We may hire marketing and online employees based on the projected size of the market and the compensation necessary to retain development employees.

&#160;

Legal Proceedings 

&#160;

In the normal course of our business, we may periodically become subject to various lawsuits. However, there are currently no legal actions pending against us, or, to our knowledge, are any such proceedings contemplated.

&#160;

Corporate Information 

&#160;

Our principal office is located at 10617 Kettering Drive, Suite 219, Charlotte, North Carolina, 28226. Our telephone number is (719) 761-1869.
