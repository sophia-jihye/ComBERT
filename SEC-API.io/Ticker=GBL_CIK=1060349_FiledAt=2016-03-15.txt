 ITEM 1: &#160; BUSINESS 

Unless we have indicated otherwise, or the context otherwise requires, references in this report to &#8220;GAMCO Investors, Inc.,&#8221; the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;GBL,&#8221; &#8220;Gabelli,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221; or similar terms are to GAMCO Investors, Inc., its predecessors and its subsidiaries.

Overview

GAMCO Investors, Inc. (New York Stock Exchange (&#8220;NYSE&#8221;): GBL), a company incorporated under the laws of Delaware, is a widely-recognized provider of investment advisory services to open and closed-end funds, institutional and private wealth management investors principally in the United States. We generally manage assets on a discretionary basis and invest in securities through various investment styles. Our revenues are based primarily on assets under management (&#8220;AUM&#8221;) and to a lesser extent, incentive fees.

&#160;

Since our inception in 1977, we are identified with our research driven approach to equity investing and our proprietary Private Market Value (PMV) with a Catalyst&#8482; stock selection process. Over the last 38 years, the firm has generated over $22.9 billion in investment returns for our institutional and private wealth management clients.

&#160;

Following the spin-off (&#8220;Spin-off&#8221;) of Associated Capital Group, Inc. (&#8220;AC&#8221;) on November 30, 2015, as of December 31, 2015, we had $38.7 billion of AUM principally through our two registered investment advisers: GAMCO Asset Management Inc. (&#8220;Institutional and Private Wealth Management&#8221;) and Gabelli Funds, LLC (&#8220;Funds&#8221;). G.distributors, LLC (&#8220;G.distributors&#8221;) acts as an underwriter and distributor of our open-end funds.

Our AUM are organized into three groups:

&#160;

&#9679; Institutional and Private Wealth Management: We provide advisory services to a broad range of investors, including corporate retirement plans, foundations, endowments, jointly-trusteed plans and public funds, private wealth clients and also serve as sub-advisor to third party investment funds including registered investment companies (&#8220;Institutional and Private Wealth Management&#8221;). On December 31, 2015, we had $16.8 billion of Institutional and Private Wealth Management AUM. 

&#9679; Open and Closed-End Funds: We provide advisory services to twenty-one open-end funds and fourteen closed-end funds under Gabelli, GAMCO and Comstock brands (collectively, the &#8220;Funds&#8221;). The Funds had $21.8 billion of AUM on December 31, 2015. Additionally, we provide administrative services to seven open-end funds, with AUM of $1.2 billion on December 31, 2015, under the TETON Westwood brand. 

&#9679; SICAV: We provide advisory services to one fund under the GAMCO brand, the GAMCO International SICAV (the &#8220;SICAV&#8221;). The SICAV has two sub-fund strategies, the GAMCO Merger Arbitrage Fund and the GAMCO All Cap Value Fund. The GAMCO All Cap Value strategy had $37 million of AUM on December 31, 2015. The GAMCO Merger Arbitrage strategy is managed by AC. 

GBL is a holding company incorporated in April 1998 in advance of our initial public offering (&#8220;Offering&#8221;) in February 1999. GGCP Holdings, LLC, a subsidiary of GGCP, Inc. owns a majority of the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock (&#8220;Class B Stock&#8221;) of GBL. Such ownership represented approximately 91% of the combined voting power of the outstanding common stock and approximately 62% of the equity interest on December 31, 2015. Gabelli Securities, Inc. (&#8220;GSI&#8221;), a majority controlled subsidiary of AC, owns 4,393,055 shares of Class A Common Stock (&#8220;Class A Stock&#8221;) representing approximately 15% of the equity interest and approximately 2% of the combined voting power on December 31, 2015. GGCP, Inc. is majority-owned by Mr. Mario J. Gabelli (&#8220;Mr. Gabelli&#8221;). AC is majority-owned by GGCP Holdings, LLC. Accordingly, Mr. Gabelli is deemed to control GBL.

Our principal executive offices are located at One Corporate Center, Rye, New York 10580. Our telephone number is (914) 921-3700. We post or provide a link on our website, www.gabelli.com , to the following filings as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;Commission&#8221; or &#8220;SEC&#8221;): our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All such filings on our website are available free of charge.

During 2015, we returned $34.7 million to shareholders through dividends and our stock buyback program. We paid $7.5 million, or $0.28 per share, in cash dividends to our common shareholders and repurchased 426,628 shares at an average investment of $63.85 per share or $27.2 million (413,228 at an average investment of $64.86 per share prior to the distribution of AC on November 30, 2015 and 13,400 shares at an average price of $32.56 following the distribution of AC).

Since the Offering, we have returned to shareholders $914.3 million in total, of which $486.3 million was in the form of dividends and $428.0 million was through stock buybacks of 9,552,653 shares at an average investment of $44.81 per share. 9,539,253 of these shares were purchased prior to the spin-off of AC to GBL shareholders. The December 31, 2015 closing prices of GBL and AC shares on the NYSE were $31.04 and $30.50, respectively.

On March 20, 2009, we distributed our ownership in Teton, the advisor to the TETON Westwood funds, to our shareholders. At the time of the distribution the stock price of Teton was $2.75 per share. At December 31, 2015 the stock price of Teton was $49.00 per share.

On November 30, 2015, we distributed our ownership in Associated Capital Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries along with certain cash and other assets, to our shareholders. AC owns and operates, directly or indirectly, the alternatives and the institutional research businesses previously owned and operated by GBL. Subsequent to the Spin-off, GAMCO no longer consolidates the financial results of AC for the purposes of its own financial reporting and the historical financial results of AC have been reflected in the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations for all periods presented within this report. Historical AUM have similarly been adjusted to remove AUM managed by AC.

Business Strategy

&#160;

Our business strategy targets global growth of the franchise through continued leveraging of our proven asset management strengths including our brands, long-term performance record, diverse product offerings and experienced investment, research and client relationship professionals. In order to achieve performance and growth in AUM and profitability, we are pursuing a strategy which includes the following key elements:

&#9679; Gabelli &#8220;Private Market Value (PMV) with a Catalyst TM &#8221; Investment Approach. While we have expanded our investment product offerings, our &#8220;value investing&#8221; approach remains the core of our business. This method is based on and has evolved from the value investing principles articulated by Graham &#38; Dodd in 1934 and enhanced by Roger Murray and Bruce Greenwald, and has been further augmented by Mr. Gabelli, CFA, with his development of Private Market Value (PMV) with a Catalyst TM &#160; value investment methodology. 

Private Market Value (PMV) with a Catalyst TM investing is a disciplined, research-driven approach based on intensive security analysis. In this process, we generally select stocks whose intrinsic value, based on our estimate of current asset value and future growth and earnings power, is significantly different from the value reflected in the public market. We then calculate the stock&#8217;s PMV, which is defined as the price an informed industrial buyer would likely pay to acquire the business.

&#9679; Establishing Relationship Offices. We have nine offices including New York, Chicago, Greenwich, London, Palm Beach, Reno, Shanghai, St. Louis and Tokyo. We will continue to evaluate adding additional offices throughout the world. 

&#9679; Incentive Fees. Since a growing percentage of the firm's revenues may be directly linked to performance-based fees (largely recognized in the fourth quarter), this may increase the variability of our revenues and profits. As of December 31, 2015, approximately $2.7 billion of our AUM are managed on a performance fee basis including $1.6 billion of Institutional and Private Wealth Management assets, $729 million of preferred issues of closed-end funds and $364 million in The GDL Fund. 

&#9679; Expanding Mutual Fund Distribution. We continue to expand our distribution network primarily through national and regional brokerage firms and have developed additional classes of shares for most of our mutual funds for sale through these firms and other third party distribution channels. We have increased our wholesaling efforts to market the multi-class shares, which have been designed to meet the needs of investors who seek advice through financial consultants. 

&#9679; Increasing Presence in Private Wealth Management Market. Our private wealth management business focuses, in general, on serving clients who have established an account relationship of $2.5 million or more with us. According to industry estimates, the number of households with over $2.5 million in investable assets will continue to grow, subject to ups and downs in the equity and fixed income markets. With our 38-year history of serving this segment, long-term performance record, customized portfolios tax-sensitive investment strategy, brand name recognition and broad array of product offerings, we believe that we are well-positioned to capitalize on the growth opportunities in this market. 

&#9679; Increasing Marketing for Institutional and Private Wealth Management. The Institutional and Private Wealth Management business was principally developed through direct marketing channels. We plan to augment our institutional sales force through the addition of staff to market directly to the consultant community as well as through our traditional marketing channels. 

&#9679; Attracting and Retaining Experienced Professionals. We offer significant variable compensation that provides opportunities to our staff. The ability to attract and retain highly-experienced investment and other professionals with a long-term commitment to us and our clients has been, and will continue to be, a significant factor in our long-term growth. 

&#9679; Hosting of Institutional Investor Symposiums. We have a tradition of sponsoring institutional investor symposiums that bring together prominent portfolio managers, members of academia and other leading business professionals to present, discuss and debate current issues and topics in the investment industry. These symposiums have included:

&#8220;The Role of Hedge Funds as a Way of Generating Absolute Returns&#8221;

&#8220;Active vs. Passive Stock Selection&#8221;

&#160;

&#9679; Capitalizing on Acquisitions, Alliances and Lift-outs. We intend to selectively and opportunistically pursue acquisitions, alliances and lift-outs that will broaden our product offerings and add new sources of distribution. On October 1, 1999, we completed our alliance with Mathers and Company, Inc. and now act as investment advisor to the GAMCO Mathers Fund, and in May 2000, we added Comstock Partners Funds, Inc., (renamed Comstock Funds, Inc.). The Mathers and Comstock funds are part of our Non-Market Correlated mutual fund product line. In November 2002, we completed our alliance with Woodland Partners LLC, a Minneapolis-based investment advisor focused on investing in small capitalization companies. On March 11, 2008, Gabelli Funds, LLC (&#8220;Funds Advisor&#8221;) assumed the role of investment advisor to the AXA Enterprise Mergers and Acquisitions Fund, subsequently renamed Gabelli Enterprise Mergers and Acquisitions Fund, a fund that had been sub-advised by GAMCO since the fund&#8217;s inception on February 28, 2001. On August 1, 2010, the clients of Florida-based NMF Asset Management became part of the Institutional and Private Wealth Management operation of GAMCO Asset Management Inc. (&#8220;GAMCO Asset&#8221;). On November 2, 2015, the investment team of Dinsmore Capital, a specialist in convertible bond investing and formerly the manager of The Bancroft Fund and the Ellsworth Growth &#38; Income Fund joined Gabelli Funds. 

We believe that our growth to date is traceable to the following factors:

&#9679; Strong Industry Fundamentals: According to data compiled by the U.S. Federal Reserve, the investment management industry has grown faster than more traditional segments of the financial services industry, including the banking and insurance industries. Since GBL began managing assets for institutional and private wealth management clients in 1977, world equity markets have grown at a 10.2% compound annual growth rate through December 31, 2015 to approximately $64.6 trillion (a) . The U.S. equity market comprises about $23.5 trillion (a) or roughly 36% of world equity markets. We believe that demographic trends and the growing role of money managers in the placement of capital compared to the traditional role played by banks and life insurance companies will result in continued growth of the investment management industry. 

&#9679; Long-Term Performance: &#160; We have a superior long-term record of achieving relatively high returns for our Institutional and Private Wealth Management clients. We believe that our performance record represents a competitive advantage and a recognized component of our franchise. 

&#9679; Stock Market Gains: &#160; Since we began managing for institutional and private wealth management clients in 1977, our traditional value-oriented Institutional and Private Wealth Management composite has earned a compound annual return of 16.2% gross and 15.3% net of fees versus a compound annual return of 11.5% for the &#160; S&#38;P 500 through December 31, 2015. For 2015, the GAMCO composite declined 5.5% gross and 6.0% net of fees versus a gain of 1.4% for the S&#38;P 500. 

&#9679; Widely-Recognized &#8220;Gabelli&#8221; and &#8220;GAMCO&#8221; Brand Names: For much of our history, our portfolio managers and investment products have been featured in a variety of financial print media, including both U.S. and international publications such as The Wall Street Journal, Financial Times, Money Magazine, Barron's, Fortune, Business Week, Nikkei Financial News, Forbes Magazine, Consumer Reports and Investor's Business Daily . We also underwrite publications written by our investment professionals, including Deals&#8230;Deals&#8230;and More Deals, which examines the history of merger arbitrage and Global Convertible Investing: The Gabelli Way , a comprehensive guide to effective investing in convertible securities. 

&#9679; Diversified Product Offerings: Since the inception of our investment management activities, we have sought to expand the breadth of our product offerings. We currently offer a wide spectrum of investment products and strategies, including product offerings in U.S. equities, U.S. fixed income, global and international equities, and convertible securities. 

Business Description

Our AUM's are clustered in two groups: Institutional and Private Wealth Management and Funds.

Institutional and Private Wealth Management: At December 31, 2015, we had $16.8 billion of AUM in approximately 1,800 Institutional and Private Wealth Management accounts, representing 43.5% of our total AUM. The Private Wealth Management clients &#8211; defined as individuals generally having minimum investable assets of $5 million comprised approximately 79% of the total number of management accounts and approximately $4.9 billion, or 29%, of the Institutional and Private Wealth Management assets as of December 31, 2015. We believe that Private Wealth Management clients for taxable portion of their assets are attracted to us by our returns and the tax efficient nature of the underlying investment process. As of December 31, 2015, institutional client accounts represented approximately $6.8 billion, or 41%, of the Institutional and Private Wealth Management assets and 9% of the accounts. Foundation and endowment fund assets represented 11% of the number of Institutional and Private Wealth Management accounts and approximately $1.6 billion, or 10%, of the Institutional and Private Wealth Management AUM. The sub-advisory clients, (where we act as sub-advisor to third party investment funds) held approximately $3.4 billion, or 20%, of total Institutional and Private Wealth Management assets with 1% of the total number of accounts.

&#160;

The ten largest Institutional and Private Wealth Management relationships comprised approximately 41% of GAMCO Asset Management AUM and approximately 18% of our total AUM and approximately 23% of GAMCO Asset Management revenues and approximately 7% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015.

&#160;

In general, our Institutional and Private Wealth Management AUM are managed to meet the specific needs and objectives of each client by utilizing investment strategies that are within our areas of expertise: &#8220;all cap value&#8221;, &#8220;large cap value&#8221;, &#8220;small cap value&#8221;, &#8220;large cap growth&#8221;, &#8220;international growth&#8221; and &#8220;convertible&#8221;. 

Investment advisory agreements for our Institutional and Private Wealth Management clients are typically subject to termination by the client without penalty on 30 days&#8217; notice or less.

We market our open-end funds primarily through third party distribution programs, including no-transaction fee (&#8220;NTF&#8221;) programs, and have developed additional share classes for many of our funds for distribution through additional third party distribution channels. At December 31, 2015, third party distribution programs accounted for approximately 80% of all assets in open-end equity funds. At December 31, 2015, approximately 20% of our AUM in open-end, equity funds was sourced through direct sales relationships.

Additional Information on Mutual Funds

Through Funds Advisor, we act as advisor to all of the Funds, except with respect to the GAMCO Mathers Fund for which GAMCO Asset Management Inc. act as the advisor.

Shareholders of the open-end funds are allowed to exchange shares among the same class of shares of the other open-end funds as economic and market conditions and investor needs change at no additional cost. However, as noted below, certain open-end funds impose a 2% redemption fee on shares redeemed within seven days or less after a purchase. We periodically introduce new funds designed to complement and expand our investment product offerings, respond to competitive developments in the financial marketplace and meet the changing needs of investors.

&#160;

Our marketing efforts for the open-end funds are currently focused on increasing the distribution and sales of our existing funds as well as creating new products for sale through our distribution channels. We believe that our marketing efforts for the funds will continue to generate additional revenues from investment advisory fees. We had traditionally distributed most of our open-end funds by using a variety of direct response marketing techniques, including telemarketing and advertising, and as a result we maintain direct relationships with many of our no-load open-end fund shareholders. Beginning in late 1995, we expanded our product distribution by offering several of our open-end funds through third party distribution programs, including NTF programs. In 1998 and 1999, we further expanded these efforts to include substantially all of our open-end funds in third party distribution programs. Approximately 20% of the AUM in the open-end equity funds are still attributable to our direct response marketing efforts. Third party distribution programs have become an increasingly important source of asset growth for us. Of the $13.8 billion of AUM in the open-end equity funds as of December 31, 2015, approximately 80% were generated through third party distribution programs. We are responsible for paying the service and distribution fees charged by many of the third party distribution programs, although a portion of such service fees under certain circumstances are payable by the funds. The multi-class shares are available in all of the Gabelli Funds, with the exception of the Gabelli Capital Asset Fund and the GAMCO Mathers Fund. We believe that the use of multi-class shares will expand the distribution of our open-end funds into the advised sector of the mutual fund investment community. During 2003, we introduced Class I shares, which are no-load shares with higher minimum initial investment and without distribution fees available directly through G.distributors or brokers that have entered into selling agreements with respect to Class I shares. The no-load shares are designated as Class AAA shares and are available for new and current investors. In general, distribution through third party programs has greater variable cost components and lower fixed cost components than distribution through our traditional direct sales methods.

We provide investment advisory and management services pursuant to an investment management agreement with each fund. The investment management agreements with the funds generally provide that we are responsible for the overall investment and administrative services, subject to the oversight of each fund's Board of Directors or Trustees and in accordance with each fund's fundamental investment objectives and policies. The investment management agreements permit us to enter into separate agreements for administrative and accounting services on behalf of the respective funds.

Our affiliated advisors provide the funds with administrative services pursuant to the management contracts. Such services include, without limitation, supervision of the calculation of net asset value, preparation of financial reports for shareholders of the funds, internal accounting, tax accounting and reporting, regulatory filings and other services. Most of these administrative services are provided through sub-contracts with independent third parties. Transfer agency and custodial services are provided directly to the funds by independent third parties.

Our funds&#8217; investment management agreements may continue in effect from year to year only if specifically approved at least annually by (i) the fund's Board of Directors or Trustees or (ii) the fund's shareholders and, in either case, the vote of a majority of the fund's directors or trustees who are not parties to the agreement or &#8220;interested persons&#8221; of any such party, within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940 as amended (the &#8220;Company Act&#8221;). Each fund may terminate its investment management agreement at any time upon 60 days' written notice by (i) a vote of the majority of the Board of Directors or Trustees cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such termination or (ii) a vote at a meeting of shareholders of the lesser of either 67% of the voting shares represented in person or by proxy (if at least 50% of the shares are present at the meeting) or 50% of the outstanding voting shares of such Fund. Each investment management agreement automatically terminates in the event of its assignment, as defined in the Company Act. We may terminate an investment management agreement without penalty on 60 days' written notice.

Mutual Fund Distribution

G.distributors, a wholly-owned subsidiary of GBL, is a broker-dealer registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and is regulated by FINRA. G.distributors' revenues are derived primarily from the distribution of our open-end funds. G.distributors distributes our open-end funds pursuant to distribution agreements with each fund. It also distributes the TETON Westwood Funds. Under each distribution agreement with an open-end fund, G.distributors offers and sells such open-end fund's shares on a continuous basis and pays the majority of the costs of marketing and selling the shares, including printing and mailing prospectuses and sales literature, advertising and maintaining sales and customer service personnel and sales and services fulfillment systems, and payments to the sponsors of third party distribution programs, financial intermediaries and G.distributors sales personnel. G.distributors receives fees for such services pursuant to distribution plans adopted under provisions of Rule 12b-1 (&#8220;12b-1&#8221;) of the Company Act. Distribution fees from the open-end funds are computed daily based on average net assets. Distribution fees from the open-end funds amounted to $47.7 million, $56.1 million and $47.4 million while payments to third-parties for selling the open-end funds totaled $45.8 million, $53.8 million and $45.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. G.distributors is the principal underwriter for funds distributed in multiple classes of shares which carry either a front-end, back-end or no sales charge. Underwriting fees and sales charges retained amounted to $1.0 million, $2.7 million and $2.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

&#160;

Under the distribution plans, the open-end Class AAA shares of the funds (except The Gabelli U.S. Treasury Money Market Fund, Gabelli Capital Asset Fund and The Gabelli ABC Fund) and the Class A and ADV shares of various funds pay G.distributors a distribution or service fee of .25% per year (except the Class A shares of the TETON Westwood Funds and Gabelli Enterprise Mergers &#38; Acquisition Fund which pay .50% and 0.45% per year, respectively, and the TETON Westwood Intermediate Bond Fund which pays .35%) on the average daily net assets of the fund. Class C shares have a 12b-1 distribution plan with a service and distribution fee totaling 1%. Class B shares were discontinued in 2014. G.distributors&#8217; distribution agreements with the funds may continue in effect from year to year only if specifically approved at least annually by (i) the fund's Board of Directors or Trustees or (ii) the fund's shareholders and, in either case, the vote of a majority of the fund's directors or trustees who are not parties to the agreement or &#8220;interested persons&#8221; of any such party, within the meaning of the Company Act. Each fund may terminate its distribution agreement, or any agreement thereunder, at any time upon 60 days' written notice by (i) a vote of the majority of its directors or trustees cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such termination or (ii) a vote at a meeting of shareholders of the lesser of either 67% of the voting shares represented in person or by proxy (if at least 50% of the shares are present at the meeting) or 50% of the outstanding voting shares of such fund. Each distribution agreement automatically terminates in the event of its assignment, as defined in the Company Act. G.distributors may terminate a distribution agreement without penalty upon 60 days' written notice.

&#160;

G.distributors also offers our open-end fund products through our website, www.gabelli.com , where directly registered mutual fund investors can access their personal account information and buy, sell, and exchange Fund shares. Fund prospectuses, quarterly reports, fund applications, daily net asset values and performance charts are all available online. 

Competition

We compete with other investment management firms and mutual fund companies, insurance companies, banks, brokerage firms and other financial institutions that offer products that have similar features and investment objectives. Many of these investment management firms are subsidiaries of large diversified financial companies. Many others are much larger in terms of AUM and revenues and, accordingly, have much larger sales organizations and marketing budgets. Historically, we have competed primarily on the basis of the long-term investment performance of many of our investment products. However, we have taken steps to increase our distribution channels, brand name awareness and marketing efforts.

&#160;

The market for providing investment management services to Institutional and Private Wealth Management clients is also highly competitive. Approximately 35% of our investment advisory fee revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 was derived from our Institutional and Private Wealth Management. Selection of investment advisors by U.S. institutional investors is often subject to a screening process and to favorable recommendations by investment industry consultants. Many of these investors require their investment advisors to have a successful and sustained performance record, often five years or longer with focus also on one-year and three-year performance records. We have significantly increased our AUM on behalf of U.S. institutional investors since our entry into the institutional asset management business in 1977.

Intellectual Property

Service marks and brand name recognition are important to our business. We have rights to the service marks under which our products are offered. We have registered certain service marks in the United States and will continue to do so as new trademarks and service marks are developed or acquired. We have rights to use the &#8220;Gabelli&#8221; name, the &#8220;GAMCO&#8221; name, and other names. Pursuant to an assignment agreement, Mr. Gabelli has assigned to us all of his rights, title and interests in and to the &#8220;Gabelli&#8221; name for use in connection with investment management services, mutual funds and securities brokerage services. However, under the agreement, Mr. Gabelli will retain any and all rights, title and interests he has or may have in the &#8220;Gabelli&#8221; name for use in connection with (i) charitable foundations controlled by Mr. Gabelli or members of his family and (ii) entities engaged in private investment activities for Mr. Gabelli or members of his family. In addition, the funds managed by Mr. Gabelli outside GBL have entered into a license agreement with us permitting them to continue limited use of the &#8220;Gabelli&#8221; name under specified circumstances. We have taken, and will continue to take, action to protect our interests in these service marks.

Regulation

Virtually all aspects of our businesses are subject to various federal, state and foreign laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investment advisory clients and shareholders of investment funds. Under such laws and regulations, agencies that regulate investment advisors and broker-dealers have broad powers, including the power to limit, restrict or prohibit such an advisor or broker-dealer from carrying on its business in the event that it fails to comply with such laws and regulations. In such an event, the possible sanctions that may be imposed include civil and criminal liability, the suspension of individual employees, injunctions, limitations on engaging in certain lines of business for specified periods of time, revocation of the investment advisor and other registrations, censures, and fines.

Our business is subject to extensive regulation at the federal, state and foreign level by the SEC and other regulatory bodies. Certain of our subsidiaries are registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (&#8220;Advisers Act&#8221;), and the funds are registered with the SEC under the Company Act. We also have a subsidiary that is registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC and is subject to regulation by FINRA and various states.

&#160;

The subsidiaries of GBL that are registered with the Commission under the Advisers Act (Funds Advisor, Gabelli Fixed Income LLC and GAMCO Asset) are regulated by and subject to examination by the SEC. The Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisors including fiduciary duties, disclosure obligations and record keeping, operational and marketing requirements. The Commission is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Advisers Act, ranging from censure to termination of an investment advisor's registration. The failure of an advisory subsidiary to comply with the requirements of the SEC could have a material adverse effect on us.

&#160;

We derive a substantial majority of our revenues from investment advisory services through our various investment management agreements. Under the Advisers Act, our investment management agreements may not be assigned without the client's consent. Under the Company Act, advisory agreements with registered investment companies such as our Funds terminate automatically upon assignment. The term &#8220;assignment&#8221; is broadly defined and includes direct as well as assignments that may be deemed to occur, under certain circumstances, upon the transfer, directly or indirectly, of a controlling interest in GBL.

&#160;

In its capacity as a broker-dealer, G.distributors is required to maintain certain minimum net capital amounts. These requirements also provide that equity capital may not be withdrawn, advances to affiliates may not be made or cash dividends paid if certain minimum net capital requirements are not met. G.distributors&#8217; net capital, as defined, met or exceeded all minimum requirements as of December 31, 2015. As a registered broker-dealer, G.distributors is also subject to periodic examination by FINRA, the SEC and the states.

Subsidiaries of GBL are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (&#8220;ERISA&#8221;), and to regulations promulgated thereunder, insofar as they are &#8220;fiduciaries&#8221; under ERISA with respect to certain of their clients. ERISA and applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#8220;Code&#8221;), impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA and prohibit certain transactions involving ERISA plan clients. Our failure to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse effect on us.

Investments by GBL and on behalf of our advisory clients and investment funds often represent a significant equity ownership position in an issuer's class of stock. As of December 31, 2015, we had five percent or more beneficial ownership with respect to 116 equity securities. This activity raises frequent regulatory, legal, and disclosure issues regarding our aggregate beneficial ownership level with respect to portfolio securities, including issues relating to issuers' shareholder rights plans or &#8220;poison pills,&#8221; and various federal and state regulatory limitations, including state gaming laws and regulations, federal communications laws and regulations and federal and state public utility laws and regulations, as well as federal proxy rules governing shareholder communications and federal laws and regulations regarding the reporting of beneficial ownership positions. Our failure to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse effect on us.

&#160;

The USA Patriot Act of 2001 contains anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws and mandates the implementation of various new regulations applicable to broker-dealers, mutual funds and other financial services companies, including standards for verifying client identification at account opening, and obligations to monitor client transactions and report suspicious activities. Anti-money laundering laws outside of the U.S. contain some similar provisions. Our failure to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse effect on us.

We and certain of our affiliates are subject to the laws of non-U.S. jurisdictions and non-U.S. regulatory agencies or bodies. In connection with our office in London and our plans to market certain products in Europe, we are required to comply with the laws of the United Kingdom and other European countries regarding these activities. Our subsidiary, GAMCO Asset Management (UK) Limited, is regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (&#8220;FCA&#8221;). In connection with our registration in the United Kingdom, we have minimum capital requirements that have been consistently met or exceeded. We opened offices in Shanghai and Tokyo and therefore are subject to national and local laws in those jurisdictions. We are subject to requirements in numerous jurisdictions regarding reporting of beneficial ownership positions in securities issued by companies whose securities are publicly-traded in those countries.

Regulatory matters

The investment management industry is likely to continue facing a high level of regulatory scrutiny and become subject to additional rules designed to increase disclosure, tighten controls and reduce potential conflicts of interest. In addition, the Commission has substantially increased its use of focused inquiries which request information from investment advisors and a number of fund complexes regarding particular practices or provisions of the securities laws. We participate in some of these inquiries in the normal course of our business. Changes in laws, regulations and administrative practices by regulatory authorities, and the associated compliance costs, have increased our cost structure and could in the future have a material adverse impact. Although we have installed procedures and utilize the services of experienced administrators, accountants and lawyers to assist us in adhering to regulatory guidelines and satisfying these requirements, and maintain insurance to protect ourselves in the case of client losses, there can be no assurance that the precautions and procedures that we have instituted and installed, or the insurance that we maintain to protect ourselves in case of client losses, will protect us from all potential liabilities.

See Item 3: LEGAL PROCEEDINGS below.
