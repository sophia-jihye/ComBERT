 Item 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.

Narrative Description of the Business 

We plan to make early stage investments that will bring alternative energy technologies to commercialization and then actively manage these investments. We plan to generate management fees based on the size of the investments that we oversee and incentive income based on the performance of these investments. Our principal business has been to provide consulting to related parties with respect to their investments in alternative energy projects.

As to our investments, we will not limit ourselves to any single area of alternative energy. We will look at any and all forms of alternative energy. We actively screen investments with emphasis towards finding opportunities with potential for long term success.

Operations

In the past, we have acted as a consultant to with respect to client investments in alternative energy projects. We performed due diligence and ongoing research and evaluation with respect to projects on a fee basis. We are not currently generating revenues as a consultant.

We also plan to seek, develop, and manage alternative energy investments for our own account. We screen investments with emphasis towards finding opportunities with long term potential. We do not limit ourselves to any single area of alternative energy. We will look at any and all forms of alternative energy.

We have a proprietary investment screening process to make our investments. This process is based upon the experience of Mr. Brian Klemsz, our President, and outside consultants as we develop our company. 

For the fiscal years ended 2015 and 2014, we have not been profitable. While we lost our only source of revenue, we have been pursuing new clients to replace the lost revenue stream and are also exploring the possibility of merging with an existing company who has revenues and, potentially, earnings. At this time, we have no definitive arrangements for either replacing our lost revenue or identifying a merger candidate.

We operate out of one office in Colorado. We have no specific plans at this point for additional offices. On January 1, 2008, we entered into a Service Agreement with Bohemian Companies, LLC to provide us with certain defined services. These services included financial, bookkeeping, accounting, legal and tax matters, as well as cash management, custody of assets, preparation of financial documents, including tax returns and checks, and coordination of professional service providers as may be necessary to carry out the matters covered by the Service Agreement. We compensated Bohemian Companies, LLC by reimbursing this entity for the allocable portion of the direct and indirect costs of each employee of Bohemian Companies, LLC. who performed services on our behalf. We received monthly invoices from Bohemian Companies, LLC. As of March 31, 2014, the Service Agreement was terminated by agreement of both parties. 

Effective May 20, 2014, we amended our Articles of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized common shares to One Hundred Million (100,000,000) shares from Fifty Million (50,000,000) shares. The par value of the common shares remains at $0.001 per share.

&#160; &#160; 

Markets

We believe that the primary reason that clients would procure services from us rather than competitors would be the existing relationships that we possess and can develop. We believe that client loyalty and satisfaction can be the basis for success in this business. Therefore, we plan to develop and expand on already existing relationships to develop a competitive edge. We utilize the expertise of our principal officer to market our proprietary investment screening process business

&#160; &#160; 

Raw Materials

&#160; &#160; The use of raw materials is not a factor in our operations at the present time. The use of raw materials may become a material factor in the future as we develop operations. 

Customers and Competition

Our business plan involves acting as both a consultant and an investor in alternative energy technologies. This business is highly competitive. There are numerous similar companies providing such services in the United States of America. Our competitors will have greater financial resources and more expertise in this business. Our ability to develop our business will depend on our ability to successfully identify alternative energy technology investments in this highly competitive environment. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so successfully.

&#160;

Over the past several years, the size and number of funds that focus on alternative energy technologies has continued to increase. If this trend continues, it is possible that it will become increasingly difficult for us to raise funds to grow our Company. Competition is based on a variety of factors, including:

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

investment performance;

&#160; &#8226; 

investor perception of investment managers&#8217; drive, focus and alignment of interest;

&#160; &#8226; 

quality of service provided to and duration of relationship with investors;

&#160; &#8226; 

business reputation; and

&#160; &#8226; 

level of fees and expenses charged for services.

&#160;

&#160; We compete with a large number of management firms and other financial institutions. A number of factors serve to increase our competitive risks:

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; 

investors may develop concerns that we will allow a business to grow to the detriment of its performance;

&#160; &#8226; 

some of our competitors have greater capital, lower targeted returns or greater sector or investment strategy specific expertise than we do, which creates competitive disadvantages with respect to investment opportunities; some of our competitors may perceive risk differently than we do which could allow them either to outbid us for investments in particular sectors or, generally, to consider a wider variety of investments;

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; 

there are relatively few barriers to entry impeding new private equity and hedge fund management firms, and the successful efforts of new entrants into our various lines of business, including former &#8216;&#8216;star&#8217;&#8217; portfolio managers at large diversified financial institutions as well as such institutions themselves, will continue to result in increased competition; and

&#160; &#8226; 

other industry participants could seek to recruit our best and brightest investment professionals away from us.

&#160; These and other factors could reduce our earnings and revenues and materially adversely affect our business.

Employees

&#160; &#160; We have one full-time employee: Mr. Klemsz. Mr. Klemsz does not draw a salary or receive any other kind of compensation. However, we reimburse our employee for all necessary and customary business related expenses. We have no plans or agreements which provide health care, insurance or compensation on the event of termination of employment or change in our control. We do not pay our Directors separately for any Board meeting they attend.

&#160;

Proprietary Information

&#160; We have a proprietary investment screening process to make our investments. Otherwise, we own no proprietary information.

Government Regulation

At some point, we may be required to file to become a registered investment advisor, but we currently do not expect government regulations or environmental laws to have any material impact on us.

Research and Development

We have never spent any amount in research and development activities.

Environmental Compliance
