We participate in the large and growing global market for connectivity and essential communications infrastructure. This market is being driven by the growth in bandwidth demand associated with the continued adoption of smartphones, tablets, machine-to-machine communication and the proliferation of data centers, Big Data, cloud-based services, streaming media content and the Internet of things (IoT). Telecommunications operators are deploying 4G and fiber optic networks and next-generation network solutions to support the dramatic growth in bandwidth demand. As users consume more data on smartphones, tablets and computers, enterprises are faced with a growing need for higher bandwidth networks, in-building cellular coverage and more robust, efficient and intelligent data centers. MSOs are investing in their networks to deliver a competitive triple-play of services (voice, video and high-speed data) and to maintain service quality. There are a number of major trends that we expect to drive demand for our solutions, including: 

&#160;

Carrier Investments in 4G Wireless Infrastructure 

4G LTE has been deployed to handle wireless data faster, more reliably and more efficiently than 2G and 3G networks. The faster data rate and lower latency capabilities of LTE networks enable a rich mobile computing experience for users equal to that of a wired connection. LTE networks are more efficient and cost effective for wireless operators because of the architecture in their core and due to improved spectral efficiency, which increases the throughput of data in a fixed amount of spectrum. 

Wireless operators have been deploying LTE globally and are making the necessary wireless infrastructure investments to accommodate the growing demand for new mobile communication services. LTE investment is expected to continue to be deployed globally over the next decade as the user base continues to shift from older technologies to LTE. 

As wireless operators deploy LTE, they must manage an increasingly complex and sensitive radio access network (RAN). As a result, we believe wireless operator coverage and capacity investments will drive demand for our comprehensive offerings. While we expect growth in wireless capacity over the long term, annual growth rates can be uneven. 

Metro Cell, DAS and Small Cell Investment to Enhance and Expand Wireless Coverage and Capacity 

The traditional macro cell network requires mobile users to connect directly to macro cell base stations. Macro cells are primarily designed to provide coverage over wide areas and typically transmit high power. They are not optimal for dense urban areas where physical structures often create coverage gaps and capacity is frequently constrained. Adding new macro cells or increasing the number of sectors on existing sites has been the traditional way to increase mobile capacity and will continue to be an important layer of the network. As use continues to outpace capacity growth, new solutions are required for densely populated areas. Metro cells and indoor networks are emerging as important layers of the network. Metro cells are smaller cell sites, located closer to the ground, having a lower power level than a traditional macro cell site. Metro cells blend into their environment and are often found integrated with traditional street furniture, which helps alleviate zoning restrictions that have made traditional deployments difficult. Finally there are small cell and DAS solutions that address the capacity and speed requirements from an indoor perspective. These systems provide coverage and capacity to the indoor environment, and reduce the load from the macro and metro layers, which improves the network as a whole. Small cell and DAS systems may range from small single operator, single-band, low capacity systems to large multi-carrier, multi-technology, multi-band, high capacity environments. 

Wireless operators view in-building coverage as a critical component of their network deployment strategies. Key challenges for wireless operators in providing in-building cellular coverage are signal loss while penetrating building structures and interference created by mobile devices while connected to macro cell sites from inside a building. In-building DAS solutions bring the antenna significantly closer to the user, which results in better coverage and capacity while simultaneously reducing interference. Additionally, in-building DAS provides seamless signal handover for users inside buildings and can support multi-operator, multi-frequency and multi-protocol (2G, 3G, 4G) solutions. In contrast, small cells are small, self-contained radio units that provide single frequency and single-provider service to a relatively small area, similar to a Wi-Fi access point. The benefits of small cell technologies are becoming increasingly important with the trend towards BYOD (bring your own device) in the enterprise market. 

Operators also commonly use traditional DAS solutions to address outdoor capacity issues in urban areas, deploying them in effect as metro cells. This urban network capacity issue can be solved by deploying multi-band, multi-technology solutions to create small coverage re-use areas. Re-use of spectrum allows wireless operators to optimize capacity of existing licensed spectrum by significantly increasing repeated usage of the same frequencies within a defined coverage area. 

&#160;

FTTx Deployments 

Residential and business bandwidth consumption continues to grow substantially. As a result, many operators are installing fiber deeper into their networks to increase capacity. The proliferation of and over-the-top video, multiscreen viewing, cloud services and social media are prompting operators to accelerate their plans for fiber deployment. While the devices consumers use are increasingly connected to the network via a wireless connection such as LTE or Wi-Fi, these wireless access points must have abundant backhaul capacity available to allow the consumer the experience they expect. From increased deployments of Fiber to the Node (FTTN), Fiber to the Premises (FTTP), and Fiber to the Distribution Point (FTTdP), operators around the world are deploying next generation networks. These networks use the capabilities of fiber to enable consumers access to the content they are looking for at higher speeds and with lower latency. 

Growth in Data Center Spending 

Organizations are increasingly investing in data centers to provide products and services to individuals and businesses. Data center investment is driven by the increase in demand for computing power and improved network performance, which is greatest for large enterprise data centers and cloud service providers. We expect there to be growing demand for scalable, flexible data center solutions. 

An increase in average data center size and the number of assets in a data center significantly raises the total cost of ownership and the complexity of managing data center infrastructure. Data center operators strive to manage their resources efficiently and to reduce energy consumption by monitoring all elements within the data center. Data center infrastructure management (DCIM) software helps operators improve operational efficiency, maximize capability and reduce costs by providing clear insight into cooling capacity, power usage, utilization, applications and overall performance. 

Transition to Intelligent Buildings 

Business enterprises are managing the proliferation of wireless devices, the impact of cloud computing and emergence of wireless and wired business applications. This increasing complexity creates the need for infrastructure to support growing bandwidth requirements, in-building cellular coverage and capacity and software that monitors the physical layer. These enterprises are also investing in communications and building automation systems to enhance energy efficiency, improve productivity and increase comfort. These intelligent building infrastructure solutions often include integrated network software and small cell or DAS. 

Strategy 

We believe the BNS acquisition will accelerate our strategy to drive profitable growth by expanding our business into attractive adjacent markets and to broaden our position as a leading communications infrastructure provider. We believe the transaction positions us for future growth and value creation by creating a company with leading positions across diverse and growing segments and geographies, significantly expanding our platform for innovative solutions, creating complementary market opportunities and offering significant synergy opportunities and a strong financial profile. We believe the combination of this business with ours places us at the core of key secular growth trends in the markets we serve. It is our strategy to capitalize on these opportunities and to:

Major customers and distributors include companies such as Anixter International Inc., AT&#38;T Inc., Verizon Communications Inc., Comcast Corporation, T-Mobile US, Inc., Graybar Electric Company Inc., Ericsson Inc., Alcatel-Lucent SA, Ooredoo and Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. We support our global sales organization with regional service centers in locations around the world. 

Products from our Wireless segment are primarily sold directly to wireless operators, to OEMs that sell equipment to wireless operators or to other service providers that deploy elements of wireless networks at the direction of wireless operators. Our customer service and engineering groups maintain close working relationships with these customers due to the significant amount of design and customization associated with some of these products. Direct sales to our top three Wireless segment customers represented 14% of our consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 19% of our consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2014. Sales to our top three OEM customers represented 6% and 8% of our consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. No direct Wireless segment customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2015 or 2014. 

&#160;

The Enterprise segment has a dedicated sales team that generates customer demand for our solutions, which are sold to thousands of end customers primarily through independent distributors, system integrators and value-added resellers. Direct sales of Enterprise products to our top three Enterprise segment customers, all of whom are distributors, represented 15% of our consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Net sales to our largest distributor, Anixter International Inc. and its affiliates (Anixter), accounted for 12% and 11% of our consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. 

Broadband segment products are primarily sold directly to cable television system operators. Although we sell to a wide variety of customers dispersed across many different geographic areas, sales to our three largest domestic broadband customers represented 7% and 6% of our consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 

Telecom products from our BNS segment are primarily sold directly to broadband operators or to service providers that deploy broadband networks at the direction of broadband operators around the world. Enterprise products from our BNS segment are sold to thousands of end customers primarily through independent distributors, system integrators and value-added resellers.

Direct sales of BNS products to our top three BNS segment customers represented 3% of our consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

We generally have no minimum purchase commitments with any of our distributors, system integrators, value-added resellers, wireless operators or OEM customers, and our contracts with these parties do not prohibit them from purchasing or offering products or services that compete with ours. While we maintain long-term relationships with these parties and have not historically lost key customers, we have experienced variability in the level of purchases by our key customers, and any significant reduction in sales to these customers, including as a result of the inability or unwillingness of these customers to continue purchasing our products, or their failure to properly manage their business with respect to the purchase of and payment for our products, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. See Part I, Item 1A, &#147;Risk Factors&#148;. 

We employ a global manufacturing and distribution strategy to control production costs and improve service to customers. We support our international sales efforts with sales representatives based in Europe, Latin America, Asia and other regions throughout the world. Our net sales from international operations were $1.9 billion, $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. 

Patents and Trademarks 

We pursue an active policy of seeking intellectual property protection, namely patents and registered trademarks, for new products and designs. On a worldwide basis, we held approximately 10,000 patents and patent applications and approximately 3,000 registered trademarks and trademark applications as of December 31, 2015. We consider our patents and trademarks to be valuable assets, and while no single patent is material to our operations as a whole, we believe the CommScope, Andrew, SYSTIMAX, Heliax and AMP NETCONNECT, trade names and related trademarks are critical assets to our business. We intend to rely on our intellectual property rights, including our proprietary knowledge, trade secrets and continuing technological innovation, to develop and maintain our competitive position. We will continue to protect our key intellectual property rights. 

Backlog and Seasonality 

At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we had an order backlog of $572 million and $479 million, respectively. Orders typically fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on customer demand and general business conditions. Our backlog includes only orders that are believed to be firm. In some cases, unfilled orders may be canceled prior to shipment of goods, but cancellations historically have not been material. However, our current order backlog may not be indicative of future demand. 

&#160;

Due to the variability of shipments under large contracts, customers&#146; seasonal installation considerations and variations in product mix and in profitability of individual orders, we can experience significant quarterly fluctuations in sales and operating income. Our operating performance is typically weaker during the first and fourth quarters and stronger during the second and third quarters. These variations are expected to continue in the future. Consequently, it may be more meaningful to focus on annual rather than interim results. 

Competition 

The market for our products is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change. We encounter significant domestic and international competition across all segments of our business. Our competitors include large, diversified companies &#150; some of whom have substantially more assets and greater financial resources than we do &#150; as well as small to medium-sized companies. We also face competition from less diversified companies that have concentrated their efforts in one or more areas of the markets we serve. Our competitors include Amphenol Corporation, Belden Inc., Berk-Tek (a company of Nexans S.A.), Comba Telecom Systems Holding Ltd., Corning Incorporated, Emerson Electric Co., Ericsson Inc., Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., JMA Wireless, KATHREIN-Werke KG, Nokia, Panduit Corp., RFS (a division of Alcatel-Lucent SA), SOLiD Technologies and SpiderCloud Wireless, Inc. We compete primarily on the basis of delivering solutions, product specifications, quality, price, customer service and delivery time. We believe that we differentiate ourselves in many of our markets based on our market leadership, global sales channels, intellectual property, strong reputation with our customer base, the scope of our product offering, the quality and performance of our solutions and our service and technical support.

We believe our scale and stability make us an attractive strategic partner to our large global customers, and we have been repeatedly recognized by key customers for these attributes. In addition, our ability to leverage our core competencies across our business coupled with our successful track record of operational efficiencies has allowed us to improve our margins and cash flows while continuing to invest in research and development and acquisitions targeting new products and new markets. 

Our manufacturing and distribution facilities are strategically located to optimize service levels and product delivery times. We also utilize lower-cost geographies for high labor content products and largely automated plants in higher-cost regions. Currently, more than half of our manufacturing employees are located in lower-cost geographies such as China, Mexico, India and the Czech Republic. Our dynamic manufacturing and distribution organization allows us to: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; flex our capacity to meet market demand and expand our market position; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; provide high customer service levels due to proximity to the customer; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; effectively integrate acquisitions and capitalize on related synergies. Differentiated Solutions Supported by Ongoing Innovation and Significant Proprietary Intellectual Property (IP) 

Our integrated solutions for wireless, enterprise, fiber optic and broadband networks are differentiated in the marketplace and are a significant global competitive advantage. We have invested more than $120 million in research and development in each of the last three years. We have also added significant IP and innovation through acquisitions, such as Airvana, which expanded our leadership and capabilities in providing indoor wireless capacity and coverage and Argus Technologies (Argus), which enhanced our next-generation base station antenna technology. Our ongoing innovation, supported by proprietary IP and technology know-how, has allowed us to sustain this competitive advantage. The transformational BNS acquisition substantially expanded our foundation of innovation with the addition of BNS&#146;s approximately 7,000 patents and patent applications worldwide. Further, BNS&#146;s leading fiber technology will help us better address a transition to fiber deployments deeper into networks and data centers as consumers and businesses generate increasing bandwidth requirements. With these new innovative solutions, we expect to solve more customer communications challenges, while providing greater opportunities to our business partners. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Integrated solutions . Our wireless network offerings include complete connectivity solutions supporting 2G, 3G and 4G wireless technologies for both macro and metro, as well as DAS and small cell sites. We are able to provide a complete portfolio of integrated RF solutions from the output of the base station (or baseband processor) at the bottom of the tower to the antenna at the top of the tower. In the enterprise market, we deliver a comprehensive solution including connectivity and cables, enclosures, network intelligence software and network design services. In the FTTx market, we are able to offer end-to-end solutions including connectors, cabling, splice closures and fiber management systems. Our ability to provide integrated connectivity solutions for wireless, enterprise, fiber optic and broadband networks makes us a value-added solutions provider to our customers and gives us a significant competitive advantage. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Strong design capabilities and technology know-how . We have a long tradition of developing highly engineered connectivity solutions, demonstrating superior performance across various generations of networks. Our ongoing focus on engineering innovation has enabled us to create high quality products that are reliable, have a desirable form factor and enable our customers to optimize the performance, flexibility, installation time, energy consumption and space requirements of their network deployments. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Significant proprietary IP . Our proven record of innovation and decades of experience creating market-leading technology products are evidenced by our approximately 10,000 patents and patent applications, as well as our approximately 3,000 registered trademarks and trademark applications, worldwide. Our significant proprietary IP, when combined with our deep engineering expertise, allows us to create industry defining solutions for customers around the world. Established Sales Channels and Customer Relationships 

We serve customers in over 100 countries and have become a trusted advisor to many of them through our industry expertise, quality, technology and long-term relationships. These factors enable us to provide mission-critical connectivity solutions that our customers need to build high-performing communication networks. 

Our customers include substantially all of the leading global telecom operators as well as thousands of enterprise customers, including many Fortune 500 enterprises, and leading cable television providers or MSOs. We are a key merchant supplier within the wireless infrastructure market and enjoy established sales channels across all geographies and technologies. Our long-standing relationships with telecommunication operators enable us to work closely with them in providing highly customized solutions that are aligned with their technology roadmaps. We have a global Enterprise segment sales force with sales representatives based in North America, 

&#160;

Europe, Latin America, Asia and other regions, and an extensive global network of channel partners including independent distributors, system integrators and value-added resellers. Our Enterprise segment sales force has direct relationships with our Enterprise customers and generates demand for our products, with sales fulfilled primarily through channel partners. Our direct sales force and channel partner relationships give us extensive reach and distribution capabilities to customers globally. Our Broadband segment products are primarily sold directly to MSOs with whom we have long-standing relationships. 

Proven Management Team with Record of Operational Excellence and Successful M&#38;A Integration 

We have a strong track record of organically growing market share, establishing leadership positions in new markets, managing cash flows, delivering profitable growth across multiple economic cycles and integrating large and small acquisitions. Our senior management team has an average of more than 20 years of experience in connectivity solutions for the communications infrastructure industry. 

We have a history of strong operating cash flow and have generated approximately $1.2 billion in cumulative operating cash flow over the last five fiscal years. Our strong cash flow profile has allowed us to continue to invest in innovative research and development, pursue strategic acquisitions, repay debt and return cash to stockholders prior to our initial public offering in 2013 (the IPO). We continuously pursue strategic initiatives aimed at optimizing our resources, reducing manufacturing and distribution costs and lowering our overall cost structure. 

Throughout our history, we have successfully complemented our strong organic growth with strategic acquisitions. While we are early in the process of integrating BNS, our management team has effectively integrated other large acquisitions, such as Andrew Corporation in 2007 and Avaya Connectivity Solutions in 2004, as well as executed tuck-in acquisitions, such as Argus, iTRACS and Alifabs, to help expand our market opportunities and continue to solve our customers&#146; business challenges in multiple growth areas. We have also made strategic minority investments in order to gain access to key technologies or capabilities. 

Raw Materials 

Our products are manufactured or assembled from both standard components and parts that are unique to our specifications. Our internal manufacturing operations are largely process oriented and we use significant quantities of various raw materials, including copper, aluminum, steel, brass, plastics and other polymers, fluoropolymers, bimetals and optical fiber, among others. We use significant volumes of copper, aluminum, steel and polymers in the manufacture of coaxial and twisted pair cables and antennas. Other parts are produced using processes such as stamping, machining, molding and pressing from metals or plastics. Portions of the requirements for these materials are purchased under supply arrangements where some portion of the unit pricing may be indexed to commodity market prices for these metals. We may, from time to time, enter into forward purchase commitments for a specific commodity to mitigate our exposure to price changes for a portion of our anticipated purchases. Certain of the raw materials utilized in our products may only be available from a limited number of suppliers. We may, therefore, encounter availability issues and/or significant price increases. 

Our profitability may be materially affected by changes in the market price of our raw materials, most of which are linked to the commodity markets. Prices for copper, aluminum, fluoropolymers and certain other polymers derived from oil and natural gas have fluctuated substantially during the past several years. As a result, we have adjusted our prices for certain Wireless, Enterprise and Broadband segment products and may have to adjust prices again in the future. Delays in implementing price increases, failure to achieve market acceptance of price increases, or price reductions in response to a rapid decline in raw material costs, could have a material adverse impact on the results of our operations. 

In addition, some of our products are assembled from specialized components and subassemblies manufactured by suppliers. We are dependent upon sole suppliers for certain key components for some of our products. If these 

&#160;

sources were not able to provide these components in sufficient quantity and quality on a timely and cost efficient basis, it could materially impact our results of operations until another qualified supplier is found. We believe that our supply contracts and our supplier contingency plans mitigate some of this risk. 

Environment 

We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, discharges to air and water, management of regulated materials, handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste, and investigation and remediation of contaminated sites. In addition, we are or may be subject to laws and regulations regarding the types of substances allowable in certain of our products and the handling of our products at the end of their useful life. Because of the nature of our business, we have incurred and will continue to incur costs relating to compliance with or liability under these environmental laws and regulations. In addition, new laws and regulations, new or different interpretations of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new remediation or discharge requirements, could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. For example, the European Union has issued Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive 2011/65/EU (RoHS 2), Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and restriction of Chemicals (REACH) and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive 2012/19/EU (WEEE) regulating the manufacture, use and disposal of electrical goods and chemicals. If we do not comply with these and similar laws in other jurisdictions or sufficiently increase prices or otherwise reduce costs to offset the increased cost of compliance, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Efforts to regulate emissions of GHGs, such as carbon dioxide, are underway in the U.S. and other countries which could increase the cost of raw materials, production processes and transportation of our products. If we are unable to comply with such regulations or sufficiently increase prices or otherwise reduce costs to offset the increased costs of compliance, GHG regulation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 

Certain environmental laws impose strict and in some circumstances joint and several liability (that could result in an entity paying more than its fair share) on current or former owners or operators of a contaminated property, as well as companies that generated, disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances at a contaminated property, for the costs of investigation and remediation of the contaminated property. Our present and past facilities have been in operation for many years and over that time, in the course of those operations, hazardous substances and wastes have been used, generated and disposed of at such facilities and investigation and remediation projects are underway at a few of these sites. There can be no assurance that the contractual indemnifications we have received from prior owners and operators of certain of these facilities will continue to be honored. In addition, we have disposed of waste products either directly or through third parties at numerous disposal sites, and from time to time we have been and may be held responsible for investigation and clean-up costs at these sites where those owners and operators have been unable to remain in business. Also, there can be no guarantee that new environmental requirements or changes in their enforcement or the discovery of previously unknown conditions will not cause us to incur additional costs for environmental matters which could be material. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had a team of approximately 23,000 people to serve our customers worldwide. The majority of our employees are located outside of the United States. As a matter of policy, we seek to maintain good relations with our employees at all locations. We are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements in the United States. A significant portion of our international employees are members of unions or subject to workers&#146; councils or similar statutory arrangements. From a companywide perspective, we believe that our relations with our employees and unions or workers&#146; councils are satisfactory though we have experienced challenges in certain countries and may encounter more such challenges in the future. Historically, periods of labor unrest or work stoppage have not had a material impact on our operations or results.
