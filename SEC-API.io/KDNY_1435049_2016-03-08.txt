 Item 1. Business.

Overview

References herein to &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;Company&#8221;, and &#8220;Aduro&#8221; refer to Aduro Biotech, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries unless the context specifically states otherwise.

We are a clinical-stage immunotherapy company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of therapies that transform the treatment of challenging diseases. Our first-in-class technology platforms, which are designed to harness the body's natural immune system, are being investigated in cancer indications and have the potential to expand into autoimmune and infectious diseases. Our Live, Attenuated, Double-Deleted, or LADD, Listeria monocytogenes technology platform is engineered to express tumor-associated antigens to induce specific and targeted immune responses. Based on compelling clinical data in advanced cancers, this platform is being developed as a treatment for multiple indications, including pancreatic, ovarian, lung and prostate cancers, mesothelioma and glioblastoma. Our STING Pathway Activator platform is designed to activate the intracellular Stimulator of Interferon Genes, or STING receptor, resulting in a potent tumor-specific immune response. Our B-select monoclonal antibody platform includes a number of immune modulating assets in research and preclinical development. We are also collaborating with leading global pharmaceutical companies to expand our products and technology platforms.

Our lead LADD product candidate, CRS-207, is an immuno-oncology therapy (a class of therapies that leverage the patient&#8217;s immune system to slow the growth and spread of, or eliminate, tumor cells). Immuno-oncology is an emerging field of cancer therapy that aims to activate the immune system in the tumor microenvironment to create and enhance anti-tumor immune responses, as well as to overcome the immuno-suppressive mechanisms that cancer cells have developed against the immune system. Recent developments in the field of immuno-oncology, including checkpoint inhibitors&#8212;therapies that have mechanisms focused on unmasking hidden cancer cells&#8212;have shown the potential to provide dramatic efficacy and extended survival, even in cancers where conventional therapies, such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, have failed. The immunotherapy field is rapidly advancing with new immuno-oncology combinations that focus on strengthening therapeutic efficacy in a wide range of cancers. We intend to pursue a broad strategy of combining our technology platforms with conventional and novel immuno-oncology therapies, based on their mechanisms of action, safety profiles and versatility. 

CRS-207 is currently being developed in metastatic pancreatic cancer, unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma and ovarian cancer. In a completed randomized controlled Phase 2a clinical trial in metastatic pancreatic cancer patients, CRS-207 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in overall survival when combined with GVAX Pancreas, a cellular vaccine product candidate. The 93-patient two-arm Phase 2a clinical trial was designed to compare the combination of CRS-207 and GVAX Pancreas versus GVAX Pancreas alone. The trial met the primary efficacy endpoint of overall survival at an interim analysis and was stopped upon recommendation from the Data Monitoring Committee. Based on the data from this study, our lead immuno-oncology regimen of CRS-207 and GVAX Pancreas was granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. Breakthrough Therapy designation is intended to expedite the development and review of products that treat serious or life-threatening conditions. We have obtained orphan drug designation for CRS-207 and GVAX Pancreas for the treatment of pancreatic cancer and for CRS-207 for the treatment of mesothelioma in the United States and European Union from the FDA and European Medicines Agency, respectively. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition. Orphan drug designation entitles a party to certain financial incentives and can provide limited market exclusivity in certain circumstances. 

We are developing a pipeline of proprietary product candidates on our own and through partnerships. We have developed two LADD product candidates in collaboration with Janssen Biotech, Inc., or Janssen, targeting prostate and lung cancers and STING Activator product candidates in oncology under our worldwide collaboration with Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, or Novartis. In addition, we are developing monoclonal antibodies, or mAbs, with the potential to yield novel immunotherapy combinations as a result of our recent acquisition of BioNovion Holding B.V., our wholly-owned subsidiary known as Aduro Biotech Europe, based in the Netherlands. We have intellectual property protection on our LADD and STING Pathway Activator technology platforms and each of our product candidates, which we believe we will maintain into the 2030s.

Our Proprietary Technology Platforms and Pipeline

We have developed first-in-class technology platforms &#8211; LADD, STING Pathway Activator and B-select monoclonal antibodies. We believe our technology platforms represent innovative approaches in immuno-oncology. Since our product candidates act by leveraging the patient&#8217;s own immune system, we believe they have the potential to deliver enhanced efficacy and to be safer and more tolerable than existing therapies, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Based on the mechanism of action and safety profile of our technology platforms, we intend to build a deep pipeline of product candidates that can be readily combinable and synergistic with both conventional and novel therapies, such as checkpoint inhibitors. Our vision is to leverage our scientific expertise 

and understanding of the body&#8217;s natural defense systems, including the interplay between the innate and adaptive immune responses, to develop safe and effective therapies for the benefit of patients. 

Live, Attenuated, Double-Deleted Listeria Monocytogenes

Our proprietary LADD product candidates have been engineered for safety. In addition, we seek to optimize tumor-specific immune responses by engineering our LADD product candidates to express encoded tumor-specific antigens and deliver them to antigen-presenting cells. Antigen-presenting cells, which include dendritic cells, lead to efficient priming of a class of immune cells known as T cells. Once primed, these T cells seek out and eliminate the targeted tumor cells. Our LADD product candidates have been engineered for safety in humans through the deletion of two genes critical for virulence of unmodified Listeria : actA and inlB . The deletion of the actA gene prevents the spread of our LADD product candidates from cell to cell, which controls the spread of infection. The deletion of the inlB gene prevents the infection of hepatocytes, or liver cells, which can lead to toxicity. We believe key attributes of our LADD technology platform include:

&#160;

&#183; 

Early Evidence of Efficacy . Our randomized controlled Phase 2a clinical trial in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer who had received or refused prior therapy demonstrated improved overall survival. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Novel Mechanism. Our LADD product candidates are designed to initiate a powerful innate immune response and drive a targeted, durable adaptive immune response. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Early Evidence of Safety in Preclinical Studies and Clinical Trials. Through our proprietary deletion of two genes that contribute to Listeria&#8217; s virulence, we substantially reduce the natural disease-causing properties of Listeria , creating stable product candidates suitable for therapeutic use. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Versatility. Individual LADD product candidates can be engineered to target a wide range of cancers by promoting anti-tumor immune responses against antigens associated with specific tumors. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Combinability. The mechanisms of action and safety profile of our LADD product candidates may give them the potential for combination with conventional and novel therapies, such as cellular vaccines, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and checkpoint inhibitors, among others. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Repeatable Administration. Our LADD product candidates are not neutralized by the patient&#8217;s immune system and are designed for repeat administration, thus allowing a chronic therapy for a sustained tumor antigen-specific response. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Cost-effectiveness. Our LADD product candidates are not personalized for each patient and can be manufactured through a relatively simple and cost-effective fermentation process. 

STING Pathway Activators

Our proprietary STING Activator product candidates are synthetic small molecule immune modulators that are designed to target and activate a receptor known as STING. Once activated, the STING receptor initiates a profound innate immune response by signaling through three distinct pathways, inducing the expression of a broad profile of cytokines that activate the development of an effective tumor antigen-specific T cell adaptive immune response. The STING receptor is generally expressed at high levels in the cytosol of immune cells, including dendritic cells. Recent advancements reported in numerous leading scientific journals have created interest in the potential for STING receptor-targeting drug candidates across diverse applications. We believe the STING receptor represents an attractive target for novel drug candidates because it is known to be critical for immune surveillance and control of cancer progression. We are developing STING Activator product candidates as therapies that are intended to prime and enhance the innate and adaptive immune responses. Our proprietary synthetic STING Activator product candidates are from a family of compounds known as cyclic dinucleotide, or CDN molecules, and are significantly more potent than naturally occurring CDNs, indicating high translational potential as a therapeutic approach to elicit an effective immune response. We believe key attributes of our STING Pathway Activator technology platform include:

&#160;

&#183; 

Early Evidence of Potency. Our STING Activator product candidates have demonstrated significant anti-tumor activity in pre-clinical studies. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Novel Mechanism. Our STING Activator product candidates are designed to initiate broad and strong innate and adaptive immune responses through the activation of the STING receptor signaling pathway. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Versatility of Delivery. We believe our STING pathway product candidates can be effectively delivered via intratumoral injection, systemic delivery via formulation and other novel modalities, such as conjugation with antibodies. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Combinability . Based on their mechanism of action, we believe our STING Activator product candidates may have synergistic or additive benefits of immune-mediated tumor killing mechanisms when combined with conventional and novel therapies, such as cellular vaccines, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and checkpoint inhibitors, among others. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Ease of Manufacture. Our STING Activator product candidates are small molecules manufactured through a relatively simple and cost-effective process. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Broad Applicability. We believe our STING pathway product candidates will have broad application in oncology and the potential to expand into other therapeutic areas such as infectious and autoimmune diseases. 

B-select Antibodies

Our B-select monoclonal antibody, or mAbs, platform technology is composed of agonist and antagonist mAbs. The unique approach to mAbs discovery through in vitro clonal expansion of B cells (antibody producing cells) has led to a number of immune modulating product candidates in research and preclinical development. The platform will allow us to further develop our portfolio of therapeutic antibodies to be used as monotherapies or in combination with existing or novel therapies, including our product candidates from the LADD and STING Pathway Activator platforms. 

Pipeline

Our most advanced immuno-oncology regimen is currently in a randomized controlled Phase 2b clinical trial known as ECLIPSE to assess the combination of our lead LADD product candidate, CRS-207, with GVAX Pancreas to treat late-stage metastatic pancreatic cancer patients who have received at least one prior line of therapy. GVAX Pancreas, which has demonstrated a favorable safety profile in clinical trials to date, is an important combination candidate because it is designed to induce T cells against an array of pancreatic cancer antigens and enable a broad-based immune response. In a Phase 2b study called STELLAR, we are evaluating CRS-207 in combination with GVAX Pancreas and an anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. In addition, we are advancing into Phase 3 CRS-207 in combination with chemotherapy in patients with unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma. We also have ongoing and planned clinical development programs evaluating LADD regimens for patients with glioblastoma multiforme and ovarian cancer, and for patients with lung and prostate cancers under collaborations with Janssen.

We envision multiple product opportunities for our STING Pathway Activator technology platform, including ADU-S100. Because STING receptors are known to be critical for immune surveillance and control of cancer progression, we believe that STING receptors represent an attractive target for novel drug candidates. We are developing our STING Activator product candidates as impactful therapies that are intended to prime and enhance innate and adaptive immune responses. Based on their mechanism of action, our STING Activator product candidates may also have synergistic or additive benefits when combined with other cancer therapies.

In addition, we are developing mAbs with the potential to yield novel immunotherapy combinations as a result of our recent acquisition of BioNovion Holding B.V., known as Aduro Biotech Europe.

Our pipeline of product candidates is depicted in the following chart: 

&#160;

Our Strategy

Our current focus is to discover, develop and commercialize best-in-class cancer therapies using our LADD, STING Activator and B-select technology platforms. Key elements of our strategy include:

&#160;

&#183; 

Rapidly advance CRS-207 through clinical development and regulatory approval. We are currently conducting two Phase 2b clinical trials known as ECLIPSE and STELLAR utilizing CRS-207 in combination with GVAX Pancreas in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. We are also using CRS-207 in combination with standard-of-care chemotherapy for treatment in the front line-setting of unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Maximize the commercial value of our proprietary LADD, STING Pathway Activator and B-select technology platforms. We currently have global development, marketing and commercialization rights for our lead product candidate, CRS-207, as well as additional LADD product candidates. If we obtain regulatory approvals for CRS-207 in pancreatic cancer or other indications, we plan to build a commercial organization with a specialty sales force to market CRS-207. We also plan to retain commercial rights to additional LADD product candidates. In addition, we established a worldwide collaboration with Novartis for STING Activator product candidates in oncology. We also maintain worldwide rights to our STING pathway programs outside of oncology. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Develop novel drug candidates by leveraging our proprietary technology platforms and our understanding of combination therapy in immuno-oncology. We have proprietary technology platforms that we believe can generate novel and combinable therapies to target a wide range of cancers with significant unmet medical need. We plan to invest in these technology platforms to develop additional product candidates. We intend to further explore combination opportunities with conventional and novel treatments, including cellular vaccines, checkpoint inhibitors (including product candidates from the B-select platform), chemotherapy and radiotherapy. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Expand on the value of our product candidates through collaborations. We may decide to selectively partner large and complex oncology indications, in certain geographies and where we believe a partner could bring additional resources and expertise to maximize the value of our product candidates. We entered into two strategic collaborations with Janssen for the treatment of prostate, lung and certain other cancers. We also established a worldwide development and commercialization collaboration with Novartis for STING Activator product candidates in oncology. We believe these collaborations have the potential to drive significant value through the extensive capabilities of these organizations. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Leverage the expertise of our scientific founders and key advisors to develop innovative technologies at the forefront of the immuno-oncology field. Our scientific founders and advisors are from some of the world&#8217;s leading research institutions and have a history of seminal discoveries and significant experience in oncology, immuno-oncology and vaccines. As such, we plan to continue to leverage the collective talent of our scientists, clinicians and a network of highly influential advisors to inform our development strategy and enable our technology to be at the forefront of the immuno-oncology field. We strive to protect our commercially important discoveries and product candidates by applying for, maintaining and defending our patent rights. As of February 12, 2016, our owned U.S. patent portfolio consisted of 22 issued patents and 22 pending patent applications. 

The Aduro Approach to Immuno-Oncology 

We believe that our LADD and STING Pathway Activator technology platforms represent a new, significant advancement within the field of immuno-oncology that can both overcome the limitations of other &#8220;create and expand&#8221; approaches and potentially complement emerging &#8220;remove the brakes&#8221; approaches to immuno-oncology. Our &#8220;create and expand&#8221; approach is designed to prime and enhance innate and adaptive immune responses against cancer cells. In addition, our technology platforms have the potential for combination with conventional and novel therapies, including other immuno-oncology products that modulate the immune response, including checkpoint inhibitors that &#8220;remove the brakes,&#8221; due to the mechanism of action and safety profile. Using our proprietary method of modifying Listeria , we engineer LADD product candidates that are designed to prime and enhance an innate and adaptive immune responses specific for several targets present on tumor cells. We have designed our LADD product candidates to directly address the safety concerns seen with other vector-based vaccines by deleting two genes critical for the virulence of unmodified Listeria . Our LADD product candidates are not neutralized by the patient&#8217;s immune system, thereby allowing for repeat administration as a chronic therapy which has a sustained enhancing of tumor antigen-specific T cell immunity. Our STING Pathway Activator technology platform is designed to specifically activate the STING receptor. Once activated, the STING receptor initiates a profound innate immune response, causing the secretion of cytokines that enhance the adaptive immune response against tumor cells. Both our LADD and STING Pathway Activator technology platforms are intended to prime and enhance an innate and adaptive immune response specific for several targets present on tumor cells. 

Our B-select technology platform further expands our immunotherapy capabilities to encompass mAbs, including preclinical assets that inhibit clinically validated immune checkpoint pathways. Such immune checkpoint inhibitors could potentially be used alone or in combination with our LADD and STING Pathway Activator platforms to increase immunotherapy potency and durability. In addition, we are developing novel preclinical mAbs which inhibit or activate unique immune response pathways that have a role in controlling the progression of diverse malignancies. 

Our Immuno-Oncology Technology Platforms 

LADD Technology Platform Overview 

Listeria is a natural bacterium that has inherent characteristics to recruit and activate natural killer, or NK, cells, triggering a strong and immediate innate immune response. Our LADD technology platform modifies Listeria in two ways: (1) to exclude two harmful genes required for the virulence of the unmodified Listeria and (2) to express and secrete tumor antigens which prime and enhance an adaptive immune response in the form of a T cell attack specifically against tumor cells. 

There are a number of desirable features of the natural biology of Listeria that make it an attractive platform for immuno-oncology drug development, in particular is its ability to induce strong innate and adaptive immune responses by effective stimulation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell immunity. There are also practical features of Listeria -based vaccines, including that they are not neutralized by the patient&#8217;s immune system, are designed for repeat administration and can be manufactured through a relatively simple and cost-effective fermentation process. We believe we have developed a LADD technology platform that is safe yet retains the potency of the natural, or unmodified, bacteria. 

We designed our LADD technology platform to enable the safe administration of Listeria by deleting two genes critical to the bacterium&#8217;s natural virulence, actA and inlB , which are required for the spread from one cell to another and the infection of hepatocytes, respectively. Our method of attenuation results in the complete deletion of actA and inlB virulence genes, and as a result we believe there is no possibility for reversion to unmodified Listeria . The attenuated strain of bacteria is then modified with new genetic material to encode and express specific tumor antigens. Our method of antigen expression involves site-specific insertion of antigen expression cassettes in up to four locations on the chromosome of the attenuated platform strain. 

Upon intravenous administration, our LADD product candidates initially target antigen presenting cells, or APCs, including dendritic cells, or DCs. DCs circulate in the blood stream and continuously monitor their environment for danger signals by sampling proteins known as antigens from dying tumor cells and pathogens such as Listeria . Activated DCs release cytokines and process the sampled antigens and present them on the cell surface to be recognized by T cells, thereby training the T cells to specifically target the 

presented antigens. In this way, DCs are the primary initiators of both the innate and adaptive immune responses and serve as messengers between the innate and adaptive immune systems, as illustrated in the figure below. Our LADD product candidates are designed to leverage the combined effect of broad-based innate immune responses and antigen-specific T cell responses to initiate destruction of tumor cells while sparing normal tissue.

We filed the investigational new drug application, or IND, for CRS-207 for use in combination with GVAX Pancreas for pancreatic cancer in April 2011. The IND for CRS-207 in combination with GVAX Pancreas and nivolumab for pancreatic cancer was filed by The Johns Hopkins University, or JHU, in September 2014. The IND for CRS-207 for use in mesothelioma was filed by Cerus Corporation in June 2007. We filed the IND for CRS-207 for use in combination with epacadostat for ovarian cancer in November 2015.

The IND for ADU-623 for use in glioblastoma was filed by Providence Health &#38; Services in August 2013. 

We have filed INDs for the two programs in collaboration with Janssen, ADU-741 for prostate cancer and ADU-214 for lung cancer. Both of these INDs have been transferred to Janssen. 

CRS-207 

CRS-207 is our lead LADD product candidate. CRS-207 is a monovalent LADD product candidate engineered to express the mesothelin antigen that is over-expressed in pancreatic and mesothelioma tumors. Some studies have shown that mesothelin is over-expressed in the following additional cancer types: ovarian, gastric, lung, triple negative breast, esophageal and colorectal. 

CRS-207 in Pancreatic Cancer 

Pancreatic Cancer Overview 

Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. In 2012, the estimated incidence according to Globocan was 43,000 in the United States and 338,000 worldwide. Pancreatic cancer is aggressive and often not diagnosed until it is too advanced for current treatments to be effective. Most patients are diagnosed after the age of 45, and 94% of patients die within five years from diagnosis. The majority of pancreatic cancer patients are treated with chemotherapy, but this cancer is highly resistant to chemotherapy. Approximately 20% of the pancreatic cancer patients are treated with surgery; however, even for those with successful surgical resection, the median survival is approximately two years. Radiotherapy may be used for locally advanced tumors, but it is not curative. There are currently no approved treatments for second and third-line patients. 

CRS-207 with GVAX Pancreas in Pancreatic Cancer 

CRS-207 combined with GVAX Pancreas is our lead LADD regimen. We are currently conducting two Phase 2b clinical trials, known as ECLIPSE and STELLAR, utilizing CRS-207 in combination with GVAX Pancreas in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. We have obtained orphan drug designation for CRS-207 and GVAX Pancreas for the treatment of pancreatic cancer in the United States and European Union from the FDA and European Medicines Agency, respectively. 

About GVAX and GVAX Pancreas 

GVAX product candidates are a family of vaccines derived from human cancer cell lines that have been engineered to recruit the immune system. In 2013, we acquired the rights, title and interest of ANI Pharmaceuticals Inc. to GVAX Pancreas product candidates. These irradiated tumor cell lines are modified to express GM-CSF, the most potent DC recruitment factor. GVAX induces T cells against a broad array of cancer antigens. Low-dose cyclophosphamide is administered one day prior to GVAX Pancreas to inhibit regulatory T cells. GVAX Pancreas is derived from human pancreatic cancer cell lines and is designed to activate specific T cell immunity to cancer antigens including mesothelin enabling, or priming, a broad-based immune response. 

Preclinical studies have shown the concept of synergy between immune checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-CTLA-4 antibodies and cancer vaccines such as GVAX. For example, researchers at JHU conducted a Phase 1b, open-label, randomized study to build on these preclinical observations by evaluating ipilimumab (a checkpoint inhibitor, anti-CTLA-4 antibody) alone or in combination with GVAX Pancreas for the treatment of previously treated, locally advanced, or metastatic pancreatic cancer. The primary objective of the study was to determine the safety profile. Secondary objectives included estimation of overall survival. A total of 30 patients with previously treated advanced pancreatic cancer were randomized (1:1). The median overall survival was 3.6 months for patients receiving ipilimumab, Arm 1, compared with 5.7 months for patients receiving ipilimumab in combination with GVAX Pancreas, Arm 2 (hazard ratio for death, or HR, = 0.51, p-value = 0.072). The one-year survival probability for patients in Arm 1 was 7% compared to 27% for patients in Arm 2. The hazard ratio is a measure of the risk of a particular event in one group compared to another group, over time. An HR lower than 1.00 indicates that the observed risk is lower in the treatment arm than in the control arm. A p-value is a measure of the statistical significance of the observed result. By convention, a p-value lower than 0.05 is considered statistically significant. Similar to prior ipilimumab studies, 20% of patients in each arm had grade 3/4 immune-related adverse events. Based on the results of the study, the investigators concluded that immune checkpoint blockade in combination with GVAX Pancreas has the potential for clinical benefit and should be evaluated further in a larger study. 

Clinical Status 

Preclinical and Phase 1 clinical studies conducted by Cerus Corporation in 2005-2006 and Anza Therapeutics in 2007-2009 demonstrated the potential of utilizing the heterologous priming and enhancing combination of CRS-207 and GVAX Pancreas. Based on these data, we initiated a randomized controlled Phase 2a clinical trial with this combination. The results of our randomized controlled Phase 2a clinical trial were first presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology, or ASCO, in 2013 and published in the January 2015 issue of the Journal of Clinical Oncology and further supported this combination approach to treat metastatic pancreatic cancer. 

In the randomized controlled Phase 2a clinical trial the combination of CRS-207 with GVAX Pancreas demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in overall survival compared to GVAX Pancreas alone in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer who previously received or refused prior chemotherapy. Based on these data, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for the combination of CRS-207 and GVAX Pancreas. We designed our Phase 2b ECLIPSE clinical trial based on the results we observed in the Phase 2a clinical trial. The ECLIPSE clinical trial is being conducted to compare the clinical outcomes of the combination of CRS-207 and GVAX Pancreas to currently used single agent chemotherapies or to CRS-207 alone. We completed enrollment in ECLIPSE in the third quarter of 2015. 

Phase 2a (Completed) 

We conducted a randomized controlled Phase 2a clinical trial of CRS-207 in combination with GVAX Pancreas in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer who received or refused prior therapy. The 93-patient two-arm study was designed to compare the combination of CRS-207 and GVAX Pancreas versus GVAX Pancreas alone. The trial met the primary efficacy endpoint of overall survival at an interim analysis and was stopped upon recommendation from the Data Monitoring Committee. 

The trial enrolled advanced-stage metastatic pancreatic cancer patients, with most patients having received two or more prior therapies in the metastatic setting. Patients were randomized in a two to one ratio in Arm A, which received GVAX Pancreas vaccine followed by four doses of CRS-207, or Arm B, which received six doses of GVAX Pancreas vaccine alone. In each arm, low dose cyclophosphamide was administered one day prior to GVAX Pancreas in order to enhance its immunogenicity and anti-tumor activity. Low dose cyclophosphamide inhibits T regulatory cells, and T regulatory cells may diminish a vaccine&#8217;s efficacy. Patients were allowed to receive additional treatment courses (a treatment course contains six vaccinations) if they were clinically stable and perceived by the investigator to benefit from treatment. In both arms, treatments are administered at three week intervals, with a four week interval between treatment courses. After a four-week rest, clinically stable patients were offered additional courses. 

&#160;

In January 2014, safety and efficacy data were presented at the ASCO Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium. The study demonstrated a statistically significant survival benefit in patients receiving the combination of CRS-207 and GVAX Pancreas, Arm A, compared to GVAX Pancreas vaccine alone, Arm B. The median overall survival, or mOS, of the patients receiving the combination was 6.1 months compared to 3.9 months for those receiving GVAX Pancreas monotherapy (hazard ratio for death, or HR, = 0.59, one-sided p value = 0.0172). One-year survival probability for patients in Arm A was 24% compared with 12% for patients in Arm B. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve for the full analysis set, patients who received at least one treatment, as of October 2013 is shown below. 

Phase 2a Overall Survival - Full Analysis Set 

&#160;

To better evaluate the effect of CRS-207, we performed a pre-defined subset analysis that included only patients who received at least three doses in either treatment group, GVAX Pancreas followed by at least one CRS-207 dose in Arm A or at least three doses of GVAX Pancreas in Arm B. In this subset of 45 Arm A patients and 21 Arm B patients, the mOS was 9.7 months in Arm A compared to 4.6 months in Arm B (HR = 0.53, one-sided p value = 0.0167). The Kaplan-Meier survival curve for the subset of patients who received at least three doses (per protocol subset) as of October 2013 is shown below. 

Phase 2a Overall Survival - Per Protocol Analysis Set 

&#160;

In addition to the 45 Arm A patients in the per protocol subset who received the combination of CRS-207 and GVAX Pancreas, three Arm B patients were crossed over into combination therapy. Of these 48 patients, nine survived longer than 24 months from randomization. None of the patients who received only GVAX Pancreas survived longer than 21 months. We continue to monitor the long-term survival of patients treated in our Phase 2a clinical trial. As of February 2016, one patient continued to receive the combination treatment and is in the 38 th month of treatment and four patients remained in follow up. 

Carbohydrate antigen 19-9, or CA 19-9, is a serum biomarker used in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer in symptomatic patients and is being studied further to determine if it could also be used as a biomarker for prognosis, overall survival, response to chemotherapy and recurrence. While not statistically significant, we observed a higher proportion of patients with stable or declining levels of CA 19-9 during treatment in Arm A than in Arm B. There was no difference in progression-free survival, or PFS. 

Side effects are known as adverse events, or AEs, and are graded in level of severity from Grade 1 to Grade 4. Grade 1 and 2 AEs are generally characterized as mild. Grade 3 AEs are considered moderate and Grade 4 AEs are considered severe. In our Phase 2a clinical trial, the most frequent drug-related Grade 3 or 4 AE was lymphopenia (an abnormally low level of white blood cells), with three patients experiencing Grade 3 lymphopenia and two patients experiencing Grade 4 lymphopenia. Lymphopenia is expected based on prior nonclinical studies and CRS-207&#8217;s mechanism of action. In addition, the AEs of lymphopenia were self-correcting or did not reveal an unexpected pattern of toxicity. We currently do not plan to alter our development plan for CRS-207 based on these observed AEs of lymphopenia. There were no other Grade 4 AEs, and there were no other Grade 3 AEs with frequencies higher than five percent in either arm. The most common Grade 3 AEs were transient lymphopenia, fevers, elevated liver enzymes and fatigue. One Grade 3 serious AE of listeriosis was reported. At the request of the patient and the investigator, this patient continues to receive study treatment. 

Phase 2b ECLIPSE (Enrollment Completed) 

We are conducting our Phase 2b ECLIPSE clinical trial of CRS-207 in combination with GVAX Pancreas to treat late-stage metastatic pancreatic cancer patients who have received at least one prior line of therapy. The study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CRS-207 in combination with GVAX Pancreas, Arm A, compared to single agent chemotherapies, Arm C, commonly used in this setting. The study also includes an arm in which patients receive CRS-207 as a monotherapy, Arm B, to 

evaluate the contribution of GVAX Pancreas to the combination therapy. The three-arm trial enrolled 303 patients at over 20 clinical trial sites in the United States and Canada. 

Patients were enrolled in two cohorts. The primary cohort includes 214 patients who have received at least two prior treatment regimens for metastatic pancreatic cancer, or third+ line. The exploratory cohort includes 89 patients who have received only one prior treatment regimen for metastatic pancreatic cancer, or second line. Patients were randomized in a one to one to one ratio across each arm of the trial. Patients in Arm A receive two doses of GVAX and four doses of CRS-207. Patients in Arm B receive six doses of CRS-207. Patients in Arm C receive a physician&#8217;s choice of the following single-agent chemotherapies: gemcitabine, 5-Fluorouracil, capecitabine, irinotecan or erlotinib. 

In Arms A and B, treatments are administered at three-week intervals. Low-dose cyclophosphamide is delivered intravenously one day before each GVAX Pancreas treatment. GVAX Pancreas is administered as six intradermal injections. CRS-207 is delivered by one-hour intravenous infusion followed by a four-hour observation period. Oral antibiotics are initiated seven days after the final CRS-207 vaccination of each treatment course. After a four-week rest, clinically stable patients are offered additional courses. 

The primary objective is to compare overall survival, or OS, in the primary cohort between Arms A and C. Secondary/exploratory objectives include comparison of OS in both primary and exploratory cohorts between all treatment arms, assessment of safety and clinical responses through tumor assessments and CA19-9 levels, and correlation of Listeria - and mesothelin-specific T cell and other immunological responses with OS, PFS, best overall response and quality of life. 

The study is 80% powered (one-sided overall alpha = 0.15) for OS in the primary cohort between Arms A and C. 

CRS-207 with GVAX Pancreas and Anti-PD-1 in Pancreatic Cancer 

We have initiated a clinical trial using CRS-207 in combination with GVAX Pancreas and nivolumab, an anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor, in metastatic pancreatic cancer. Nivolumab is being developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb and is currently approved in the U.S. for treatment of melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer and renal cell carcinoma. We anticipate that combining CRS-207 and GVAX Pancreas with a checkpoint inhibitor may further improve clinical outcomes because of their complementary mechanisms of action. 

About Anti-PD-1 

Programmed cell death protein 1, or PD-1, is expressed on the surface of activated T cells, B cells, and DCs. PD-1 and associated ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, negatively regulate immune responses with the ligands expressed on many murine tumor cell lines. Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies, a class of checkpoint inhibitors, target this novel immunosuppressive pathway with the goal of strengthening the anti-tumor T cell response by impairing the interaction of the inhibitory receptor PD-1 on T cells with PD-L1 expressed on tumor cells. While anti-PD-1 therapies have shown efficacy in subsets of patients in some tumor types, patients with certain cancers have not responded to treatment with anti-PD-1 in early clinical trials, including pancreatic cancer patients. Based on preclinical models and early clinical data, we believe that checkpoint inhibitors when combined with strong adaptive immune cell stimulators, such as cancer vaccines, can have an amplified anti-tumor effect against poorly immunogenic tumors. These results provide rationale for further testing of checkpoint inhibitors in combination with other immunotherapies. 

Clinical Status 

The investigator-sponsored randomized controlled Phase 2b clinical trial, or STELLAR, is supported by Aduro, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Stand Up to Cancer, PanCAN/AACR and the Lustgarten Foundation. STELLAR is designed to explore the synergistic effects on our treatment regimen in combination with nivolumab. The first patient was dosed in the first quarter of 2015. 

Phase 2b STELLAR (Ongoing) 

Our STELLAR clinical trial is a randomized controlled Phase 2b clinical trial of CRS-207 in combination with GVAX Pancreas and nivolumab in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer who have received only one prior line of therapy in the metastatic setting. The ongoing 102-patient randomized controlled two-arm Phase 2b clinical trial is being conducted by leading investigators at five U.S. clinical trial sites. Patients receive either the combination therapy with nivolumab or the combination therapy alone. The primary endpoint of the trial is overall survival and secondary endpoints include evaluation of clinical and immune response and safety.

CRS-207 in Mesothelioma 

Mesothelioma Overview 

Malignant mesothelioma is a tumor in the tissue lining, most commonly the tissue lining surrounding the lungs. Mesothelioma is a relatively rare disease; it is estimated that the incidence in the United States is approximately 3,000 cases per year. 

Malignant mesothelioma carries a poor prognosis with a mOS of approximately 12 months from diagnosis. Mesothelioma is currently treated with surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. 

CRS-207 with Chemotherapy in Mesothelioma 

We are using CRS-207 in combination with standard-of-care chemotherapy for treatment in the front line-setting of unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma. We have obtained orphan drug designation for CRS-207 for the treatment of mesothelioma in the United States and European Union from the FDA and European Medicines Agency, respectively.

&#160;

About Chemotherapy 

Chemotherapy can be an effective treatment option to enhance immune responses, inhibit immunosuppression and modify the tumor microenvironment to be more susceptible to immune-mediated killing. This provides a strong rationale to use chemotherapies in combination with a LADD product candidate to trigger robust innate and adaptive immune responses in a more susceptible tumor environment. 

Clinical Status 

We have completed enrollment in our single-arm Phase 1b clinical trial of CRS-207 in combination with standard-of-care chemotherapy in patients with unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma who have not received prior therapy. A total of 38 patients were treated under this regimen. Based on encouraging results, we have opened an exploratory cohort within the same population in which patients receive the addition of low-dose cyclophosphamide intravenously one day before each CRS-207 in combination with standard-of-care chemotherapy. 

Phase 1b (Enrollment Completed, Exploratory Cohort Ongoing) 

The study design is single-arm; patients receive two prime CRS-207 vaccinations followed by standard-of-care chemotherapy, consisting of pemetrexed and cisplatin, or PEM/CIS, and then followed with boost and maintenance vaccinations of CRS-207. The study was initially designed to enroll 16 patients. The primary endpoints of the study are safety and immune response to the CRS-207 therapy. Secondary endpoints include tumor response, time to progression, immune analyses and tumor marker kinetics. 

&#160;

&#160;

In August 2015, data from scheduled radiologic time points of 34 evaluable patients was renewed and disease control was observed in 94% (32/34), including 59% (20/34) with partial responses and 35% (12/34) experiencing stable disease following treatment with CRS-207 and chemotherapy. Median duration of response was 5.3 months (95% CI: 4.7-16.7 months) and median progression free survival was 8.5 months (95% CI: 6.9 &#8211; 10.8 months). No treatment-related serious adverse events or unexpected toxicities were observed. Treatment, follow-up and immune response evaluations are ongoing. Radiologic images were also read by an independent, central radiologist supporting our investigators&#8217; findings. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Phase 3 (Planned) 

We have conducted meetings with the U.S. FDA and Paul-Ehrlich-Institut to discuss Phase 3 plans for our mesothelioma program. We expect to initiate a randomized controlled Phase 3 clinical trial in North America, Europe and Australia to evaluate OS, PFS, overall response rate, and safety of the combination therapy of CRS-207 and standard-of-care chemotherapy.

CRS-207 in Ovarian Cancer 

Ovarian Cancer Overview 

In the United States, ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer-related death in women. It is estimated that the incidence in the United States is approximately 21,000 cases per year.

Epithelial ovarian cancer is the most common and lethal form of ovarian cancer. Prognosis for survival depends on the stage of the disease at diagnosis; however, most women are diagnosed with advanced stage ovarian cancer, with a 5-year survival of only 30%. For patients with advanced stage ovarian cancer, surgical removal of the tumor is generally performed. Standard of care for these patients is then platinum-based combination chemotherapy. However, of the 60% to 80% of patients who present with advanced disease and who respond to first-line chemotherapy, more than 75% will develop resistant or recurrent disease. Ultimately, almost all patients develop platinum chemotherapy resistance.

CRS-207 with epacadostat in Ovarian Cancer 

We are using CRS-207 in combination with Incyte&#8217;s investigational selective IDO1 inhibitor, epacadostat, for treatment in platinum resistant epithelial ovarian, fallopian, or primary peritoneal cancer patients that have progressed within 6 months after completing platinum-based chemotherapy. This study is being conducted by us in collaboration with Incyte. 

About epacadostat

Epacadostat is an inhibitor of the enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, or IDO1. IDO1 is an immunosuppressive enzyme that has been shown to induce regulatory T cell generation and activation, and allow tumors to escape immune surveillance. Epacadostat is an orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of IDO1 that has nanomolar potency in both biochemical and cellular assays and has demonstrated potent activity in enhancing T lymphocyte, dendritic cell and natural killer cell responses in vitro, with a high degree of selectivity. Together, epacadostat, which has been shown to enhance activities of multiple types of immune cells by reducing the immune suppression characteristic of the tumor microenvironment, and CRS-207, which has shown to stimulate immune cell activity with particular targeting mechanisms that seek and attack tumor cells that express mesothelin like those found in ovarian cancer, provide a strong rationale to use in combination for ovarian cancer.

Clinical Status 

Aduro entered into a clinical trial agreement with Incyte to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of CRS-207, in combination with epacadostat in patients with ovarian cancer. Under the terms of the agreement, we will collaborate with Incyte on a non-exclusive basis to evaluate the combination. We will be responsible for conducting the study and the results will be used to determine whether further clinical development of this combination is warranted. Costs for the trial will be shared on an equal basis.

Phase 1/2 (Planned) 

The Phase 1/2 trial is designed to test combinations of CRS-207 with two dose levels of epacadostat in dose escalation and then will expand to a Phase 2 evaluating the combination at the optimal dose level compared to CRS-207 alone based on safety and tumor biomarkers. The study plans to enroll up to 42 patients in Phase 1 and up to 86 patients in Phase 2 with platinum-resistant ovarian, fallopian or peritoneal cancers.

ADU-623 in Glioblastoma Multiforme 

ADU-623 is a bivalent LADD product candidate engineered to express EGFRvIII and NY-ESO-1, antigens expressed in glioblastoma multiforme, as well as other cancers. 

Glioblastoma Multiforme Overview 

Glioblastoma multiforme is a brain cancer with an incidence of approximately 11,000 people in the United States in 2013 according to Datamonitor Healthcare. These tumors are rapidly progressing, with a median time from diagnosis to the patient&#8217;s death of approximately 15 months. In recurrent glioblastoma multiforme, treatment consists of both symptomatic and palliative therapies. However, with currently available therapies glioblastoma multiforme typically remains fatal within a very short period of time. 

Clinical Status 

ADU-623 is being evaluated in an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial conducted by leading investigators at the Earle A. Chiles Research Institute at Providence Cancer Center in Portland, Oregon. 

Phase 1 (Ongoing) 

The Phase 1, dose escalation, safety and immunogenicity trial will enroll up to a total of 38 patients in the second-line. Second-line glioblastoma multiforme patients are those who have previously completed standard-of-care radiotherapy and temozolomide followed by adjuvant temozolomide or who have progressed following standard-of-care radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The study will evaluate three dose levels of ADU-623 with the primary endpoint of establishing the safety of the therapy and determining the optimal dose. The trial will also evaluate the patients&#8217; tumor responses and immune response to the ADU-623 therapy. 

ADU-741 in Prostate Cancer 

ADU-741 is a LADD product candidate engineered to express multiple antigens, and is under partnership with Janssen, which has exclusive rights to certain LADD-based product candidates specifically engineered for the treatment of prostate cancer. 

Prostate Cancer Overview 

According to the American Cancer Society, approximately one in seven men in the United States will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in his lifetime. According to Globocan, the incidence of prostate cancer was 233,000 cases in the United States and 1.1 million cases worldwide in 2012. 

Clinical Status 

In May 2014, we entered into an agreement whereby we granted Janssen an exclusive, worldwide license to certain product candidates specifically engineered for the treatment of prostate cancer, based on our novel LADD technology platform for any and all uses. We are eligible to receive up to a potential total of $365.0 million in upfront fees and development and commercialization milestones. Janssen will have exclusive rights to develop and commercialize LADD product candidates in prostate cancer and will assume responsibility for all research, development, manufacturing, regulatory and commercialization activities for the licensed products. 

Phase 1 (Ongoing)

Janssen initiated the Phase 1 trial in prostate cancer in the fourth quarter of 2015. The Phase 1 study will evaluate intravenous administration of ADU-741 in patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer.

ADU-214 in Lung Cancer 

ADU-214 is a bivalent LADD product candidate expressing EGFRvIII and mesothelin, and is licensed to Janssen, which has exclusive rights for LADD product candidates for lung cancer indications and exclusive rights to develop and commercialize LADD product candidates expressing these antigens for any and all uses. 

Lung Cancer Overview 

Lung cancer causes more deaths than the next three leading causes of cancer deaths&#8212;colon, breast and prostate cancers&#8212;combined. According to Globocan, there were an estimated 214,000 new cases of lung cancer diagnosed in the United States in 2012 and 1.8 million new cases of lung cancer diagnosed worldwide in 2012. 

Clinical Status 

In November 2014, an additional agreement with Janssen became effective, granting Janssen an exclusive, worldwide license to certain product candidates engineered for the treatment of lung cancer and certain other cancers based on our novel LADD technology platform for any and all uses. Under the agreement we are eligible to receive significant development, regulatory and commercialization milestone payments up to a potential total of $817.0 million. Janssen will have exclusive rights to develop and commercialize LADD product candidates in lung cancer and will assume responsibility for all research, development, manufacturing, regulatory and commercialization activities for the licensed products. 

Phase 1 (Ongoing)

Janssen initiated the Phase 1 trial in lung cancer in the fourth quarter of 2015. The Phase 1 study will evaluate intravenous administration of ADU-214 in patients with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. 

STING Pathway Activator Technology Platform Overview 

Recent advancements reported in numerous leading scientific journals have generated significant interest and rationale for targeting the STING receptor as a novel therapeutic approach to immuno-oncology. We are developing a portfolio of STING Activator product candidates, synthetic proprietary small molecule immune modulators that target and activate the STING receptor with applications across diverse diseases. The STING receptor is generally expressed at high levels in the cytosol of immune cells, including DCs. Once activated, the STING receptor initiates a profound innate immune response by signaling through three distinct pathways, inducing the expression of a broad profile of cytokines, including interferons and chemokines. This cytokine profile subsequently leads to the development of an effective tumor antigen-specific T cell adaptive immune response. 

Naturally occurring cyclic dinucleotides, or CDNs, that target the STING receptor are produced by bacteria that secrete CDNs into the host cell or by mammalian cells through cyclic GMP-AMP synthetase, or cGAS. cGAS is a recently discovered receptor that senses double-stranded, or ds, DNA in the cytosol of APCs, and in response synthesizes a CDN that is structurally distinct from the CDNs produced by bacteria. While both bacterial- and cGAS-produced CDNs target and activate the STING receptor, CDNs 

produced by cGAS bind more tightly to STING than CDNs produced by bacteria. This stronger binding triggers a larger and more stable change in shape of the STING receptor, leading to the development of a more effective tumor antigen-specific immune response. Additionally, while some of the five unique STING receptors in humans respond poorly to CDNs produced by bacteria, all respond to CDNs produced by cGAS. We are advancing through development novel synthetic STING Activator product candidates that contain a structure based on the cGAS-produced CDNs, thus stimulating potent innate immune responses to all of the known human STING receptors. 

We have developed proprietary STING Activator derivative compounds that are significantly more potent than the natural cGAS-produced molecules, which can be demonstrated by comparing the expression levels the cytokines produced from signaling through three distinct pathways. The NF- &#107; B pathway induces the expression of numerous pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6 and TNF &#97; that stimulate a variety of immune cells. The IRF-3 pathway leads to the induction of IFN- &#98; and co-regulated genes which orchestrate diverse innate immune responses. The STAT6 pathway leads to expression of chemokines, including CCL2 and CCL20 that are involved in immune cell recruitment. The unique profile of cytokines induced through activating the STING receptor results in strong efficacy in numerous aggressive preclinical mouse models of cancer. 

In healthy individuals, DCs and other APCs constantly sample nearby tumor and non-tumor cells, however, in cancer patients, tumors can produce immune-inhibitory molecules which can make the DCs non-functional. The activation of the STING receptor in the tumor microenvironment by IT injection of our proprietary STING Activator product candidates stimulate the maturation of the DCs, leading to the presentation of antigens found on the individual&#8217;s unique tumor. The activated tumor-specific T cells induce tumor cell death both locally and systemically, resulting in significant and durable therapeutic efficacy in preclinical tumor models. 

STING Activator Product Candidates 

We envision multiple immuno-oncology STING Activator product opportunities as a monotherapy or in combination with other cancer treatments. In preclinical animal models, our data have shown that our proprietary STING Activator product candidates can be combined with designated recombinant proteins to induce potent antigen-specific CD4+, which recognize foreign antigens and assist in the immune response, and CD8+, which recognize and destroy cells expressing foreign antigens, T cell immunity. We believe our STING Activator product candidates can also be combined with conventional cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy to enhance our STING Activator product candidates&#8217; immune-mediated tumor killing mechanisms. We also believe that our STING Activator product candidates could alter the nature of the tumor microenvironment, thus allowing for improved responses to checkpoint inhibitors. 

ADU-S100 

Our lead STING Activator product candidate is ADU-S100, with proprietary modifications to the mammalian CDN structure designed to optimize stability, STING receptor binding affinity and potency, without significant toxicity. In March 2015, we entered into a worldwide collaboration with Novartis to further advance the research and development of STING agonist candidates in oncology. 

ADU-S100 Preclinical Studies 

In preclinical mouse tumor models, IT injection of ADU-S100 induced tumor shrinkage and generated substantial immune responses that may be capable of providing long-lasting systemic antigen-specific T cell immunity to prevent further growth of distal, untreated tumor metastases, a response known as an abscopal effect. Further preclinical studies demonstrated that the abscopal effect is entirely STING receptor-dependent. These data provide the rationale for advancing this novel molecule for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic cancers. 

Further rationale for the approach of IT injection of ADU-S100 is the recent discovery by Dr. Thomas Gajewski of the University of Chicago that the STING-dependent innate immune sensing in the tumor microenvironment is a critical step in promoting spontaneous tumor-initiated T cell priming, subsequent infiltration of tumor lymphocytes and tumor regression. Analyses conducted 

with tumors isolated from melanoma patients have also revealed that tumors containing infiltrating activated T cells are characterized by an IFN-&#223; transcriptional signature. Studies in mice have demonstrated that IFN-&#223; signaling plays a critical role in tumor-initiated T cell priming. We believe that treatment strategies to induce IFN-&#223; signaling and DC activation in the tumor microenvironment to bridge the innate and adaptive immune responses have significant therapeutic potential. IT delivery of our synthetic STING Activator product candidates activate a tumor-specific T cell response that is unique to the individual&#8217;s tumor; conceptually, a small molecule approach to patient-specific immuno-oncology treatments. 

Single Agent ADU-S100 (B16 Melanoma Therapeutic Model) 

Proprietary ADU-S100 versus Naturally Occurring cGAS CDN

&#160;

&#160;

In the preclinical study depicted above, mice were injected with melanoma tumor cells. Once the tumor grew to be 100 mm 3 , groups of mice were given three 50 &#181;g IT doses of ML cGAMP, a naturally occurring cGAS CDN, or ADU-S100. In addition, one group was treated with Hank&#8217;s Balanced Salt Solution, or HBSS, as a control. All three doses of the compounds were given over the same one-week period. In this study we demonstrated that ADU-S100 in mice had superior anti-tumor activity as compared to a naturally occurring cGAS CDN. 

ADU-S100 Versus TLR Ligands (B16 Melanoma Therapeutic Model) 

Proprietary ADU-S100 versus TLR Ligands 

&#160;

&#160;

In this experiment, similar in design to the prior experiment, mice were injected with melanoma tumor cells and received three IT doses of select compounds over the same one-week period once the tumors grew to be 100 mm 3 . ADU-S100 was compared to TLR ligand product candidates in order to compare against other innate immune activators which are currently in clinical development by other companies. The doses of the IT injections for the TLR ligands and ADU-S100 were kept constant at 50 &#181;g. While it is appreciated that the doses may not be optimized for each TLR ligand, the same dosing was used for consistency. In addition, one group was treated with HBSS, as a control. The results from this study supported the selection of ADU-S100 for tumor regression and control. 

IT STING Activator Therapy with ADU-S100 Induces a Potent Abscopal Effect (B16 Melanoma Therapeutic Model) 

In the preclinical study designed to examine the abscopal effect, mice were injected with melanoma cells on their right flank to create the primary tumor, and also given additional melanoma cells one week later by intravenous injection to create lung metastases, distal tumor lesions. The primary tumor was treated three times over a one-week period with 50 &#181;g of ADU-S100, or HBSS, as a control. On day 28, the lungs were examined to determine the number of lung metastases. Mice treated with ADU-S100 in the primary tumor showed significant inhibition of the treated tumor and additionally demonstrated a significant inhibition of distant lung metastases. The photographs of the lungs are representative of the two treatment groups and show the contrast in the number of lung metastases (black nodules) between the control group, where numerous metastases are visible, and the treatment group, where only a few metastases are visible. Thus, these results show that IT injection with ADU-S100 primes an effective systemic CD8+ T cell immune response that significantly inhibits the growth of distal untreated lesions. 

Clinical Status 

In March 2015, we established a worldwide collaboration with Novartis to further advance the research and development of STING Activator product candidates in oncology. We filed the IND for ADU-S100, our first STING Activator product candidate, in the fourth quarter of 2015. 

Phase 1 (Planned) 

We expect to initiate a Phase 1 trial with our lead STING Activator product candidate, ADU-S100, in collaboration with Novartis. The Phase 1 study will evaluate safety and tolerability of ADU-S100 in patients with cutaneously accessible, treatment-refractory primary or metastatic solid tumors or lymphomas. 

STING Pathway Opportunities 

We envision multiple product opportunities for the STING Pathway Activator technology platform. We believe that our STING Activator product candidates can be used as a monotherapy to directly activate the tumor microenvironment, enhancing recognition of the tumor by the immune system and leading to tumor destruction. In preclinical animal models, we have shown that our proprietary STING Activator product candidates can be co-formulated with designated recombinant proteins to induce potent antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell immunity. We believe that due to our STING Activator product candidates&#8217; immune-mediated tumor killing mechanisms and ability to alter the nature of the tumor microenvironment our proprietary STING Activator product candidates could be combined with conventional and novel therapies, such as cellular vaccines, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and checkpoint inhibitors, among others. 

In addition, our STING Activator product candidates directly activate natural killer cells and could enhance Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity, or ADCC, tumor cell killing mechanisms, which are a significant mechanism of action of several established monoclonal antibody therapies. Another possible opportunity would be to directly conjugate our STING Activator product candidates to enhance ADCC. 

We also believe that our STING pathway product candidates have the potential to be used in treatments for infectious and autoimmune diseases as an adjuvant to enhance existing vaccines or in formulations for new products. We are also developing other STING Inhibitors that, in contrast to our current STING Activator product candidate that activates the STING receptor, would block the STING receptor, thus preventing or controlling the immune response which is key in the treatment of autoimmune diseases. 

Manufacturing

Overview 

We rely on third-party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to produce our product candidates for clinical use and currently do not own or operate manufacturing facilities. We have established manufacturing processes and supply and quality agreements for all of the investigational agents used in our ongoing clinical trials. We require that our CMOs produce bulk drug substances and finished drug products in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs, and all other applicable laws and regulations. We may continue to rely on CMOs to manufacture our products for commercial sale. We maintain agreements with potential and existing manufacturers that include confidentiality and intellectual property provisions to protect our proprietary rights. 

LADD Product Candidates 

LADD product candidates are produced through a fermentation process and then concentrated and purified. The drug substance is diluted into a cryopreservative and filled into vials that are inspected, labeled and frozen as final drug product. We have contracts with IDT Biologika GmbH, or IDT, and Waisman Clinical BioManufacturing to produce and release LADD product candidates. We 

recently transitioned manufacturing of our lead LADD product candidate, CRS-207, to IDT, which can support commercial manufacturing. 

Under our process development and manufacturing agreement with IDT, which we entered into in December 2013, IDT provides manufacturing services for CRS-207. We pay for manufacturing services performed by IDT under the agreement pursuant to a work plan described in the agreement. 

We may unilaterally terminate the agreement in the event of a material breach of the agreement by IDT if such breach remains uncured after 45 days of receiving written notice of such breach. In addition, either party may terminate the agreement in the event of the other party&#8217;s insolvency. Either party may also terminate the agreement by providing 30 days&#8217; written notice to the other party if we decide to end our CRS-207 program, solely for reasons of clinical inefficacy or safety, or an action by the FDA, EMA or other regulatory authority not granting approval despite commercially reasonable efforts to gain such approval. 

GVAX Pancreas Product Candidates 

GVAX Pancreas product candidates are engineered cell lines that express GM-CSF and have been lethally irradiated to prevent replication. GVAX Pancreas is composed of two allogeneic pancreatic cancer cell lines that are expanded in cell factories. The cells are harvested, concentrated, purified and then lethally gamma irradiated. GVAX Pancreas is frozen, stored and transported in vapor-phase liquid nitrogen. We have contracts with Lonza Walkersville, Inc., or Lonza, and JHU to produce and release GVAX Pancreas product candidates. We recently began transferring the manufacturing process to Lonza, which can support commercial production of GVAX Pancreas product candidates. 

Under our manufacturing services agreement with Lonza, which we entered into in August 2012, Lonza provides manufacturing services to produce cell lines for our GVAX Pancreas product candidates. We pay for manufacturing services performed by Lonza under the agreement pursuant to statements of work entered into from time to time. 

We may unilaterally terminate the agreement upon 45 days&#8217; written notice to Lonza. Lonza may terminate the agreement upon 12 months&#8217; written notice to us. Either party may terminate the agreement in the event of the other party&#8217;s insolvency or for the other party&#8217;s material breach of the agreement if such breach remains uncured after 30 days of receiving written notice of such breach or after 90 days of receiving written notice of such breach if such breach is not capable of being cured within 30 days and the breaching party is making diligent efforts to cure such breach. Absent early termination, the agreement will continue until the fifth anniversary of the effective date of the original agreement. 

STING Activator Product Candidates 

Manufacturing of our STING Activator product candidates generally encompasses both the chemical synthesis of the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, and its formulation and fill/finish of the final product. The synthetic process for the manufacture of our STING Activator product candidates is a trade secret and we retain control and ownership of the process. We have contracted with a CMO to produce, release and stability test the ADU-S100 API. We have also entered into a drug product manufacturing and clinical supply agreement with a CMO for the formulation and fill/finish and release and stability testing of the drug product candidate. 

Intellectual Property

Intellectual property is of vital importance in our field and in biotechnology generally. We seek to protect and enhance proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business by seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We will also seek to rely on regulatory protection afforded through orphan drug designations, data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions where available. 

We have obtained orphan drug designations for GVAX Pancreas and CRS-207 for the treatment of pancreatic cancer and for CRS-207 for the treatment of mesothelioma, which makes them eligible for a period of orphan drug exclusivity, if approved, under certain conditions. We believe that each of our different biological products approved under a biologics license application, or BLA, will be eligible for 12 years of market exclusivity in the United States, 10 years of market exclusivity in Europe and significant durations in other markets, which would be complementary to any relevant patent exclusivity. 

Through licensing and through developing our own portfolio, we have rights to more than 100 issued patents and more than 200 pending applications in the United States and foreign countries. Families within the portfolio are directed to our LADD and STING Pathway Activator technology platforms, and to GVAX. 

LADD Technology Platform 

We own twelve issued U.S. patents, ten pending U.S. patent applications, and corresponding foreign issued patents and patent applications, and additionally we are the exclusive licensee to families of patents and patent applications, all relating to our LADD technology platform.

We have also filed U.S. and international patent applications 

directed to a modified actA fusion protein, which, if issued, would cover ADU-623, ADU-214 and our future LADD product candidates. If patents with such claims are issued, they could extend the technology platform patent protection for such products until 2033. 

EGFRvIII Family 

Within this portfolio are an issued U.S. patent and pending U.S. and corresponding foreign patent applications that we co-own with Providence Health &#38; Services&#8211;Oregon, a family of patent applications that are directed to Listeria strains that express EGFRvIII antigen. This technology is included in our ADU-623, ADU-214 and other product candidates. The issued U.S. patent expires in 2031, not including any patent term extensions that may be available under U.S. laws and assuming continued payment of any applicable fees. 

Combination Therapy with LADD 

Additionally, within this portfolio are U.S. patents and pending applications directed to compositions that can be used in conjunction with or as an adjuvant to the LADD technology platform. For example, we have an issued U.S. patent directed to a method of enhancing an immune response to mesothelin by administering a boost dose of an attenuated Listeria that encodes an active mesothelin antigen after administration of an effective amount of an inactivated tumor cell that encodes GM-CSF. These claims could cover the use of CRS-207 in combination with GVAX. This patent expires in 2027, not including any patent term extensions that may be available under U.S. laws and assuming continued payment of any applicable fees. In addition, we have an issued U.S. patent and corresponding foreign applications directed to a method of treating cancer by administering an attenuated Listeria that encodes an active portion of a cancer antigen after administration of an effective amount of radiotherapy as a primary therapy, and also after administration of an effective amount of an inactivated tumor cell that encodes GM-CSF and the cancer antigen. These claims could cover the use of CRS-207 in combination with GVAX. This patent expires in 2031, not including any patent term extensions that may be available under U.S. laws. 

STING Activator Family 

We own and license families of patent applications directed to our STING Activator product candidates, which target the STING receptor, which, if issued, would expire between 2025 and 2036. In particular, we own three pending U.S. patent applications and corresponding pending foreign patent applications directed to stereochemically pure cyclic purine dinucleotides and certain other substituted cyclic purine dinucleotides, which if issued would expire in 2033 and 2034, and four provisional patent applications directed to certain substituted cyclic purine dinucleotides, which if issued would expire in 2036. Within this portfolio are U.S. and international patent applications directed to systems and methods for activating STING utilizing our STING Activator product candidates that are jointly owned with the Regents of the University of California, and which, if issued, would expire in 2034. Also within this portfolio are U.S. and international patent applications directed to the use of our STING Activator product candidates in conjunction with cytokine expressing cells, for instance CSF-expressing cells, that are owned jointly with JHU, and which, if issued, would expire in 2033 and 2034. We also license a family of patents from Karagen Pharmaceuticals directed to certain STING Activator molecules and their use in modulating immune response in a patient, which expire in 2025, a family of patents from the Regents of the University of California also directed to certain STING Activator molecules and their uses that, if issued, would expire in 2034, and a family of patents from a consortium of universities led by Memorial Sloan Kettering also directed to certain STING Activator molecules and their uses that, if issued, would expire in 2034. 

GVAX Technology 

We own ten issued U.S. patents and four pending U.S. patent applications and exclusively license multiple families of patents and patent applications that cover cell lines that express GM-CSF. This technology is referred to as GVAX. We license a family of patents from JHU that covers the first generation GVAX platform, including a U.S. patent specifically covering GVAX Pancreas. The patents in this family are expected to expire between 2016 and 2022; however, we have a license with JHU for continued exclusive use of the cell lines produced by JHU after the patents expire. Additionally, in 2013, we entered into another license agreement with JHU relating to GVAX technology that includes toll-like receptor ligands. This GVAX technology includes two international patent applications, which, if issued, would expire in 2031 to 2032. 

Other Technology 

In addition to the technologies described in detail above, we license or own other intellectual property directed to compositions and methods that could be used in conjunction with our Listeria technology platform. The intellectual property is directed to, for example, methods of administering our Listeria products in conjunction with other therapeutics. Additionally, we have licensed technology from UC Berkeley that enables us to integrate expression sequences more easily into Listeria and allows us to develop multivalent vaccines more quickly and efficiently. We have an exclusive license to this technology, which expires in 2022, subject to any extensions or disclaimers of the licensed patents. 

General Considerations 

As with other biopharmaceutical companies, our ability to maintain and solidify a proprietary position for our lead product candidates will depend upon our success in obtaining effective patent claims that cover such product candidates and their intended methods of use, and enforcing those claims once granted. 

The term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug or biologic may be eligible for patent term extension, which provides patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug or biologic is under regulatory review. Patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug or biologic may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug or biologic. In the future, if and when our biopharmaceutical products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. 

Many biopharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies and academic institutions are competing with us in the field of oncology and filing patent applications potentially relevant to our business. Even when a third-party patent is identified, we may conclude upon a thorough analysis, that we do not infringe upon the patent or that the patent is invalid. If the third-party patent owner disagrees with our conclusion and we continue with the business activity in question, we may be subject to patent litigation. Alternatively, we might decide to initiate litigation in an attempt to have a court declare the third-party patent invalid or non-infringed by our activity. In either scenario, patent litigation typically is costly and time-consuming, and the outcome can be favorable or unfavorable. 

In addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain a competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, through confidentiality agreements with our employees, collaborators, contractors and consultants, and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have agreements with some of our consultants that require them to assign to us any inventions created as a result of their working with us. The confidentiality agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of agreements or clauses requiring invention assignment, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. 

Our commercial success will depend in part upon not infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent would require us or our licensee(s) to alter our development or commercial strategies, obtain licenses, or cease certain activities. The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. If a third party commences a patent infringement action against us, or our licensee(s), it could consume significant financial and management resources, regardless of the merit of the claims or the outcome of the litigation. 

We may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology 

systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our consultants, contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.

Novartis Agreement 

In March 2015, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Novartis pursuant to which we are collaborating worldwide with Novartis regarding the development and commercialization of products containing an agonist of the molecular target known as STING in the field of oncology, including immuno-oncology and cancer vaccines. Under this agreement, or the Novartis Agreement, we granted Novartis a co-exclusive license to develop such products worldwide, an exclusive license to commercialize such products outside the United States and a non-exclusive license to support us in commercializing such products in the United States if we request such support. The collaboration is guided by a joint steering committee with each party having final decision making authority regarding specified areas of development or commercialization. 

Pursuant to the Novartis Agreement, each party is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to perform specified development activities in accordance with a development plan. Novartis is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize products developed under the collaboration outside the United States and we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize the products in the United States. 

Under the Novartis Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $200 million from Novartis. We are also eligible to receive up to an additional $250 million in development milestones and up to an additional $250 million in regulatory approval milestones. 

We are responsible for 38% of the joint development costs worldwide and Novartis is responsible for the remaining 62% of the joint development costs worldwide. We will also receive 50% of all profits for any products commercialized pursuant to this collaboration in the United States and 45% of all profits for specified European countries and Japan. For each of these profit share countries, each party will be responsible for its respective commercial sharing percentage of all joint commercialization costs incurred in that country. For all other countries where we are not sharing profits, Novartis will be responsible for all commercialization costs 

and will pay us a royalty in the mid-teens on all net sales of product sold by Novartis, its affiliates and sublicensees, with such percentage subject to reduction post patent and data exclusivity expiration and subject to reduction, capped at a specified percentage, for royalties payable to third party licensors. Novartis&#8217; royalty obligation will run on a country-by-country basis until the later of expiration of the last valid claim covering the product, expiration of data exclusivity for the product and 12 years after first commercial sale of the product in such country. 

With respect to the United States, specified European countries and/or Japan, we may elect for such region to either reduce by 50% or to eliminate in full our development cost sharing obligation. If we elect to reduce our cost sharing percentage by 50% in any such region, then our profit share in such region will also be reduced by 50%. If we elect to eliminate our development cost sharing obligation, then such region will be removed from the profit share, and instead Novartis will owe us royalties on net sales of product for such region, as described above. 

The Novartis Agreement will continue in effect until the later of (i) the date on which the parties mutually agree to cease the commercialization of products in the profit share region and (ii) the date on which Novartis&#8217; royalty obligations cease. Either party may terminate the Novartis Agreement upon the other party&#8217;s uncured material breach, for the other party&#8217;s bankruptcy or insolvency, or for safety reasons. Additionally, Novartis may terminate the Novartis Agreement for convenience at any time after March 19, 2018 upon 180 days&#8217; notice.

Under the Karagen Agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize licensed products in the United States and the European Union. 

Under the Karagen Agreement, we are required to make milestone payments totaling up to $900,000, in aggregate, for the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones as well as royalties based on net sales of products by us, our affiliates and sublicensees at rates ranging in the low single-digit percentages, determined by whether the disease field is an exclusive or non-exclusive disease field, subject to minimum annual royalties and standard reductions. In addition, we are required to pay Karagen a percentage of consideration received from any sublicensing arrangements ranging from the mid-single digits to the mid-teen digits determined by the current stage of development of the relevant licensed product at the time of the sublicense grant, or by whether we have exercised our option to add a designated field of use to its exclusive license, as applicable. 

The Karagen Agreement will expire, on a country-by-country basis, upon the expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim within the licensed patent rights. Either party may terminate the Karagen Agreement upon 90 days&#8217; advance written notice in the event of the other party&#8217;s material breach that is not cured within such 90-day period, and immediately upon notice in the event of the other party&#8217;s 

bankruptcy or insolvency. Additionally, we may terminate the Karagen Agreement at will upon 90 days&#8217; advance written notice to Karagen. 

UCB Vance Agreement 

In September 2014, we entered into a license agreement with UCB, granting us an exclusive, worldwide sublicenseable license under certain patent rights covering the use of the STING Activator molecules that activate the STING receptor to make, develop, use and commercialize products, to practice methods and to offer services, in each case that are covered by the licensed patent rights, in all fields of use. Under this agreement, or the UCB Vance Agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, manufacture and sell licensed products and services and are obligated to achieve specified development and regulatory milestones by specified dates. 

Under the UCB Vance Agreement, we paid UCB an upfront fee of $50,000 in 2014 and are required to make future milestone payments totaling up to $1.5 million, in the aggregate, upon our achievement of certain specified development and regulatory milestones for the first indication and up to $250,000 upon our achievement of a specified development and regulatory milestone for each additional indication developed. Under the UCB Vance Agreement, we are obligated to pay UCB royalties based on net sales of licensed products and services sold by us and our sublicensees at a rate in the low single-digit percentages, subject to minimum annual royalties and customary reductions, and a percentage of consideration received from any sublicensing arrangements at rates ranging from the low-single digits to the low thirties, determined by the current stage of development of the relevant licensed product at the time the sublicense is granted. 

The UCB Vance Agreement will continue in effect until the expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim within the licensed patent rights. UCB may terminate the agreement upon 90 days&#8217; advance written notice in the event of our material breach that is not cured within such 90-day period. We may terminate the agreement at will upon 90 days&#8217; advance written notice. UCB may the terminate agreement upon 90 days&#8217; advance written notice in the event we challenge the validity or unenforceability of any licensed patent. 

MSK Agreement 

In December 2014, we entered into a license agreement with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, or MSK, The Rockefeller University, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, and University of Bonn, collectively the Licensors, pursuant to which we received an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license under certain patents related to STING Activators and a non-exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license under specified know-how, in each case to develop, make, have made, use, have used, import, sell, and otherwise commercialize certain licensed products for use in therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatments in humans. Under the agreement, or the MSK Agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize a licensed product, including achieving specified development and regulatory milestones by specified dates. 

Under the MSK Agreement, we paid MSK upfront fees of $50,000 in January 2015. We are required to pay MSK development and regulatory milestone payments totaling up to $375,000 for each licensed product and commercialization milestone payments totaling up to $2,950,000 for each licensed product. We are also required to pay MSK royalties based on net sales of licensed products by us and our sublicensees at a rate ranging in the low single digits depending on whether the licensed product is covered by a valid claim of the licensed patents, subject to minimum annual royalties. Our royalty obligation to MSK continues on a country-by-country basis until the later of the expiration of the last patent right covering the licensed product in such country or 10 years from the first commercial sale in such country. We are also obligated to pay MSK a percentage of certain consideration received for the grant of sublicenses, ranging from ten to the mid-twenties. 

The MSK Agreement will continue in effect until the expiration of our royalty obligations. Either party may terminate the MSK Agreement upon the other party&#8217;s uncured material breach that is not cured within 90 days after the breaching party receives notice of such breach. Additionally, the Licensors may terminate the MSK Agreement for our bankruptcy or insolvency or if we fail to pay any undisputed amounts owed under the agreement and do not cure such failure within 30 days after receiving notice of such failure. 

Competition 

The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, and the immuno-oncology subsector, are characterized by rapid evolution of technologies, fierce competition and strong defense of intellectual property. A wide variety of institutions, including large pharmaceutical companies, specialty biotechnology companies, academic research departments and public and private research institutions, are actively developing potentially competitive products and technologies. We face substantial competition from biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies developing products in immuno-oncology and in our lead indications. They generally fall within the following categories: 

&#160;

&#183; 

diversified immuno-oncology: AstraZeneca PLC, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Celgene Corporation, GlaxoSmithKline plc, Merck &#38; Co., Inc., Novartis AG, Pfizer Inc., Roche Holding Ltd and Sanofi SA, Bayer Healthcare; 

&#160;

&#183; 

immuno-oncology aimed at stimulating immune response: AdaptImmune LLC, Idera Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Immune Design Corp. and NewLink Genetic Corporation; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Listeria -based technology: Advaxis, Inc.; 

&#160;

&#183; 

pancreatic cancer: Incyte Corporation and Merrimack Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

mesothelioma: Boeringer Ingelheim and Morphotek/Eisai. 

While we believe that our product candidates, technology, knowledge and experience provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from established and emerging pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, among others. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing and new therapies that may become available in the future. The availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors will also significantly affect the pricing and competitiveness of our products. 

Many of our competitors, either alone or with strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining approval for treatments and achieving widespread market acceptance, rendering our treatments obsolete or non-competitive. Accelerated mergers and acquisitions activity in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These companies also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical study sites and patient registration for clinical studies and acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. 

Our commercial opportunity could be substantially limited in the event that our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, safer, less toxic, more convenient or cheaper than our comparable products. In geographies that are critical to our commercial success, competitors may also obtain regulatory approvals before us, resulting in our competitors building a strong market position in advance of our product&#8217;s entry. We believe the factors determining the success of our programs will be the efficacy, safety and convenience of our product candidates. 

Government Regulation and Product Approval

As a biopharmaceutical company that operates in the United States, we are subject to extensive regulation. Federal, state and local government authorities in the United States and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of biological and pharmaceutical products such as those we are developing. Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA before they may be legally marketed in the United States and by the appropriate foreign regulatory agency before they may be legally marketed in foreign countries. Generally, our activities in other countries will be subject to regulation that is similar in nature and scope as that imposed in the United States, although there can be important differences. Additionally, some significant aspects of regulation in Europe are addressed in a centralized way, but country-specific regulation remains essential in many respects. The process for obtaining regulatory marketing approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 

U.S. Product Development Process 

In the United States, the FDA regulates pharmaceutical and biological products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and the FDA&#8217;s implementing regulations. Products are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial 

resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. FDA sanctions could include, among other actions, refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. The FDA has limited experience with commercial development of combination immuno-oncology products. The process required by the FDA before a drug or biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 

&#160;

&#183; 

completion of nonclinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to good laboratory practices, or GLPs, and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations; 

&#160;

&#183; 

submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 

&#160;

&#183; 

performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA&#8217;s regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research patients and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for its intended use; 

&#160;

&#183; 

submission to the FDA of a BLA for any biologic or an NDA for any drug we seek to market that includes substantive evidence of safety, purity, and potency, or safety and effectiveness from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials; 

&#160;

&#183; 

satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the product is produced, to assess compliance with cGMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product&#8217;s identity, strength, quality and purity, and, if applicable, the FDA&#8217;s current good tissue practices, or GTPs, for the use of human cellular and tissue products; 

&#160;

&#183; 

potential FDA audit of the nonclinical study and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA or NDA; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the NDA or BLA. 

Before testing any product candidate in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs. The clinical trial sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions regarding the proposed clinical trials and places the trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such trials. 

Where a recombinant nucleic acid trial is conducted at, or sponsored by, institutions receiving funding for recombinant DNA research from the U.S. National Institutes of Health, or NIH, prior to the submission of an IND to the FDA, a protocol and related documentation is submitted to and the study is registered with the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities, or OBA, pursuant to the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules, or NIH Guidelines. Compliance with the NIH Guidelines is mandatory for investigators at institutions receiving NIH funds for research involving recombinant DNA, however many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them. The NIH is responsible for convening the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, or RAC, a federal advisory committee, which discusses protocols that raise novel or particularly important scientific, safety or ethical considerations at one of its quarterly public meetings. The OBA will notify the FDA of the RAC&#8217;s decision regarding the necessity for full public review of a protocol. RAC proceedings and reports are posted to the OBA web site and may be accessed by the public. 

Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor&#8217;s control (except in the cases of Sponsor-Investigator studies). Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the 

FDA&#8217;s regulations composing the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research patients provide informed consent. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Clinical trials of certain biologics also must be reviewed by an institutional biosafety committee, or IBC, a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees basic and clinical research conducted at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment. 

Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Phase 1. The biological product is initially introduced into healthy human patients and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Phase 2. The biological product is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency, and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk to benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. 

Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gather additional information about a product's safety, efficacy, or optimal use. Some of the studies may be required under statue or regulation; others may be trials a sponsor has committed to conduct. 

During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Quarterly safety reporting is required for marketed products for the first three years after approval. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials (for INDs) and changes to the application (for marketed products) must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA, the NIH and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events that are considered related to study drug, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human patients, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening adverse reaction that is considered related to study drug within seven calendar days after the sponsor&#8217;s initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk, including risks inferred from other unrelated immuno-oncology trials. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB&#8217;s requirements or if the biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 

Human immuno-oncology products are a new category of therapeutics. Because this is a relatively new and expanding area of novel therapeutic interventions, there can be no assurance as to the length of the trial period, the number of patients the FDA will require to be enrolled in the trials in order to establish the safety, efficacy, purity and potency of immuno-oncology products, or that the data generated in these trials will be acceptable to the FDA to support marketing approval. 

Concurrently with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other criteria, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 

U.S. Review and Approval Processes 

After the completion of clinical trials of a product candidate, FDA approval of a BLA or NDA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the product. The BLA or NDA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human trials, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data, or full or partial waivers. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA or NDA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. 

Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each BLA or NDA must be accompanied by a significant user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. PDUFA also imposes an annual product fee for products and an annual establishment fee on facilities used to manufacture prescription biological or drug products. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs or NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication. 

Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA or NDA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA or NDA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission, and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA or NDA may be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA or NDA. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe, potent, and/or effective for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and in the case of an NDA, whether the product is safe and effective for its intended use, and in each case, whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological or drug products or biological or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA or NDA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve a BLA or NDA without a REMS, if required. 

Before approving a BLA or NDA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. For human tissue-based products, the FDA also will not approve the product if the manufacturer is not in compliance with the FDA&#8217;s current good tissue practices, or GTPs, to the extent applicable. These are FDA regulations and guidance documents that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue based products, or HCT/Ps, which are human cells or tissue intended for implantation, transplant, infusion, or transfer into a human recipient. The primary intent of the GTP requirements is to ensure that cell and tissue based products are manufactured in a manner designed to prevent the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable disease. FDA regulations also require tissue establishments to register and list their HCT/Ps with the FDA and, when applicable, to evaluate donors through screening and testing. Additionally, before approving a BLA or NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND trial requirements and GCP requirements. To assure cGMP, GTP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production and quality control. 

Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA or NDA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. If the agency decides not to approve the BLA or NDA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA or NDA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA or NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. 

If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific indications and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. 

Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a risk management plan, 

or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, designed to further assess a biological product&#8217;s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. 

In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. However, if only one indication for a product has orphan designation, a pediatric assessment may still be required for any applications to market that same product for the non-orphan indication(s). 

Orphan Drug Designation 

Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug or biologic for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review or approval process. 

If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application user fee. 

A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. 

In the European Union, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and 10 years of market exclusivity is granted following drug or biological product approval. This period may be reduced to 6 years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. 

We have received orphan drug designation for CRS-207 and GVAX Pancreas for the treatment of pancreatic cancer and CRS-207 for the treatment of mesothelioma. There can be no assurance that we will receive orphan drug designation for additional indications or for any additional product candidates. 

Expedited Development and Review Programs 

The FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. Unique to a Fast Track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the BLA or NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the BLA or NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the BLA or NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the BLA or NDA. 

Any product, submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with a Fast Track designation, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. Additionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Products studied for their safety and 

effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biological product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. Fast Track designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. 

In 2012 the FDA established a Breakthrough Therapy designation which is intended to expedite the development and review of products that treat serious or life-threatening conditions. The designation is available for product candidates that are intended, alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and for which preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over currently available therapy on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the Fast Track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance. The Breakthrough Therapy designation is a distinct status from both Fast Track designation and priority review, which can also be granted to the same product if relevant criteria are met. If a product is designated as Breakthrough Therapy, FDA will expedite the development and review of such product. 

We received Breakthrough Therapy designation for the combination of CRS-207 and GVAX Pancreas. Where applicable, we plan to request Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy designation for other product candidates and regimens. Even if we receive one or both of these designations for our product candidates, the FDA may later decide that our product candidates no longer meets the conditions for qualification. In addition, these designations may not provide us with a material commercial advantage. 

Post-Approval Requirements 

Any products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product&#8217;s approved uses, known as off-label use, limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for off-label uses, if the physicians deem to be appropriate in their professional medical judgment, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses. 

In addition, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to applicable manufacturing requirements after approval to ensure the long-term stability of the product. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA or NDA, including, among other things, recall or withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. 

Other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval. 

The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product&#8217;s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA&#8217;s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development. 

U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 

The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, or BPCIA, amended the PHSA to authorize the FDA to approve similar versions of innovative biologics, commonly known as biosimilars. A competitor seeking approval of a biosimilar must file an application to establish its product as highly similar to an approved innovator biologic, among other requirements. The BPCIA, however, bars the FDA from approving biosimilar applications for 12 years after an innovator biological product receives initial marketing approval. 

Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents, if granted, may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent restoration term of up to five years, as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product&#8217;s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA or NDA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA or NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may intend to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA or NDA. 

Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent terms, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued &#8220;Written Request&#8221; for such a trial. 

Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 

In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, for instance the Office of Inspector General, the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the false claims laws, the physician payment transparency laws, the privacy and security provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and similar state laws, each as amended. 

The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor, however, does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. 

Additionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Affordable Care Act to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act, as discussed below. 

The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. 

The federal False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes &#8220;any request or demand&#8221; for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies&#8217; marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses. 

HIPAA created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 

Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. 

We may be subject to data privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the HITECH Act, and their respective implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, imposes requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA&#8217;s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys&#8217; fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts. 

Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act under the Affordable Care Act, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children&#8217;s Health Insurance Program, with certain exceptions, to report information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members and payments or other &#8220;transfers of value&#8221; made to such physician owners. Failure to submit timely, accurately, and completely the required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for &#8220;knowing failures&#8221;). Manufacturers were required to begin collecting data on August 1, 2013 and submit reports on aggregate payment data to the government for the first reporting period of August 1, 2013 to December 31, 2013, by March 31, 2014, and to report detailed payment data for the first reporting period and submit legal attestation to the accuracy of such data by June 30, 2014. Thereafter, manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th day of each subsequent calendar year. CMS made all reported data publicly available on September 30, 2014. Certain states also mandate implementation of compliance programs, impose restrictions on pharmaceutical manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to healthcare providers and entities. 

In order to distribute products commercially, we must also comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of drug and biological products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in sales and marketing and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. 

If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including without limitation, civil, criminal and/or 

administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, private &#8220;qui tam&#8221; actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, or refusal to allow us to enter into government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. 

Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 

Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the extent to that third-party payors provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such products. In the United States, third-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, private managed care providers, health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products, therapies and services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor&#8217;s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor&#8217;s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. 

Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the EU, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country. 

The marketability of any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on healthcare pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 

Healthcare Reform 

In March 2010, President Obama enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, the Affordable Care Act, which is substantially changing healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impact the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry. 

Among the Affordable Care Act&#8217;s provisions of importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, in addition to those otherwise described above, are the following: 

&#160;

&#183; 

an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents apportioned among these entities according to their market share in some government healthcare programs; 

&#160;

&#183; 

an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for most branded and generic drugs, respectively and a cap on the total rebate amount for innovator drugs at 100% of the Average Manufacturer Price, or AMP; 

&#160;

&#183; 

addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for certain drugs and biologics, including our product candidates, that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; 

&#160;

&#183; 

extension of manufacturers&#8217; Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations; 

&#160;

&#183; 

expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers&#8217; Medicaid rebate liability; 

&#160;

&#183; 

a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer&#8217;s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; 

&#160;

&#183; 

expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. 

Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation&#8217;s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013, and will remain in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and cancer treatment centers. Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs.

We anticipate that the Affordable Care Act and other legislative reforms will result in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product, if covered, and could seriously harm our business, though we are still unsure what its full impact will be. There have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act, and we expect such challenges and amendments to continue in the future. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products. 

Further, in January 2016, CMS issued a final rule regarding the Medicaid drug rebate program. The final rule, effective April 1, 2016, among other things, revises the manner in which the &#8220;average manufacturer price&#8221; is to be calculated by manufacturers participating in the program and implement certain amendments to the Medicaid rebate statute created under the Affordable Care Act. In addition, it is possible that there will be further legislation or regulation that could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. 

Additional Regulation 

In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with 

applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations. 

Europe and Rest of World Government Regulation 

In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval of a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the EU, for example, a clinical trial application must be submitted to each country&#8217;s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the clinical trial application is approved in accordance with a country&#8217;s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries. 

The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 

To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug or biological product under EU regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application. The application used to file the BLA in the United States is similar to that required in the EU, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements. 

For other countries outside of the EU, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 

If we or our potential collaborators fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 we had 111 full-time employees, 35 of whom hold Ph.D. degrees, 82 of whom were engaged in research and development activities and 29 of whom were engaged in finance, business development, facilities, human resources and administrative support. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
