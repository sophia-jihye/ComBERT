Our Company 

All references to &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221;, &#8220;our&#8221;, &#8220;SBS&#8221;, &#8220;our company&#8221; or &#8220;the Company&#8221; in this report mean Spanish Broadcasting System, Inc., a Delaware corporation formed in 1994, and all entities owned or controlled by Spanish Broadcasting System, Inc. and, if prior to 1994, mean our predecessor parent company Spanish Broadcasting System, Inc., a New Jersey corporation, and its subsidiaries. Our executive offices are located at 7007 N.W. 77 th Avenue, Miami Florida 33166, our telephone number is (305) 441-6901, and our corporate website is www.spanishbroadcasting.com. 

We are a leading Spanish-language media and entertainment company with radio and/or television stations in the top U.S. Hispanic markets, including Puerto Rico. Our owned and operated radio stations serve markets representing approximately 35% of the U.S. Hispanic population, and our television operations serve markets representing over 3.5 million Hispanic households. We produce and distribute Spanish-language content, including radio programs, television shows, music and live entertainment through our radio stations and our television group, MegaTV, which produces over 70 hours of original programming per week. MegaTV broadcasts via our owned and operated stations in South Florida, Houston, and Puerto Rico and through programming and/or distribution agreements with other stations, including nationally on a subscriber basis. 

We operate the top Spanish-language radio station in the United States based on the average number of listeners per quarter-hour, which is WSKQ-FM, one of our New York stations. WSKQ-FM delivered the highest listenership among all Spanish-language radio stations in the United States, according to the 2015 Hispanic Fact Pack. Our other radio stations are located in Los Angeles, New York, Puerto Rico, Miami, Chicago and San Francisco. In addition to our owned and operated radio stations, we have our AIRE Radio Networks with over 100 affiliate radio stations servicing over 53 of the top U.S. Hispanic markets, including all of the top 30 Hispanic markets. AIRE Radio Networks currently covers 90% of the coveted U.S. Hispanic market. Our AIRE Radio Networks reach over 11.0 million listeners in an average week with our targeted networks. 

As part of our operating business, we also maintain multiple bilingual websites, including www.lamusica.com , Mega.tv and various station websites that provide content related to Latin music, entertainment, news and culture, as well as the LaMusica mobile app. LaMusica simultaneously streams our stations&#8217; content, which has broadened the audience reach of our radio stations. In addition, we produce live concerts and events in the United States and Puerto Rico. Concerts generate revenue from ticket sales, sponsorship and promotions, raise awareness of our brands in the surrounding communities and provide our advertising partners additional opportunities to reach their target audience. 

Our Strategy 

We focus on maximizing the revenue and profitability of our broadcast portfolio by strengthening the performance of our existing broadcast stations. We evaluate strategic media acquisitions and/or dispositions and strive to expand our media content through distribution and affiliations in order to achieve a significant presence with clusters of stations in the top U.S. Hispanic markets. We generally consider acquisitions and the expansion of the number of broadcast stations in markets where we can maximize our revenue through aggressive sales and programming efforts directed at U.S. Hispanic and general market advertisers. The potential acquisitions and expansion may include broadcast stations which do not currently target the U.S. Hispanic market, but which we believe can successfully be reformatted and programmed. We also focus on long-term growth by investing in on-air talent, advertising and, from time to time, programming research. Additionally, from time to time, we explore investment opportunities in related media outlets targeting the U.S. Hispanic market. 

Our operating strategy focuses on maximizing our broadcast stations&#8217; appeal to our targeted audiences and advertisers in order to increase revenue and cash flow, while simultaneously controlling operating expenses. To achieve these goals, we focus on a number of key factors. 

Develop Market Leading Station Clusters in High Growth Hispanic Markets . We believe Hispanic media will gain revenue share as a result of the growing U.S. Hispanic population and its growing buying power. Given our knowledge of, and experience with, the U.S. Hispanic marketplace and our established position in the top U.S. Hispanic markets, including Puerto Rico, we will continue to focus on reaching and maximizing revenue in high growth Hispanic markets. We believe that operating multiple stations in the same markets enables us to achieve operating efficiencies and cost savings. We pursue a strategy of creating broadcast station clusters that reach a critical mass of our target audience and marketing resources necessary to aggressively pursue incremental advertising revenue. 

&#160;

Leverage Our Proprietary Content Across Our Media Platforms . We will continue to monetize our content across multiple platforms, including radio, broadcast and pay television and live events, as well as emerging med ia alternatives. We use our media platforms and relationships with Hispanic celebrities and talent to produce unique programming and content for our television and radio stations. Concerts and special promotional appearances form an important part of our m arketing strategy and provide us with significant local market exposure. We also develop content from these events and create opportunities to sell, market and distribute that content through our websites and other media, providing our advertising partners with attractive advertising solutions. In addition, the events allow us to promote our brands to increase our radio audience and advertising revenue. As the media landscape evolves, we are developing our key broadcast programs, on-air personalities and br ands for consumption as downloadable video and interactive content. 

Maintain Cost Discipline . We employ a regimented managerial approach to operating our media outlets. We emphasize control of our operating costs through detailed budgeting, continuous review of staffing levels and expenses and vendor analysis. We are highly focused on reducing our costs and believe we have streamlined our cost structure to provide a foundation for growth. 

Grow Our Television Business . Television is the largest Hispanic media market in the United States, with approximately 75.9% of the total 2014 U.S. Hispanic advertising spending. In 2014, the U.S. Hispanic television industry generated $7.2 billion of revenue, according to the 2015 Hispanic Fact Pack. Our radio stations and experience in the Hispanic media and radio market in the United States and Puerto Rico give us a powerful platform, knowledge base and set of relationships on which to build our television business. We utilize our market knowledge to create distinctive television programs tailored to our target audiences&#8217; preferences. We believe that MegaTV will capitalize on these insights as the reach of our television programming continues to grow. Additionally, our television business offers attractive cross-promotional opportunities with our radio stations. 

Maintain Strong Community Involvement . We have been, and will continue to be, actively involved in the local communities that we serve. Our broadcast stations participate in numerous community programs, fundraisers and activities benefiting the local community and Hispanics abroad. Examples of our community involvement include free public service announcements, free events designed to promote family values within the local Hispanic communities, extensive coverage of world events that have an impact on the U.S. Hispanic population as well as charitable contributions to organizations that benefit the local Hispanic communities in which we operate. Our community involvement also allows us to keep abreast of shifting audience preferences, to further tailor our content and to enhance broadcast station loyalty. 

Hispanic Market Opportunity 

The U.S. Hispanic population is the largest ethnic minority group and is projected to be the fastest growing segment of the population. We believe that we are well positioned to benefit from the projected growth in population and buying power of the U.S. Hispanic population and the expected shift of advertising dollars to Hispanic media. We believe that targeting the Hispanic market is attractive for the following reasons: 

&#183; 

Hispanic Population Growth . Between the years 2000 and 2015, the U.S. Hispanic population increased by 58.9% compared to 7.4% for the non-Hispanic population. In 2015, Hispanics comprised 17.6% of the U.S. population and approximately one out of every six individuals living in the United States was of Hispanic origin, according to the Selig Center for Economic Growth, The Multicultural Economy , 2015. The U.S. Hispanic population grew at more than seven times the rate of the general population from 2000 to 2015 and is projected to grow to 31% of the U.S. population by 2060, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Hispanics have accounted for nearly half of the U.S. population growth since the 2010 Census. 

&#183; 

Growth in Hispanic Buying Power . The U.S. Hispanic population accounted for over $1.3 trillion of total buying power in 2015, up from $1.0 trillion in 2010 and is estimated to grow to $1.7 trillion by 2020, according to the Selig Center for Economic Growth, The Multicultural Economy , 2015. U.S. Hispanic buying power accounted for 9.8% of all U.S. buying power in 2015. By 2020, Hispanics will account for 10.6% of total U.S. buying power. 

&#183; 

Spanish-Language Advertising Spending . Advertisers spent an estimated $9.5 billion on Spanish-language media advertising in 2014, according to the 2015 Hispanic Fact Pack. This amount has more than quadrupled since 2000 when Hispanic advertising expenditures totaled $2.1 billion according to Hispanic Business Magazine, December 2001. As advertisers increasingly recognize the buying power of the U.S. Hispanic population, especially in markets with high Hispanic concentration, we believe that Spanish-language advertising will continue to increase. 

&#183; 

Re-balancing of Advertising Spending Towards Hispanic Media . From 2013 to 2014, U.S. Hispanic media spending rose by 12.0% from $8.5 billion to $9.5 billion, far exceeding the overall increase of just 0.7% in U.S. measured media spending, according to the 2015 Hispanic Fact Pack. As advertisers seek to tap the large and growing Hispanic market, we believe they will allocate additional advertising dollars to the Hispanic market. We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the growing Hispanic advertising market given our attractive position in the top U.S. Hispanic markets, including Puerto Rico. 

&#160;

The above market opportunity information is based on data provided by the 2015 Hispanic Fact Pack, the BIA/Kelsey&#8217;s Investing in Television/Radio Market Report 2015 and the Selig Center for Economic Grow th, The Multicultural Economy , 201 5 . 

Our Strengths 

Strong Presence in Largest U.S. Hispanic Markets . We operate in six of the eight largest U.S. Hispanic markets, estimated to represent approximately 39.2% of the U.S. Hispanic population in 2015: Los Angeles, New York, Miami, San Francisco, Chicago and Houston, as well as also operating in Puerto Rico. We operate three of the top six Spanish-language radio stations in the United States. Our New York station (WSKQ-FM) ranks first among Spanish-language radio stations in terms of highest listenership. The Los Angeles and New York markets, where we consistently have a top-three-rated Spanish-language radio station, have the largest and second largest U.S. Hispanic populations, respectively. New York and Los Angeles are also the largest and second largest overall radio markets in the United States measured by advertising revenue. In addition, MegaTV serves markets representing over 3.5 million Hispanic households. 

Strong Portfolio of Branded Media Franchises . Because of our history with Hispanic-focused media, we believe that we have been able to develop strong relationships with the Hispanic audiences in our markets and create strong brand loyalty. Our listeners enjoy music from popular and emerging artists as well as updated local information on weather, news and general entertainment. As an example of the power of our brand, our New York station (WSKQ-FM) delivered the highest listenership among all Spanish-language radio stations in the United States, according to the 2015 Hispanic Fact Pact. Our live concerts and events provide our advertisers additional opportunities to reach their target audiences as well as allow us to cross-promote our brands and diversify our revenue base. 

Diversification across Media Platforms, Geography and Customers . Our programming reaches audiences across U.S. Hispanic communities and across various media distribution platforms. We sell our advertising time both nationally and locally and generate substantially all of our revenue from the sale of advertising time to a broad and geographically diverse customer base. The diversification of our stations across several local markets helps to mitigate any revenue decline in a specific geographic area. Additionally, in 2015, no single advertiser generated more than 5% of our consolidated revenue. Our customer base includes advertisers in the automotive, retail, telecommunications and healthcare industries, among others. In addition to advertising revenue, we also generate subscription and retransmission fee revenue from MegaTV. 

Attractive Business Model . Our strong margins and low levels of capital expenditures enable us to generate high levels of station operating cash flows. We also benefit from an attractive operating cost structure that provides significant operating leverage while allowing us ongoing operating flexibility. 

Experienced Management Team . Led by Ra&#250;l Alarc&#243;n, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, our senior management team has, on average, over 20 years of experience in the broadcasting sector. Importantly, the Alarc&#243;n family has been involved in Spanish-language radio broadcasting since the 1950s, when the late Mr. Pablo Ra&#250;l Alarc&#243;n, Sr., our former Chairman Emeritus, established his first radio station in Camag&#252;ey, Cuba. We believe that our experienced management team gives us a unique understanding of the various Hispanic ethnic and cultural subgroups and allows us to effectively tailor our broadcast programming, websites and concerts accordingly. 

Recent Developments

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Exchange of Stations in Puerto Rico

&#160;

On January 4, 2016, the Company completed an asset exchange with International Broadcasting Corp. under which the Company agreed to exchange certain assets used or useful in the operations of WIOA-FM, WIOC-FM, and WZET-FM in Puerto Rico for certain assets used or useful in the operations of WTCV (DT), WVEO (DT), and WVOZ (TV) in Puerto Rico previously owned and operated by International Broadcasting Corp. The asset exchange is further discussed in note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

&#160;

FCC Broadcast Incentive Auction

&#160;

We have filed applications to participate in the FCC&#8217;s television spectrum incentive auction with television stations in Miami, Houston, and Puerto Rico to potentially generate cash proceeds that are expected to be created by the auction process. There can be no assurance that the FCC&#8217;s television spectrum incentive auction will be successfully completed and any potential cash proceeds will be subsequently realized.

Litigation- Brevan Howard and Others Complaint

On December 27, 2013, River Birch Master Fund, L.P., P River Birch Ltd. (together, &#8220;River Birch&#8221;) and Visium Catalyst Credit Master Fund, Ltd. (collectively with River Birch, &#8220;Initial Plaintiffs&#8221;) brought a claim against us in the Delaware Court of Chancery (the &#8220;Court&#8221;) seeking a declaratory judgment that a &#8220;Voting Rights Triggering Event&#8221; had occurred (as of April 15, 2010) under our certificate of designations for the Series B preferred stock (the &#8220;Certificate of Designations&#8221;) as a result of our non-payment of dividends. The claim alleges that as a result of such Voting Rights Triggering Event, the incurrence of indebtedness for the purpose of purchasing our Houston television station and the issuance of our 12.5% Senior Secured Notes due 2017 (the &#8220;Notes&#8221;) under the Indenture governing the Notes, among other things, were prohibited incurrences of indebtedness under the Certificate of Designations.

The Initial Plaintiffs further claim that we violated the Certificate of Designations by failing to take any actions or explore any options that would have given us legally available funds with which to repurchase the outstanding Series B preferred stock on October 15, 2013. In connection with their claims, Initial Plaintiffs also seek an injunction requiring us to repurchase the Series B preferred stock and an award of contract damages. 

On January 17, 2014, we filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. On March 3, 2014, the complaint was amended to remove River Birch and add Brevan Howard Credit Catalyst Master Fund Ltd., Brevan Howard Master Fund, ALJ Capital I, LP, ALJ Capital II, LP, LJR Capital, LP, and Cedarview Opportunities Master Fund, LP (collectively with Visium Catalyst Credit Master Fund, Ltd., &#8220;Plaintiffs&#8221;) as additional plaintiffs. We filed an Opening Brief in support of our Motion to Dismiss on March 31, 2014. Plaintiffs filed an answering brief to our Motion to Dismiss on April 30, 2014. Our reply brief was filed on May 16, 2014, and a hearing was held on our Motion to Dismiss on June 10, 2014. Following the hearing, the parties agreed to stay all proceedings relating to Count I (which seeks a declaration that a Voting Rights Triggering Event was in effect at all times after April 15, 2010), Count II (which alleges that SBS breached the Certificate of Designations by incurring indebtedness in 2011 and 2012) and Count IV (which alleges that SBS breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by deferring certain dividends) of the amended complaint. The stay has since been lifted. On June 27, 2014, the Court denied our motion to dismiss Count III (which alleges that SBS breached the Certificate of Designations by failing to redeem all of the Series B Preferred Stock on October 15, 2013) of the amended complaint. A hearing on our motion to dismiss Counts I, II and IV of the amended complaint was held on February 10, 2015. On May 19, 2015, the Court of Chancery granted our motion to dismiss Counts I, II and IV of the amended complaint. An order dismissing those Counts with prejudice was entered on May 22, 2015.

At present, Count III of the amended complaint remains outstanding. Court of Chancery Rule 41 (e) permits any party (or the Court sua sponte ) to move for a dismissal for failure to prosecute in any case wherein no action has been taken for a period of one year. Given that the last action in this case was taken on May 22, 2015, such a motion may be filed on or after May 22, 2016. We note, however, that such a motion could be denied if &#8220;good reason for the inaction is given&#8221;, as provided by Court of Chancery Rule 41 (e).

We deny the allegations contained in the amended complaint and, to the contrary, assert that we have been and continue to be in full and complete compliance with all of our obligations under the Certificate of Designations, as fully disclosed in our public filings dating back to 2009. Accordingly, we believe that the complaint&#8217;s allegations are frivolous and wholly without merit and intend to contest such allegations vigorously.

Owned and Operated Radio Station Programming 

We format the programming of each of our radio stations to target a substantial share of the U.S. Hispanic audience in its respective market. The U.S. Hispanic population is diverse, consisting of numerous identifiable groups from many different countries of origin and each with its own musical and cultural heritage. The music, culture, customs and Spanish dialects vary from one radio market to another. We strive to become very familiar with the musical tastes and preferences of each of the various Hispanic ethnic groups and customize our programming to match the local preferences of our target demographic audience in each market we serve. By employing listener study groups and surveys, we can respond immediately, if necessary, to any changing preferences of listeners and/or trends by refining our programming to reflect the results of our research and testing. Each of our programming formats is described below. 

&#183; 

Spanish Tropical . The Spanish Tropical format primarily consists of salsa, merengue, bachata and Latin Rhythmic music. Salsa is dance music combining Latin Caribbean rhythms with jazz originating from Puerto Rico, Cuba and the Dominican Republic, which is popular with the Hispanics whom we target in New York, Miami and Puerto Rico. Merengue music is up-tempo dance music originating in the Dominican Republic. Bachata is a softer tempo dance music also originating in the Dominican Republic. Latin Rhythmic is a modern dance genre that has evolved into a mix of Spanish- and English-language dance hall, traditional reggae, Latin pop and Spanish hip-hop. 

&#183;

Television Strategy 

MegaTV&#8217;s programming is based on a strategy designed to showcase a combination of programs, ranging from televised radio-branded shows to general entertainment programs, such as music, celebrity, debate, interviews and personality-based shows. On the forefront of digital platforms, we were the first Spanish-language programmer to broadcast in 100% native High Definition (HD) in the United States and one of the first Spanish-language programmers in the United States to launch content on Video On Demand, known as VOD. 

&#160;

As part of our strategy, we have incorpora ted certain of our radio on-air personalities into our television programming, as well as including interactive elements to complement our Internet websites. We produce over 70 hours of original programming per week. Our television revenue is generated pri marily from the sale of local advertising and paid programming. Advertising rates depend primarily on our ability to attract an audience in the demographic groups targeted by our advertisers, the number of stations in the market we compete with for the sam e audience, and the supply of and demand for television advertising time, as well as other qualitative factors. We also generate revenue from the sale of integrated sponsorships and program syndication. 

Our television growth strategy is focused on selectively expanding our MegaTV operations into U.S. Hispanic markets where we do not currently have television programming distribution outlets. We continue to target fast-growing and high-density U.S. Hispanic markets, where we can maximize our revenue through aggressive and selective sales and programming efforts directed at U.S. Hispanic and general market advertisers in order to be profitable in terms of station operating income. 

Our Miami facility for our media broadcast programming and production is nearly 70,000 square feet and houses the bulk of MegaTV&#8217;s national and local market operations. With over 14,000 square feet of high definition (HD) TV-Studio production space, the building was remodeled to handle the majority of MegaTV&#8217;s diverse original HD programming, while also accommodating outside production clients with its wide range of production capabilities, which can include anything from news to late-night variety shows with live band and studio audiences. MegaTV&#8217;s long-term technical design criteria for this facility placed an emphasis on streamlined production workflows and digital media management. Key technical features of this facility include: 

&#183; 

integrated HD/standard definition (SD) file-based content capabilities throughout our studio, post production and master control areas; 

&#183; 

three HD studio production spaces that can be operated independently or combined; 

&#183; 

two fully equipped HD control rooms with server, editing and mastering capabilities; 

&#183; 

14 HD/SD post production editing suites that include advanced technology in networked solutions; 

&#183; 

satellite downlink antenna farm and extensive fiber connectivity for content contribution and distribution; and 

&#183; 

multi-path, redundant HD server-based master control system responsible for our distribution feeds. 

The Miami facility also includes office space for production and back-office personnel, as well as dressing rooms, make-up rooms and green rooms for our on-air talent and studio guests. 

We also have 3,500 square feet of HD TV-Studio production space in Puerto Rico with a fully equipped HD control room and six edit suites. 

We hold broadcast spectrum in three of the largest markets in the U.S. Spectrum is a strategic asset which we believe has significant option value. With the success of the recent AWS-3 spectrum auction, which generated $45 billion of proceeds, the underlying value of our spectrum is substantial. We believe we have an opportunity to realize significant value from our spectrum assets and we have filed applications to participate in the FCC planned broadcast TV spectrum incentive auction (the &#8220;Broadcast Incentive Auction&#8221;) to monetize a portion of our spectrum assets.

Special Events and On-Line Properties 

As part of our media operating business, we also operate SBS Entertainment and SBS Interactive. SBS Entertainment is a premier producer of unique entertainment, concerts and special events. We generate special events revenue from ticket sales and event sponsorships, as well as profit-sharing arrangements by producing or co-producing live concerts and events with popular artists, which are promoted by our radio and television stations. SBS Interactive manages LaMusica.com, Mega.tv, various radio station websites, and La Musica Mobile App. All of the digital properties offer bilingual (Spanish-English) content related to Latin music, entertainment, news and culture. LaMusica.com and our network of station websites generate revenue primarily from advertising and sponsorships. In addition, the majority of our station websites simultaneously stream our stations&#8217; content, which has broadened our audience reach. We are developing brand specific digital content strategies for various broadcast programs, on-air personalities and brands, and intend to generate revenue from such strategies. We also leverage many of our special events produced by SBS Entertainment, to produce music based digital content for live streaming and/or taped, on-demand streaming, which can also be developed to generate revenue. 

We believe that SBS Entertainment and SBS Interactive, together with our broadcast portfolio, enables our audience to enjoy targeted and culturally relevant entertainment, which include, but are not limited to concert specials, artist interviews, music editorial content, music reviews, and local entertainment calendars, among others. At the same time, our online properties enable our advertisers to reach their targeted Hispanic consumers through an additional, targeted and dynamic medium. 

&#160;

Advertising Reven ue 

The vast majority of our revenue is derived from cash advertising sales. Advertising revenue has historically been classified into two categories &#8211; &#8220;national&#8221; and &#8220;local.&#8221; &#8220;National&#8221; generally refers to advertising that is solicited by a representative firm for national advertisers. A subset category of national advertising revenue is network advertising revenue, which is advertising sold to network advertisers by our AIRE Radio Networks group. Our national sales representative for our radio stations is McGavren Guild Media, LLC. &#8220;Local&#8221; refers to advertising purchased by advertisers and agencies in the local market served by a particular station. 

Current trends in the media advertising market have changed the long-established model for categorizing advertising revenue. We have expanded the conventional model by offering &#8220;integrated sponsorship&#8221; opportunities, which are highly sought after and command a higher investment from agencies, in order to maximize our advertisers&#8217; opportunities. We expect that our primary source of revenue from our broadcast stations will be generated from the sale of national, local and integrated sponsorship advertising. In addition, we are anticipating that our television, radio and Internet offerings will generate more advertising opportunities by offering multi-media packages. 

We believe that the broadcasting industry is one of the most efficient and cost-effective means for advertisers to reach targeted demographic groups. Advertising rates charged by a station are based primarily on the station&#8217;s ability to attract an audience in a given market and on the attractiveness to advertisers of the station&#8217;s audience demographics, as well as the demand on available advertising inventory. Rates also vary depending upon a program&#8217;s popularity among the listeners/viewers an advertiser is seeking to attract and the availability of alternative media in the market. Radio advertising rates generally are highest during the morning drive-time hours, which are the peak hours for radio audience listening. Television advertising rates are higher during prime time evening viewing periods. A broadcaster that has multiple stations in a market appeals to national advertisers because these advertisers can reach more listeners and viewers, thus enabling the broadcaster to attract a greater share of the advertising revenue in a given market. In light of these factors, we seek to grow our revenue by taking advantage of our presence in major Hispanic markets as new and existing advertisers recognize the increasing desirability of targeting the growing U.S. Hispanic population. 

Each station broadcasts a predetermined number of advertisements per hour with the actual number depending upon the format of a particular station and any programming strategy we are utilizing to attract an audience. We also determine the number of advertisements broadcast hourly that can maximize the station&#8217;s revenue without negatively impacting its audience listener/viewer levels. While there may be shifts from time to time in the number of advertisements broadcast during a particular time of the day, the total number of advertisements broadcast on a particular station generally does not vary significantly from year to year. 

We have short- and long-term contracts with our advertisers, although it is customary in the radio and television industry that the majority of advertising contracts are short-term and generally run for less than three months. This affords broadcasters the opportunity to modify advertising rates as dictated by changes in viewer ratings, changes in competitive dynamics and changes in the business climate within a particular market. In each of our broadcasting markets, we employ sales personnel to obtain local advertising revenue. Our local sales force is responsible for maintaining relationships with key local advertisers and agencies and identifying new advertisers. We pay commissions to our local sales staff upon receipt of payment for their respective billings which assists in our collection efforts. 

Seasonality 

Seasonal broadcasting revenue fluctuations are common in the broadcasting industry and are primarily due to fluctuations in advertising expenditures by local and national advertisers. Our net broadcasting revenues vary throughout the year. Historically, our first calendar quarter (January through March) has generally produced the lowest net broadcasting revenue for the year because of routine post-holiday decreases in advertising expenditures. 

Competition 

The success of our broadcast stations depends significantly upon their audience ratings and their share of the overall advertising revenue within their markets. The radio and television broadcasting industries are highly competitive businesses. Each of our radio stations compete with both Spanish-language and English-language radio stations in their market, as well as other media, such as newspapers, broadcast television, cable television, the Internet, magazines, outdoor advertising, satellite radio, and transit advertising. Our television operations compete for viewers and revenue with both Spanish-language and English-language television stations in our local markets, as well as nationally broadcast television operations, cable television, the Internet and other video media. 

&#160;

Several of the broadca st stations with which we compete are subsidiaries of larger national or regional companies that may have substantially greater financial resources than we do. Factors which are material to our competitive position include: 

&#183; 

management experience; 

&#183; 

talent and popularity of on-air personalities and television show hosts and actors; 

&#183; 

audience ratings and our broadcast stations&#8217; rank in their markets; 

&#183; 

sales talent and experience; 

&#183; 

signal strength and frequency; and 

&#183; 

audience demographics, including the nature of the Spanish-language market targeted by a particular station. 

Although the broadcast industry is highly competitive, some barriers to entry do exist. These barriers can be mitigated to some extent by changing existing broadcast station formats and programming and upgrading power, among other actions. The operation of a broadcast station requires a license or other authorization from the Federal Communications Commission (the &#8220;FCC&#8221;). The number of AM radio stations that can operate in a given market is limited by the availability of AM radio spectrum in the market. The number of FM radio stations and television stations that can operate in a given market is limited by the availability of those frequencies allotted by the FCC to communities in such market. In addition, the FCC&#8217;s multiple ownership rules regulate the number of stations that may be owned and controlled by a single entity in a given market. For a discussion of FCC regulation, see &#8220;Federal Regulation of Radio and Television Broadcasting&#8221; below. 

The radio industry is also subject to competition from new media technologies that are being developed or introduced, such as the delivery of audio programming by satellite, cable television systems and Internet-based music streaming services. Some radio broadcast stations, including ours, are utilizing digital technology on their existing terrestrial frequencies to deliver audio programming. The FCC also has begun granting licenses for a new &#8220;low power&#8221; radio or &#8220;microbroadcasting&#8221; service to provide low-cost noncommercial neighborhood service on frequencies which would not interfere with existing stations. 

The FCC has selected In-Band On-Channel TM , also known as IBOC or &#8220;HD Radio &#174; ,&#8221; as the exclusive technology for introduction of terrestrial digital operations by AM and FM radio stations. HD Radio &#174; technology permits a station to transmit radio programming in digital formats using the bandwidth that the radio station is currently licensed to use. HD Radio &#174; technology is used to (1) improve sound quality, (2) provide spectrum for enhanced data services and multiple program streams and (3) allow radio stations to time broker unused digital bandwidth to third parties, thereby providing new business opportunities for radio broadcasters. We currently utilize HD Radio &#174; digital technology on some of our stations and will evaluate additional installations over the next few years. 

The delivery of information through the presently minimally regulated Internet has also created a new form of competition for both radio and television. Internet broadcasts have no geographic limitations and can provide listeners with programming from around the country and the world. We expect that improvements from higher bandwidths, faster download speeds and wider programming selection may make Internet radio a more significant competitor in the future. The radio broadcasting industry historically has grown despite the introduction of new technologies for the delivery of entertainment and information, such as television broadcasting, cable television, audio tapes, compact discs and portable digital music players. 

Recent developments by many companies, including Internet service providers, are expanding the variety and quality of broadcast content on the internet. Internet companies have developed business relationships with companies that have traditionally provided syndicated programming, network television and other content. As a result, additional programming is becoming available through nontraditional methods, which can directly impact the number of TV viewers and thus indirectly impact station rankings, popularity and revenue possibilities from our stations. Like radio, the television broadcasting industry has grown, notwithstanding the increasing popularity of entertainment and media content delivered through personal computers, smartphones, tablets and other portable wireless devices. We cannot assure you, however, that the development or introduction of any new media technology will not have an adverse effect on the radio and television broadcasting industries. 

We cannot predict what other matters may be considered in the future by the FCC, nor can we assess in advance what impact, if any, the implementation of any of these proposals or changes may have on our business. See &#8220;Federal Regulation of Radio and Television Broadcasting&#8221; below. 

&#160;

Trademarks, Copyrights and Licenses 

In the course of our business, we use various trademarks, copyrights, trade names, domain names and service marks, including logos, with our products and services in our programming, advertising and promotions. Trademarks and copyrights are of material importance to our business and are protected by registration or otherwise in the United States, including Puerto Rico. We believe our trademarks, copyrights, trade names, domain names and service marks are important to our business, and we intend to continue to protect and promote them where appropriate and to protect the registration of new trademarks and copyrights, including through legal action. We do not hold or depend upon any material government license, franchise or concession, except that we hold and depend upon the broadcast licenses granted by the FCC and hold certain trademarks granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. 

Environmental Matters 

As the owner, lessee or operator of various real properties and facilities, we are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Historically, compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot assure you; however, that compliance with existing or new environmental laws and regulations will not require us to make significant expenditures of funds. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 440 full-time employees and 127 part-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor organization or are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. 

Our business depends upon the efforts, abilities and expertise of our executive officers and other key employees, including on-air talent, as well as our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel. The loss of any of our executive officers and key employees, particularly Ra&#250;l Alarc&#243;n, Chairman of our Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer and President, could have a material adverse effect on our business. 

Legal Proceedings 

From time to time, we are involved in various routine legal and administrative proceedings and litigation incidental to the conduct of our business, such as contractual matters and employee-related matters. In recent years, we have been subject to administrative proceedings and lawsuits, including class action lawsuits, alleging violations of federal and state law regarding workplace, wage-hour and employment discrimination matters, and a number of these lawsuits have resulted in the payment of substantial damages. In the opinion of management, such litigation is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. In 2013, a number of the holders of our Series B preferred stock brought actions against us relating to whether and when a Voting Rights Triggering Event had occurred. See Business - Recent Developments and Item. 3 Legal Proceedings for a discussion of such litigation. 

Antitrust 

We have completed, and in the future may complete, strategic acquisitions and divestitures in order to achieve a significant presence with clusters of stations in the top U.S. Hispanic markets. As a result of the industry consolidation resulting from the passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the Federal Trade Commission (the &#8220;FTC&#8221;) and the Department of Justice (the &#8220;DOJ&#8221;), the federal agencies responsible for enforcing the federal antitrust laws, have reviewed certain proposed acquisitions of broadcast stations and station networks. The DOJ can be particularly aggressive when the proposed buyer already owns one or more broadcast stations in the market of the station it is seeking to buy and, following a proposed acquisition, would garner a substantial portion of the advertising revenues in a market. The DOJ has challenged a number of broadcasting transactions. Some of those challenges ultimately resulted in consent decrees requiring, among other things, divestitures of certain stations. As part of its scrutiny of station acquisitions, the DOJ has stated publicly that it believes that commencement of operations under time brokerage agreements, local marketing agreements and other similar agreements customarily entered into in connection with station transfers prior to the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the &#8220;HSR Act&#8221;), could violate the HSR Act. In connection with acquisitions, subject to the waiting period under the HSR Act, so long as the DOJ policy on the issue remains unchanged, we would not expect to commence operation of any affected station under a time brokerage agreement, local marketing agreement or similar agreement until the waiting period has expired or been terminated. 

&#160;

Federal Regulation of Radio and Television Broadcasting 

General 

The radio and television broadcasting industry is subject to extensive and changing regulation by the FCC with regard to programming, technical operations, employment, ownership and other business practices. The FCC regulates broadcast stations pursuant to the Communications Act. The Communications Act permits the operation of broadcast stations only in accordance with a license issued by the FCC upon a finding that the grant of a license would serve the public interest, convenience and necessity. The Communications Act provides for the FCC to exercise its licensing authority to provide a fair, efficient and equitable distribution of broadcast service throughout the United States. Among other things, the FCC: 

&#183; 

assigns frequency bands for radio and television broadcasting; 

&#183; 

determines the particular frequencies, locations and operating power of radio and television broadcast stations; 

&#183; 

issues, renews, revokes and modifies radio and television broadcast station licenses; 

&#183; 

establishes technical requirements for certain transmitting equipment used by radio and television broadcast stations; 

&#183; 

adopts and implements regulations and policies that directly or indirectly affect the ownership, operation, program content and employment and business practices of radio and television broadcast stations; 

&#183; 

has the power to impose penalties, including monetary forfeitures and license revocations, for violations of its rules and the Communications Act; and 

&#183; 

regulates certain aspects of the operation of cable and direct broadcast satellite systems and certain other electronic media that compete with broadcast stations. 

The following is a brief summary of certain provisions of the Communications Act and specific FCC rules and policies. This summary does not purport to be complete and is subject to the text of the Communications Act, the FCC&#8217;s rules and regulations, and the rulings of the FCC. You should refer to the Communications Act and these FCC rules, regulations and rulings for further information concerning the nature and extent of federal regulation of broadcast stations. A licensee&#8217;s failure to observe the requirements of the Communications Act or FCC rules and policies may result in the imposition of various sanctions, including admonishment, fines, the grant of renewal terms of less than eight years, the grant of a license with conditions or, for particularly egregious violations, the denial of a license renewal application, the revocation of an FCC broadcast license or the denial of FCC consent to acquire additional broadcast properties, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our operations. 

FCC Licenses 

The Communications Act provides that a broadcast station license may be granted to any applicant if the granting of the application would serve the public interest, convenience and necessity, subject to certain limitations. In making licensing determinations, the FCC considers an applicant&#8217;s legal, technical, financial and other qualifications. The FCC grants radio and television broadcast station licenses for specific periods of time and, upon application, may renew them for additional terms. Under the Communications Act, radio and television broadcast station licenses may be granted for a maximum term of eight years. 

The FCC classifies each AM and FM radio station. The minimum and maximum facilities requirements for an FM station are determined by its class. Some FM class designations depend upon the geographic zone in which the transmitter of the FM station is located. In general, commercial FM stations are classified as Class A, B1, C3, B, C2, C1, C0 and C, in order of increasing power and antenna height. Class C FM stations are subject to involuntary downgrades to Class C0 in various circumstances if they do not meet certain antenna height specifications. We do not operate any AM radio stations.

Applications to renew the FCC broadcast license for WSKQ-FM were filed on January 31, 2006 and February 3, 2014. Petitions to deny the applications were filed alleging that WSKQ-FM had broadcast indecent material during the license term. We filed opposition pleadings categorically stating that the allegations made did not raise sufficient questions to warrant nonrenewal of the license. The FCC released a decision on March 9, 2016 denying the allegations and granting the license renewal applications.

TV Station WSBS-DT is licensed to Key West and is part of the Miami DMA (designated market area, as defined by Nielsen Media Research). 

(3) &#160; 

TV Station KTBU-DT is licensed to Conroe, Texas and is part of the Houston DMA. 

License Grant and Renewal 

Pursuant to the Communications Act, the FCC renews broadcast licenses without a hearing upon a finding that: 

&#183; 

the station has served the public interest, convenience and necessity; 

&#183; 

there have been no serious violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or FCC rules and regulations; and 

&#183; 

there have been no other violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or FCC rules and regulations which, taken together, indicate a pattern of abuse. 

After considering these factors, the FCC may grant the license renewal application with or without conditions, including renewal for a term less than the maximum term otherwise permitted by law, or hold an evidentiary hearing. 

The Communications Act authorizes the filing of petitions to deny a license renewal application during specific periods of time after a renewal application has been filed. Interested parties, including members of the public, may use these petitions to raise issues concerning a renewal applicant&#8217;s qualifications. If a substantial and material question of fact concerning a renewal application is raised by the FCC or other interested parties, or if for any reason the FCC cannot determine that granting a renewal application would serve the public interest, convenience and necessity, the FCC will hold an evidentiary hearing on the application. If, as a result of an evidentiary hearing, the FCC determines that the licensee has failed to meet the requirements specified above and that no mitigating 

&#160;

factors justify the imposition of a lesser sanction, then the FCC may deny a license renewal application. Generally, our licenses have been renewed without any material conditions or sanctions being imposed, but we cannot assure you that the licenses of each of our stations will continue to be renewed or will continue to be renewed without conditions or sanctions. 

Transfers and Assignments of License 

The Communications Act requires prior approval by the FCC for the assignment of a broadcast license or the transfer of control of a corporation or other entity holding a license. In determining whether to approve an assignment of a radio broadcast license or a transfer of control of a broadcast licensee, the FCC considers, among other things: 

&#183; 

the financial and legal qualifications of the prospective assignee or transferee, including compliance with FCC restrictions on non-U.S. citizens or entity ownership and control; 

&#183; 

compliance with FCC rules limiting the common ownership of attributable interests in broadcast and newspaper properties; 

&#183; 

the history of compliance with FCC operating rules; and 

&#183; 

the character qualifications of the transferee or assignee and the individuals or entities holding attributable interests in them. 

To obtain the FCC&#8217;s prior consent to assign or transfer a broadcast license, appropriate applications must be filed with the FCC. If the assignment or transfer results in a substantial change in ownership or control, the application must be placed on public notice for a period of 30 days during which petitions to deny the application may be filed by interested parties, including members of the public. Informal objections may be filed any time up until the FCC acts upon the application. If the FCC grants an assignment or transfer application, interested parties have 30 days from public notice of the grant to seek reconsideration of that grant. The FCC has an additional ten days to set aside such grant on its own motion. When ruling on an assignment or transfer application, the FCC is prohibited from considering whether the public interest might be served by an assignment or transfer to any party other than the assignee or transferee specified in the application. 

Alien Ownership 

Under the Communications Act, a broadcast license may not be granted to or held by any corporation that has more than 20% of its capital stock owned or voted by non-U.S. citizens, whom the FCC refers to as &#8220;aliens,&#8221; or entities or their representatives, by foreign governments or their representatives, or by non-U.S. corporations. Furthermore, the Communications Act provides that no FCC broadcast license may be granted to or held by any corporation directly or indirectly controlled by any other corporation of which more than 25% of the capital stock is owned or voted by non-U.S. citizens or entities or their representatives, by foreign governments or their representatives, or by non-U.S. corporations, if the FCC finds the public interest will be served by the refusal or revocation of such license. The FCC has interpreted this provision of the Communications Act to require an affirmative public interest finding before a broadcast license may be granted to or held by any such entity, and in the past the FCC has made such an affirmative finding in the broadcast context only in limited circumstances. These restrictions apply in modified form to other forms of business organizations, including partnerships and limited liability companies. Thus, the licenses for our stations could be revoked if more than 25% of our outstanding capital stock is issued to or for the benefit of non-U.S. citizens. In 2013, the FCC issued a declaratory ruling that notwithstanding its past practices it will consider on a case-by-case basis requests for approval of acquisitions by aliens of in excess of 25% of the stock of the parent of a broadcast licensee. In 2015, the FCC initiated a rulemaking proceeding proposing to simplify the foreign ownership approval process for broadcast station licensees. In acting upon a request for declaratory ruling, the FCC will coordinate with Executive Branch agencies on national security, law enforcement, foreign policy, and trade policy issues. Our certificate of incorporation provides that the transfer or conversion of our capital stock, whether voluntary or involuntary, shall not be permitted, and shall be ineffective, if such transfer or conversion would violate (or would result in violation of) the Communications Act or any of the rules or regulations promulgated thereunder or require the prior approval of the FCC, unless such prior approval has been obtained. 

Ownership Attribution 

The FCC generally applies its broadcast ownership limits to &#8220;attributable&#8221; interests held by an individual, corporation, partnership or other association or entity, including limited liability companies. In the case of a corporation holding broadcast licenses, the interests of officers, directors and those who, directly or indirectly, have the right to vote 5% or more of the stock of a licensee corporation are generally deemed attributable interests, as are officer positions and directors of a corporate parent of a broadcast licensee. The FCC treats all partnership interests as attributable, except for those limited partnership interests that under FCC policies are considered insulated from material involvement in the management or operation of the media-related activities of the partnership. The FCC currently treats limited liability companies like limited partnerships for purposes of attribution. Stock interests held by insurance companies, mutual funds, bank trust departments and certain other passive investors that hold stock for investment purposes only become attributable with the ownership of 20% or more of the voting stock of the corporation holding broadcast licenses. 

&#160;

To assess whether a voting stock interest in a direct or an indirect parent corporation of a broadcast licensee is attributable, the FCC uses a &#8220;multiplier&#8221; analysis in which noncontrolling voting stock int erests are deemed proportionally reduced at each noncontrolling link in a multi-corporation ownership chain. A time brokerage agreement with another radio or television station in the same market creates an attributable interest in the brokered radio or te levision station, as well as for purposes of the FCC&#8217;s local radio and television station ownership rules, if the agreement affects more than 15% of the brokered radio or television station&#8217;s weekly broadcast hours. Similarly, a radio station licensee&#8217;s ri ght under a joint sales agreement (JSA) to sell more than 15% per week of the advertising time on another radio station in the same market constitutes an attributable ownership interest in such station for purposes of the FCC&#8217;s ownership rules. In additio n, the FCC adopted an Order in March 2014 that makes a television station licensee&#8217;s right under a JSA to sell more than 15% per week of the advertising time on another television station in the same market an attributable interest. An appeal of this Orde r is pending before the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. We are not currently a party to any JSAs, so the FCC&#8217;s Order does not affect us at this time. 

Debt instruments, nonvoting stock, stock options or other nonvoting interests with rights of conversion to voting interests that have not yet been exercised, insulated limited partnership interests where the limited partner is not materially involved in the media-related activities of the partnership, and minority voting stock interests in corporations where there is a single holder of more than 50% of the outstanding voting stock whose vote is sufficient to affirmatively direct the affairs of the corporation generally do not subject their holders to attribution, unless such interests implicate the FCC&#8217;s equity-debt-plus (or &#8220;EDP&#8221;) rule. Under the EDP rule, a major programming supplier or a same-market media entity will have an attributable interest in a station if the supplier or same-market media entity also holds debt or equity, or both, in the station that is greater than 33% of the value of the station&#8217;s total debt plus equity. For purposes of the EDP rule, equity includes all stock, whether voting or nonvoting, and interests held by limited partners or limited liability company members that are not materially involved. A major programming supplier is any supplier that provides more than 15% of the station&#8217;s weekly programming hours. 

Multiple Ownership 

The Communications Act and FCC rules generally restrict ownership, operation or control of, or the common holding of attributable interests in (i) broadcast stations above certain limits serving the same local market, and (ii) broadcast stations and a daily newspaper serving the same local market. The FCC is required to review quadrennially the following media ownership rules and to modify, repeal or retain any rules as it determines to be in the public interest: the newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership rule; the local radio ownership rule; the radio-television cross-ownership rule; the dual network rule; and the local television ownership rule. 

The FCC&#8217;s currently effective multiple ownership rules are briefly summarized below. 

Local Radio Ownership 

Although current FCC rules allow one entity to own, control or hold attributable interests in an unlimited number of AM and FM radio stations nationwide, the Communications Act and the FCC&#8217;s rules limit the number of radio broadcast stations in local markets (generally defined as those counties in the Nielsen &#174; Metro Survey Area, where they exist) in which a single entity may own an attributable interest as follows: 

&#183; 

In a radio market with 45 or more full-power commercial and noncommercial radio stations, a party may own, operate or control up to eight commercial radio stations, not more than five of which are in the same service (AM or FM). 

&#183; 

In a radio market with between 30 and 44 (inclusive) full-power commercial and noncommercial radio stations, a party may own, operate or control up to seven commercial radio stations, not more than four of which are in the same service (AM or FM). 

&#183; 

In a radio market with between 15 and 29 (inclusive) full-power commercial and noncommercial radio stations, a party may own, operate or control up to six commercial radio stations, not more than four of which are in the same service (AM or FM). 

&#183; 

In a radio market with 14 or fewer full-power commercial and noncommercial radio stations, a party may own, operate or control up to five commercial radio stations, not more than three of which are in the same service (AM or FM), except that a party may not own, operate, or control more than 50% of the radio stations in such market. 

To apply these tiers, the FCC currently relies on Nielsen Metro Survey Areas, where they exist. In other areas, the FCC relies on an interim contour-overlap methodology. For radio stations located outside Nielsen Metro Survey Areas, the FCC is undertaking a rulemaking to determine how to define such local radio markets. The market definition used by the FCC in applying its ownership rules may not be the same as that used for purposes of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. 

&#160;

&#160;

Local Television Ownership 

Under the ownership rules currently in place, the FCC generally permits an owner to have only one television station per market. A single owner is permitted to have two stations with overlapping signals only if (i) one of the two commonly owned stations is not ranked in the top four based upon audience share, and (ii) there will remain after the transaction eight independently owned, full power noncommercial or commercial operating television stations in the market. The rules also permit the ownership, operation or control of two television stations in a market as long as the stations&#8217; Noise Limited Service contours do not overlap. The FCC will consider waiving these ownership restrictions in certain cases involving failing or failed stations or stations which are not yet built. The FCC also grants satellite waivers when one or more television stations operate as satellites of another station. We currently operate WTCV as a parent station and WVEO and WVOZ - TV as satellite stations in the Puerto Rico designated market area pursuant to a satellite waiver. Under the rule, the licensee of a television station that provides more than 15% of another in-market station&#8217;s weekly programming will be deemed to have an attributable interest in the other station. Based on an Order adopted by the FCC in March 2014, a television station that is a party to a JSA to which it sells more than 15% of the advertising time of another television station in the same market will be deemed to have an attributable interest in the station for which it sells advertising time. This ruling became effective on June 19, 2014. Parties to JSA agreements in effect as of June 19, 2014 that do not comply with the FCC&#8217;s Local Television Ownership Rule were given two years to bring the JSA into compliance, seek a waiver or eliminate the JSA. Congressional action extended this deadline to October 1, 2025. We are not currently a party to any JSAs, so the FCC&#8217;s Order does not affect us at this time.

Television National Audience Reach Limitation 

Under the national television ownership rule, one party may not own television stations which reach more than 39% of all U.S. television households. For purposes of calculating the total number of television households reached by a station, the FCC attributes an Ultra High Frequency &#8220;UHF&#8221; television station with only 50% of the television households in its market. In establishing a national cap by statute, Congress did not specifically mention the FCC&#8217;s &#8220;UHF discount&#8221; policy. In 2013, the FCC released a proceeding to determine if the UHF discount policy should be retained, reused or eliminated. This proceeding remains pending. 

Radio-Television Cross-Ownership 

The radio-television cross-ownership rule generally allows common ownership of one or two television stations and up to six radio stations, or, in certain circumstances, (i) one television station and seven radio stations, in any market where at least 20 independent voices would remain after the combination; (ii) two television stations and up to four radio stations in a market where at least 10 independent voices would remain after the combination; and (iii) one television and one radio station notwithstanding the number of independent voices in the market. A &#8220;voice&#8221; includes each independently owned and operated full-power television and radio station and each daily newspaper that has a circulation exceeding 5% of the households in the market, plus one voice for all cable television systems operating in the market. 

Newspaper-Broadcast Cross-Ownership 

Under the currently effective newspaper broadcast cross-ownership rule, unless grandfathered or subject to waiver, no party can have an attributable interest in both a daily English-language newspaper and either a television or radio station in the same market if specified signal contours of the television station or the radio station encompass the entire community in which the newspaper is published. 

Programming and Operations 

The Communications Act requires broadcasters to serve the public interest. A broadcast license is required to present programming in response to community problems, needs and interests and to maintain certain records demonstrating its responsiveness. The FCC will consider complaints from listeners about a broadcast station&#8217;s programming when it evaluates the licensee&#8217;s renewal application, but listeners&#8217; complaints also may be filed and considered at any time. Stations also must pay regulatory and application fees, and follow various FCC rules that regulate, among other things, political advertising, equal employment opportunity, technical operation, the broadcast of obscene, indecent or profane programming, sponsorship identification, the broadcast of contest and lottery information and the conduct of contests. 

The FCC requires that licensees not discriminate in hiring practices on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin or gender. It also requires stations with at least five full-time employees to disseminate information about all fulltime job openings and undertake outreach initiatives from an FCC list of activities such as participation in job fairs, internships or scholarship programs. Stations must retain records of their outreach efforts and keep an annual Equal Employment Opportunity (&#8220;EEO&#8221;) report in their public inspection files and post an electronic version on their websites. 

&#160;

Certain FCC rules affecting programming and operations are briefly summarized below. 

Indecency and Profanity 

Provisions of federal law regulate the broadcast of obscene, indecent, or profane material. The FCC&#8217;s rules prohibit the broadcast of obscene material at any time and indecent or profane material between the hours of 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. Broadcasters risk violating the prohibition against broadcasting indecent or profane material because the vagueness of the FCC&#8217;s indecency/profanity definition makes it difficult to apply, particularly with regard to spontaneous, live programming. In recent years, the FCC has increased its enforcement efforts of these indecency and profanity regulations, and has threatened to initiate license revocation proceedings against broadcast licenses for &#8220;serious&#8221; indecency or profanity violations. The FCC has substantially increased its monetary penalties for violations of these regulations. Legislation enacted in 2006 provides the FCC with authority to impose fines of up to $325,000 per indecent or profane utterance with a maximum forfeiture exposure of $3.0 million for any continuing violation arising from a single act or failure to act. In the ordinary course of business, we have received complaints or the FCC has initiated inquiries about whether a limited number of our radio stations have broadcast indecent programming. We also have a few outstanding indecency proceedings against our stations. 

In July 2010, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (&#8220;Second Circuit&#8221;) issued a decision in which it vacated the FCC&#8217;s indecency policy as unconstitutional. In June 2012, the Supreme Court issued a decision which held that the FCC could not fine ABC and FOX for the specific broadcasts at issue in the case because the FCC had not provided them with sufficient notice of its intent to issue fines for the use of fleeting expletives. The Court also held that the FCC&#8217;s indecency standards did not violate the First Amendment. In April 2013, the FCC requested comments on its indecency policy, including whether it should ban the use of fleeting expletives or whether it should only impose fines for broadcasts that involve repeated and deliberate use of expletives. The FCC has advised that it will continue to pursue enforcement actions in egregious cases while it conducts its review of its indecency policies generally and recently issued a Notice of Apparent Liability for the maximum forfeiture amount of $325,000 against a television station for violation of its indecency policy. We cannot predict whether Congress will consider or adopt further legislation in this area. 

Simulcasting 

The FCC rules prohibit a licensee from simulcasting more than 25% of its programming on another radio station in the same broadcast service (that is, AM/AM or FM/FM). The simulcasting restriction applies if the licensee owns both radio broadcast stations or owns one and programs the other through a local marketing agreement, provided that the contours of the radio stations overlap in a certain manner. 

Time Brokerage and Joint Sales Agreements 

Occasionally, stations enter into time brokerage agreements or local marketing agreements. Separately owned and licensed stations may agree to function cooperatively in programming, advertising sales and other matters, subject to compliance with the antitrust laws and the FCC&#8217;s rules and policies, including the requirement that the licensee of each station maintain independent control over the programming and other operations of its own station. Over the past few years, a number of stations have entered into cooperative arrangements commonly known as JSAs. The FCC has determined that where two radio stations are both located in the same market and a party with a cognizable interest in one such station sells more than 15% of the advertising per week of the other station, that party shall be treated as if it has an attributable interest in that brokered station. As noted in the Section entitled &#8220;Local Television Ownership,&#8221; above, the FCC recently adopted an Order ruling that a television station that is a party to a JSA to which it sells more than 15% of the advertising time of another television station in the same market also has an attributable interest in the station for which it sells advertising time. We are not currently a party to any JSAs, so the FCC&#8217;s Order does not affect us at this time.

RF Radiation 

In 1985, the FCC adopted rules based on a 1982 American National Standards Institute, or &#8220;ANSI,&#8221; standard regarding human exposure to levels of radio frequency, or &#8220;RF,&#8221; radiation. These rules require applicants for renewal of broadcast licenses or modification of existing licenses to inform the FCC at the time of filing such applications whether an existing broadcast facility would expose people to RF radiation in excess of certain limits. In 1992, ANSI adopted a new standard for RF radiation exposure that, in some respects, was more restrictive in the amount of environmental RF radiation exposure permitted. The FCC has since adopted more restrictive radiation limits which became effective October 15, 1997 and which are based in part on the revised ANSI standard. 

Terrestrial Digital Radio 

The FCC has approved a technical standard for the provision of &#8220;in band, on channel&#8221; terrestrial digital radio broadcasting by existing radio broadcasters and has allowed radio broadcasters to convert to a hybrid mode of digital/analog operation on their existing 

&#160;

frequencie s. Digital radio provides additional spectrum segmentation for enhanced data services and additional program streams to complement the existing programming service, which permits new business and multicasting opportunities for radio broadcasters. In Januar y 2010, the FCC adopted procedures that allow FM radio stations to significantly increase their digital power levels above those originally permitted in order to improve the digital service these stations provide. 

Low Power Radio Broadcast Service 

The FCC has adopted rules establishing two classes of a low power radio service, both of which operate in the existing FM radio band: a primary class with a maximum operating power of 100 watts and a secondary class with a maximum power of 10 watts. These low power radio stations have limited service areas of 3.5 miles and 1 to 2 miles, respectively. Implementation of a low power radio service provides an additional audio programming service that could compete with our radio stations for listeners, but we cannot predict the effect upon us. 

Change of Community 

The FCC has adopted rules concerning the FM Table of Allotments to allow radio broadcasters to change their community of license more easily. We have evaluated our current licenses to see if a community of license change would be beneficial. We are aware that competitors may use this rule revision to improve their facilities, and other radio operators may use this rule in a way that would make them newly attractive acquisition targets for us. 

Cable and Satellite Carriage of Television Broadcast Stations 

The Communications Act and implementing FCC regulations govern the retransmission of commercial television stations by cable television systems and direct broadcast satellite, or &#8220;DBS,&#8221; operators. Every three years, each station must elect, with respect to cable systems and DBS operators within its designated market area, or &#8220;DMA,&#8221; either &#8220;must carry&#8221; status, pursuant to which the cable system&#8217;s or DBS operator&#8217;s carriage of the station is mandatory, or &#8220;retransmission consent,&#8221; pursuant to which the station gives up its right to mandatory carriage in order to negotiate consideration in return for consenting to carriage. We have elected &#8220;must carry&#8221; with respect to our full power television stations. These &#8220;must carry&#8221; rights are not absolute, and under some circumstances, a cable system or DBS operator may be entitled not to carry a given station. For example, DBS operators are required to carry the signals of all local television broadcast stations requesting carriage only in local markets in which the DBS operator carries at least one signal pursuant to the statutory local-to-local compulsory copyright license. 

Neither cable systems nor DBS operators are required to carry more than a station&#8217;s primary video programming channel. Consequently, the multicast programming streams provided by our Houston television station are not entitled to mandatory carriage pursuant to the digital must-carry rules. In 2011, the FCC released a rulemaking seeking comment on a series of proposals to streamline and clarify the rules concerning retransmission consent negotiations. In a separate proceeding, the FCC has requested comment on whether the definition of MVPD should be expanded to include entities that make available multiple channels of video programming to subscribers through Internet connections. Both proceedings are pending, and we cannot predict what impact, if any, they will have on our negotiations with video programming distributors. 

Digital Television Services 

As of June 12, 2009, all full-power broadcast television stations were required to cease broadcasting analog programming and convert to all digital broadcasts. The transition to digital television has improved the technical quality of television signals and provides broadcasters the flexibility to offer new services, including high-definition television, broadband data transmission and additional video streams. Our full-power television and Class A television stations have completed construction of their DTV facilities and are currently broadcasting solely on their digital channels. Our full-power television station in Houston also broadcasts several additional video streams. Under current FCC rules, when &#8220;must carry&#8221; rights apply, cable systems and DBS operators are required to carry only one channel of the digital signal of our television stations, despite the capability of digital broadcasters to broadcast multiple program streams within one station&#8217;s digital allotment. 

Children&#8217;s Television Programming 

The FCC has adopted rules on children&#8217;s television programming pursuant to the Children&#8217;s Television Act of 1990. The rules limit the amount and content of commercial matter that may be shown on television stations during programming designed for children 12 years of age and younger and require stations to broadcast on their main program stream three hours per week of educational and informational programming (&#8220;E/I programming&#8221;) designed for children 16 years of age and younger. FCC rules also impose E/I programming requirements on each additional digital multicast program stream transmitted by television stations, with the requirement increasing in proportion to the additional hours of free programming offered on multicast channels. These rules also limit 

&#160;

the display during children&#8217;s programming of Internet addresses of websites that contain or link to commercial material or that use program characters to sell products. 

Sponsorship Identification 

Both the Communications Act and the FCC rules generally require that, when payment or other consideration has been received or promised to a broadcast licensee for the airing of program material, the station must disclose that fact and identify who paid or promised to provide the consideration at the time of the airing. The FCC has initiated inquiries against several media companies, including our company, concerning sponsorship identification practices with respect to the music recording industry. The FCC has also initiated inquiries against several dozen television stations seeking to determine whether their broadcast of &#8220;video news releases&#8221; (each, a &#8220;VNR&#8221;) violated the sponsorship identification rules by failing to disclose the source and sponsorship of the VNR materials. At least two television broadcast licensees recently were issued fines by the FCC for violations of the sponsorship ID rules related to VNRs. VNRs are news stories and feature materials produced by government agencies and commercial entities, among others, for use by broadcasters. The FCC also has under consideration rule-making proceedings concerning sponsorship identification issues, such as product placement. Whether any new regulations are ultimately adopted and, if so, the effect of such rules on our operations cannot currently be determined. 

Closed Captioning and Video Description Rules 

FCC rules require the majority of programming broadcast by television stations to contain closed captions. The rules allow a video programming owner to file a petition for exemption from the rules. We have filed a petition for exemption from the rules based upon a showing of undue burden. During the pendency of an undue burden determination, the video programming subject to the request for exemption is considered exempt from the closed captioning requirement. In January 2012, the FCC adopted rules to require that television programming broadcast or transmitted with captioning include captioning if subsequently made available online, for example, by streaming content on broadcasters&#8217; websites. In 2014, the FCC adopted an Order expanding the IP captioning rules to brief segments or clips of video programs that are carried on the Internet. The new rules will phase in between January 1, 2016 and July 1, 2017. 

FCC rules also require, in part, that affiliates of the top-four national broadcast networks in the top 60 markets provide a minimum of 50 hours of video-described primetime and/or children&#8217;s programming each calendar quarter. 

Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation 

Rules enacted by the FCC that require our television broadcast stations to transmit commercials and adjacent programming at the same volume went into effect in December 2012. 

Recordkeeping 

The FCC rules require broadcast stations to maintain various records regarding operations, including equipment performance records and a log of a station&#8217;s operating parameters. Broadcast stations must also maintain a public inspection file. Portions of the public inspection files maintained by television stations are hosted on an FCC-maintained website. The FCC recently adopted rules that will also require radio station public inspection files to be hosted on an FCC-maintained website. The rules are expected to go into effect in late 2016 and will initially cover stations located in the top 50 markets. 

Regulation of the Internet 

Internet services including websites of our broadcast stations are subject to regulation relating to the privacy and security of personally identifiable user information and acquisition of personal information from children under 13, including the federal Child Online Privacy Protection Act (&#8220;COPPA&#8221;) and the federal Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act (&#8220;CAN-SPAM&#8221;). In addition, a majority of states have enacted laws that impose data security and security breach obligations. Additional federal, state, territorial laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the Internet or other online services, covering such issues as user privacy, child safety, data security, advertising, pricing, content, copyrights and trademarks, access by persons with disabilities, distribution, taxation and characteristics and quality of products and services. 

Repurposing of Broadcast Spectrum for Other Uses 

Federal legislation was enacted in February 2012 that, among other things, authorizes the FCC to conduct voluntary &#8220;broadcast incentive auctions&#8221; in order to reallocate certain spectrum currently occupied by television broadcast stations to mobile wireless broadband services, to &#8220;repack&#8221; television stations into a smaller portion of the existing television spectrum band, and to require 

&#160;

television stations that do not participate or are not selected in the reverse auction to modify their transmission faci lities, subject to reimbursement for reasonable relocation costs up to a nationwide total of $1.75 billion. 

The FCC has adopted rules concerning the incentive auction and the repacking of the television band and has commenced the auction process. Under the auction rules implemented by the FCC, television stations will be given an opportunity to offer spectrum for sale to the government in a &#8220;reverse&#8221; auction while wireless providers will bid to acquire spectrum from the government in a related &#8220;forward&#8221; auction. Applications from television stations to participate in the reverse auction were due on January 12, 2016 and the reverse auction will begin on March 29, 2016. We have filed applications to participate in the auction for stations in Miami, Houston, and Puerto Rico. We and our agents, employees, officers, directors and owners are subject to strict FCC prohibitions on directly or indirectly communicating&#8212;both internally and externally&#8212;information regarding our bidding strategy or the status of our bids in the auction. Accordingly, we will not be able to publicly communicate any updated information about our application other than as stated above. In particular, we will not be able to publicly communicate the preliminary results of our participation in the auction, which we may be apprised of as early as the second quarter of 2016, until the auction is completed, which may not be before the fourth quarter of 2016. These restrictions could have the effect of limiting our ability to access the equity or debt markets during that period, which could adversely impact our ability to raise additional capital or refinance our indebtedness, thereby adversely impacting our ability to reduce our cost of borrowing. If the FCC believes that there have been irregularities in our bidding, or receives a complaint to such effect, then it may launch an investigation and require us to demonstrate that we took adequate precautions to limit our public communications during the auction. Any violation of these prohibitions could result in significant penalties and reversal of our bids, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Following completion of the incentive auction, the FCC will &#8220;repack&#8221; the remaining television broadcast spectrum, which may require certain television stations that did not participate or were not selected in the reverse auction to modify their transmission facilities, including requiring such stations to operate on other channel designations. The FCC will reimburse stations for reasonable relocation costs up to a nationwide total of $1.75 billion. When repacking, the FCC will make reasonable efforts to preserve a station&#8217;s coverage area and population served. In addition, the FCC is prohibited from requiring a station to move involuntarily from the UHF band, the band in which most of our television broadcast licenses operate, to the VHF band or from the high VHF band to the low VHF band.

The outcome of the incentive auction and repacking of broadcast television spectrum, or the impact of such items on our business, cannot be predicted. 

Proposed and Recent Changes 

Congress and the FCC continually consider new laws, regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could, directly or indirectly, affect our operations, ownership and profitability; result in the loss of audience share and advertising revenue; or affect our ability to acquire additional broadcast stations or to finance such acquisitions. We can neither predict what matters might be considered nor judge in advance what impact, if any, the implementation of any of these proposals or changes might have on our business. Such matters may include:
