 Item 1. Description of Business 

OVERVIEW OF OUR TWO BUSINESS SEGMENTS 

When used in this annual report, the terms &#147;Lightbridge&#148;, &#147;Company&#148;, &#147;we&#148;, &#147;our&#148;, and &#147;us&#148; refer to Lightbridge Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries Thorium Power, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and Lightbridge International Holding, LLC (a Delaware limited liability company).

Lightbridge is a leading nuclear fuel technology company and we participate in the nuclear power industry in the United States and internationally. Our mission is to be a world leader in the design and licensing of nuclear fuels that we anticipate will be economically attractive, enhance reactor safety, proliferation resistant, and produce less waste than current generation nuclear fuels, and to provide world-class strategic advisory services to governments and utilities seeking to develop or expand civil nuclear power programs.

Our business operations can be categorized in two segments:

&#160; (1) Our nuclear fuel technology business segment - we develop next generation nuclear fuel technology that has the potential to significantly increase the power output of commercial reactors, reducing the cost of generating electricity and the amount of nuclear waste on a per-megawatt-hour basis and enhancing reactor safety and the proliferation resistance of spent fuel. Our main focus is on our nuclear fuel technology business segment.

&#160; (2) Our nuclear energy consulting business segment - we provide nuclear power consulting and strategic advisory services to commercial and governmental entities worldwide. Our nuclear consulting business operations are intended to help defray a portion of the costs relating to the development of our nuclear fuel technology.

Financial information about our business segments is included in Part II Item 7, Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Note 12 Business Segment Results, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II Item 8, Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Fuel Technology Business Segment Overview 

Since the founding of our company, we have been engaged in the design and development of proprietary, innovative nuclear fuels. This effort has led us to develop a metallic fuel rod design that is at the heart of each of our nuclear fuel products. The Company&#146;s efforts are focused on the success of our nuclear fuel.

We are currently focusing our development efforts on all-metal fuel (i.e., non-oxide fuel) for currently operating as well as new build reactors. The Company also owns fuel assembly designs for all-uranium seed and blanket fuel for existing plants and new build reactors and thorium-based seed and blanket fuel for both existing and new build reactors. Each of the fuel designs utilizes our metallic fuel rod technology, and each design advances our mission to improve the cost competitiveness, safety, proliferation resistance, and performance of nuclear power generation. The Company&#146;s focus on metallic fuel is based on input from nuclear utilities that have expressed interest in the improved economics and enhanced safety that metallic fuel can provide.

In response to the challenges associated with conventional oxide fuels, we believe our innovative, proprietary metallic fuels will be capable of significantly higher burnup and power density compared to conventional oxide fuels. The fuel in a nuclear reactor generates heat energy. That heat is then converted through steam into electricity that is sold. Burnup is the total amount of electricity generated per unit mass of nuclear fuel, and is a function of the power density of a nuclear fuel and the amount of time the fuel operates in the reactor. Power density is the amount of heat power generated per unit volume of nuclear fuel. Conventional oxide fuel used in existing commercial reactors is approaching the limits of its burnup and power density capability. As a result, further optimization to increase power output from the same core size and improve the economics and safety of nuclear power generation using conventional oxide fuel technologies is limited. As the industry prepares to meet the increasing global demand for electricity production, longer operating cycles and higher reactor power outputs have become a much sought-after solution for the current and future reactor fleet.

We believe our proprietary nuclear fuel designs have the potential to significantly enhance the nuclear power industry&#146;s economics and increase power output by:

providing an increase in power output of up to 10% while simultaneously extending the operating cycle length from 18 to 24 months in existing pressurized water reactors (which are currently constrained to an 18-month operating cycle by oxide fuel); or increasing the power up to 17% while retaining an 18-month operating cycle; enabling increased reactor power output (up to 30% increase) without changing the core size in new build pressurized water reactors (PWRs); and reducing the volume of spent fuel per kilowatt-hour as well as enhancing proliferation resistance of spent fuel. There are significant technology synergies among our primary fuel products due to utilization of the proprietary metallic fuel rod technology that is at the core of each of them. Once completed, a full-scale demonstration and qualification of the metallic fuel rod technology will simultaneously advance all of our product families currently under development. Due to the significantly lower fuel operating temperature, our metallic nuclear fuel rods are expected to provide major improvements to safety margins during off-normal events.

We are currently focusing our development efforts on the metallic fuel with a power uprate of up to 10% and a 24-month operating cycle in existing Westinghouse-type four-loop pressurized water reactors. Those reactors represent a large segment of the global market and comprise our initial target market. Our metallic fuel could also be adapted for use in other types of water-cooled commercial power reactors, such as boiling water reactors, Canada Deuterium Uranium (CANDU) heavy water reactors, as well as water-cooled small modular reactors.

US Nuclear Regulatory Commission licensing processes require engineering analysis of a large break loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA), as well as many other scenarios. The LOCA scenario assumes failure of a large water pipe in the reactor coolant system. Under LOCA conditions, the fuel and cladding temperatures rise due to reduced cooling capacity. Preliminary analytical modeling shows that under a design-basis LOCA scenario, unlike conventional uranium dioxide fuel, the cladding of the Lightbridge-designed metallic fuel rods would stay at least 200 degrees below the 850-900 degrees Celsius temperature at which steam begins to react with the zirconium cladding to generate hydrogen gas. Buildup of hydrogen gas in a nuclear power plant can lead to detonation of the hydrogen. Lightbridge fuel is designed to prevent hydrogen gas generation in design-basis LOCA situations, which is a major safety benefit.

We believe our fuel designs will allow current and new build nuclear reactors to safely increase power production and reduce operations and maintenance costs on a per kilowatt-hour basis. New build nuclear reactors could also benefit from the reduced upfront capital investment per kilowatt of generating capacity. In addition to the projected electricity production cost savings, we believe that our technology can result in utilities or countries needing to deploy fewer new reactors to generate the same amount of electricity, resulting in significant capital cost savings. For utilities or countries that already have operating reactors, our technology could be utilized to increase the power output of those reactors as opposed to building new reactors. Further, we believe that the fuel fabrication or manufacturing process for this new fuel design is simpler, which we expect could lower fuel fabrication costs.

Consulting Business Segment Overview 

Our business model expanded with the establishment of a consulting business segment in 2007, through which we provide consulting and strategic advisory services to companies and governments planning to create or expand electricity generation capabilities using nuclear power plants. On August 1, 2008, we signed separate consulting services agreements with two government entities: Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation (ENEC) formed by Abu Dhabi, one of the member Emirates of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and the Federal Authority for Nuclear Regulation (FANR) formed by the government of the UAE. Under these two original agreements, we have provided consulting and strategic advisory services over a contract term of five years starting from June 23, 2008. The FANR contract has been extended to December 31, 2016. These contracts can each continue to be extended upon agreement by both parties. Substantially all of our consulting business segment revenue is from foreign sources. We have also signed other consulting contracts in 2013 and 2014 with governmental and non-governmental entities to provide various consulting services that ended in 2015.

NEXT GENERATION NUCLEAR FUEL FOR THE NUCLEAR INDUSTRY 

Recent Developments 

AREVA Agreements On December 18, 2015, we entered into a letter of agreement with AREVA NP (&#147;AREVA&#148;) setting out the principal terms of the potential formation of one or more joint ventures between Lightbridge and AREVA to further develop, manufacture, commercialize, and fund Lightbridge&#146;s next generation metallic nuclear fuel technology. The letter of agreement established a framework for the future collaboration between Lightbridge and AREVA. The letter of agreement, as amended, also granted AREVA an exclusivity period for negotiations with us regarding formation of joint ventures to develop, manufacture, commercialize, and fund our next generation metallic nuclear fuel technology, which exclusivity period will expire on March 14, 2016 or the later expiration of the joint development agreement. On March 14, 2016, we entered into a joint development agreement (&#147;JDA&#148;) with AREVA which will define the different steps (including, without limitation, a feasibility study, a business plan, and an implementation action plan), working groups, and methodology to determine the feasibility and opportunity of future joint ventures between the parties. The joint development agreement provides the process by which the parties will execute definitive documentation for the joint ventures, including a term sheet that will set forth the main terms of the definitive joint venture agreements. As part of the definitive joint venture agreements, based on successful completion of the scope of work under the JDA, Lightbridge and AREVA will agree on: (1) terms and conditions to complete the remaining scope of work to demonstrate and commercialize the fuel assemblies based on Lightbridge&#146;s metallic nuclear fuel, and (2) a technology licensing arrangement and other agreements needed to form and operate the joint venture company. The companies have agreed to work exclusively together in the area covered by the JDA, which will remain in force until the formation of the joint venture or December 31, 2016 at the latest. 

On March 4, 2016, we won the CleanEquity Monaco Award in Excellence in Technology Research for our innovation in nuclear fuel. The award is presented annually by His Serene Highness Prince Albert II of Monaco after the winner is selected by a panel of independent judges. 

On December 16, 2015, we entered into an initial services agreement with BWXT Nuclear Energy, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of BWX Technologies, Inc., to evaluate the ability to fabricate and prepare a preliminary plan for fabrication of Lightbridge-designed partial length nuclear fuel samples at BWXT facilities in the United States. 

On January 12, 2016 we announced that, the Institute for Energy Technology (IFE), which operates the Halden Research Reactor in Norway, received formal regulatory approval from the Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority for all planned irradiation of Lightbridge metallic fuel at the Halden Research Reactor in Norway. 

Nuclear fuel managers at Dominion Generation, Duke Energy, Exelon Generation and Southern Company sent a letter to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (&#147;NRC&#148;) asking the NRC to prepare to review Lightbridge&#146;s patented fuel design, in advance of an expected application in 2017 to use the Company&#146;s fuel in a U.S. commercial reactor as early as 2020. The NRC relies on communications from licensees to adjust Commission staffing levels and budgets in anticipation of future regulatory reviews of applications submitted to the agency. These four utilities continue to advise Lightbridge on our nuclear fuel program, recently expanding their support to include expert technical advice in the area of NRC regulatory licensing activities. We expect to restart our discussions with the NRC in the coming months in preparation for regulatory licensing approval of lead test assembly operation with our metallic fuel in commercial reactors in the United States in the 2020-2021 timeframe. The letter is publicly available on the NRC website at http://pbadupws.nrc.gov/docs/ML1513/ML15134A092.pdf ; 

On September 9, 2015, we signed a Comprehensive Nuclear Services Agreement with Canadian Nuclear Laboratories (CNL) for fabrication of our patented next generation metallic nuclear fuel test samples at CNL facilities at Chalk River, Ontario, Canada. This enabling agreement provides the framework to proceed with Phases 2 and 3 of the test fuel sample fabrication at CNL&#146;s facilities in Chalk River as envisioned in an October 2014 Initial Cooperation Agreement. The initial scope of work under the comprehensive nuclear services agreement involves development of a fabrication plan in the first half of 2016. 

We entered into a binding, 10-year service agreement with the IFE, operator of the 25 MW Halden Research Reactor, southeast of Oslo, Norway. Beginning in 2017, we expect our fabricated fuel samples to undergo full irradiation under prototypic commercial reactor operating conditions in a pressurized water loop of the Halden Research Reactor. The project&#146;s pre-irradiation scope includes irradiation-rig mechanical design, detailed neutronic and thermal-hydraulic calculations, and safety analyses with necessary regulatory approvals. The initial phase of irradiation testing is expected to continue for about three years to reach the burnup necessary for insertion of lead test assemblies (LTAs) in a commercial power reactor. The final phase of irradiation testing necessary for batch reloads and full cores operating with a 10% power uprate and a 24-month cycle is expected to take an additional two years and be completed while LTAs have begun operating in the core of a commercial power reactor. Post-irradiation examination of our partially irradiated fuel samples also is planned to begin at Halden in 2018. 

IFE was granted an export license by the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs covering all planned activities relating to the Company's nuclear fuel in Norway. Planned activities include irradiation testing of our advanced metallic fuel samples under prototypic commercial reactor operating conditions, as well as discharge of irradiated fuel samples from IFE's Halden Research Reactor. The export license is valid for a standard initial term of 3 years through October 31, 2018, and is extendable. Post-irradiation examination of irradiated fuel samples at Studsvik in Sweden requires a separate Norwegian export license, for which IFE plans to apply. 

IFE's Safety Committee approved our planned loop irradiation experiment in the Halden Research Reactor. As a next step, IFE plans to submit a safety report on the Lightbridge-designed metallic fuel samples to the Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority, as part of an application for regulatory approval of the loop irradiation experiment in the Halden Research Reactor. 

Initial task and purchase orders have been issued under the recently signed agreements with CNL and IFE. Work is currently underway on both projects in accordance with the overall project plan. 

The Korean Intellectual Property Office approved and issued to us a key patent covering our multi- lobed metallic fuel rod design and fuel assemblies. Patent No. 10-151116 &#150; &#147;Nuclear Reactor (Variants), Fuel Assembly Consisting of Driver-Breeding Modules for a Nuclear Reactor (Variants) and a Fuel Cell for a Fuel Assembly&#148; - expands international protection of our proprietary fuel technology. 

In addition to the above key Korean patent, we have been granted Korean and Australian patents covering our thorium-based seed and blanket fuel assembly design for Western-type pressurized water reactors. The new patents are valid until December 2028. 

The Lightbridge Quality Assurance Program has been formulated to meet the requirements of 10 CFR 50 Appendix B, 10 CFR Part 21 and the applicable requirements of NQA-1: 2008 Edition, 2009 Addenda. 

Research and Development Project Schedule 

We currently anticipate that we, working in collaboration with our development partners/vendors and in certain cases contingent upon execution of collaborative research and development agreements with them will be able to:

Have semi-scale metallic fuel samples fabricated in late 2016-early 2017 for irradiation testing in a test reactor environment under prototypic commercial reactor conditions; Perform in-reactor and out-of-reactor experiments in 2016-2020; Establish a pilot-scale fuel fabrication facility and demonstrate full-length fabrication of our metallic fuel rods in 2017-2018; Develop analytical models in 2016-2018 for our metallic fuel technology that can be used for reactor analysis and regulatory licensing; and Begin LTA operation in a full-size commercial light water reactor as soon as 2020-2021, which involves testing a limited number of full-scale fuel assemblies in the core of a commercial nuclear power plant over three 18-month cycles. Accordingly, based on our current estimated schedule, a purchase order for an initial reload batch placed by a utility is expected as soon as 2023-2024 (after two 18-month cycles of LTA operation), with final qualification (i.e., deployment of fuel in the first reload batch) in a commercial reactor expected as soon as 2025-2026. In the interim, once we have the initial fuel performance data from loop irradiation of our fuel samples in a research reactor under prototypic operating conditions of a commercial power reactor, which is currently anticipated by late 2017-early 2018, we will target entry into a commercial arrangement with one or more major fuel fabricators that may include upfront technology access fees and/or engineering support or consulting payments to us.

OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY &#150; NUCLEAR FUEL TECHNOLOGY BUSINESS SEGMENT 

We intend to license our intellectual property for nuclear fuel designs to existing major nuclear fuel fabricators who have fuel supply contracts with utilities that own and operate nuclear power plants worldwide. We believe that such partnering will allow us to take advantage of the existing customer base of fuel fabricators, thus enabling our fuel products to achieve higher market penetration rates in a relatively short period of time. We are currently pursuing a research, development, and demonstration strategy aimed at generating sufficient interest and confidence in our fuel technology among major fuel fabricators with a view to entering into a commercial arrangement with one or more of them near the completion of the first half of our loop irradiation testing program. We believe there may be opportunities for licensing our fuel fabrication technology and engineering support fees from fuel fabricators.

We anticipate that the following factors will play a key role in structuring a technology license agreement with a major fuel supplier:

Sharing of future fuel development costs; An upfront technology access fee payable to us; Ongoing royalty fees from future fuel product sales payable to us based on a cost sharing formula; and Potential engineering support or consulting payments payable to us. Our commercialization efforts are based on a multi-prong approach that we believe will increase the likelihood of success:

1. Approach major fuel fabricators (push marketing strategy to our direct licensing customers)

&#160; &#160; 2. Early outreach to nuclear power utilities (pull marketing strategy to the customers of the fuel fabricators)

&#160; &#160; 3. Generate public, industry, and government awareness of our fuel technologies

We are putting a significant amount of effort into reaching out to major fuel fabricators. Our ultimate commercial success depends on how soon and what kind of a commercial arrangement we are able to negotiate with one or more of these potential partners. As a result, building relationships with these potential partners and keeping them up-to-date on our fuel technology demonstration progress through ongoing dialogue are the essential elements of our commercialization strategy.

COMPETITION, CURRENT STATUS AND CHALLENGES OF OUR NUCLEAR FUEL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT WORK 

COMPETITION 

To our knowledge, our nuclear fuel development project is the only program that we believe could be commercially viable to increase, in a safe and economically attractive way, power output by up to 17% in existing PWRs and up to 30% in new build PWRs. Due to long product development timelines, significant nuclear regulatory requirements, and our intellectual property, we believe that the barriers to entry are very high for a competitor to our nuclear fuel technology segment.

Competition with respect to the design of commercially viable nuclear fuel products is limited to conventional uranium oxide fuels, which, as discussed above, are reaching the limits in terms of their capability to provide increased power output or longer fuel cycles. We believe that the industry needs fuel products that can provide these benefits. While we believe conventional uranium oxide fuel may be capable of achieving power uprates of up to 10% in existing PWRs, doing so would require uranium-235 enrichment levels above 5% (as is also the case with our metallic fuel), higher reload batch sizes, or a combination thereof. The alternative route of increasing reload batch sizes while keeping uranium enrichment levels below 5% for power uprates up to 10% using conventional uranium oxide fuel raises the cost of each fuel reload, resulting in a significant fuel cycle cost penalty to the nuclear utility. The cost penalty could have a dramatic adverse impact on the economics of existing plants whose original capital cost has already been written off (most US nuclear power plants fall into this category).

Due to poor economics, nuclear utilities may be reluctant to embrace that route as a way to increase power output by up to 10%, which could lead to greater opportunities for use of Lightbridge&#146;s nuclear fuel.

There are several major companies that collectively fabricate a large majority of the fuel used in the world&#146;s commercial nuclear power plants, including both Western-type PWRs and boiling water reactors (BWRs), as well as Russian-type VVERs. To the extent that these companies currently own and may in the future develop new nuclear fuel designs that can be used in the same types of reactors as those targeted by us, they can be viewed as potential competitors. However, our commercialization strategy is not to compete with these major fuel fabricators, but rather to partner with one or more of these companies through technology license arrangements to extend their fuel offerings to their customers with our fuel technologies. For this reason, we consider these companies as potential partners or licensees as opposed to competitors.

CURRENT STATUS 

Government Approvals and Relationships with Critical Development Partners/Vendors 

The sales and marketing of our services and technology internationally may be subject to US export control regulations and the export control laws of other countries. Governmental authorizations may be required before we can export our services or technology or collaborate with foreign entities. If authorizations are required and not granted, our international business plans could be materially affected. Furthermore, the export authorization process is often time consuming. Violation of export control regulations could subject us to fines and other penalties, such as losing the ability to export for a period of years, which would limit our revenue growth opportunities and significantly hinder our attempts to expand our business internationally.

In 2015, we received our export controls approval from the US Department of Energy for all of our planned work in Canada, Norway, and Sweden.

The testing, fabrication and use of nuclear fuels by our future partners, licensees and nuclear power generators will be heavily regulated. The test facilities and other locations where our fuel designs may be tested before commercial use require governmental approvals from the host country&#146;s nuclear regulatory authority. The responsibility for obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals will lie with our research and development contractors that conduct such tests and experiments. Nuclear fuel fabricators, which will ultimately fabricate fuel using our technology under commercial licenses from us, are similarly regulated. Utilities that operate nuclear power plants that may utilize the fuel produced by these fuel fabricators require specific licenses relating to possession and use of nuclear materials as well as numerous other governmental approvals for the ownership and operation of nuclear power plants.

Separately, some of the planned critical path research, development, and demonstration activities require access to certain highly specialized technical expertise and licensed facilities where such development and demonstration work can be carried out. There are a limited number of commercial entities or government research laboratories in the world that possess this kind of technical expertise and have a licensed operating facility, including a limited number in the United States. We are currently focusing our fuel development efforts with both domestic and overseas development partners/vendors. Beginning in 2017, we expect our fabricated fuel samples to undergo full irradiation under prototypic commercial reactor operating conditions in a pressurized water loop of the Halden Research Reactor in Norway. However, the National Nuclear Security Administration (&#147;NNSA&#148;) of the U.S. Department of Energy, has informed us that a transfer of our fuel samples to Norway would not be possible until the bilateral agreement for peaceful nuclear cooperation, or a so-called &#147;123 Agreement&#148; between the U.S. and Norway was renewed. Under Section 123 of the U.S. Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, a bilateral agreement for peaceful nuclear cooperation between the United States and another country must be in place before significant transfers of nuclear material, equipment, or components from the United States to the other country. The previous Section 123 Agreement with Norway has expired. The State Department and Norway have finalized the terms for the renewal of the 123 Agreement. Once the new 123 Agreement has been signed by both governments, , the U.S. President transmits the proposed agreement to both houses of Congress for a 90-day review process. The agreement will become effective unless Congress adopts a joint resolution of disapproval. If the 123 Agreement between the United States and Norway is not renewed by the time our fuel samples are fabricated and ready for shipment (currently expected around the end of 2016), we may risk program schedule delays. Such delays could disrupt our fuel technology development plans, which may have a detrimental impact on the results of our operations.

A domestic partner/vendor may eliminate the need to seek a separate US export license authorization for this work and eliminate the risk of the 123 Agreement with Norway not being in place in time to support our current schedule. If we proceed with a US national laboratory, any agreement will be subject to DOE&#146;s review and approval. Any delay in such approval of our proposed agreement by DOE could cause program schedule slippage. If we proceed with a US commercial entity, some aspects of the development and demonstration work may still require certain US regulatory approvals (e.g., relating to 19.7% enriched uranium). Any delay in such regulatory approvals could have an adverse impact on our program schedule and future financial results. 

CHALLENGES 

Collaboration with a fuel fabricator that can fabricate the LTAs and a nuclear utility that is willing to accept the LTAs is required for LTA demonstration in a commercial reactor. In the US, the fabricator and the utility will be primarily responsible for securing necessary regulatory licensing approvals for the LTA operation. To this end, in 2011, we established a Nuclear Utility Fuel Advisory Board (NUFAB) to further strengthen dialogue with global nuclear utilities. Separately, we are also pursuing discussions with major fuel fabricators relating to collaboration on our nuclear fuel designs. As disclosed recently in an 8-K filing, we have entered into a Letter of Agreement with AREVA relating to our nuclear fuel designs. 10 

There is a lack of publicly available experimental data on our metallic fuel. As a result, we will need to conduct various irradiation experiments to confirm fuel performance under normal and off-normal events. Loop irradiation in a test reactor environment prototypic of commercial reactor operating conditions and other experiments on unirradiated and irradiated metallic fuel samples will be essential to demonstrate the performance and advantages of our metallic fuel. We are currently planning loop irradiation testing of our metallic fuel samples in a research reactor as part of this effort. Existing analytical models may be inadequate. New analytical models, capable of accurately predicting the behavior of our metallic fuel during normal operation and off-normal events may be required. Experimental data measured from our planned irradiation demonstrations will help to identify areas where new analytical models or modifications to existing ones may be required. Demonstration of a fabrication process both for semi-scale irradiation fuel samples and subsequently for full-length (12-14 feet) metallic fuel rods for PWR LTAs is required. Past operating experience with similar metallic fuel composition involved fabrication of metallic fuel rods up to 3 feet in length in Russia. In 2015, we entered into separate agreements with CNL, a wholly owned subsidiary of Atomic Energy of Canada Limited, and BWXT Nuclear Energy, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of BWX Technologies, Inc. to demonstrate feasibility of fabrication of semi-scale irradiation fuel samples at their existing facilities in Canada and the United States, respectively. Our current plan is for these fabricated semi-scale irradiation fuel samples to be irradiated to their target burnup in a pressurized water loop of the Halden Research Reactor located in Halden, Norway and for post- irradiation examination of the irradiated fuel samples to be performed on the same site in Norway. There is also the opportunity to utilize additional nearby hot cell facilities located in Studsvik, Sweden that are operated by the Swedish company Studsvik AB. SOURCES AND AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS 

We intend that our fuel technology development business will become a licensing business, as we plan to license our metallic fuel technology to fuel fabricators. We do not plan to utilize any raw materials in the conduct of our operations. The fuel fabricators which will ultimately fabricate our fuel products will require zirconium and uranium, and additional raw materials that are required for the production of nuclear fuel assemblies that go into the reactor core. Uranium and zirconium are available from various suppliers at market prices.

OVERVIEW OF THE NUCLEAR POWER INDUSTRY 

Potential Market 

Presently, nuclear power provides approximately 7% of the world&#146;s energy, including approximately 11% of the world&#146;s electricity. According to the World Nuclear Association, as of January 1, 2016 there were approximately 439 operable nuclear power plants worldwide, mostly light water reactors, with the most common types being PWRs, BWRs, and VVER reactors (a Russian equivalent of PWRs). Nuclear power provides a non-fossil fuel, low-carbon energy solution that can meet baseload electricity needs.

Due to substantial project risks and the significant upfront capital commitment associated with building new reactors, many nuclear utilities in deregulated markets choose to optimize their existing generating capacity through increasing their capacity utilization factor, power uprates and plant life extensions. We expect this trend to continue, particularly in the mature nuclear markets with significant existing nuclear capacity. We expect most of the new build activity to occur in emerging nuclear markets.

Of the world&#146;s existing reactors currently in operation, PWRs (including Russian-designed VVERs) account for more than half of the net operating capacity, with BWRs being second accounting for another 20%.

Of the nuclear reactors currently under construction, over 80% are either PWRs or VVERs with a rated electric power output of 1,000 megawatts (&#147;MWe&#148;) or greater.

Utilities have utilized power uprates since the 1970&#146;s as a way to increase the power output of their nuclear plants. Typically, more highly enriched uranium fuel and/or more fresh fuel is needed to increase power output. This enables the reactor to produce more thermal energy and therefore more steam to drive the turbine generator and produce electricity. In order to accomplish this, components such as pipes, valves, pumps, heat exchangers, electrical transformers and generators, must be able to accommodate the conditions that would exist at the higher power level. For example, a higher power level usually involves higher steam and water flow through the systems used to convert thermal power into electric power. These systems must be capable of accommodating the higher flows.

In some instances, utilities will modify and/or replace components in order to accommodate a higher power level. Technical analyses must demonstrate that the proposed plant configuration remains safe and that measures to protect the health and safety of the public continue to be effective. These analyses, which span many technical disciplines, are reviewed and approved by the regulator before a power uprate can be performed.

The utility will conduct an economic analysis to evaluate the potential financial benefits of the proposed uprate. Typically, power uprates enable utilities to increase their generating capacity at a cost significantly less than the cost of building a new plant. In many cases, power uprates can be completed in months as opposed to the several years required for new build, thus the invested dollars begin producing revenue shortly after they are spent. Power uprates, therefore, represent an efficient use of capital.

Utilities have embraced power uprates as a cost effective way to increase their generation capacity. While the efforts thus far have occurred mostly in the United States, there is a large, untapped worldwide market for power uprates. There are about 150 PWRs operating outside the United States. If all of these plants had their power increased by 10%, the aggregate generating capacity would increase by about 14,500 MWe. This is equivalent to about 12 new 1,200 MWe reactors. The incentive to proceed with power uprates at the 10% level is significant since there are few changes required to implement the power uprate, and the changes that are required are relatively inexpensive. The limiting factor at the moment is the fuel. We believe that our metallic fuel rod technology will enable the 10% increase in power along with extending the fuel cycle to 24 months, and can be used to support even greater power increases up to 30%.

Most nuclear power plants originally had a licensed lifetime of 25 to 40 years, but engineering assessments have established that many can operate much longer. In the US, approximately 60 reactors have been granted license extensions to continue operating for a total of 60 years. Most of the plants that have not already requested a license extension are expected to apply in the near future. A license extension at about the 30-year mark requires additional capital expenditure for the replacement of worn equipment and outdated control systems.

The technical and economic feasibility of replacing major reactor components, such as steam generators in PWRs, has been demonstrated. The increased revenue generated from extending the lifetime of existing plants is attractive to utilities, especially in view of the difficulties in obtaining public acceptance of constructing replacement nuclear capacity.

The loss of generating capacity by old plants being retired is balanced by new plants coming on line. There are no firm projections for retirements over the next two decades, however the World Nuclear Association (WNA), estimates that at least 60 of those now operating will close by 2030, most being small plants. Using conservative assumptions about license renewal, the 2009 WNA Market Report anticipates that approximately 143 reactors will be decommissioned by 2030.

Almost all of the new build reactor designs are either Generation III or Generation III+ type reactors. The primary difference from second-generation designs is that many incorporate passive or inherent safety features which require no active controls or operational intervention to avoid accidents in the event of malfunction. Many of these passive systems rely on gravity, natural convection, or resistance to high temperatures.

Influence of Natural Gas Prices in the United States 

Natural gas is currently the cheapest option for power generation in the US, which is causing some utilities to abandon plans for nuclear and other power sources. The abundance of cheap natural gas may adversely affect the markets for nuclear power uprates.

Influence of the Accident at Fukushima, Japan and New International Nuclear Build 

The major nuclear accident at the Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan following the strong earthquake and massive tsunami that occurred on March 11, 2011, increased public opposition to nuclear power in some countries, resulting in a slowdown in, or, in some cases, a complete halt to, new construction of nuclear power plants and an early shut down of existing power plants in certain countries. As a result, some countries that were considering launching new domestic nuclear power programs before the Fukushima accident have delayed or cancelled preparatory activities they were planning to undertake as part of such programs. This has diminished the number of consulting opportunities that we could compete for globally, at least in the near-term. In addition, the Fukushima accident appears to have shrunk the projected size of the global nuclear power market in 2025-2030 as reflected in the most recent reference case projections published by the World Nuclear Association. At the same time, the event has brought a greater emphasis on safety to the forefront that may be beneficial to our metallic fuel that provides improved safety and fuel performance during normal operation and design-basis accidents.

Our Initial Target Market 

Presently, we are targeting Western-type PWR reactors with a net capacity of 900 MWe or more that will be under 40 years of age by 2021. These reactors represent the largest market segment, both in terms of operating reactors and new build units under construction or planned. Our technology is applicable to many more reactors than those included in our initial target market. The initial target market was selected as we believe that it represents the largest commercial market segment with the highest potential for return on investment in the near-term.

Based on the WNA&#146;s reactor database, we estimate that the current size of our initial target market is approximately 127 gigawatts electric, or GWe, of net generating capacity. We estimate the size of our target market to expand to 249 GWe by 2025 and 261 GWe by 2030.

Within the identified potential target market, France, China, United States, and Korea represent the largest market segment, accounting for over 80% of the total projected target market size in 2030. We believe that it is important for us, through technology license arrangements with major fuel vendors, to ultimately secure a footing in one or more of these countries in order to achieve meaningful market penetration rates.

OUR CONSULTING BUSINESS SEGMENT 

The Nature of Our Consulting Services 

This segment is primarily engaged in the business of assisting commercial and governmental entities globally with developing and expanding their nuclear industry capabilities and infrastructure. We provide integrated strategic advice across a range of expertise areas including, for example, regulatory development, nuclear reactor site selection, procurement and deployment, reactor and fuel technology, international relations, program management and infrastructure development.

Due to the relatively limited growth in the nuclear energy industry during the 1980&#146;s and 1990&#146;s, and corresponding limited recruitment into the industry, the cadre of engineers, managers and other nuclear energy industry experts is aging. In any nuclear renaissance, we believe that the industry will be challenged in acquiring and retaining sufficient qualified expertise. In countries studying the potential of establishing new nuclear energy programs, the number of qualified nuclear energy personnel is limited, and we believe that those countries will need to rely on significant support from non-domestic service providers and experts to ensure success in those programs.

Our emergence in the field of nuclear energy consulting is in direct response to the need for independent assessments and highly qualified technical consulting services from countries looking to establish nuclear energy programs, by providing a blueprint for safe, secure, reliable, and cost-effective nuclear power. We offer full-scope strategic planning and advisory services for new and growing existing markets. Furthermore, we only engage with commercial entities and governments that are dedicated to non-proliferative and transparent nuclear programs.

Our consulting services are expert and relationship based, with particular emphasis on key decision makers in senior positions within governments or companies, as well as focus on overall management of nuclear energy programs. To date, nearly all of our revenues have been derived from our consulting and strategic advisory services business segment, which primarily provides nuclear consulting services to entities within the United Arab Emirates, our first significant consulting and strategic advisory client. We have also provided nuclear safety consulting advice to US nuclear utilities. We expect to be working both directly and as a subcontractor to larger companies for our new consulting contracts in 2016 and beyond and utilizing less outside consulting firms to provide us with consulting services in the future. 

Competition in Nuclear Industry Consulting 

In general, the market for nuclear industry consulting services is competitive, fragmented and subject to rapid change. The market includes a large number of participants with a variety of skills and industry expertise, including local, regional, national, and international firms that specialize in political assessment, legal and regulatory framework, nuclear technology, or program implementation. Some of these companies are global in scope and have greater personnel, financial, technical, and marketing resources than we do. The larger companies offering similar services as we do typically are also active in the delivery of nuclear power plant equipment and/or provision of engineering design services. We believe that our independence, experience, expertise, reputation and segment focus, enable us to compete effectively in this marketplace as a strategic advisor for those governments wishing to develop a new civil nuclear program.

Our major challenge in pursuing our business is that the decision making process for nuclear power programs typically involves careful consideration by many parties and therefore requires significant time. Many of the potential clients that could benefit from our services are in regions of the world where tensions surrounding nuclear energy are high, or in countries where public opinion plays an important role. Domestic and international political pressure and public opposition to nuclear power may hinder our efforts to provide nuclear energy consulting services.

Employees 

Our business model is to limit the number of our full-time employees and to rely on individual independent contractors, outside agencies and technical facilities with specific skills to assist with various business functions including, but not limited to: corporate overhead personnel, research and development, and government relations. This model limits overhead costs and allows us to draw upon resources that are specifically tailored to our internal and external (client) needs. As of December 31, 2015, we had seven full-time employees and two part-time employees. We utilize a network of independent contractors available for deployment for specialized consulting assignments. We believe that our relationship with our employees and contractors is satisfactory.

History and Corporate Structure 

We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on February 2, 1999. On October 6, 2006, we acquired our wholly-owned subsidiary Thorium Power, Inc. and changed our name to Thorium Power, Ltd. Thorium Power, Inc. was incorporated on January 8, 1992. In 2008, we formed Lightbridge International Holding, LLC (a Delaware limited liability company) to be a holding company for our foreign branch offices. Our foreign branch offices were set up to facilitate our international operations. We registered a branch office in England in 2008 called Lightbridge Advisors Limited and a branch office in Moscow, Russia in July 2009, which we are in the process of closing. On September 21, 2009, we changed our name from Thorium Power Ltd. to Lightbridge Corporation to more accurately reflect the varied nature of our business operations. Thorium Power, Inc. remains a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lightbridge Corporation.
