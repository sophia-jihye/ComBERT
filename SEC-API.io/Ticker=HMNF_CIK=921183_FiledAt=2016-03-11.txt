Lending Activities 

&#160; 

General. Historically, the Company has originated 15 and 30 year fixed rate mortgage loans secured by one-to-four family residences for its loan portfolio. Over the past 15 years, the Company has focused on managing interest rate risk and increasing interest income by increasing its investment in shorter term and generally higher yielding commercial real estate, commercial business and construction loans, while reducing its investment in longer term one-to-four family real estate loans. The Company continues to originate 15 and 30 year fixed rate mortgage loans and some shorter term fixed rate loans. The shorter term fixed rate loans and adjustable rate loans are generally placed into portfolio, while the majority of the 15 and 30 year fixed rate mortgage loans are sold in the secondary mortgage market. Mortgage interest rates continued to be at relatively low levels in 2015 and very few 15 and 30 year loans were placed into portfolio as most were sold into the secondary market in order to manage the Company&#8217;s interest rate risk position. The Company also offers an array of consumer loan products that include both open and closed end home equity loans. Home equity lines of credit have adjustable interest rates based upon the prime rate, as published in the Wall Street Journal, plus a margin. Refer to &#8220; Note 5 Loans Receivable, Net &#8221; and &#8220; Note 6 Allowance for Loan Losses and Credit Quality Information &#8221; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report for more information on the loan portfolio (incorporated by reference in Item 8 of Part II of this Form 10-K).

&#160;

Includes demand loans, loans having no stated maturity and overdraft loans.

&#160;

The total amount of loans due after December 31, 2016 which have predetermined interest rates is $178.0 million, while the total amount of amount of loans due after such date which have floating or adjustable interest rates is $69.8 million. At December 31, 2015, construction loans were $15.1 million for one-to-four family dwellings, $18.9 million for multi-family and $4.1 million for nonresidential.

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

The aggregate amount of loans and extensions of credit that the Bank is permitted to make to any one borrower is generally limited to 15% of unimpaired capital and surplus. In addition to the 15% limit, the Bank is permitted to lend an additional amount equal to 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus if the additional amount is fully secured by &#8220;readily marketable collateral&#8221; having a current market value of at least 100% of the loan or extension of credit. Similarly, the Bank is permitted to lend additional amounts equal to the lesser of 30% of unimpaired capital and surplus, or $30 million, for certain residential development loans. Applicable law establishes a number of rules for combining loans to separate borrowers. Loans or extensions of credit to one person may be attributed to other persons if: (i) the proceeds of a loan or extension of credit are used for the direct benefit of the other person; or (ii) a common enterprise is deemed to exist between persons. At December 31, 2015, based upon the 15% limitation, the Bank&#39;s regulatory limit for loans to one borrower was approximately $12.2 million and no loans to any one borrower exceeded this amount. At December 31, 2015, the Bank&#8217;s largest aggregate amount of loans to one borrower totaled $10.1 million. All of the loans for the largest borrower were performing in accordance with their terms and the borrower had no affiliation with the Bank other than its relationship as a borrower.

&#160;

All of the Bank&#39;s lending is subject to its written underwriting standards and to loan origination procedures. Decisions on loan applications are made on the basis of detailed applications and property valuations determined by an independent appraiser. The loan applications are designed primarily to determine the borrower&#39;s ability to repay. The more significant items on the application are verified through the use of credit reports, financial statements, tax returns, or confirmations. 

&#160;

One-to-four family loans that are equal to or less than the conforming/saleable loan dollar limits as established by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) or Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) may be approved by a designated underwriter. This limit was $417,000 for both 2015 and 2014. Loans up to $500,000 may be approved by one of the Bank&#8217;s retail lending underwriters, the Rochester Market President, the Rochester Market Vice President, or the Bank&#8217;s Director of Business Banking. The approval limit for these individuals varies depending on their authority level and includes the total aggregate amount of all retail loan obligations owed or guaranteed to the Bank, plus the new obligation. Loans up to $1.0 million may be approved by the Bank&#8217;s Director of Retail Lending and Loan Servicing or the Vice President of Credit Administration. The Bank&#8217;s Chief Credit Officer and Chief Operating Officer may approve loans up to $1.75 million and $2.0 million, respectively. The approval limit for these individuals includes the total aggregate amount of all loan obligations owed or guaranteed to the Bank, plus the new obligation. Loans greater than $2.0 million require the approval of a majority of the Executive Loan Committee.

&#160;

The Bank&#39;s individual commercial loan officers have the authority to approve loans that meet the guidelines established by the Bank&#8217;s commercial loan policy for loans up to their individual delegated aggregate relationship authority. Individual delegated aggregate relationship authority varies by loan officer, with the highest individual authorities being $400,000. The aggregate relationship amount is determined by the total customer credit commitments outstanding, plus the new loan request amount. The Director of Business Banking can approve loans up to a $500,000 aggregate relationship. The Vice President of Credit Administration, Chief Credit Officer and the Chief Operating Officer have approval authorities up to $1.0 million aggregate, $1.75 million aggregate and $2.0 million aggregate, respectively. Existing loan relationship requests that, in aggregate, are greater than $2.0 million to $7.5 million, or a new relationship loan request of greater than $2.0 million up to $4.5 million, are approved by the Senior Loan Committee. Any loan request greater than these limits must be approved by the Bank&#8217;s Executive Loan Committee.

&#160;

The Bank generally requires title insurance on its mortgage loans, as well as fire and extended coverage casualty insurance in amounts at least equal to the principal amount of the loan or the value of improvements on the property. The Bank also requires flood insurance to protect the property securing its interest when the property is located in a flood plain.

&#160; &#160; 

One-to-Four Family Residential Real Estate Lending. At December 31, 2015, the Company&#39;s one-to-four family real estate loans, consisting of both fixed rate and adjustable rate loans, totaled $90.9 million, an increase of $21.1 million, from $69.8 million at December 31, 2014. The increase in the one-to-four family loans in 2015 is the result of additional mortgage lending staff and an increased emphasis on originating shorter term fixed rate and adjustable rate mortgage loans that were placed into the portfolio during 2015. The majority of the longer term loans that were originated during the year continued to be sold into the secondary market in order to manage the Company&#8217;s interest rate risk position.

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

The Company offers conventional fixed rate one-to-four family loans that have maximum terms of 30 years. In order to manage interest rate risk, the Company typically sells the majority of fixed rate loan originations with terms to maturity of 15 years or greater that are eligible for sale in the secondary market. The interest rates charged on the fixed rate loan products are based on the secondary market delivery rates, as well as other competitive factors. The Company also originates fixed rate loans with terms up to 30 years that are insured by the Federal Housing Authority (FHA), Veteran&#8217;s Administration (VA), Minnesota Housing Finance Agency, Iowa Finance Authority, or United States Department of Agriculture-Guaranteed Housing.

&#160;

The Company also offers one-year adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) at a margin (generally 350 to 450 basis points) over the yield on the Average Weekly One Year U.S. Treasury Constant Maturity Index for terms of up to 30 years. The ARM loans offered by the Company allow the borrower to select (subject to pricing) an initial period of one year, three years, or five years between the loan origination and the date the first interest rate change occurs. The ARMs generally have a 200 basis point annual interest rate change cap and a lifetime cap of 600 basis points over or under the initial rate. The Company&#8217;s originated ARMs do not permit negative amortization of principal, generally do not contain prepayment penalties and are not convertible into fixed rate loans. Because of the low interest rate environment that has existed over the last few years, a limited number of ARM loans have been originated as consumers have generally opted for the longer term fixed rate loans.

&#160;

In underwriting one-to-four family residential real estate loans, the Company evaluates the borrower&#39;s credit history, ability to make principal, interest and escrow payments, the value of the property that will secure the loan, and debt to income ratios. Properties securing one-to-four family residential real estate loans made by the Company are appraised by independent appraisers. The Company originates residential mortgage loans with loan-to-value ratios up to 100% for owner-occupied homes and up to 85% for non-owner-occupied homes; however, private mortgage insurance is generally required to reduce the Company&#39;s exposure to 80% or less of the value on most loans. The Company generally seeks to underwrite its loans in accordance with secondary market, FHA or VA standards. However, the Company does originate shorter term fixed rate and adjustable rate one-to-four family loans for its portfolio that do not meet certain secondary market guidelines.

&#160;

The Company&#39;s residential mortgage loans customarily include due-on-sale clauses giving it the right to declare the loan immediately due and payable in the event that, among other things, the borrower sells or otherwise disposes of the property subject to the mortgage.

&#160;

Fixed rate loans in the Company&#39;s portfolio represent conventional fixed rate loans. At December 31, 2015, $1.7 million of the one-to-four family residential loan portfolio was non-performing compared to $1.6 million at December 31, 2014.

&#160; &#160; 

Commercial Real Estate and Multi-Family Lending. The Company originates permanent commercial real estate and multi-family loans secured by properties located primarily in its market area. It also purchases a limited amount of participations in commercial real estate and multi-family loans originated by third parties. The commercial real estate and multi-family loan portfolio includes loans secured by motels, hotels, apartment buildings, churches, ethanol plants, manufacturing plants, land developments, office buildings, business facilities, shopping malls, nursing homes, golf courses, restaurants, warehouses, convenience stores, and other non-residential building properties primarily located in the upper Midwestern portion of the United States. At December 31, 2015, the Company&#8217;s commercial and multi-family real estate loans totaled $209.3 million, an increase of $30.2 million, from $179.1 million at December 31, 2014. 

&#160; &#160;

Permanent commercial real estate and multi-family loans are generally originated for a maximum term of 10 years and may have longer amortization periods with balloon maturity features. The interest rates may be fixed for the term of the loan or have adjustable features that are tied to the prime rate or another published index. Commercial real estate and multi-family loans are generally written in amounts up to 80% of the lesser of the appraised value of the property or the purchase price and generally have a debt service coverage ratio of at least 120%. The debt service coverage ratio is the ratio of net cash from operations to debt service payments. The Company may originate construction loans secured by commercial or multi-family real estate, or may purchase participation interests in third party originated construction loans secured by commercial or multi-family real estate.

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Appraisals on commercial real estate and multi-family real estate properties are performed by independent appraisers prior to the time the loan is made. For transactions less than $250,000, the Company may use an internal valuation. All appraisals on commercial and multi-family real estate are reviewed and approved by a qualified third party or credit department employee. The Bank&#39;s underwriting procedures require verification of the borrower&#39;s credit history, income and financial statements, banking relationships, and income projections for the property. The commercial loan policy generally requires personal guarantees from the proposed borrowers. An initial on-site inspection is generally required for all collateral properties for loans with balances in excess of $250,000. Independent annual reviews are performed for aggregate commercial lending relationships that exceed $500,000. The reviews cover financial performance, documentation completeness, and accuracy of loan risk ratings.

&#160;

Multi-family and commercial real estate loans generally present a higher level of risk than loans secured by one-to-four family residences. This greater risk is due to several factors, including the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and borrowers, the effects of general economic conditions on income producing properties and the increased difficulty of evaluating and monitoring these types of loans. Furthermore, the repayment of loans secured by multi-family and commercial real estate is typically dependent upon the successful operation of the related real estate project. If the cash flow from the project is reduced (for example, if leases are not obtained or renewed), the borrower&#39;s ability to repay the loan may be impaired. At December 31, 2015, $0.3 million of loans in the commercial real estate portfolio were non-performing, compared to $7.2 million at December 31, 2014. The largest non-performing lending relationship in this category as of December 31, 2015 is a $0.2 million loan secured by farm land located in the Bank&#8217;s primary market area. 

&#160;

Construction Lending. The Company makes construction loans to individuals for the construction of their residences and to builders for the construction of one-to-four family residences. It also makes a limited number of loans to builders for houses built on speculation. Construction loans also include commercial real estate loans. 

&#160;

Almost all loans to individuals for the construction of their residences are structured as permanent loans. These loans are made on the same terms as residential loans, except that during the construction phase, which typically lasts up to twelve months, the borrower pays interest only. Generally, the borrower also pays a construction fee at the time of origination plus other costs associated with processing the loan. Residential construction loans are underwritten pursuant to the same guidelines used for originating residential loans on existing properties.

&#160;

Construction loans to builders or developers of one-to-four family residences generally carry terms of one year or less. 

&#160;

Construction loans to owner occupants are generally made in amounts up to 95% of the lesser of cost or appraised value, but no more than 90% of the loan proceeds can be disbursed until the building is completed. The Company generally limits the loan-to-value ratios on loans to builders to 80%. Prior to making a commitment to fund a construction loan, the Company requires a valuation of the property, financial data, and verification of the borrower&#39;s income. The Company obtains personal guarantees for substantially all of its construction loans to builders. Personal financial statements of guarantors are also obtained as part of the loan underwriting process. Construction loans are generally located in the Company&#39;s market area.

&#160;

Construction loans are obtained principally through continued business from builders and developers who have previously borrowed from the Bank, as well as referrals from existing customers and walk-in customers. The application process includes a submission to the Bank of accurate plans, specifications and costs of the project to be constructed. These items are one factor utilized in the determination of the appraised value of the subject property to be built. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015, construction loans totaled $38.1 million, an increase of $25.5 million from $12.6 million at December 31, 2014. Total construction loans included $15.1 million and $6.4 million of one-to-four family residential, $18.9 million and $1.1 million of multi-family residential, and $4.1 million and $5.1 million of commercial real estate loans at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. The nature of construction loans makes them more difficult to evaluate and monitor than loans on existing buildings. The risk of loss on a construction loan is dependent largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the property&#39;s value upon completion of the project, experience of the builder, and the estimated cost (including interest) of the project. If the estimate of value proves to be inaccurate, the Company may be confronted, at or prior to the maturity of the loan, with a project having a value that is insufficient to assure full repayment or the possibility of having to make substantial investments to complete and sell the project. Because defaults in repayment may not occur during the construction period, it may be difficult to identify problem loans at an early stage. In these cases, the Company may be required to modify the terms of the loan. At December 31, 2015, $1.4 million of construction loans in the commercial real estate portfolio were non-performing compared to $1.5 million at December 31, 2014. The non-performing construction loans are loans to parties related through common ownership to construct model homes that when sold, or have a purchase agreement, are converted to performing loans and the interest is recognized.

&#160;

Consumer Lending. The Company originates a variety of consumer loans, including home equity loans (open-end and closed-end), automobile, recreational vehicles, mobile home, lot loans, loans secured by deposit accounts and other loans for household and personal purposes. At December 31, 2015, the Company&#8217;s consumer loans totaled $64.4 million, an increase of $9.5 million from $54.9 million at December 31, 2014. 

&#160;

Consumer loan terms vary according to the type and value of collateral, length of contract and creditworthiness of the borrower. The Company&#39;s consumer loans are made at fixed or adjustable interest rates, with terms up to 20 years for secured loans and up to five years for unsecured loans.

&#160;

The Company&#39;s home equity loans are written so that the total commitment amount, when combined with the balance of any other outstanding mortgage liens, generally do not exceed 90% of the appraised value of the property or an internally established market value. Internal market values are established using current market data, including recent sales data, and are typically lower than third party appraised values. The closed-end home equity loans are written with fixed or adjustable rates with terms up to 15 years. The open-end home equity lines are written with an adjustable rate and a 2-or 10-year draw period that requires interest only payments followed by a 10-year repayment period that fully amortizes the outstanding balance. The consumer may access the open-end home equity line by making a withdrawal at the Bank, transferring funds through our online or mobile banking products, or writing a check on the home equity line of credit account. Open and closed-end equity loans, which are generally secured by second mortgages on the borrower&#8217;s principal residence, represented 83.5% of the Company&#8217;s consumer loan portfolio at December 31, 2015. 

&#160;

The underwriting standards employed by the Company for consumer loans include a determination of the applicant&#39;s payment history on other debts and their ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. Although creditworthiness of the applicant is of primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the security, if any, in relation to the proposed loan amount. Consumer loans may entail greater credit risk than do residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans that are unsecured or are secured by rapidly depreciable assets, such as automobiles, recreational vehicles, or mobile homes. In these cases, any repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance as a result of the greater likelihood of damage, loss or depreciation. In addition, consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower&#39;s continuing financial stability, and thus are more likely to be affected by adverse personal circumstances. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount that can be recovered on such loans. At December 31, 2015, $0.8 million of the consumer loan portfolio was non-performing, compared to $0.5 million at December 31, 2014. 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Commercial Business Lending. The Company maintains a portfolio of commercial business loans to borrowers associated with the real estate industry as well as to retail, manufacturing operations, and professional firms. The Company&#39;s commercial business loans generally have terms ranging from six months to five years and may have either fixed or variable interest rates. The Company&#39;s commercial business loans generally include personal guarantees and are usually, but not always, secured by business assets such as inventory, equipment, leasehold interests in equipment, fixtures, real estate and accounts receivable. The underwriting process for commercial business loans includes consideration of the borrower&#39;s financial statements, tax returns, projections of future business operations, and inspection of the subject collateral, if any. The Company also purchases participation interests in commercial business loans originated outside of the Company&#8217;s market area from third party originators. These loans generally have underlying collateral of inventory or equipment and repayment periods of less than ten years. At December 31, 2015, the Company&#8217;s commercial business loans totaled $70.1 million, an increase of $13.0 million, from $57.1 million at December 31, 2014. 

&#160;

Unlike residential mortgage loans, which generally are made on the basis of the borrower&#39;s ability to make repayment from his or her income, and which are secured by real property with more easily ascertainable value, commercial business loans are of higher risk and typically are made on the basis of the borrower&#39;s ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower&#39;s business. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial business loans may be substantially dependent on the success of the business itself. Furthermore, the collateral securing the loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise, and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business. At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, there were $0.1 million of loans in the commercial business loan portfolio that were non-performing. 

&#160;

Originations, Purchases and Sales of Loans and Mortgage-Backed and Related Securities 

&#160;

Real estate loans are generally originated by the Company&#39;s salaried loan officers. Mortgage and consumer loan officers may also receive a commission in addition to their base salary for meeting production and other branch goals. Loan applications are taken in all branch and loan production offices.

&#160;

The Company originates both fixed and adjustable rate loans, however, its ability to originate loans is dependent upon the relative customer demand for loans in its markets. Demand for adjustable rate loans is affected by the interest rate environment. The number of adjustable rate loans remained low in 2015 due to the low long term fixed mortgage rates that existed during the year. The Company originated for its portfolio $12.1 million of one-to-four family adjustable rate loans during 2015, an increase of $10.1 million, from $2.0 million in 2014. The Company also originated for its portfolio $27.6 million of fixed rate one-to-four family loans during 2015, an increase of $16.0 million, from $11.6 million for 2014. The increase in the fixed and adjustable rate one-to-four family loans that were placed into the loan portfolio in 2015 is the result of the Bank offering more adjustable and short term fixed rate loan options to borrowers that did not meet certain secondary market criteria but did meet internal underwriting guidelines. This increased the amount of loans that were originated and placed into the Bank&#8217;s portfolio. 

&#160;

During the past several years, the Company has focused its portfolio loan origination efforts on commercial real estate, commercial business and consumer loans because these loans have terms to maturity and adjustable interest rate characteristics that are generally more beneficial to the Company in managing interest rate risk than traditional one-to-four family fixed rate conventional loans. The Company originated $141.1 million of multi-family and commercial real estate, commercial business and consumer loans (which excludes commercial real estate loans for construction or development) during 2015, an increase of $40.6 million, from originations of $100.5 million for 2014. The increase in originations primarily reflects the $17.6 million and $17.3 million increase in commercial business and commercial real estate loans, respectively, in 2015 compared to 2014. Consumer loan origination also increased $11.6 million between the periods, while multi-family loan origination decreased $5.9 million. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

In order to supplement loan demand in the Company&#39;s market area and geographically diversify its loan portfolio, the Company, from time to time, purchases participations in real estate loans from selected sellers, with yields based upon then-current market rates. The Company reviews and underwrites all loans purchased to ensure that they meet the Company&#39;s underwriting standards and the seller generally continues to service the loans. The Company has generally not experienced higher losses or credit quality issues with purchased participations than other loans originated by the Company. The Company purchased $18.4 million of loans during 2015, an increase of $7.2 million, from $11.2 million during 2014. The commercial real estate and commercial business loans that were purchased have terms and interest rates that are similar in nature to the Company&#39;s originated commercial and business portfolio. See &#8220;Note 5 Loans Receivable, Net&#8221; and &#8220;Note 6 Allowance for Loan Losses and Credit Quality Information&#8221; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report for more information on purchased loans (incorporated by reference in Item 8 of Part II of this Form 10-K). 

&#160;

The Company also acquired loans totaling $24.1 million in the acquisition of Kasson State Bank that was completed in the third quarter of 2015.

&#160;

The Company has some mortgage-backed and related securities that are held, based on investment intent, in the "available for sale" portfolio. The Company acquired $5.5 million of mortgage-backed and related securities in 2015 in connection with the Kasson State Bank acquisition and did not acquire any mortgage-backed securities in 2014. No mortgage-backed securities were purchased in 2015, other than those acquired in the Kasson State Bank acquisition, because debt instruments issued by federal agencies, such as FNMA and FHLMC, continued to be more appealing to purchase due to their shorter duration given the low interest rate environment that continued to exist in 2015. In 2015, the Company sold $4.2 million of mortgage-backed securities that were acquired in the Kasson State Bank acquisition, due primarily to the small lot size of the individual securities. The Company did not sell any mortgage-backed securities in 2014. See &#8211; &#8220;Investment Activities&#8221; below.

Classified Assets and Delinquencies 

&#160;

Classification of Assets. Federal regulations require that each savings institution evaluate and classify its assets on a regular basis. In addition, in connection with examinations of savings institutions, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) examiners may identify problem assets and, if appropriate, require them to be classified with an adverse rating. There are three adverse classifications: substandard, doubtful, and loss. Assets classified as substandard have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as doubtful have the weaknesses of those classified as substandard, with additional characteristics that make collection in full on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values questionable, and there is a high possibility of loss. An asset classified as loss is considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as an asset on the balance sheet of the institution is not warranted. Assets classified as substandard or doubtful require the institution to establish prudent specific allowances for loan losses. If an asset, or portion thereof, is classified as a loss, the institution charges off such amount. If an institution does not agree with an OCC or FDIC examiner&#39;s classification of an asset, it may appeal the determination to the OCC District Director or the appropriate FDIC personnel. On the basis of management&#39;s review of its assets, at December 31, 2015, the Bank classified a total of $21.8 million of its loans and real estate as follows:

The Bank&#39;s classified assets consist of non-performing loans and loans and other assets of concern discussed in Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (incorporated by reference in Item 7 of Part II of this Form 10-K). See &#8220;Note 6 Allowance for Loan Losses and Credit Quality Information&#8221; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report (incorporated by reference in Item 8 of Part II of this Form 10-K) for more information on classified assets. At December 31, 2015, these asset classifications were materially consistent with those of the OCC and FDIC. 

&#160;

Delinquency Procedures. Generally, the following procedures apply to delinquent one-to-four family real estate loans. When a borrower fails to make a required payment on a loan, the Company attempts to cure the delinquency by contacting the borrower. A late notice is sent on all loans over 16 days delinquent. Additional written and verbal contacts are made with the borrower between 30 and 60 days after the due date. If the loan is contractually delinquent 90 days, the Company sends a 30-day demand letter to the borrower and after the loan is contractually delinquent 120 days, institutes appropriate action to foreclose on the property. If foreclosed, the property is sold at a sheriff&#8217;s sale and may be purchased by the Company. Delinquent commercial real estate and commercial business loans are generally handled in a similar manner. The Company&#39;s procedures for repossession and sale of consumer collateral are subject to various requirements under state consumer protection laws.

&#160;

Real estate acquired by the Company as a result of foreclosure is typically classified as real estate in judgment for six to twelve months and thereafter as real estate owned until it is sold. When property is acquired by foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure, it is recorded as real estate owned at the estimated fair value less the estimated cost of disposition. After acquisition, all costs incurred in maintaining the property are expensed. Costs relating to the development and improvement of the property, however, are capitalized to the extent of fair value less disposition cost.

&#160;

The following table sets forth the Company&#39;s loan delinquencies by loan type, amount and percentage of type at December 31, 2015 for loans past due 60 days or more.

Investment Activities 

&#160;

The Company utilizes the available for sale securities portfolio in virtually all aspects of asset/liability management. In making investment decisions, the Investment-Asset/Liability Committee considers, among other things, the yield and interest rate objectives, the credit risk position, and the Bank&#39;s liquidity and projected cash flow requirements.

&#160;

Securities. Federally chartered savings institutions have the authority to invest in various types of liquid assets, including United States Treasury obligations, securities of various federal agencies, certain certificates of deposit of insured banks and savings institutions, certain bankers&#39; acceptances, repurchase agreements and federal funds. Subject to various restrictions, the holding company of a federally chartered savings institution may also invest its assets in commercial paper, investment grade corporate debt securities and mutual funds whose assets conform to the investments that a federally chartered savings institution is otherwise authorized to make directly.

&#160;

The investment strategy of the Company has been directed toward a mix of high-quality assets (primarily government agency obligations) with short and intermediate terms to maturity. At December 31, 2015, the Company did not own any investment securities of a single issuer that exceeded 10% of the Company&#39;s stockholders&#8217; equity other than U.S. government agency obligations.

&#160;

The Bank invests a portion of its liquid assets in interest-earning overnight deposits of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines (FHLB) and the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. Other investments include high grade municipal bonds, corporate preferred stock, corporate equity securities, and medium-term (up to five years) federal agency notes. HMN invests in the same type of investment securities as the Bank. See &#8220;Note 4 Securities Available For Sale&#8221; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report for additional information regarding the Company&#39;s securities portfolio (incorporated by reference in Item 8 of Part II of this Form 10-K).

Mortgage-Backed and Related Securities. In order to supplement loan production and achieve its asset/liability management goals, the Company invests in mortgage-backed and related securities. All of the mortgage-backed and related securities owned by the Company are issued, insured or guaranteed either directly or indirectly by a U.S. Government Agency and are considered to be investment grade securities. The Company had $2.3 million of mortgage-backed and related securities classified as available for sale at December 31, 2015, compared to $2.9 million at December 31, 2014 and $5.2 million at December 31, 2013. The decrease in mortgage-backed securities in 2015 and 2014 is the result of fewer purchases by the Company and normal repayments. No mortgage-backed securities were purchased in 2015, other than those acquired in the Kasson State Bank acquisition, and none were purchased in 2014. Few mortgage-backed securities were purchased because debt instruments issued by federal agencies, such as FNMA and FHLMC, continued to be more appealing to purchase due to their shorter duration given the low interest rate environment that existed in 2015 and 2014.

At December 31, 2015, the Company did not have any non-agency mortgage-backed or related securities in excess of 10% of its stockholders&#39; equity. 

&#160;

Mortgage-backed and related securities can serve as collateral for borrowings and, through sales and repayments, as a source of liquidity. In addition, mortgage-backed and related securities available for sale can be sold to respond to changes in economic conditions. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Sources of Funds 

&#160;

General. The Bank&#39;s primary sources of funds are retail, internet and brokered deposits, payments of loan principal, interest earned on loans and securities, repayments and maturities of securities, borrowings, and other funds provided from operations.

&#160;

Deposits. The Bank offers a variety of deposit accounts to retail and commercial customers having a wide range of interest rates and terms. The Bank&#39;s deposits consist of savings, negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW), money market, non-interest bearing checking and certificate accounts (including individual retirement accounts). The Bank relies primarily on competitive pricing policies and customer service to attract and retain these deposits. 

&#160;

The variety of deposit accounts offered by the Bank has allowed it to be competitive in obtaining funds and to respond with flexibility to changes in consumer demand. As customers have become more interest rate conscious, the Bank has become more susceptible to short-term fluctuations in deposit flows. The Bank manages the pricing of its deposits in keeping with its asset/liability management, profitability and growth objectives. Based on its experience, the Bank believes that its savings and NOW accounts are relatively stable sources of deposits. However, the ability of the Bank to attract and maintain certificates of deposit and money market accounts, and the rates paid on these deposits, has been and will continue to be significantly affected by market conditions. The increase in deposits in 2015 relates primarily to the $47.3 million in deposits that were acquired in an acquisition in the third quarter of 2015. The changes in deposits in 2014 and 2013 are primarily the result of changes in the commercial deposits from customers in the ethanol industry. Brokered deposits decreased $7.6 million and $8.3 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively, as the proceeds from loan payoffs were used to pay off the outstanding brokered deposits that matured during those years. 

&#160;

For additional information regarding the composition of the Bank&#39;s deposits, see &#8220;Note 11 Deposits&#8221; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report (incorporated by reference in Item 8 of Part II of this Form 10-K). For additional information on certificate maturities and the impact on the Company&#39;s liquidity see &#8220;Management Discussion and Analysis - Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8221; of the Annual Report (incorporated by reference in Item 7 of Part II of this Form 10-K).

&#160;

Borrowings. The Bank&#39;s other available sources of funds include advances from the FHLB and borrowings from the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. As a member of the FHLB of Des Moines, the Bank is required to own capital stock in the FHLB and is authorized to apply for advances. Each FHLB credit program has its own interest rate, which may be fixed or variable, and range of maturities. The FHLB may prescribe the acceptable uses for these advances, as well as limitations on the size of the advances and repayment provisions. Consistent with its asset/liability management strategy, the Bank has utilized FHLB advances from time to time to fund loan demand and extend the term to maturity of its liabilities. The Bank may also use short-term FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank borrowings to offset short term cash needs due to deposit outflows or loan fundings. At December 31, 2015, the Bank had no FHLB advances and no Federal Reserve Bank borrowings outstanding. On such date, the Bank had a collateral pledge arrangement with the FHLB pursuant to which the Bank may borrow up to $95.3 million for liquidity purposes, subject to approval from the FHLB. The Bank also had the ability to borrow $73.5 million from the Federal Reserve Bank based upon the loans that were pledged as collateral at December 31, 2015. On December 15, 2014, the Company entered into a Loan Agreement with an unrelated third party, providing for a term loan of up to $10 million that was evidenced by a promissory note with an interest rate of 6.5% per annum. On February 17, 2015 the Company took a one time advance on the note of $10.0 million and used the proceeds to retire the final $10 million of Preferred Stock. The outstanding loan balance on the third party note payable was $9.0 million at December 31, 2015.

&#160;

&#160; 

Service Corporations of the Bank 

&#160;

As a federally chartered savings bank, the Bank is permitted by OCC regulations to invest up to 2% of its assets in the stock of, or loans to, service corporation subsidiaries, and may invest an additional 1% of its assets in service corporations where these additional funds are used for inner-city or community development purposes. In addition to investments in service corporations, federal institutions are permitted to invest an unlimited amount in operating subsidiaries engaged solely in activities in which a federal savings bank may engage directly.

&#160;

OIA is one of two subsidiaries of the Bank. OIA is a Minnesota corporation that was organized in 1983 and operated as an insurance agency until 1986 when its assets were sold. OIA remained inactive until 1993 when it began offering credit life insurance, annuity and mutual fund products to the Bank&#39;s customers and others. OIA currently offers a variety of financial planning products and services. HPH is the Bank&#8217;s other subsidiary and was organized as a limited liability company in Minnesota in 2013. It was inactive in 2015 but has operated as an intermediary for the Bank in holding and operating certain foreclosed properties. 

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The Bank faces strong competition both in originating real estate, commercial and consumer loans and in attracting deposits. Competition in originating loans comes primarily from mortgage bankers, commercial banks, credit unions and other savings institutions which have offices in the Bank&#39;s market area and those that operate through Internet banking operations throughout the United States. The Bank competes for loans principally on the basis of the interest rates and loan fees it charges, the types of loans it originates and the quality of services it provides to borrowers.

&#160;

Competition for deposits is principally from mutual funds, securities firms, commercial banks, credit unions and other savings institutions located in the same communities and those that operate through Internet banking operations throughout the United States. The ability of the Bank to attract and retain deposits depends on its ability to provide an investment opportunity that satisfies the requirements of investors as to rate of return, liquidity, risk, convenience and other factors. The Bank competes for these deposits by offering a variety of deposit accounts at competitive rates, convenient business hours and a customer oriented staff. 

&#160;

Other Corporations Owned by the Company 

&#160;

The Bank was HMN&#8217;s sole direct subsidiary at December 31, 2015. 

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

At December 31, 2015, the Company had a total of 194 employees, which equated to 185 full-time equivalent employees. None of the employees of the Company are represented by any collective bargaining unit. Management considers its employee relations to be good.

&#160;

Regulation and Supervision 

&#160;

The banking industry is highly regulated. As a savings and loan holding company (SLHC), HMN is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the FRB. The Bank, a federally-chartered savings association, is also subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the OCC, which is the Bank&#8217;s primary federal regulator. The FDIC also has authority to regulate the Bank. Subsidiaries of HMN and the Bank may also be subject to state regulation and/or licensing in connection with certain insurance and investment activities. The Company is subject to numerous laws and regulations. These laws and regulations impose restrictions on activities, set minimum capital requirements, impose lending and deposit restrictions and establish other restrictions. References in this section to applicable statutes and regulations are brief and incomplete summaries only. You should consult the statutes, regulations and related policies and interpretive guidance for a full understanding of the details of their operation. Changes in statutes, regulation or regulatory policies applicable to the Company, including interpretation or implementation thereof, could have a material effect on the Company&#8217;s business. 

&#160;

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 

&#160;

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act) significantly changed, and will continue to change, the regulatory structure for financial institutions and their holding companies, including with respect to lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities. Federal banking regulators and other agencies including, among others, the FRB, the OCC and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), have been, and will continue to be, engaged in extensive rule-making efforts under the Dodd-Frank Act. 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Holding Company Regulation 

&#160;

In accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act, the OTS was integrated into the OCC in 2011 and the primary banking regulator for HMN became the FRB. The FRB supervises and regulates all SLHCs, including HMN, that were formerly regulated by the OTS. The Dodd-Frank Act also codified the FRB&#8217;s so-called &#8220;source of strength&#8221; doctrine. While the OTS had suggested that SLHCs were to serve as a &#8220;source of support&#8221;, the OTS did not have a formal policy. The source of strength doctrine requires financial institution holding companies, such as HMN, to provide financial assistance to their subsidiary financial institutions in the event of financial distress. The Dodd-Frank Act and applicable FRB regulations now subject all SLHCs to the source-of-strength doctrine. The regulations do not explicitly authorize the FRB to compel a SLHC to recapitalize a subsidiary savings association, but the FRB does have broad enforcement authority over SLHCs. The practical impact of this for HMN is still unclear. It may mean that HMN should be able to demonstrate its ability to access the capital markets for additional funds. The Dodd-Frank Act does not directly alter HMN&#8217;s ability to engage in non-financial activities. However, the FRB now has the authority to require a grandfathered unitary SLHC, like HMN, to form an intermediate holding company to serve as the direct parent of a thrift, and it is possible that the FRB would impose other restrictions if HMN sought to engage in non-financial activities. 

&#160;

Acquisitions by Savings and Loan Holding Companies. Acquisition of a savings association or a savings and loan holding company is generally subject to FRB approval and the public must have an opportunity to comment on the proposed acquisition. Without prior approval from the FRB, HMN may not acquire, directly or indirectly, control of another savings association. 

&#160;

Examination and Reporting. Under Home Owners&#39; Loan Act (HOLA) and FRB regulations, HMN, as a SLHC, must file periodic reports with the FRB. In addition, HMN must comply with FRB record keeping requirements and is subject to holding company supervision and examination by the FRB. The FRB may take enforcement action if the activities of a SLHC constitute a risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of a subsidiary savings association. 

&#160;

Affiliate Transactions. The Bank, as a holding company subsidiary that is a depository institution, is subject to both qualitative and quantitative limitations on transactions with the Company. See &#8220;Bank Regulation - Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders&#8221; below. 

&#160;

Capital Adequacy. The Bank is subject to various capital requirements, which, effective January 1, 2015, have been modified under rules promulgated by the FRB and the OCC implementing the Dodd-Frank Act and the Basel III reforms of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision of the Bank for International Settlements (Basel III Rules).

&#160;

Under the Basel III Rules, certain SLHCs for the first time in 2015 found themselves to be subject to formal regulatory capital requirements. In the second quarter of 2015, the FRB amended its Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement (Policy Statement), which exempted small bank holding companies from the above capital requirements, by raising the asset size threshold for determining applicability from $500 million to $1 billion. The Policy Statement was also expanded to include savings and loan holding companies that meet the Policy Statement&#8217;s qualitative requirements for exemption. The Company met the qualitative exemption requirements, and therefore, is exempt from the Basel III holding company capital requirements. 

&#160;

See &#8220;Bank Regulation &#8211; Capital Requirements and Prompt Corrective Action Requirements; Basel III Rules&#8221; below.

&#160;

Dividends. Federal law also limits the ability of a savings and loan holding company, such as HMN, to pay dividends or make other capital distributions. FRB guidance applicable to holding companies sets out factors that should be taken into account when considering dividends or distributions, including, among other things, current and prospective earnings and liquidity, and the holding company&#8217;s ability to serve as an ongoing source of financial and managerial strength to insured depository institution subsidiaries such as the Bank.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Bank Regulation 

&#160;

As a federally-chartered savings association, the Bank is subject to regulation and supervision by the OCC. Federal law authorizes the Bank, as a federal savings association, to conduct, subject to various conditions and limitations, business activities that include: accepting deposits and paying interest on them; making and buying loans secured by residential and other real estate; making a limited amount of consumer loans; making a limited amount of commercial loans; investing in corporate obligations, government debt securities, and other securities; and offering various banking, trust, securities and insurance agency services to its customers. 

&#160;

Savings associations are expected to conduct lending activities in a prudent, safe and sound manner. The OCC regulates the safety and soundness of the Bank by enforcing statutory limits on the Bank&#8217;s lending and investment powers. OCC regulations set aggregate limits on certain types of loans including commercial business, commercial real estate, and consumer loans. OCC regulations also establish limits on loans to a single borrower. As of December 31, 2015, the Bank&#8217;s lending limit to one borrower was approximately $12.2 million.

&#160;

A federal savings association generally may not invest in noninvestment-grade debt securities. A federal savings association may establish subsidiaries to conduct any activity the association is authorized to conduct and may establish service corporation subsidiaries for limited preapproved activities.

&#160;

Qualified Thrift Lender Test. Savings associations, including the Bank, must be qualified thrift lenders (QTLs). A savings association generally satisfies the QTL requirement if at least 65% of a specified asset base consists of assets such as loans to small businesses and loans to purchase or improve domestic residential real estate. Savings associations may qualify as QTLs in other ways. Savings associations that do not qualify as QTLs are subject to significant restrictions on their operations. If the Bank fails to meet QTL requirements, the Company would face certain limitations, including potential enforcement action by the OCC and, as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, a statutory bar to the payment by the Bank of dividends except under prescribed conditions including approval by the OCC. As of December 31, 2015, the Bank met the QTL test.

&#160;

OCC Assessments. The OCC is authorized by statute to charge assessments to cover the costs of examining the financial institutions it regulates and to fund its operations. The Bank&#8217;s OCC assessments for the year ended December 31, 2015 were approximately $155,000. While all SLHCs, including HMN, were subject to examination fees imposed by the OTS, the FRB has not assessed fees for its examination function.

&#160;

Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders. Savings associations, like banks, are subject to affiliate and insider transaction restrictions. The restrictions prohibit or limit a savings association from extending credit to, or entering into certain covered transactions with affiliates, principal stockholders, directors and executive officers of the savings association and its affiliates. The term &#8220;affiliate&#8221; generally includes a holding company, such as HMN, and any company under common control with the savings association. Federal law limits covered transactions between the Bank and any one affiliate to 10% of the Bank&#8217;s capital and surplus and with all affiliates in the aggregate to 20%. In addition, the federal law governing unitary savings and loan holding companies prohibits the Bank from making any loan to any affiliate whose activity is not permitted for a subsidiary of a bank holding company. This law also prohibits the Bank from making any equity investment in any affiliate that is not its subsidiary. The Bank is currently in compliance with these requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act expanded the limitations on transactions with affiliates to cover transactions that create credit risk. Covered transactions now include derivatives and the borrowing and lending of securities. Repurchase agreements with affiliates are now subject to collateralization requirements.

&#160;

Dividend Restrictions. Federal law limits the ability of a depository institution, such as the Bank, to pay dividends or make other capital distributions. The Bank, as a subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company, must file a notice with the FRB before payment of a dividend or approval of a proposed capital distribution by its board of directors and must obtain prior approval from the FRB if it fails to meet certain regulatory conditions. 

&#160;

During 2015, the Bank paid dividends to HMN of $3.0 million to pay the principal and interest on the third party note payable and fund the ongoing operating expenses of the Company. HMN did not declare or distribute any dividends to its common shareholders in 2015.

Deposit Insurance. The FDIC insures the deposits of the Bank through the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF). The DIF is funded by assessments of FDIC members such as the Bank. The FDIC applies a risk-based system for setting deposit insurance assessments. Under the risk-based assessment system, an institution&#8217;s insurance assessments vary according to the level of capital the institution holds and the degree to which it is the subject of supervisory concern.

&#160;

The Dodd-Frank Act instituted significant changes that modified the way that the DIF is managed by the FDIC and is capitalized. The Dodd-Frank Act altered the assessment base for deposit insurance assessments from a deposit to an asset base. It also increased the DIF reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35%. The Dodd Frank Act also requires that FDIC assessments be set in a manner that offsets the cost of the assessment increases for institutions with consolidated assets of less than $10 billion (meaning that assessments on larger institutions will be responsible for the 20 basis point increase). During 2015, the Bank was assessed approximately $342,000 for the DIF. The Dodd-Frank Act also permanently increased deposit insurance coverage from $100,000 per account ownership type to $250,000. 

&#160;

In addition to deposit insurance assessments, the FDIC is authorized to collect assessments against insured deposits to be paid to the Financing Corporation (FICO) to service the FICO debt incurred in the 1980&#8217;s. The FICO assessment rate is adjusted quarterly. In 2015, the Bank paid a FICO assessment of approximately $31,000. 

&#160;

Capital Requirements and Prompt Corrective Action Requirements; Basel III Rules. The Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company&#8217;s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Bank&#8217;s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Quantitative measures established by regulations to ensure capital adequacy required the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Common Tier 1 Risk-based capital, Total Tier 1 capital (Tier 1 leverage ratio), Tier 1 capital to Risk-based assets, and Risk-based capital to total assets (in each case as defined in the regulations). The Bank&#8217;s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors.

&#160;

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) established five capital categories: 1) well-capitalized; 2) adequately capitalized; 3) undercapitalized; 4) significantly undercapitalized; and 5) critically undercapitalized. The activities in which a depository institution may engage and regulatory responsibilities of federal bank regulatory agencies vary depending upon whether an institution is well-capitalized, adequately capitalized or undercapitalized. Undercapitalized institutions are subject to various restrictions such as limitations on dividends and growth. A depository institution&#8217;s prompt corrective action capital category depends upon where its capital levels are in relation to relevant capital measures, which include risk-based capital measures and certain other factors. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

At December 31, 2015, the Bank&#8217;s capital amounts and ratios are presented for (a) actual capital and (b) required capital and ratios under the Prompt Corrective Actions regulations to which the Bank is currently subject:

(1) 

Based upon the Bank&#8217;s adjusted total assets for the purpose of the Tier 1 or core capital ratios and risk-weighted assets for the purpose of the risk-based capital ratios. 

&#160;

Management believes that, as of December 31, 2015, the Bank&#8217;s capital ratios were in excess of those quantitative capital ratio standards set forth under the prompt corrective action regulations described above and was &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; within the meaning of those prompt corrective action regulations. However, there can be no assurance that the Bank will continue to maintain such status in the future. In addition, the OCC has extensive discretion in its supervisory and enforcement activities, including the ability to downgrade the Bank&#8217;s prompt corrective action capital category by one level under certain conditions.

&#160;

Under applicable banking regulations, the failure to comply with capital rules or other applicable requirements as they arise, could subject HMN, the Bank and their directors and officers to such restrictions, legal actions or sanctions as the FRB or the OCC considers appropriate. Possible sanctions include among others (i) the imposition of one or more cease and desist orders requiring corrective action, which are enforceable directives that may address any aspect of the Company management, operations or capital, including requirements to change management, raise equity capital, dispose of assets or effect a change of control; (ii) civil money penalties; and (iii) downgrades in the capital adequacy status of the Bank. These regulatory actions may significantly restrict the ability of the Company to take operating and strategic actions that may be in the best interests of stockholders or compel the Company to take operating and strategic actions that are not potentially in the best interests of stockholders. 

&#160;

Other Regulations and Examination Authority. The FDIC has adopted regulations to protect the DIF and depositors, including regulations governing the deposit insurance of various forms of accounts. Federal regulation of depository institutions is intended for the protection of depositors, and not for the protection of stockholders or other creditors. In addition, federal law requires that in any liquidation or other resolution of any FDIC-insured depository institution, claims for administrative expenses of the receiver and for deposits in U.S. branches (including claims of the FDIC as subrogee of the insured institution) shall have priority over the claims of general unsecured creditors. 

&#160;

The OCC may sanction any OCC-regulated bank that does not operate in accordance with OCC regulations, policies and directives. The FDIC has additional authority to terminate insurance of accounts, after notice and hearing, upon a finding that the insured institution is or has engaged in any unsafe or unsound practice that has not been corrected, is operating in an unsafe or unsound condition, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, or order of or condition imposed by the FDIC. 

&#160;

Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) System. The Bank is a member of the FHLB of Des Moines, which is one of the 11 regional Federal Home Loan Banks (FHBs). The primary purpose of the FHBs is to provide funding to their saving association members in support of the home financing credit function of the members. Each FHB serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region. FHBs are funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB System. FHBs make loans or advances to members in accordance with policies and procedures established by the board of directors of the FHB. These policies and procedures are subject to the regulation and oversight of the Federal Housing Financing Board. All advances from a FHB are required to be fully secured by sufficient collateral as determined by the FHB. Long-term advances are required to be used for residential home financing and small business and agricultural loans. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

As a member, the Bank is required to purchase and maintain stock in the FHLB of Des Moines. As of December 31, 2015, the Bank had $0.7 million in FHLB stock, which was in compliance with this requirement. The Bank receives dividends on its FHLB stock. The FHLB&#8217;s dividend philosophy is to differentiate dividend rates between membership and activity-based capital stock. Based on the FHLB&#8217;s most recent quarterly filing on Form 10-Q for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the effective combined annualized dividend rate paid on both subclasses of its capital stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 was 2.92% and 2.80%, respectively. 

&#160;

Other Regulation. Under FRB regulations, the Bank is required to maintain reserves against transaction accounts (primarily interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing checking accounts). Historically, reserves generally have been maintained in cash or in noninterest-bearing accounts, thereby effectively increasing an institution&#8217;s cost of funds. These regulations generally require that the Bank maintain reserves against net transaction accounts. The reserve levels are subject to adjustment by the FRB and prior to October 6, 2008, the policy was to not pay interest on reserves. The FRB now pays interest and utilizes the rate of interest paid on reserves to conduct monetary policy. A savings association, like other depository institutions maintaining reservable accounts, may, under certain conditions, borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank discount window. 

&#160;

Numerous other regulations promulgated by the FRB, the OCC, the CFPB and other agencies and other governmental authorities affect the business operations of the Bank. These include but are not limited to regulations relating to privacy, equal credit access, mortgage lending and foreclosure practices, electronic fund transfers, collection of checks, lending and savings disclosures, and availability of funds. The CFPB has broad authority to develop new rules and interpretations with respect to consumer financial products and services, even though its examination and enforcement authority currently do not extend to the Bank. 

&#160;

The CFPB&#8217;s rule-making activities include, among other things, the issuance in January 2013 of final rules implementing the Dodd-Frank Act mortgage lending requirements, including the &#8220;ability-to-repay&#8221; requirement for mortgage lending together with certain safe harbors and rebuttable presumptions of compliance associated with &#8220;qualified mortgages.&#8221;

&#160;

Community Reinvestment Act. The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) requires financial institutions regulated by the federal financial supervisory agencies to ascertain and help meet the credit needs of their delineated communities, including low to moderate income neighborhoods within those communities, while maintaining safe and sound banking practices. The regulatory agency assigns one of four possible ratings to an institution&#8217;s CRA performance and is required to make public an institution&#8217;s rating and written evaluation. The four possible ratings of meeting community credit needs are outstanding, satisfactory, needs improvement and substantial noncompliance. Under regulations that apply to all current CRA performance evaluations, many factors play a role in assessing a financial institution&#8217;s CRA performance. The institution&#8217;s regulator must consider its financial capacity and size, legal impediments, local economic conditions and demographics, including the competitive environment in which it operates. The evaluation does not rely on absolute standards, and the institutions are not required to perform specific activities or to provide specific amounts or types of credit. The Bank maintains a CRA statement for public viewing, as well as an annual CRA highlights document. These documents describe the Bank&#8217;s credit programs and services, community outreach activities, public comments and other efforts to meet community credit needs. The Bank&#8217;s last CRA exam was July 29, 2013 and the Bank received a &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; rating under the Intermediate Small Savings Association criteria.

&#160;

Bank Secrecy Act. The Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) requires financial institutions to verify the identity of customers, keep records and file reports that are determined to have a high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax and regulatory matters, and to implement anti-money laundering programs and compliance procedures. The impact on Bank operations from the BSA depends on the types of customers served by the Bank.

Troubled Asset Relief Program &#8211; Capital Purchase Program 

&#160;

On October 3, 2008, the federal government enacted the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA). EESA was enacted to provide liquidity to the U.S. financial system and lessen the impact of accelerating economic problems. The EESA included broad authority. The centerpiece of the EESA was the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). The EESA&#8217;s broad authority was interpreted to allow the Treasury to purchase equity interests in both healthy and troubled financial institutions. The equity purchase program is commonly referred to as the Capital Purchase Program (CPP). The Company elected to participate in the CPP and sold shares of its Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A (the Preferred Stock) to the Treasury in December 2008, along with a warrant to purchase 833,333 shares of HMN common stock at $4.68 per share (the Warrants). As a participant in the CPP, the Company was subject to the regulatory requirements of the EESA, as amended, and the interim final rule published on June 15, 2009, 31 C.F.R. Part 30, TARP Standards for Compensation and Corporate Governance, which imposed, among other things, certain restrictions on executive compensation and corporate governance practices. Further, holders of the Preferred Stock were entitled to a 5% annual cumulative compounding dividend for each of the first five years of the investment, which increased to 9% on February 15, 2014, until the Company redeemed the shares. 

&#160;

On February 8, 2013, the Treasury sold the Preferred Stock to unaffiliated third party investors in a private transaction for $18.8 million. The Company received no proceeds from the sale and it had no effect on the terms of the outstanding Preferred Stock, including the Company&#8217;s obligation to satisfy accrued and unpaid compounded dividends prior to the payment of any dividend or other distribution to holders of junior stock, including the Company&#8217;s common stock, and the increase in the dividend rate from 5% to 9%, commencing with the dividend payment date of February 15, 2014. Further, the sale of the Preferred Stock had no effect on the Company&#8217;s capital, financial condition or results of operations. As of February 17, 2015, all of the Preferred Stock had been redeemed by the Company.

&#160;

On May 21, 2015, the Treasury sold the Warrants at an exercise price of $4.68 per share to three unaffiliated third party investors for an aggregate purchase price of $5.7 million. Two of the investors received a Warrant to purchase 277,777.67 shares and one investor received a Warrant to purchase 277,777.66 shares. All of the Warrants may be exercised at any time prior to their expiration date of December 23, 2018. The Company received no proceeds from this transaction and it had no effect on the Company&#8217;s capital, financial condition or results of operations.
