 ITEM 1. 

BUSINESS 

General 

PartnerRe Ltd., incorporated in Bermuda in August 1993, is the ultimate holding company for our international reinsurance and insurance group (collectively, the Company, PartnerRe or we). The Company predominantly provides reinsurance and certain specialty insurance lines on a worldwide basis through its principal wholly-owned subsidiaries, including Partner Reinsurance Company Ltd. (PartnerRe Bermuda), Partner Reinsurance Europe SE (PartnerRe Europe), Partner Reinsurance Company of the U.S. (PartnerRe U.S.) and, effective April 1, 2015, Partner Reinsurance Asia Pte. Ltd. (PartnerRe Asia). Risks reinsured include, but are not limited to, property, casualty, motor, agriculture, aviation/space, catastrophe, credit/surety, engineering, energy, marine, specialty property, specialty casualty, multiline and other lines, mortality, longevity, accident and health and alternative risk products. The Company’s alternative risk products include weather and credit protection to financial, industrial and service companies on a worldwide basis. 

In 1997, recognizing the limitation of a monoline strategy, the Company shifted its strategic focus to become a leading multiline reinsurer. In July 1997, the Company completed the acquisition of SAFR (subsequently renamed PartnerRe SA and reinsurance business transferred into PartnerRe Europe), a well-established global professional reinsurer based in Paris. In December 1998, the Company completed the acquisition of the reinsurance operations of Winterthur Re, further enhancing the Company’s expansion strategy. In December 2009, the Company completed the acquisition of PARIS RE Holdings Limited (Paris Re), a French-listed, Swiss-based holding company and its operating subsidiaries. This acquisition provided the Company with enhanced strategic and financial flexibility in a less predictable and more limited growth environment. 

Effective December 31, 2012, the Company completed the acquisition of Presidio Reinsurance Group, Inc. (subsequently renamed and referred to herein as PartnerRe Health), a U.S. specialty accident and health reinsurance and insurance writer. 

As of April 1, 2015, PartnerRe Asia became the principal reinsurance carrier for the Company’s non-life and life business underwritten in the Asia Pacific region. The establishment of PartnerRe Asia has enabled the Company's Asian reinsurance operations to be consolidated into one regional, well-capitalized entity and will support its growing underwriting presence in the region. 

On January 25, 2015, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Amalgamation (Amalgamation Agreement) with Axis Capital Holdings Limited, a Bermuda exempted company (AXIS), pursuant to which, upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Amalgamation Agreement, the two companies were expected to amalgamate and continue as a single Bermuda exempted company (Amalgamation). 

On April 14, 2015, the Company announced the receipt of an unsolicited written proposal from EXOR S.p.A. (EXOR), a European investment company controlled by the Agnelli family, to acquire 100% of the outstanding common shares of the Company for $130 per share in cash. 

On August 2, 2015, after subsequent negotiations with EXOR, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Exor N.V., Pillar Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of Exor N.V., and, solely with respect to certain specified sections thereof, EXOR (as subsequently amended, the Merger Agreement). The transaction would be effected by a merger of Pillar Ltd. with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Exor N.V. (Merger). Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, each PartnerRe common share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger shall automatically be canceled and converted into the right to receive (i) $137.50 in cash per share and (ii) be entitled to receive a one-time special pre-closing cash dividend in the amount of $3.00 per common share. 

In addition, under the terms of the Merger Agreement, EXOR committed to either (i) a 100 basis points increase in the current applicable preferred share dividend rate, such increase to be effected through an exchange offer and to be conditional and contingent upon the Company obtaining a private letter ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that the enhanced terms will not be treated as fast-pay stock (within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.7701(l)-3(b)) for U.S. federal income tax purposes or (ii) if such private letter ruling is not obtained prior to closing of the transaction, pay a cash payment of approximately $42.7 million in aggregate (equal to $1.25 per preferred share) to the holders of record of the Company’s preferred shares as at the effective time of the Merger subject and subsequent to the closing of the transaction. On February 17, 2016, the Company announced that the IRS had indicated that it will not grant a private letter ruling clarifying the tax shelter reporting obligations applicable to the surviving company’s preferred shares. 

As such, following the closing, EXOR will pay a cash payment of approximately $42.7 million in aggregate to the holders of record of the Company’s preferred shares as at the effective time of the Merger and the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to launch an exchange offer after the closing of the Merger, referred to as the Alternate Exchange Offer in the Merger Agreement, whereby participating preferred shareholders would receive newly issued preferred shares reflecting, subject to certain exceptions contained in the existing preferred shares, an extended call date of the fifth anniversary of the date of issuance and a restriction on payment of dividends on common shares to an amount not exceeding 67% of net income until December 31, 2020. The terms of the newly issued preferred shares would be otherwise identical in all material respects to the Company’s applicable existing preferred shares. 

The Company's shareholders will have the option to elect to receive payment of the merger consideration in a currency other than U.S. dollars directly through an affiliate of Computershare Trust Company, N.A. (Computershare). Any PartnerRe shareholder can make such an election by contacting Computershare at 1-855-396-2084 if within the USA or at 1-781-575-2765 (if calling from outside the United States). The exchange rate for one U.S. dollar expressed in the currency elected by any PartnerRe shareholder will be based on the prevailing market rates available to Computershare on the date of the currency conversion less commercially reasonable spreads charged by Computershare and the bank exchanging the currency. Neither the Company nor Computershare or any of their affiliates will be responsible for any costs associated with the election by any PartnerRe shareholder. Please contact Computershare directly for further information regarding currency elections in connection with the Merger. 

In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement with EXOR, the Company and AXIS terminated the Amalgamation Agreement. On August 3, 2015, the Company paid AXIS a termination fee and reimbursement of expenses of $315 million (AXIS Termination Fee). 

On November 19, 2015, the Merger with EXOR was approved by the Company's shareholders and the consummation of the Merger is pending certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. In addition, the Board of Directors (BOD) declared the special dividend, which is conditional and contingent upon the issuance of the certificate of merger by the Bermuda Registrar of Companies. The parties expect to complete the Merger in the first quarter of 2016, although there can be no assurances that the parties will be able to do so. 

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, promptly following the closing, the Company expects to delist its common shares from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and to deregister the common shares under the Securities Exchange Act. The Company’s preferred shares will remain registered under the Securities Exchange Act. As a company whose only listed securities on the NYSE will be preferred shares, the Company will not be required to comply with certain NYSE corporate governance requirements that are applicable to companies that have listed common stock, including (i) the requirement for the board of directors to have a majority of independent directors and (ii) the requirement to establish Compensation and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees, each comprised entirely of independent directors, or otherwise ensure that the compensation of the company’s executive officers and nominees for directors are determined or recommended to the board of directors by the independent members of the board of directors. 

In addition, the Company may qualify as a "foreign private issuer" (as defined in Rule 3b-4 of the Securities Exchange Act) on the last business day of its second fiscal quarter. In such case, the Company may start using the forms and rules applicable to foreign private issuers. Foreign private issuers are not required, among other things, to comply with the Securities Exchange Act rules governing proxy statements or the requirement to file quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. In addition, officers, directors and 10% shareholders of foreign private issuers are not subject to the reporting and short-swing profit disgorgement provisions of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act. 

See Risk Factors in Item 1A of Part I of this report. Except as otherwise explicitly provided herein, all discussions in this report are with respect to PartnerRe Ltd. as a standalone entity. 

Business Strategy 

The Company is in the business of assessing and assuming risk for an appropriate return. The Company creates value through its ability to understand, evaluate, diversify and distribute risk. Its strategy is founded on a capital-based risk appetite and the selected risks that Management believes will allow the Company to meet its goals for appropriate profitability and risk management within that appetite. Management believes that this construct allows the Company to balance cedants’ need for confidence of claims payment with its shareholders’ need for an appropriate return on their capital. Compound annual growth in diluted tangible book value per common share and common share equivalents outstanding plus dividends is the prime metric used by Management to measure the Company’s performance. Other important measures include operating earnings or loss attributable to PartnerRe Ltd. common shareholders, operating earnings or loss per common share and common share equivalents outstanding (diluted operating earnings or loss per share), operating return on beginning diluted book value per common share and common share equivalents outstanding (Operating ROE) and Group Adjusted Return on Equity (Group AROE) . These measures are referred to as non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of Regulation G and investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. See Key Financial Measures in Item 7 of Part II of this report for a detailed discussion of the key measures used by the Company to evaluate its financial performance, including definitions and basis of calculation. 

The Company has adopted the following five-point strategy: 

We are diversified across products and insurance markets: &#32;PartnerRe writes most lines of reinsurance and writes selected specialty insurance lines of business to further diversify its earnings stream and to provide access to risks that position the Company for future growth. Management believes diversification is a competitive advantage, which increases return per unit of risk, provides access to risk worldwide and reduces the overall volatility of results. Diversification is also the cornerstone of the Company’s risk management approach. The (re)insurance business is cyclical, but cycles by line of business and by geography are rarely synchronized. 

We have an appetite for risk provided it helps us deliver superior risk-adjusted returns: &#32;PartnerRe’s products address accumulation risks, complex coverage issues and large exposures faced by clients. The Company’s book of business is focused on severity lines of business such as casualty, catastrophe, specialized property and aviation. The Company is willing to assume such above average risk, but only if the pricing implies significantly above average risk-adjusted returns. The Company’s diversification enables it to assume risks that are individually large for our clients, but are more easily diversified within PartnerRe’s portfolio. The Company also writes frequency lines of business such as standard property, motor and life, which have historically provided modestly lower levels of returns with less volatility. 

We manage our capital to optimize long-term returns while maintaining an appropriate risk profile : PartnerRe’s business is cyclical and the Company responds to that reality. The Company seeks to manage its capital to optimize shareholder returns over the reinsurance cycle, but it will not unbalance the portfolio by writing only the business that offers the highest return at any point in time. In order to manage capital appropriately across a portfolio and over a reinsurance cycle, the Company believes two things are critical: an appropriate and common measure of risk-adjusted performance and the ability and willingness to redeploy capital for its most efficient and effective use, either within the business or by returning capital to shareholders. To achieve effective and efficient capital allocation, the Company uses Operating ROE as a portfolio management tool, supported by strong actuarial and financial analysis. 

We create value through superior risk evaluation and intelligent portfolio and relationship management: &#32;The Company’s technical underwriting, actuarial and portfolio management skills enable the Company to create value by understanding, valuing, diversifying, and distributing risk. The Company’s objective is overall portfolio profitability. The aim is not to select a few highly profitable transactions in any year, but to build sustainable portfolios that can deliver superior returns over several years and utilize retrocessional coverage to achieve these overall portfolio profitability objectives. While our primary focus is assuming risk for our own account, we are open to intermediating risk in order to optimize our retained portfolio and enhance overall returns. 

We enhance overall returns through prudent financial and investment management and an efficient support framework: &#32;Strong underwriting must be complemented with prudent financial management, careful reserving, superior asset management and efficient support in order to achieve the Company’s targeted returns. The Company’s principal business is the assumption of reinsurance and insurance risk and, when selecting asset strategies and support services, the Company’s priority is to support the reinsurance operations. The Company is willing to take some additional risk on its assets if it helps us generate extra return, but this risk-taking is managed so that it will not put at risk the reinsurance operations. We will not use insurance or reinsurance as a means of raising funds to pursue other goals. 

Reinsurance and Insurance Operations 

General 

The Company provides reinsurance and certain specialty insurance lines for its clients in approximately 150 countries around the world. The Company’s principal offices are located in Hamilton (Bermuda), Dublin, Greenwich (Connecticut, U.S.), Paris, Singapore and Zurich. 

Through its subsidiaries and branches, the Company provides reinsurance or insurance of non-life and life risks to ceding companies (primary insurers, cedants or reinsureds). Reinsurance is offered on either a proportional or non-proportional basis through treaties or facultative reinsurance. 

In a proportional (or quota share) treaty reinsurance agreement, the reinsurer assumes a proportional share of the original premiums and losses incurred by the cedant. The reinsurer pays the ceding company a commission, which is generally based on the ceding company’s cost of acquiring the business being reinsured (including commissions, premium taxes, assessments and miscellaneous administrative expenses) and may also include a profit. 

In a non-proportional (or excess of loss) treaty reinsurance agreement the reinsurer indemnifies the reinsured against all or a specified portion of losses on underlying insurance policies in excess of a specified amount, which is called a retention or attachment point. Non-proportional business is written in layers and a reinsurer or group of reinsurers accepts a band of coverage up to a specified amount. The total coverage purchased by the cedant is referred to as a program and is typically placed with predetermined reinsurers in pre-negotiated layers. Any liability exceeding the upper limit of the program reverts to the ceding company. 

In a facultative (proportional or non-proportional) reinsurance agreement the reinsurer assumes individual risks. The reinsurer separately rates and underwrites each risk rather than assuming all or a portion of a class of risks as in the case of treaty reinsurance. 

In addition, the Company provides certain specialty insurance lines of business, which include certain business written in aviation, energy, engineering, marine, multiline, specialty casualty, specialty property, health and other lines. 

The Company monitors the performance of its operations in three segments, Non-life, Life and Health and Corporate and Other. Segments and the sub-segments of the Company’s Non-life segment represent markets that are reasonably homogeneous in terms of geography, client types, buying patterns, underlying risk patterns and approach to risk management. The composition of the Non-life and Life and Health segments is described in more detail below. Corporate and Other is comprised of the Company's investment and corporate activities, including other expenses. See also the description of the Company’s segments and sub-segments as well as a discussion of how the Company measures its segment results in Note 21 to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report. 

The Company’s gross premiums written by segment for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;were as follows (in millions of U.S. dollars):

See Note 21 to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report for additional disclosure of the geographic distribution of gross premiums written and financial information about segments and sub-segments. 

Non-life Segment 

The Non-life segment is divided into four sub-segments, North America, Global (Non-U.S.) Property and Casualty (Global (Non-U.S.) P&amp;C), Global Specialty and Catastrophe. The North America sub-segment includes agriculture, casualty, credit/surety, motor, multiline, property and other risks generally originating in the U.S. The Global (Non-U.S.) P&amp;C sub-segment includes casualty, motor and property business generally originating outside of the U.S. The Global Specialty sub-segment is comprised of business that is generally considered to be specialized due to the sophisticated technical underwriting required to analyze risks, and is global in nature. This sub-segment consists of several lines of business for which the Company believes it has developed specialized knowledge and underwriting capabilities. These lines of business include agriculture, aviation/space, credit/surety, energy, engineering, marine, multiline, specialty casualty, specialty property and other lines. The Catastrophe sub-segment is comprised of the Company’s catastrophe line of business. 

The gross premiums written in each of the Company’s Non-life sub-segments for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;were as follows (in millions of U.S. dollars):

Gross premiums written and the distribution of gross premiums written by line of business in the Non-life segment vary between years as a result of changes in the allocation of capital among lines of business driven by the Company’s response to market conditions and risk assessment, the timing of renewals of treaties, a change in treaty structure, premium adjustments reported by cedants, foreign exchange fluctuations and other factors. The year over year comparison of major changes in the distribution of gross premiums written by line of business for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;is described in Results by Segment — Non-life Segment in Item 7 of Part II of this report. 

The following discussion summarizes the business written in each line of business in the Company’s Non-life segment. 

Agriculture —The Company reinsures, primarily on a proportional basis, agricultural yield and price/revenue risks related to flood, drought, hail and disease related to crops, livestock and aquaculture. 

Aviation/Space —The Company provides specialized reinsurance and insurance protection for airline, general aviation and space business. The reinsurance is provided on both a proportional and non-proportional basis and through facultative arrangements. The space business relates to coverages for satellite assembly, launch, orbit and operation for commercial space programs. 

Casualty —The Company’s casualty business includes third party liability, employers’ liability, workers’ compensation and personal accident coverages written on both a proportional and non-proportional basis. 

Catastrophe —The Company provides property catastrophe reinsurance protection, written primarily on a non-proportional basis, against the accumulation of losses caused by windstorm, earthquake, tornado, tropical cyclone, flood or by any other natural hazard that is covered under a comprehensive property policy. Through the use of underwriting tools based on proprietary computer 

models developed by its research team, the Company combines natural science with highly professional underwriting skills in order to offer capacity at a price commensurate with the risk. 

Credit/Surety —The Company provides credit reinsurance, written primarily on a proportional basis, to mortgage guaranty insurers, government sponsored entities and commercial credit insurers. The Company’s surety line relates primarily to bonds and other forms of security written by specialized surety insurers, and is written primarily on a proportional basis. 

Energy (Energy Onshore) —The Company provides reinsurance and insurance coverage for the onshore oil and gas industry, mining, power generation and pharmaceutical operations. The reinsurance is provided predominantly on a proportional basis and through facultative arrangements. 

Engineering —The Company provides reinsurance and insurance for engineering projects, large construction and erection projects throughout the world. The reinsurance is offered mainly on a proportional basis and through facultative arrangements. 

Marine (Marine/Energy Offshore) —The Company provides reinsurance and insurance protection and technical services relating to marine hull, cargo, transit and offshore oil and gas operations. The reinsurance is offered predominantly on a proportional basis and through facultative arrangements. 

Motor —The Company’s motor business includes reinsurance coverages for third party liability and property damage risks arising from both passenger and commercial fleet automobile coverages written by cedants. This business is written on a proportional and non-proportional basis. 

Multiline —The Company’s multiline business provides both property and casualty reinsurance coverages written on both a proportional and non-proportional basis and whole account coverages written on a proportional basis. 

Property —Property business provides reinsurance coverage to insurers for property damage or business interruption losses resulting from fires, catastrophes and other perils covered in industrial and commercial property and homeowners’ policies and is written on both a proportional and non-proportional basis. The Company’s most significant exposure is typically to losses from windstorm, tornado and earthquake, although the Company is exposed to losses from sources as diverse as freezes, riots, floods, industrial explosions, fires, hail and a number of other loss events. The Company’s predominant exposure under these property coverages is to property damage. However, other risks, including business interruption and other non-property losses may also be covered under a property reinsurance contract when arising from a covered peril. The Company’s property reinsurance treaties generally exclude certain risks such as war, nuclear, biological and chemical contamination, radiation and environmental pollution. 

Specialty Casualty —The Company provides specialized reinsurance and insurance protection primarily for non-U.S. casualty business that requires specialized underwriting expertise due to the nature of the underlying risk. The reinsurance protection is offered on a proportional, non-proportional or facultative basis. 

Specialty Property —The Company provides specialized reinsurance and insurance protection that requires specialized underwriting expertise due to the nature of the underlying risk. The reinsurance protection is offered on a proportional, non-proportional or facultative basis. 

In addition to the catastrophe line of business, certain other lines of business, including, but not limited to, the property, marine, energy, specialty property and multiline lines of business, also have exposure to catastrophe losses arising from natural catastrophes, such as hurricanes, windstorms, floods, tornadoes and earthquakes. 

Distribution 

The Company’s Non-life business is produced both through brokers and through direct relationships with insurance companies. In North America, business is primarily written through brokers, while in the rest of the world, the business is written on both a direct and broker basis. 

For the year ended December 31, 2015 , the Company had two brokers that individually accounted for 10% or more of its total Non-life gross premiums written: Marsh (including Guy Carpenter) accounted for approximately 27% of total Non-life gross premiums written; and the Aon Group (including the Benfield Group) accounted for approximately 22% of total Non-life gross premiums written. 

The combined percentage of gross premiums written through these two brokers by Non-life sub-segment for the year ended December 31, 2015 &#32;was as follows:

Competition 

The Company competes with other reinsurers and certain insurers, some of which have greater financial, marketing and management resources than the Company, and it also competes with new market entrants, and, specifically in the catastrophe line of business, with alternative capital sources and insurance-linked securities. Competition in the types of reinsurance and insurance that the Company underwrites is based on many factors, including the perceived and relative financial strength, pricing and other terms and conditions, services provided, ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, speed of claims payment and reputation and experience in the lines of business to be written. 

The Company’s competitors include independent reinsurance companies, subsidiaries or affiliates of established worldwide insurance companies, reinsurance departments of certain primary insurance companies and, specifically in the catastrophe line of business, alternative capital sources and insurance-linked securities. Management believes that the Company’s major competitors are the larger European, U.S. and Bermuda-based international reinsurance companies, as well as specialty reinsurers and regional companies in certain local markets. These competitors include, but are not limited to, Munich Re, Swiss Re, Everest Re Group Ltd. , Hannover Re, SCOR SA and the reinsurance operations of certain primary insurance companies, such as Chubb Limited (formerly ACE Limited), Arch Capital Group Ltd., AXIS and XL Catlin. 

Management believes the Company ranks among the world’s largest professional reinsurers and is well positioned in terms of client services and highly technical underwriting expertise. Management also believes that the Company’s global franchise and diversified platform, which allows the Company to provide broad risk solutions across many lines of business and geographies, is increasingly attractive to cedants who are choosing to utilize fewer reinsurers by consolidating their reinsurance panels and focus on those reinsurers who can cover more than one line of business. Furthermore, the Company’s capitalization and strong financial ratios allow the Company to offer security to its clients. 

Life and Health Segment 

Lines of Business 

The Company’s Life and Health segment includes the mortality, longevity and health lines of business written primarily in the United Kingdom (U.K.), Ireland and France and accident and health business written in the U.S. 

At the time of the acquisition of PartnerRe Health in December 2012, PartnerRe Health operated as a Managing General Agent (MGA), writing all of its business on behalf of third-party insurance companies and earning a fee for producing the business, as well as participating in a portion of the original business that was ceded to PartnerRe Health by these third parties based on quota share agreements. During 2013, the Company obtained the necessary licenses and approvals and since January 1, 2014, virtually all of the PartnerRe Health business has originated directly, without the use of third-party insurance companies. This transition, combined with growth in the underlying business, continues to affect the year over year comparability with increased gross premiums written in the accident and health line of business in 2015 &#32;compared to 2014 &#32;and 2013. 

The gross premiums written by line of business in the Company’s Life and Health segment for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;(in millions of U.S. dollars) were as follows:

The following discussion summarizes the business written in the Company’s Life and Health segment by line of business. 

Accident and health— The Company provides reinsurance coverage to primary life insurers with respect to individual and group health risks. PartnerRe Health writes specialty accident and health business, predominantly in the U.S., including Health Maintenance Organizations (HMO) reinsurance, medical reinsurance and provider and employer excess of loss programs. 

Longevity— The Company provides reinsurance coverage to employer sponsored pension schemes and primary life insurers who issue annuity contracts offering long-term retirement benefits to consumers, who, in turn, seek protection against outliving their financial resources. Longevity business is written on a long-term, proportional basis primarily in the U.K. The Company’s longevity portfolio is subdivided into standard and non-standard annuities. The non-standard annuities are annuities sold to consumers with aggravated health conditions and are usually medically underwritten on an individual basis. The main risk the Company is exposed to by writing longevity business is an increase in the future life span of the insured compared to the expected life span. 

Mortality —The Company provides reinsurance coverage to primary life insurers and pension funds to protect against individual and group mortality and disability risks. Mortality business is written primarily on a proportional basis through treaty agreements. Mortality business is subdivided into death and disability covers (with various riders) primarily written in Continental Europe, term assurance and critical illness (TCI) primarily written in the U.K. and Ireland, and guaranteed minimum death benefit (GMDB) primarily written in Continental Europe. The Company also writes certain treaties on a non-proportional basis, primarily in France. 

Other than gross premiums written, Management uses reinsurance business in force to measure the growth of the Company’s mortality business. Reinsurance business in force reflects the addition or acquisition of new mortality business, offset by terminations (e.g., voluntary surrenders of underlying life insurance policies, lapses of underlying policies, deaths of insureds, and the exercises of recapture option by cedants), changes in foreign exchange, and any other changes in the amount of insurance in force. The term "in force" refers to the aggregate insurance policy face amounts, or net amounts at risk. The net assumed business in force for the mortality line of business was $179 billion , $196 billion and $210 billion at December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. The business in force at December 31, 2015 &#32;has decreased compared to 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange. 

Distribution 

The Company’s Life and Health business is produced both through brokers and through direct relationships with insurance companies. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , one broker, the Aon Group (including the Benfield Group), accounted for 11% of the Life and Health segment’s total gross premiums written. No other broker contributed more than 5% and no one cedant accounted for more than 8% of the Life and Health segment’s total gross premiums written. 

Competition 

For the Company's Life business, the competition differs by location but generally includes multi-national reinsurers and local reinsurers or state-owned insurers in the U.K., Ireland and Continental Europe for its mortality and longevity lines of business. The competition specifically related to the PartnerRe Health business generally includes other specialty accident and health insurance and reinsurance providers in the U.S. and departments of worldwide insurance and reinsurance companies. 

Reserves 

General 

Loss reserves represent estimates of amounts an insurer or reinsurer ultimately expects to pay in the future on claims incurred at a given time, based on facts and circumstances known at the time that the loss reserves are established. It is possible that the total future payments may exceed, or be less than, such estimates. The estimates are not precise in that, among other things, they are based on predictions of future developments and estimates of future trends in claim severity, frequency and other variable factors such as inflation. During the loss settlement period, it often becomes necessary to refine and adjust the estimates of liability on a claim either upward or downward. Despite such adjustments, the ultimate future liability may exceed or be less than the revised estimates. 

As part of the reserving process, insurers and reinsurers review historical data and anticipate the impact of various factors such as legislative enactments and judicial decisions that may affect potential losses from casualty claims, changes in social and political attitudes that may increase exposure to losses, mortality and morbidity trends and trends in general economic conditions. This process assumes that past experience, adjusted for the effects of current developments, is an appropriate basis for anticipating future events. 

See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in Item 7 of Part II of this report for a discussion of the Company’s reserving process.

Net Non-life reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses decreased from $9,531 million &#32;at December 31, 2014 &#32;to $8,875 million &#32;at December 31, 2015 . This decrease primarily reflected the impact of foreign exchange, net favorable loss development on prior accident years and loss payments, which were partially offset by current year net losses incurred. Net Non-life reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses decreased from $10,379 million at December 31, 2013 to $9,531 million at December 31, 2014. This decrease primarily reflected the impact of foreign exchange, net favorable loss development on prior accident years and a relatively high level of loss payments, mainly driven by the settlement of the 2013 crop year in the agriculture line of business of the North America sub-segment, which were partially offset by current year net losses incurred. 

The net incurred losses for the year ended December 31, 2015 &#32;relating to the current and prior accident years by Non-life sub-segment were as follows (in millions of U.S. dollars):

The net favorable loss development on prior accident years of $831 &#32;million for the year ended December 31, 2015 &#32;primarily resulted from favorable loss emergence, as losses reported by cedants were lower than expected. The most significant drivers of the Non-life net prior year favorable loss development during the year ended December 31, 2015 &#32;were the casualty line of business in the North America sub-segment, the property line of business in the Global (Non-U.S.) P&amp;C sub-segment and the marine, aviation/space, specialty casualty and energy lines of business in the Global Specialty sub-segment. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a more detailed discussion of net prior year favorable loss development by Non-life sub-segment and Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates—Losses and Loss Expenses and Life Policy Benefits in Item 7 of Part II of this report for a discussion of the net prior year favorable loss development by reserving lines for the Company’s Non-life operations. 

Reserve Agreement 

On December 21, 2006, Colis&#233;e Re (formerly known as AXA RE), a subsidiary of AXA SA (AXA) transferred substantially all of its assets and liabilities, other than specified reinsurance and retrocession agreements and certain other excluded assets and liabilities, to PARIS RE Holdings SA’s French operating subsidiary Paris Re France (AXA Transfer) (Paris Re France). The AXA Transfer was immediately followed by the acquisition by Paris Re of all the outstanding capital stock of Paris Re France (AXA Acquisition). In connection with the AXA Acquisition, AXA, Colis&#233;e Re and Paris Re entered into various agreements (2006 Acquisition Agreements). 

On the closing of the AXA Acquisition, AXA, Colis&#233;e Re and Paris Re France entered into a reserve agreement (Reserve Agreement). The Reserve Agreement provides that AXA and Colis&#233;e Re shall guarantee reserves in respect of Paris Re France and subsidiaries acquired in the AXA Acquisition. The Reserve Agreement covers losses incurred prior to December 31, 2005, including any adverse development in respect thereof, by the subsidiaries of Colis&#233;e Re transferred to Paris Re France as part of the 2006 Acquisition Agreements, in respect of reinsurance policies issued or renewed, and in respect of which premiums were earned, on or prior to December 31, 2005 (but excluding any amendments thereto effected after the closing of the 2006 Acquisition Agreements). 

Pursuant to the Reserve Agreement, AXA has agreed to cause AXA Liabilities Managers, an affiliate of Colis&#233;e Re (AXA LM), to provide Paris Re France with periodic reports setting forth the amount of losses incurred in respect of the business guaranteed by AXA. The reserve guarantee provided by AXA and Colis&#233;e Re is conditioned upon, among other things, the guaranteed business, including all related ceded reinsurance, being managed by AXA LM. The Reserve Agreement further contemplates that Colis&#233;e Re or Paris Re France, as the case may be, shall pay to the other party amounts equal to any deficiency or surplus in the transferred reserves with respect to losses incurred, such losses being net of any recovery by Colis&#233;e Re including through retrocessional protection, salvage or subrogation. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company commuted a portion of the Reserve Agreement with Colis&#233;e Re, which resulted in a portion &#32;of reserves and investments underlying the funds held — directly managed account being returned to Colis&#233;e Re. 

See Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources—Funds Held — Directly Managed in Item 7 of Part II and Note 8 to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report for more detail. 

The rights and obligations of AXA LM with respect to the management of this business are set forth in a run off services and management agreement among AXA LM, Colis&#233;e Re and Paris Re France (Run Off Services and Management Agreement). Under the Run Off Services and Management Agreement, Paris Re has agreed that AXA LM will manage claims arising from all reinsurance and retrocession contracts subject to the Reserve Agreement, either directly or, for contracts that were issued by certain Colis&#233;e Re entities identified in the agreement, by delegation to certain other specified entities, including Paris Re France. This includes contract administration, the administration of ceded reinsurance, claims handling, settlements and business commutations. Although Paris Re France has certain consultation rights in connection with the management of the run-off of the contracts subject to the Reserve Agreement, AXA LM does not need to obtain Paris Re France’s prior consent in connection with claims handling and settlements, and no consent is required for business commutations if the amount of case reserves related to contracts does not exceed &#8364;100 million in any twelve month period. 

On October 1, 2010, PartnerRe Europe and Paris Re France effected a cross border merger whereby all the assets and liabilities of Paris Re France were transferred to PartnerRe Europe, including the agreements between Paris Re France and Colis&#233;e Re. 

Changes in Non-life Reserves 

The gross, retroceded and net reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses for the Company’s Non-life business, and the portion of the gross, retroceded and net reserves that relates to the reserves subject to the Reserve Agreement (Guaranteed Reserves), at December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 &#32;were as follows (in thousands of U.S. dollars):

The Guaranteed Reserves have been excluded from the following tables that analyze the development of the Company’s net reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses for the Company’s Non-life business given the Reserve Agreement covers any adverse or favorable development related to the reserves acquired by Paris Re in the AXA Acquisition, and therefore, they have no impact on the development of the Company’s gross and net reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses. 

The development of net reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses for the Company’s Non-life business, excluding Guaranteed Reserves, is shown in the following table. The table begins by showing the initial reported year-end gross and net reserves, including incurred but not reported (IBNR) reserves, recorded at the balance sheet date for each of the ten years presented. 

The next section of the table shows the re-estimated amount of the initial reported net reserves, excluding Guaranteed Reserves, for up to ten subsequent years, based on experience at the end of each subsequent year. The re-estimated net liabilities reflect additional information, received from cedants or obtained through reviews of industry trends, regarding claims incurred prior to the end of the preceding financial year. A redundancy (or deficiency) arises when the re-estimation of reserves is less (or greater) than its estimation at the preceding year-end. The cumulative redundancies (or deficiencies) reflect cumulative differences between the initial reported net reserves and the currently re-estimated net reserves. Annual changes in the estimates are reflected in the income statement for each year as the liabilities are re-estimated. Reserves denominated in foreign currencies are revalued at each year-end’s foreign exchange rates. 

The lower section of the table shows the portion of the initial year-end net reserves, excluding Guaranteed Reserves, that were paid (claims paid) as of the end of subsequent years. This section of the table provides an indication of the portion of the re-estimated net liability that is settled and is unlikely to develop in the future. Claims paid are converted to U.S. dollars at the average foreign exchange rates during the year of payment and are not revalued at the current year foreign exchange rates. Because claims paid in prior years are not revalued at the current year’s foreign exchange rates, the difference between the cumulative claims paid at the end of any given year and the immediately previous year represents the claims paid during the year.

Paris Re’s liability for unpaid losses and loss expenses was included at December 31, 2009 for the first time. For years prior to 2009, this table excludes the reserves of the Paris Re companies acquired. Accordingly, the reserve development (net liability for unpaid losses and loss expenses at the end of the year, as originally estimated, less net liability for unpaid losses and loss expenses re-estimated as of subsequent years) for years prior to 2009 relates only to losses recorded by PartnerRe and subsidiaries not acquired in the Paris Re acquisition.

The Company’s reserve development is composed of the change in ultimate losses from what the Company originally estimated as well as the impact of the foreign exchange revaluation on reserves. The Company conducts its reinsurance operations in a variety of non-U.S. currencies and records its net reserves in the currency of the treaty, with the principal exposures being the euro, British pound, Canadian dollar and Swiss Franc . The impact of reporting the Company’s net reserves based on the foreign exchange rates at the balance sheet date can be a significant component of the cumulative redundancy or deficiency in net reserves and in some years can be the principal component. The amount of foreign exchange included in the cumulative net redundancy reported above as well as the net redundancy excluding the impact of foreign exchange movements on net reserves were as follows (in thousands of U.S. dollars):

Movements in foreign exchange rates between accounting periods have typically resulted in significant variations in the Company’s loss reserves as the U.S. dollar, the Company’s reporting currency, appreciated/depreciated against multiple currencies. The Company, however, generally holds investments in the same currencies as its net reserves, or enters into derivative foreign exchange contracts, with the intent of matching the foreign exchange movements on its assets and liabilities. See Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk contained in Item 7A of Part II of this report for a more detailed discussion of the foreign currency risk of the Company’s assets and liabilities. 

The Company believes that in order to enhance the understanding of its reserve development, it is useful for investors to evaluate the Company’s reserve development excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The development of initial net reserves converted at each year’s average foreign exchange rates is shown in the following table (in thousands of U.S. dollars). Using the historical average foreign exchange rates for the development lines of the table has the effect of linking each year’s development with that year’s income statement. This table should not be considered as a substitute for the table provided above as it does not reflect a significant portion of the initial net reserve development that is due to foreign exchange revaluation.

Other P&amp;C Exposures 

The Company’s reserve for unpaid losses and loss expenses at December 31, 2015 &#32;includes reserves that are difficult to estimate using traditional reserving methodologies. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates—Losses and Loss Expenses and Life Policy Benefits in Item 7 of Part II of this report for additional information and discussion of the uncertainties and complexities related to the New Zealand Earthquakes and the Company’s exposure to claims arising from asbestos and environmental exposures. 

There can be no assurance that the reserves established by the Company will not be adversely affected by development of other latent exposures, and further, there can be no assurance that the reserves established by the Company will be adequate. However, they represent Management’s best estimate for ultimate losses based on available information at this time. 

Life and Health Reserves 

The reconciliation of the gross and net life and health reserves &#32;for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;was as follows (in millions of U.S. dollars):

Net life and health reserves &#32;modestly decreased from $2,021 &#32;million at December 31, 2014 &#32;to $2,009 million &#32;at December 31, 2015 , primarily due to paid losses and the impact of foreign exchange, which were partially offset by net incurred losses. Net life and health reserves increased from $1,967 million at December 31, 2013 to $2,021 million at December 31, 2014, primarily due to net incurred losses, which were partially offset by paid losses and the impact of foreign exchange. The net incurred losses for the Company’s life and health reserves will generally exceed net paid losses in any one given year due to the long-term nature of the liabilities and the growth in the book of business. 

For the year ended December 31, 2015 , the Company experienced net favorable loss development on prior accident years of $47 million , which was primarily related to the PartnerRe Health business, the short-term mortality business and the GMDB business .

Investments and Investments underlying the Funds Held—Directly Managed Account 

The Company has developed specific investment objectives and guidelines for the management of its investment portfolio and the investments underlying the funds held — directly managed account (see below for details). These objectives and guidelines stress diversification of risk, matching of the underlying liability payments, low credit risk and stability of portfolio income. Despite the prudent focus of these objectives and guidelines, the Company’s investments are subject to general market risk, as well as to risks inherent in particular securities. 

To ensure that the Company will have sufficient assets to pay its clients’ claims, the Company’s investment philosophy distinguishes between those assets, including the investments underlying the funds held — directly managed account, that are matched against existing liabilities (liability funds) and those that represent shareholders’ equity (capital funds). Liability funds are invested in high quality fixed income securities and cash and cash equivalents. Capital funds are available for investing in a broadly diversified portfolio, which includes investments in preferred and common stocks, private bond and equity investments, investment grade and below investment grade securities and other asset classes that offer potentially higher returns. 

Investments 

The Company’s investment portfolio, excluding the funds held — directly managed account which is discussed below, includes fixed maturities, short-term investments and equities that are classified as trading securities and recorded at fair value, and other invested assets. The carrying values of the Company’s investments at December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 &#32;were as follows (in millions of U.S. dollars):

In addition to the total investments shown in the above table of $14.3 billion &#32;and $15.3 billion &#32;at December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively, the Company held cash and cash equivalents of $1.6 billion &#32;and $1.3 billion &#32;at December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. 

The decrease in the fair value of the Company’s fixed maturities at December 31, 2015 &#32;compared to December 31, 2014 , primarily reflects the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most major currencies, cash outflows to fund the AXIS Termination Fee, increases in U.S. risk-free interest rates and the widening of credit spreads. These decreases were partially offset by net investment income and cash inflows due to asset re-allocations from equities to fixed income. At December 31, 2015, there has been a shift in the distribution of the fixed maturity portfolio compared to December 31, 2014 as the Company decreased its holdings of non-U.S. government bonds and corporate bonds and increased its holdings of U.S. government and U.S. states, territories and municipalities securities, primarily due to changes in risk adjusted returns. 

The overall average credit rating of the portfolio at December 31, 2015 &#32;was A , and 93% &#32;of the fixed maturities and short-term investments were rated investment grade (BBB- or higher) by Standard &amp; Poor’s. For further discussion of the composition of the investment portfolio, see Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources—Investments in Item 7 of Part II of this report. 

The investment portfolio is divided and managed by strategy and legal entity. Each segregated portfolio is managed against a specific benchmark to properly control the risk of each portfolio as well as the aggregate risks of the combined portfolio. The performance of each portfolio and the aggregate investment portfolio is measured against several benchmarks to ensure that they have the appropriate risk and return characteristics. 

In order to manage the risks of the investment portfolio, several controls are in place. First, the overall duration (interest rate risk) of the portfolio is managed relative to the duration of the net reinsurance liabilities, defined as reinsurance liabilities net of all reinsurance assets, so that the economic value of changes in interest rates have offsetting effects on the Company’s assets and liabilities. Second, to ensure diversification and avoid aggregation of risks, limits on assets types, economic sector exposure, industry exposure and individual security exposure are placed on the investment portfolio. These exposures are monitored on an ongoing basis and reported at least quarterly to the Risk and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors (Board). See Risk Management below for a discussion of Market Risk, Interest Rate Risk and Default and Credit Spread Risk. See Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in Item 7A of Part II of this report for a discussion of the Company’s interest rate, equity and foreign currency management strategies. 

Investments underlying the Funds Held—Directly Managed Account 

Following the AXA Acquisition, Paris Re France and certain subsidiaries entered into an Issuance Agreement with Colis&#233;e Re to enable Colis&#233;e Re to write business on behalf of Paris Re France between January 1, 2006 and September 30, 2007. In addition, effective January 1, 2006, Paris Re France and Colis&#233;e Re entered into 100% quota share retrocession agreements to transfer the benefits and risks of Colis&#233;e Re’s reinsurance agreements to Paris Re and provide for the payment of premiums to Paris Re France in consideration for reinsuring the covered liabilities (the Quota Share Retrocession Agreement). The Quota Share Retrocession Agreement provides that these premiums will be on a funds withheld basis. Paris Re France will receive any surplus, and be responsible for any deficits remaining with respect to the funds held — directly managed account, after all liabilities have been discharged and payments pursuant to the Reserve Agreement have been settled. In addition, realized and unrealized investment gains and losses and net investment income related to the investment portfolio underlying the funds held — directly managed account inure to the benefit of Paris Re France. The investments underlying the funds held — directly managed account were predominantly maintained by Colis&#233;e Re in a segregated investment portfolio and managed by the Company. The Company’s strategy related to the management of the funds held — directly managed account is as described above related to the Company’s investment portfolio. 

The Company’s investment portfolio underlying the funds held — directly managed account includes fixed maturities and short-term investments that are recorded at fair value, and other invested assets. The carrying values of the investments underlying the funds held — directly managed account at December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 &#32;were as follows (in millions of U.S. dollars):

In addition to the investments underlying the funds held — directly managed account shown in the above table of $400 &#32;million and $473 &#32;million at December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively, the funds held — directly managed account also included cash and cash equivalents of $65 million &#32; and $42 million &#32;at December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively, accrued investment income of $4 million &#32;and $6 million &#32;at December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively, and other assets and liabilities held by Colis&#233;e Re related to the underlying business of $71 million &#32;and $88 million &#32;at December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. 

The decrease in the fair value of the investment portfolio underlying the funds held — directly managed account at December 31, 2015 &#32;compared to December 31, 2014 &#32;was primarily related to the run-off of the underlying liabilities associated with this account and, to a lesser extent, the impact of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most major currencies. 

The overall average credit rating of the portfolio at December 31, 2015 &#32;was AA, and all of the fixed maturities were rated investment grade (BBB- or higher) by Standard &amp; Poor’s.

Risk Management 

In the insurance and reinsurance industry, the core of the business model is the assumption and management of risk. A key challenge is to create total shareholder value through the intelligent and optimal assumption and management of reinsurance, insurance and investment risks while limiting and mitigating those risks that can destroy tangible as well as intangible value, those risks for which the organization is not sufficiently compensated, and those risks that could threaten the ability of the Company to achieve its objectives. While many companies start with a return goal, the Company starts with a capital-based risk appetite and then looks for risks that meet its return targets within that framework. Management believes that this construct allows the Company to balance the cedants’ need for certainty of claims payment with the shareholders’ need for an adequate total return. 

All business decisions entail a risk/return trade-off, and these decisions are applicable to the Company’s risks. In the context of assumed business risks, this requires an accurate evaluation of risks to be assumed, and a determination of the appropriate economic returns required as fair compensation for such risks. In the context of other than voluntarily assumed business risks, the decision relates to comparing the probability and potential severity of a risk event against the costs of risk mitigation strategies. In many cases, the potential impact of a risk event is so severe as to warrant significant, and potentially expensive, risk mitigation strategies. In other cases, the probability and potential severity of a risk does not warrant extensive risk mitigation. 

The Company’s results are primarily determined by how well the Company understands, prices and manages assumed risk. Management also believes that every organization faces numerous risks that could threaten the successful achievement of a company’s goals and objectives. These include all factors which can be viewed as either strategic, financial or operational risks that are common to any industry, such as choice of strategy and markets, economic and business cycles, competition, changes in regulation, data quality and security, fraud, business interruption and management continuity. See Risk Factors in Item 1A of Part I of this report. 

The Company has a clearly defined governance structure for risk management. Executive Management and the Board are responsible for setting the overall vision and goals of the Company, which include the Company’s risk appetite and return expectations. The Company’s risk framework, including key risk policies, is recommended by Executive Management and approved by the Risk and Finance Committee of the Board (Risk and Finance Committee). Each of the Company’s risk policies relates to a specific risk and describes the Company’s approach to risk management, defines roles and responsibilities relating to the assumption, mitigation, and control processes for that risk, and an escalation process for exceptions. Key policies are established by the Chief Executive Officer (CEO)/President and operating policies and risk controls at the next level down are established by Business Unit and Support Unit management as appropriate. Key policies are approved by the relevant Committee of the Board. Risk management policies and processes are coordinated by Group Risk Management and compliance is verified by Internal Audit on a periodic basis. The results of audits are monitored by the Audit Committee of the Board. 

The Company utilizes a multi-level risk management structure, whereby critical exposure limits, return requirement guidelines, capital at risk and key policies are established by the Executive Management and Board, but day-to-day execution of risk assumption activities and related risk mitigation strategies are delegated to the Business Units and Support Units. Reporting on risk management activities is integrated within the Company’s annual planning process, quarterly operations reports, periodic reports on exposures and large losses, and presentations to the Executive Management and Board. Individual Business Units and Support Units employ, and are responsible for reporting on, operating risk management procedures and controls, while Internal Audit periodically evaluates the effectiveness of such procedures and controls. 

Strategic Risks 

Strategic risks are managed by the CEO/President and include the direction and governance of the Company, as well as its response to key external factors faced by the reinsurance industry, such as changes in cedants’ risk retention behavior, regulation, competitive structure and macroeconomic, legal and social trends. Management considers that strong governance procedures, including a robust system of processes and internal controls is appropriate to manage risks related to its reputation and risks related to new initiatives, including acquisitions, new products or markets. The Company seeks to preserve its reputation through high professional and ethical standards and manages the impact of identified risks through the adoption and implementation of a sound and comprehensive Assumed Risk Framework. 

Assumed Risks 

Central to the Company’s assumed risk framework is its risk appetite. The Company’s risk appetite is a statement of how much and how often the Company will tolerate economic losses during an annual period. The Company’s risk appetite is expressed as the maximum economic loss that the Board is willing to incur based on a once in 250 years modeled probability. The Company’s risk appetite is approved by the Board on an annual basis. Definitions for the maximum economic loss and available economic capital are as follows: 

Economic Loss. The Company defines an economic loss as a decrease in the Company’s economic value, which is defined as common shareholders’ equity attributable to PartnerRe Ltd. plus the "time value of money" discount of the Non-life reserves that is not recognized in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP), net of tax, plus the embedded value of the Life portfolio that is not recognized in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, net of tax, less goodwill and intangible assets, net of tax. 

Available Economic Capital. The Company defines economic capital as the economic value, as defined above, plus preferred shareholders’ equity and the carrying value of debt recognized in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 

The Maximum Economic Loss. The maximum economic loss is a loss expressed as a percentage of economic capital for a once in 250 years modeled probability. 

The Company manages exposure levels from multiple risk sources to provide reasonable assurance that modeled operating or economic losses are contained within the risk appetite approved by the Board. The Company utilizes an internal model to evaluate capital at risk levels and compliance with the Company’s risk appetite. The results of the Company’s assessment of capital at risk levels in relation to the risk appetite are reported to the Board on a periodic basis. 

To mitigate the chance of operating losses and economic losses exceeding the risk appetite, the Company relies upon diversification of risk sources and risk limits to manage exposures. Diversification enables losses from one risk source to be offset by profits from other risk sources so that the chance of overall losses exceeding the Company’s risk appetite is reduced. However, if multiple losses from multiple risk sources occur within the same year, there is the potential that operating and economic losses can exceed the risk appetite. In addition, there is the chance that the Company’s internal assessment of capital at risk for a single source of risk or for multiple sources of risk proves insufficient resulting in actual losses exceeding the Company’s risk appetite. To reduce the chance of either of these unfavorable outcomes, the Company uses risk limits to minimize the chance that losses from a single risk source or from multiple risk sources will cause operating losses and economic losses to exceed the Company’s risk appetite, and embeds correlations within its internal model to capture the possibility of multiple losses from multiple risk sources. 

The Company establishes key risk limits net of any reinsurance/retrocession for any risk source deemed by Management to have the potential to cause operating losses or economic losses greater than the Company’s risk appetite. The Company may also establish risk limits for any risk source deemed to have the possibility of causing reputational damage. The Risk and Finance Committee approves the key risk limits. Executive and Business and Support Unit Management may set additional specific and aggregate risk limits within the key risk limits approved by the Risk and Finance Committee. The actual level of risk is dependent on current market conditions and the need for balance in the Company’s portfolio of risks. On a quarterly basis, Management reviews and reports to the Risk and Finance Committee the actual limits deployed against the approved limits. 

Individual Business and Support Units manage assumed risks, subject to the appetite and principles approved by the Board, limits approved by the Risk and Finance Committee, and policies established by Executive and Business Unit Management. At an operational level, Business and Support Units manage assumed risk through risk mitigation strategies including strong processes, technical risk assessment and collaboration among different groups of professionals who each contribute a particular area of expertise. 

Management established key risk limits that are approved by the Risk and Finance Committee for ten risk sources. The limits approved by the Risk and Finance Committee and the actual limits deployed at December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 &#32;were as follows (in billions of U.S. dollars, except interest rate risk data):

Natural Catastrophe Risk &#32; 

The Company defines this risk as the risk that the aggregate losses from natural perils materially exceed the net premiums that are received to cover such risks, which may result in operating and economic losses to the Company. The Company considers both catastrophe losses due to a single large event and catastrophe losses that would occur from multiple (but potentially smaller) events in any year. 

Natural catastrophe risk is managed through the allocation of catastrophe exposure capacity in each exposure zone to different Business Units, regular catastrophe modeling and a combination of quantitative and qualitative analysis. The Company considers a peril zone to be an area within a geographic region, continent or country in which losses from insurance exposures are likely to be highly correlated to a single catastrophic event. Not all peril zones have the same limit and zones are broadly defined so that it would be unlikely for any single event to substantially erode the aggregate exposure limits from more than one peril zone. Even extremely high severity/low likelihood events will only partially exhaust the limits in any peril zone, as they are likely to only affect a part of the area covered by a wide peril zone. 

The Company imposes a limit to natural catastrophe risk from any single loss through exposure limits, net of retrocession, in each zone and to each peril and also utilizes probable maximum loss estimates to manage its exposures to specific peril zones. Limits from catastrophe exposed business include limits on both reinsurance treaties and insurance-linked securities. Specifically, the Company uses the lesser of any contractually defined limits or the probable maximum loss per contract as the measure of capacity per treaty including proportional exposures for the key peak exposures. This capacity measure is aggregated by contract within a peril zone to establish the total exposures. Actual exposure limits deployed and estimated probable maximum loss in a specific peril zone will vary from period to period depending on Management’s assessment of current market conditions, the results of the Company’s exposure modeling, and other analysis. See Natural Catastrophe Probable Maximum Loss below for a discussion of the Company’s estimated exposures for selected peak industry natural catastrophe perils at October 1, 2015 . 

Long Tail Insurance and Reinsurance Risk 

The Company defines this risk as the risk that the estimates of ultimate losses for casualty and other long-tail lines will prove to be too low, leading to the need for substantial reserve strengthening, which may result in operating and economic losses to the Company. One of the greatest risks in long-tail lines of business, and particularly in U.S. casualty, is that loss trends are higher than the assumptions underlying the Company’s ultimate loss estimates, resulting in ultimate losses that exceed recorded loss reserves. When loss trends prove to be higher than those underlying the reserving assumptions, the impact can be large because of an accumulation effect: for long-tail lines, the Company carries reserves to cover claims arising from several years of underwriting 

activity and these reserves are likely to be similarly affected by unfavorable loss trends. The effect is likely to be more pronounced for recent underwriting years because, with the passage of time, actual loss emergence and data provide greater confidence around the adequacy of ultimate liability estimates for older underwriting years. Management believes that the volume of long-tail business most exposed to these reserving uncertainties is limited. 

The Company manages and mitigates the reserving risk for long-tail lines in a variety of ways. Underwriters and pricing actuaries follow a disciplined underwriting process that utilizes all available data and information, including industry trends, and the Company establishes prudent reserving policies for determining recorded reserves. These policies are systematic and Management endeavors to apply them consistently over time. The Company’s limit for long tail reinsurance risk represents the written premiums for casualty and other long-tail lines for the four most recent calendar quarters. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Losses and Loss Expenses and Life Policy Benefits in Item 7 of Part II of this report. 

Market Risk 

The Company defines this risk as the risk of a substantial decline in the value of its Risk Assets. Risk Assets comprise the Company’s equity and equity-like securities which include all invested assets that are not investment grade standard fixed income securities and certain fixed income asset classes that are not liquid (but excludes insurance-linked securities as that risk is aggregated with liability risks). The Company limits the market value of Risk Assets as well as sub-limits the market value of equity and equity-like securities that it will hold in its investment portfolio. 

Assuming equity and equity-like risks within that part of the investment portfolio that is not required to support the Company’s reinsurance liabilities provides valuable diversification from other risk classes, along with the potential for higher returns. However, overexposure to equity risk could lead to a large loss in the value of equity and equity-like securities and non-standard fixed income securities in the case of a market crash. The Company sets strict limits on investments in any one name and any one industry, which creates a diversified portfolio and allows Management to focus on the systemic effects of equity risks. Systemic risk is managed by asset allocation, subject to strict caps on Risk Assets as a percentage of shareholders’ equity. The Company’s fully integrated information system provides real-time investment data, allowing for continuous monitoring and decision support. Each portfolio is managed against a pre-determined benchmark to enable alignment with appropriate risk parameters and achievement of desired returns. See Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk-Equity Price Risk in Item 7A of Part II of this report. 

Interest Rate Risk 

The Company defines this risk as the risk of a substantial mismatch of asset and liability durations, which may result in economic losses to the Company. Economically, the Company is hedged against changes in asset and liability values resulting from small parallel changes in the risk free yield curve to the degree asset and liability durations are matched. Non-parallel shifts in the yield curve or extremely large changes in yields can introduce interest rate risk and investment losses to the degree asset maturity and coupon payments are not exactly matched to liability payments. Investment losses associated with interest rate risk of a magnitude that have the potential to exceed the Company’s risk appetite are associated with extremely large increases in interest rates over an annual period. The Company limits and monitors the interest rate exposure on its fixed income assets held in excess of those that are matched against liabilities. The Company both matches assets and liabilities to hedge against changes in interest rates and limits the total amount of interest rate exposure. See Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk-Interest Rate Risk in Item 7A of Part II of this report. 

Default and Credit Spread Risk 

The Company defines this risk as the risk of a substantial increase in defaults in the Company’s standard fixed income credit securities (which includes investment grade corporate bonds and asset-backed securities) leading to realized investment losses or a significant widening of credit spreads resulting in realized or unrealized investment losses, either of which may result in economic losses to the Company. Investment losses of the magnitude that have the potential to exceed the Company’s risk appetite are associated with the systemic impacts of severe economic and financial stress. As a result, the Company limits the market value of the standard fixed income credit securities so that investment losses will be mitigated in an extreme economic or financial crisis. See Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk-Credit Spread Risk in Item 7A of Part II of this report. 

Trade Credit Underwriting Risk 

The Company defines this risk as the risk that aggregated trade credit losses materially exceed the net premiums that are received to cover such risks, which may result in operating and economic losses to the Company. Trade credit underwriting losses of the magnitude that have the potential to exceed the Company’s risk appetite are associated with the systemic impacts of severe economic and financial stress. In these events, underwriting losses may arise from defaults of single large named insureds and from a high frequency of defaults of smaller insureds. In addition, trade credit underwriting risk is highly correlated with default and credit spread widening risk of the standard investment grade fixed income portfolio during times of economic stress or financial crises. 

In order to determine a trade credit underwriting limit metric for the purposes of risk accumulation, the Company examines extreme scenarios and measures its exposure to loss under those scenarios. Examples of these scenarios include historical losses from the largest trade credit defaults, prior periods of financial crisis and economic stress (e.g. 1990-1991 recession and 2008-2009 financial crisis) and potential impacts of financial crisis and economic stress scenarios. The Company does not rely upon modeled losses to determine the limit metric, but benchmarks the scenario results against existing tests, scenarios and models. For risk accumulation purposes, the Company examines the extreme scenario that would result in 100% of loss ratio adverse deviation on the trade credit portfolio written on a proportional basis (which far exceeds any adverse deviation of the loss ratio experienced in past periods of economic stress or financial crises) increased by the net probable maximum losses of the two largest named insureds in the Company's trade credit portfolio. 

Longevity Risk 

The Company considers longevity exposure to have a material accumulation potential and has established a limit to manage the risk of loss associated with this exposure, which may result in operating and economic losses to the Company. The Company defines longevity risk as the potential for increased actual and future expected annuity payments resulting from annuitants living longer than expected, or the expectation that annuitants will live longer in the future. Assuming longevity risk, through reinsurance or capital markets transactions, is part of the Company’s strategy of building a diversified portfolio of risks. While longevity risk is highly diversifying in relation to other risks in the Company’s portfolio (e.g. mortality products), longevity risk itself is a systemic risk with little opportunity to diversify within the risk class. Longevity risk accumulates across cedants, geographies, and over time because mortality trends can impact diverse populations in the same manner. Longevity risk can manifest slowly over time as experience proves annuitants are living longer than original expectations, or abruptly as in the case of a "miracle drug" that increases the life expectancy of all annuitants simultaneously. 

In order to determine a longevity limit metric for the purposes of risk accumulation, the Company examines extreme scenarios and measures its exposure to loss under those scenarios. Examples of these scenarios include immediate elimination of major causes of death and an extreme improvement in mortality continuing indefinitely. For risk accumulation purposes, the Company selects the most financially adverse scenario and adds an additional margin for potential deviation. To measure utilization of the longevity limit (accumulation of longevity exposure) the Company accumulates the net present value of adverse losses resulting from the application of the selected most extreme scenario, adds an additional margin to every in-force longevity treaty for potential delays in recognizing that an observed mortality deviation is not short term in nature and, where appropriate, includes the notional value of longevity insurance-linked securities. 

Pandemic Risk 

The Company considers mortality exposure to have a material accumulation potential to common risk drivers, in particular to pandemic events, which may result in operating and economic losses to the Company. The Company defines pandemic risk as the increase in mortality over an annual period associated with a rapidly spreading virus (either within a highly populated geographic area or on a global basis) with a high mortality rate. Assuming mortality risk, through reinsurance or capital markets transactions, is part of the Company’s strategy of building a diversified portfolio of risks. While mortality risk is highly diversifying in relation to other risks in the Company’s portfolio (e.g. longevity products), mortality risk itself is a systemic risk when the risk driver is a pandemic with little opportunity to diversify within the risk class. Mortality risk from pandemics can accumulate across cedants and geographies. 

In order to determine a pandemic limit metric for the purposes of risk accumulation, the Company examines extreme scenarios and measures its exposure to loss under those scenarios. Examples of these scenarios include increased mortality associated with past pandemic events (e.g. 1918 Spanish flu) and potential mortality outcomes from transmission scenarios across differing age groups, and across developed and developing countries. For risk accumulation purposes, the Company selects an extreme mortality scenario applied to the insured portfolio in developing and developed countries that would have twice the assumed fatality rate of the 1918 Spanish flu recurring today, combined with an adverse mortality age pattern, and with the same transmissibility characteristics. 

Agriculture Risk 

The Company defines this risk as the risk that losses from multi-peril crop insurance materially exceed the net premiums that are received to cover such risks, which may result in operating and economic losses to the Company. Multi-peril crop underwriting losses of the magnitude that have the potential to exceed the Company’s risk appetite are associated with the systemic impacts of severe weather events, particularly drought or flooding, over a large geographic area. Localized events such as convective thunderstorms or hail, while potentially devastating, are unlikely to have the large geographic footprint necessary to create material losses exceeding the net premiums collected. 

Multi-peril crop risk is managed through geographic diversification both within individual countries and across countries. This is accomplished through the allocation and tracking of capacity across exposure zones (defined as individual countries) and is accompanied by regular extreme event modeling, and a combination of quantitative and qualitative analysis. 

The Company utilizes probable maximum loss estimates, net of retrocession, to manage its exposures. The limit approved measure is aggregated by contract within an exposure zone to establish the total exposures. Actual exposures deployed and estimated probable maximum losses in a specific zone will vary from period to period depending on Management’s assessment of current market conditions, the results from exposure modeling, and other analysis. 

Mortgage Insurance and Reinsurance Risk 

The Company defines this risk as the risk that losses from mortgage insurance materially exceed the net premiums that are received to cover such risks, which may result in operating and economic losses to the Company. Mortgage insurance underwriting losses that have the potential to exceed the Company’s risk appetite are associated with the systemic impacts of severe mortgage defaults, driven by large scale economic downturns and high unemployment. Localized or regional economic downturns are unlikely to have a large enough geographic footprint necessary to create material losses exceeding the net premiums collected. 

At December 31, 2015 , the majority of the Company’s exposure to mortgage risk related to risks in the U.S. All of the Company’s U.S. mortgage portfolio consists of prime mortgages, with most of the underlying risks related to policies written post-financial crisis and subject to enhanced post-financial crisis underwriting procedures that differentiate between risks. Mortgage insurance is managed through geographic diversification both within countries and across countries. This is accomplished through the allocation and tracking of capacity across exposure zones (defined as individual countries) and is accompanied by regular extreme event modeling, and a combination of quantitative and qualitative analysis 

The Company utilizes total limits deployed, net of retrocession, to manage its exposures. The limits per individual contract are aggregated within an exposure zone to establish the total exposures. Actual exposures deployed and estimated probable maximum losses in a specific zone will vary from period to period depending on Management’s assessment of current market conditions, the results from exposure modeling, and other analysis. 

Operational and Financial Risks &#32; 

Operational and financial risks are managed by designated functions within the organization. These risks include, but are not limited to, failures or weaknesses in financial reporting and controls, regulatory non-compliance, poor cash management, fraud, breach of information technology security, disaster recovery planning and reliance on third party vendors. The Company seeks to minimize these risks through robust processes and monitoring throughout the organization. 

Other Underwriting Risk and Exposure Controls 

The Company’s underwriting is conducted at the Business Unit level through specialized underwriting teams with the support of technical staff in disciplines such as actuarial, claims, legal, risk management and finance. 

The Company’s underwriters generally speak the local language and/or are native to their country or area of specialization. They develop close working relationships with their ceding company counterparts and brokers through regular visits, gathering detailed information about the cedant’s business and local market conditions and practices. As part of the underwriting process, the underwriters also focus on the reputation and quality of the proposed cedant, the likelihood of establishing a long-term relationship with the cedant, the geographic area in which the cedant does business and the cedant’s market share, historical loss data for the cedant and, where available, historical loss data for the industry as a whole in the relevant regions, in order to compare the cedant’s historical loss experience to industry averages, and to gauge the perceived insurance and reinsurance expertise and financial strength of the cedant. The Company trains its underwriters extensively and strives to maintain continuity of underwriters within specific geographic markets and areas of specialty. 

Given the Company underwrites volatile lines of business, such as catastrophe reinsurance, the operating results and financial condition of the Company can be adversely affected by catastrophes and other large losses that may give rise to claims under reinsurance coverages provided by the Company. The Company manages its exposure to catastrophic and other large losses by (i) limiting its aggregate exposure on catastrophe reinsurance in any particular geographic zone, (ii) selective underwriting practices, (iii) diversification of risks by geographic area and by lines and classes of business, and (iv) by purchasing retrocessional reinsurance. 

The Company generally underwrites risks with specified limits per treaty program. Like other reinsurance companies, the Company is exposed to multiple insured losses arising out of a single occurrence, whether a natural event such as hurricane, windstorm, tornado, flood or earthquake, or man-made events. Any such catastrophic event could generate insured losses in one or many of the Company’s reinsurance treaties and facultative contracts in one or more lines of business. The Company considers such event scenarios as part of its evaluation and monitoring of its aggregate exposures to catastrophic events. 

Retrocessional reinsurance &#32; 

The Company uses retrocessional reinsurance agreements to reduce its exposure on certain reinsurance risks assumed and to mitigate the effect of any single major event or the frequency of medium-sized events. These agreements provide for the recovery of a portion of losses and loss expenses from retrocessionaires. The majority of the Company’s retrocessional reinsurance agreements cover property and specialty lines (e.g., agriculture, aviation, marine and certain risks included in the credit/surety line) exposures, predominantly those that are catastrophe exposed. The Company also utilizes retrocessions in the Life and Health segment to manage the amount of per-event and per-life risks to which it is exposed. Retrocessionaires must be pre-approved based on their financial condition and business practices, with stability, solvency and credit ratings being important criteria. Strict limits per retrocessionaire are also put into place and monitored to mitigate counter party credit risk. 

The Company remains liable to its cedants to the extent that the retrocessionaires do not meet their obligations under retrocessional agreements, and therefore retrocessions are subject to credit risk in all cases and to aggregate loss limits in certain cases. The Company holds collateral, including escrow funds, trusts, securities and letters of credit under certain retrocessional agreements. Provisions are made for amounts considered potentially uncollectible and reinsurance losses recoverable from retrocessionaires are reported after allowances for uncollectible amounts. 

In addition to the retrocessional agreements, PartnerRe Europe has a Reserve Agreement in place with Colis&#233;e Re (see Business-Reserves-Non-life Reserves-Reserve Agreement in Item 1 of Part I of this report). 

Claims 

In addition to managing and settling reported claims and consulting with ceding companies on claims matters, the Company conducts periodic audits of specific claims and the overall claims procedures at the offices of ceding companies. The Company attempts to evaluate the ceding company’s claim adjusting techniques and reserve adequacy and whether it follows proper claims processing procedures. The Company also provides recommendations regarding procedures and processes to the ceding company. 

Natural Catastrophe Probable Maximum Loss (PML) 

The following discussion of the Company’s natural catastrophe probable maximum loss (PML) information contains forward-looking statements based upon assumptions and expectations concerning the potential effect of future events that are subject to uncertainties. See Item 1A of Part I of this report for a list of the Company’s risk factors. Any of these risk factors could result in actual losses that are materially different from the Company’s PML estimates below. 

Natural catastrophe risk is a source of significant aggregate exposure for the Company and is managed by setting risk appetite and limits, as discussed above. Natural catastrophe perils can impact geographic regions of varying size and can have economic repercussions beyond the geographic region directly impacted. 

The Company considers a peril zone to be an area within a geographic region, continent or country in which losses from insurance exposures are likely to be highly correlated to a single catastrophic event. The Company defines peril zones to capture the vast majority of exposures likely to be incorporated by typical modeled events. There is, however, no industry standard and the Company’s definitions of peril zones may differ from those of other parties. 

The Company has exposures in other peril zones that can potentially generate losses greater than the PML estimates below. The Company’s PMLs represent an estimate of loss for a single event for a given return period. The table below discloses the Company’s 1-in-250 and 1-in-500 year return period estimated loss for a single occurrence of a natural catastrophe event in a one-year period. In other words, the 1-in-250 and 1-in-500 year return period PMLs mean that there is a 0.4% and 0.2% chance, respectively, in any given year that an occurrence of a natural catastrophe in a specific peril zone will lead to losses exceeding the stated estimate. 

The PML estimates below include all significant exposure from our Non-life and Life and Health business operations. This includes coverage for property, marine, energy, engineering, workers’ compensation and mortality and exposure to catastrophe from insurance-linked securities. The PML estimates do not include casualty coverage that could be exposed as a result of a catastrophic event. In addition, they do not include estimates for contingent losses to insureds that are not directly impacted by the event (e.g. loss of earnings due to disruption in supply lines). 

The Company’s single occurrence estimated net PML exposures (pre-tax and net of retrocession and reinstatement premiums) for certain selected peak industry natural catastrophe perils at October 1, 2015 &#32;were as follows (in millions of U.S. dollars):

Other Key Issues of Management 

Capital Adequacy 

A key challenge for Management is to maintain an appropriate level of capital. Management’s first priority is to hold sufficient capital to meet all of the Company’s obligations to cedants, meet regulatory requirements and support its position as one of the stronger reinsurers in the industry. Holding an excessive amount of capital, however, will reduce the Company’s compound annual growth in diluted tangible book value per share and Operating ROE. Consequently, Management closely monitors its capital needs and capital level throughout the reinsurance cycle and in times of volatility and turmoil in global capital markets, and actively takes steps to increase or decrease the Company’s capital in order to achieve an appropriate balance of financial strength and shareholder returns. Capital management is achieved by either deploying capital to fund attractive business opportunities, or in times of excess capital and times when business opportunities are not so attractive, returning capital to its common shareholders by way of share repurchases and dividends. During 2015 , the Company repurchased approximately 0.5 million &#32;of its common shares under its authorized share repurchase program at a total cost of $59 million , representing an average cost of $112.89 &#32;per share. Following the announcement of the Amalgamation Agreement on January 25, 2015, the Company suspended its repurchase activities and the share repurchase program remains suspended under the terms of the Merger Agreement with EXOR. &#32;In addition, the Company increased the quarterly dividends on its common shares by 4% during 2015 , from $0.67 per share to $0.70 per share. For further discussion of capital adequacy, see Shareholders' Equity and Capital Resources Management in Item 7 of Part II of this report. 

Liquidity and Cash Flows 

The Company aims to be a reliable and financially secure partner to its cedants. This means that the Company must maintain sufficient liquidity at all times so that it can support its cedants by settling claims quickly. The Company generates cash flows primarily from its underwriting and investment operations. Management believes that a profitable, well-run reinsurance organization will generate sufficient cash from premium receipts to pay claims, acquisition costs and other expenses in most years. To the extent that underwriting cash flows are not sufficient to cover operating cash outflows in any year, the Company may utilize cash flows generated from investments and may ultimately liquidate assets from its investment portfolio. Management ensures that its liquidity requirements are supported by maintaining a high quality, well balanced and liquid investment portfolio, and by matching the duration and currency of its investments and investments underlying the funds held—directly managed account with that of its net reinsurance liabilities. In 2016 , the Company expects to continue to generate positive operating cash flows, absent a series of unusual catastrophic events. For further discussion of liquidity and cash flows, see Shareholders' Equity and Capital Resources Management — Liquidity in Item 7 of Part II of this report. 

Enterprise Culture 

Management is focused on ensuring that the structure and culture of the organization promote intelligent, prudent, transparent and ethical decision-making. Management believes that a sound enterprise culture starts with the tone at the top. Management holds regular company-wide information sessions to present and review Management’s latest decisions, whether operational, financial or structural, as well as the financial results of the Company. Employees are encouraged to address questions related to the Company’s results, strategy or Management decisions, either anonymously or otherwise to Management so that they can be answered during these information sessions. Management believes that these sessions provide a consistent message to all employees about the Company’s value of transparency. Management also strives to promote a work environment that (i) aligns the skill set of individuals with challenges encountered by the Company, (ii) includes segregation of duties to ensure objectivity in decision-making, and (iii) provides a compensation structure that encourages and rewards intelligent risk taking and ethical behavior. To that effect, the Company has a written Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and provides employees with a direct communication channel to the Audit Committee of the Board in the event they become aware of questionable behavior of Management or any other employee. Finally, Management believes that building a sound internal control environment, including a strong Internal Audit function, helps ensure that behaviors are consistent with the Company’s cultural values. 

Employees 

The Company had 1,035 employees at December 31, 2015 . The Company believes that its relations with its employees are good. 

Regulation 

The business of reinsurance is regulated in all countries in which we operate, although the degree and type of regulation varies significantly from one jurisdiction to another. Some jurisdictions impose complex regulatory requirements on insurance businesses while other jurisdictions impose fewer requirements. In certain foreign countries, reinsurers are required to be licensed by governmental authorities. These licenses may be subject to modification, suspension or revocation dependent on such factors as amount and types of reserves and minimum capital and solvency tests. The violation of regulatory requirements may result in fines, censures and/or criminal sanctions in various jurisdictions. See Risk Factors in Item 1A of Part I of this report. 

As a holding company, PartnerRe Ltd. is not directly subject to (re)insurance regulations, but its various material operating subsidiaries are subject to regulation as follows: 

Bermuda 

The Insurance Act 1978 of Bermuda and related regulations, as amended (the Insurance Act), regulates the insurance business of PartnerRe Bermuda. The Insurance Act imposes solvency and liquidity standards and auditing and reporting requirements on Bermuda insurance companies and grants the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA) powers to supervise, investigate and intervene in the affairs of insurance companies. The Insurance Act makes no distinction between insurance and reinsurance business. 

PartnerRe Bermuda is licensed as a Class 4 and Class E insurer in Bermuda and is therefore authorized to carry on general and long-term insurance business, respectively. Significant aspects of the Bermuda insurance regulatory framework and requirements imposed on Class 4 and Class E insurers such as PartnerRe Bermuda include the following: 

Minimum Capital Requirements. &#32;The BMA imposes certain minimum capital regulatory requirements on PartnerRe Bermuda, which are to hold statutory capital and surplus equal to or exceeding the Target Capital Level, which is equivalent to 120% of the Enhanced Capital Requirement (ECR). PartnerRe Bermuda’s Enhanced Capital Requirement (ECR) should be calculated by either (a) the model developed by the BMA, or (b) an internal capital model which the BMA has approved for use for this purpose. PartnerRe Bermuda currently uses the BMA model in calculating its solvency requirements. The Bermuda risk-based regulatory capital adequacy and solvency margin regime provides a risk-based capital model (termed the Bermuda Solvency Capital Requirement (BSCR)) as a tool to assist the BMA both in measuring risk and in determining appropriate levels of capitalization. The BSCR employs a standard mathematical model that correlates the risk underwritten by Bermuda insurers to the capital that is dedicated to their business; 

Solvency Assessment. &#32;PartnerRe Bermuda must perform an assessment of its own risk and solvency requirements, referred to as a Commercial Insurer’s Solvency Self Assessment (CISSA). The CISSA allows the BMA to obtain an insurer’s view of the capital resources required to achieve its business objectives and to assess a company’s governance, risk management and controls surrounding this process. In addition, PartnerRe Bermuda must file with the BMA a Catastrophe Risk Return which assesses an insurer’s reliance on vendor models in assessing catastrophe exposure; 

Reporting Requirements. &#32;PartnerRe Bermuda must prepare audited annual statutory financial statements and file them with the BMA, together with audited annual financial statements which are prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP); and 

Dividends and Distributions. &#32;PartnerRe Bermuda is prohibited from declaring or paying any dividend of more than 25% of its total statutory capital and surplus, as shown in its previous financial year statutory balance sheet, unless at least seven days before payment of the dividend it files with the BMA an affidavit that it will continue to meet its minimum capital requirements as described above. In addition, PartnerRe Bermuda must obtain the BMA’s prior approval before reducing its total statutory capital, as shown in its previous financial year statutory balance sheet, by 15% or more. 

In addition to the above regulatory requirements impacting PartnerRe Bermuda, Bermuda has recently taken steps to achieve equivalence status under the European Union’s (EU) Solvency II initiative (Solvency II). On November 26, 2015, the EU Commission published the Delegated Decision on Bermuda which was presented to the EU Parliament and EU Council for final review. The Delegated Decision proposed full equivalence for Bermuda for an unlimited period for all three relevant equivalence areas: Articles 172, 227 and 260, with the exception of rules on captives and special purpose insurers, which are subject to a different regulatory regime in Bermuda. This determination would result in Bermuda-based reinsurers being exempt from the requirement to post collateral in the EU and allow reinsurance contracts concluded with undertakings having their head office in Bermuda to be treated in the same manner as reinsurance contracts concluded with undertakings authorized in accordance with the directive (Article 172); EU insurance groups can conduct their EU prudential reporting for a subsidiary in Bermuda under local rules instead of Solvency II if deduction and aggregation is allowed as the method of consolidation of group accounts (Article 227); and Bermuda insurance groups which are active in the EU are exempt from some aspects of group supervision in the EU as Member States will rely on the equivalent supervision exercised by the Bermuda Monetary Authority (Article 260). Upon completion of the EU Parliament and EU Council review procedure, provided no formal objection is lodged, Bermuda will be deemed Solvency II equivalent with such equivalence to take effect from January 1, 2016. 

One of the key concepts of Solvency II is the principal of one "home" regulator over all the operating entities in a particular insurance or reinsurance group (referred to as Group Supervision). The Insurance Act sets out provisions regarding Group Supervision, including the power of the BMA to include or exclude specified entities from Group Supervision, the power of the BMA to withdraw as group supervisor, the functions of the BMA as group supervisor and the power of the BMA to make rules regarding Group Supervision. This Group Supervision regime is in addition to the regulation of the Company’s various operating subsidiaries in their local jurisdictions. The BMA’s Group Supervision rules set out the rules in respect of the assessment of the financial situation and solvency of an insurance group, the system of governance and risk management, and supervisory reporting and disclosures of an insurance group. The group solvency rules set out the rules in respect of the capital and solvency return and enhanced capital requirements for an insurance group. The BMA has chosen PartnerRe Bermuda as the designated insurer for the purposes of Group Supervision, and the BMA currently acts as group supervisor of the PartnerRe group. As group supervisor, the BMA gathers relevant and essential information on and assess the financial situation of the PartnerRe group, and coordinates the dissemination of such information to other relevant competent authorities for the purposes of assisting in their regulatory functions and the enforcement of regulatory action against the PartnerRe group or any of its members. PartnerRe is not an insurer and, as such, is not regulated in Bermuda. However, pursuant to its functions as group supervisor, the BMA may include any member of the group within its Group Supervision, including PartnerRe. 

Significant aspects of the Bermuda insurance regulatory framework and requirements imposed on Insurance Groups include the solvency assessment. The PartnerRe group must annually perform an assessment of its own risk and solvency requirements, referred to as a Group’s Solvency Self Assessment (GSSA). The GSSA allows the BMA to obtain an insurance group’s view of the capital resources required to achieve its business objectives and to assess a group’s governance, risk management and controls surrounding this process. In addition, the PartnerRe group must file with the BMA a Catastrophe Risk Return which assesses an insurer’s reliance on vendor models in assessing catastrophe exposure. 

Effective January 1, 2014, the BMA imposed the ECR on the PartnerRe group pursuant to its function as the Company's group supervisor. The PartnerRe group’s ECR may be calculated by either (a) the standard model developed by the BMA, or (b) an internal capital model which the BMA has approved for use for this purpose. PartnerRe currently uses the BMA standard model in calculating its group ECR requirements. In addition, the PartnerRe group is required to prepare and submit annual audited group U.S. GAAP financial statements, annual group statutory financial statements, annual group statutory financial return, annual group capital and solvency return and quarterly group unaudited financial returns. 

In addition to the above, PartnerRe Bermuda maintains an operating branch in Canada and a representative office in Mexico. The Canadian branch is subject to regulation in Canada by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions. For a further discussion of the regulations pertaining to the Canadian branch see below. 

Ireland 

The Central Bank of Ireland (the Central Bank) regulates insurance and reinsurance companies authorized in Ireland, including PartnerRe Europe and PartnerRe Ireland Insurance Limited (PartnerRe Ireland). PartnerRe Holdings Europe Limited, a holding company for PartnerRe Europe and PartnerRe Ireland, is not subject to regulation by the Central Bank. PartnerRe Europe is a reinsurance company incorporated under the laws of Ireland and is duly authorized as a reinsurance undertaking to carry on non-life and life reinsurance business in accordance with the European Union (Insurance and Reinsurance) Regulations 2015. PartnerRe Ireland is an insurance company incorporated under the laws of Ireland and is duly authorized as an insurance undertaking to carry on non-life insurance business in accordance with the European Union (Insurance and Reinsurance) Regulations 2015. 

Significant aspects of the Irish re/insurance regulatory framework and requirements imposed on PartnerRe Europe and PartnerRe Ireland include the following: 

Solvency Requirements. &#32;The Solvency II European Directive related to the solvency standards applicable to insurers and reinsurers prescribes, at the level of PartnerRe Europe and PartnerRe Ireland, the minimum amounts of financial resources that both companies are required to have in order to cover the risks to which they are exposed and the principles that should guide their overall risk management and reporting. 

This Directive became effective January1, 2016. In addition to the Solvency II requirements, some of the previous rules, known as Solvency I, and some specific requirements set by the Central Bank are retained for 2016; 

Reporting Requirements. &#32;PartnerRe Europe and PartnerRe Ireland must file and submit annual audited financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and related reports to the Irish Companies Registration Office (CRO) together with an annual return of certain core corporate information. Changes to core corporate information during the year must also be notified to the CRO. These requirements are in addition to the regulatory returns required to be filed annually with the Central Bank and additionally, in the case of PartnerRe Ireland, with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) in the U.S.; and 

Dividends and Distributions. &#32;Pursuant to Irish company law, PartnerRe Europe and PartnerRe Ireland are restricted to declaring dividends only out of "profits available for distribution". Profits available for distribution are, broadly, a company’s accumulated realized profits less its accumulated realized losses. Such profits may not include profits previously utilized. 

In addition to the above, PartnerRe Europe has also established operating branches in the United Kingdom, France, Switzerland, Singapore, Labuan and Hong Kong and a representative office in Brazil, which are subject to Irish reinsurance supervision regulations. In addition, the Singapore branch is subject to regulation by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Labuan branch is subject to regulation by the Labuan Financial Services Authority and the Hong Kong branch to regulation by the Office of the Commissioner of Insurance of Hong Kong. PartnerRe Ireland, pursuant to the Nonadmitted and Reinsurance Reform Act of 2010 (part of the Dodd-Frank Act), is a nonadmitted alien insurer in the U.S. and is eligible to write business as an excess and surplus lines insurer in all U.S. states. PartnerRe Ireland has also established an operating branch in the United Kingdom which is subject to Irish reinsurance supervision regulations. PartnerRe Ireland has a non-regulated branch in the Netherlands. 

United States 

PartnerRe U.S. Corporation is a Delaware domiciled holding company for its wholly owned (re)insurance subsidiaries, PartnerRe U.S., PartnerRe Insurance Company of New York (PRNY) and PartnerRe America Insurance Company (PRAIC) (PartnerRe U.S., PRNY and PRAIC together being the PartnerRe U.S. Insurance Companies). The PartnerRe U.S. Insurance Companies are subject to regulation under the insurance statutes and regulations of their domiciliary states, New York in the case of PartnerRe U.S. and PRNY, and Delaware in the case of PRAIC, and all states where they are licensed, accredited or approved to underwrite insurance and reinsurance. 

PartnerRe U.S. Corporation is also the owner of the Presidio Reinsurance Group, Inc. and its 100% owned subsidiaries Presidio Excess Insurance Services, Inc. (PXS), PartnerRe Management Ltd. (PRM) and Presidio Reinsurance Corporation Inc. (PRC). PXS is a managing general underwriter licensed in a number of states. PRM is domiciled in the U.K. and regulated by the Financial Services Authority. PRC is a Montana domiciled captive reinsurer. 

Currently, the PartnerRe U.S. Insurance Companies are licensed, accredited or approved reinsurers and/or insurers in all fifty states and the District of Columbia, and are subject to the requirements described below: 

Risk-Based Capital Requirements. &#32;The Risk-Based Capital (RBC) for Insurers Model Act (the Model RBC Act), as it applies to property and casualty insurers and reinsurers, was initially adopted by the NAIC in December 1993. The Model RBC Act or similar legislation has been adopted by the majority of states in the U.S. The main purpose of the Model RBC Act is to provide a tool for insurance regulators to evaluate the capital of insurers with respect to the risks assumed by them and to determine whether there is a need for possible corrective action. U.S. insurers and reinsurers are required to report the results of their RBC calculations as part of the statutory annual statements that such insurers and reinsurers file with state insurance regulatory authorities. The Model RBC Act provides for four different levels of regulatory actions, each of which may be triggered if an insurer’s Total Adjusted Capital (as defined in the Model RBC Act) is less than a corresponding level of risk-based capital. Decreases in an insurer’s Total Adjusted Capital as a percentage of its Annualized Control Level (as defined in the Model RBC Act) triggers increasing regulatory actions. Such regulatory actions include but are not limited to issuance of orders for corrective action by the insurer, rehabilitation or liquidation of the insurer. 

Insurance Regulatory Information System (IRIS) Ratios. &#32;A committee of state insurance regulators developed the NAIC’s IRIS primarily to assist state insurance departments in executing their statutory mandates to oversee the financial condition of insurance or reinsurance companies operating in their respective states. IRIS identifies thirteen industry ratios and specifies usual values for each ratio. Generally, a company will become subject to regulatory scrutiny if it falls outside the usual ranges with respect to four or more of the ratios, and regulators may then act, if the company has insufficient capital, to constrain the company’s underwriting capacity. No such action has been taken with respect to the PartnerRe U.S. Companies. 

Reporting Requirements. &#32;Regulations vary from state to state, but generally require insurance holding companies and insurers and reinsurers that are subsidiaries of insurance holding companies to register and file with their state domiciliary regulatory authorities certain reports, including information concerning their capital structure, ownership, financial condition and general business operations. State regulatory authorities monitor compliance with, and periodically conduct examinations with respect to, state mandated standards of solvency, licensing requirements, investment limitations, and restrictions on the size of risks which may be reinsured, deposits of securities for the benefit of reinsureds, methods of accounting for assets, reserves for unearned premiums and losses, and other purposes. In general, such regulations are for the protection of reinsureds and, ultimately, their policyholders, rather than security holders. In the U.S., the New York State Department of Financial Services is the domiciliary regulator of PartnerRe U.S. and PRNY, and the Delaware Department of Insurance is the domiciliary regulator of PRAIC. 

Dividends and Distributions. &#32;Under New York law, the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) must approve any dividend declared or paid by PartnerRe U.S. or PRNY that, together with all dividends declared or distributed by each of them during the preceding twelve months, exceeds the lesser of 10% of their respective statutory surplus as shown on the latest statutory financial statements on file with the NYDFS, or 100% of their respective adjusted net investment income during that period. In addition, we anticipate that, for a period of two years from the date of consummation of the proposed Merger, PartnerRe U.S. and PRNY shall be required to seek approval of the NYDFS prior to paying any dividends (see Risk Factors in Item 1A of Part I of this report). Under Delaware law the Delaware Commissioner of Insurance must approve any dividend declared or paid by PRAIC that, together with all dividends or distributions made within the preceding 12 months exceeds the greater of (i) ten percent of PRAIC’s surplus as regards policyholders as of the preceding December 31 or (ii) the net income, not including realized capital gains, for the 12-month period ending the preceding December 31. Both Delaware and New York do not permit a dividend to be declared or distributed, except out of earned surplus. 

In addition to the above, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the Dodd-Frank Act) currently impacts the PartnerRe U.S. Insurance Companies. The Dodd-Frank Act represents a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry in the U.S. and establishes a Federal Insurance Office (FIO) within the U.S. Treasury Department. Although the FIO does not have general supervisory or regulatory authority over the business of insurance or reinsurance, it is charged with monitoring all aspects of the insurance industry, consulting with state insurance regulators, assisting in administration of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (TRIA) and other duties. The FIO is also responsible for issuing certain reports to Congress, the President and/or others, such as the FIO’s December 2013 report which recommended limited federal regulatory involvement in areas such as the development of a uniform agreement on reinsurance collateral requirements, its September 2015 annual report on the insurance industry and its December 2014 report on the role of the global reinsurance market in supporting insurance in the U.S. Furthermore, the director of the FIO is a non-voting member of the multi-agency Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), and the FSOC may, among other things, subject an insurance company or an insurance holding company to heightened prudential standards in accordance with Title I of the Dodd Frank Act following an extended determination process (which can require that such insurance company be subject also to supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System). The Dodd-Frank Act also made small changes to the regulation of credit for reinsurance and surplus lines insurance in the U.S. See Risk Factors in Item 1A of Part I of this report. 

Canada 

Canadian branches of PartnerRe Bermuda and PartnerRe U.S. hold licenses to write reinsurance business in Canada. Each Canadian branch is authorized to insure, in Canada, risks falling within the classes of insurance as specified in their respective licenses and is limited to the business of reinsurance. The Canadian branch of PartnerRe Bermuda is licensed to write life business in Ontario. The Canadian branch of PartnerRe U.S. is licensed to write property and casualty business in Ontario. Each Canadian branch is subject to local regulation for its Canadian branch business, specified principally pursuant to Part XIII of the Insurance Companies Act (the Canadian Insurance Act) applicable to foreign property and casualty companies and to foreign life companies as well as relevant provincial insurance acts. The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, Canada (OSFI) supervises the application of the Canadian Insurance Act. 

PartnerRe Bermuda and PartnerRe U.S. maintain sufficient assets, vested in trust at a Canadian financial institution approved by OSFI, to allow their branches to meet minimum statutory solvency requirements as required by the Act and the regulations made under it. Certain statutory information is filed with federal and provincial insurance regulators in respect of both property and casualty and life business written by branches. This information includes, among other things, a yearly business plan and an annual Dynamic Capital Adequacy Test (DCAT) report from the Appointed Actuary of the branch that tests the adequacy of the assets that are vested under various adverse scenarios. 

Singapore 

The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) regulates insurance and reinsurance companies authorized in Singapore, including PartnerRe Asia and, to a more limited extent, PartnerRe Europe’s Singapore branch. 

PartnerRe Asia is the principal reinsurance carrier for PartnerRe’s business underwritten in the Asia Pacific region, conducting general insurance business as a reinsurer and life insurance business as a reinsurer. PartnerRe Asia has an established operating branch in Labuan which is subject to regulation by the Labuan Financial Services Authority. 

Significant aspects of the Singapore reinsurance regulatory framework and requirements include the following: 

Solvency Requirements: &#32;&#32;As a licensed reinsurer, PartnerRe Asia is required to maintain minimum capital of SGD25 million. In addition, PartnerRe Asia is required to establish and maintain separate insurance funds for each class of business that it carries on for both Singapore and offshore policies. The solvency requirement in respect of each insurance fund shall at all times be not less than the total risk requirement of the fund (determined by reference to three components being insurance risks, asset portfolio risks and asset concentration risks). The MAS is entitled to require that a licensed reinsurer holds assets of a certain type and prescribed value in Singapore. 

Reporting Requirements: &#32;PartnerRe Asia must file and submit annual audited financial statements in accordance with Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (SFRS) and related report to the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) together with an annual return of certain core corporate information. Changes to core corporate information during the year must also be notified to ACRA. These requirements are in addition to the regulatory returns required to be filed annually with the MAS. 

Dividends and Distribution: &#32;Dividends are generally declared from unappropriated profits. The declaration of a dividend by PartnerRe Asia may be subject to relevant conditions and requirements being met as specified under the Insurance Act (Singapore) and its associated regulations. Any proposed reduction of capital or redemption of preference shares requires the prior approval of the MAS. In addition to the above, the laws and initiatives issued by the MAS regarding Corporate Governance, Outsourcings and Technology Risk Management currently impact or may impact Partner Re Asia in the future. 

Other Regulatory Considerations 

Moreover, there are various regulatory bodies and initiatives that impact PartnerRe in multiple international jurisdictions and the potential for significant impact on PartnerRe could be heightened as a result of recent industry and economic developments. In particular, Solvency II, adopted in the European Union effective January 1, 2016, aims to establish a revised set of risk-based capital requirements and risk management standards that will replace the current Solvency I requirements. Solvency II sets out new, strengthened requirements applicable to the entire European Union relating to capital adequacy and risk management for insurers. Other similar measures, such as the International Association of Insurance Supervisors’ (IAIS) announced plans to include a risk-based global insurance capital standard within the common supervision framework it is currently developing, also have the potential for significant impact on PartnerRe. Furthermore, the IAIS has developed policy measures for institutions it designates as globally systemically important insurers (G-SIIs), including enhanced supervision standards, measures to facilitate resolution, and capital requirements to increase loss absorption capacity. 

Taxation of the Company and its Subsidiaries 

The following summary of the taxation of PartnerRe Ltd., PartnerRe Bermuda, PartnerRe Europe, PartnerRe Asia and the PartnerRe U.S. Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively PartnerRe U.S. Companies) is based upon current law. Legislative, judicial or administrative changes may be forthcoming that could affect this summary. Certain subsidiaries, branch offices and representative offices of the Company are subject to taxation related to operations in Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, France, Hong Kong, Ireland, Labuan, Mexico, Singapore, Switzerland and the U.S. The discussion below covers the significant locations for which the Company or its subsidiaries are subject to taxation. 

Bermuda 

PartnerRe Ltd. and PartnerRe Bermuda have each received from the Bermuda Minister of Finance an assurance under The Exempted Undertakings Tax Protection Act, 1966 of Bermuda, that in the event that any legislation is enacted in Bermuda imposing tax computed on profits or income, or computed on any capital asset, gain or appreciation, or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax, then the imposition of any such tax shall not be applicable to PartnerRe Ltd. or PartnerRe Bermuda or to any of their operations or the shares, debentures or other obligations of PartnerRe Ltd. or PartnerRe Bermuda until March 2035. These assurances are subject to the proviso that they are not construed to prevent the application of any tax or duty to such persons as are ordinarily resident in Bermuda (PartnerRe Ltd. and PartnerRe Bermuda are not currently so designated) or to prevent the application of any tax payable in accordance with the provisions of The Land Tax Act, 1967 of Bermuda or otherwise payable in relation to the property leased to PartnerRe Bermuda. 

Canada 

The Canadian life branch of PartnerRe Bermuda and the Canadian non-life branch of PartnerRe U.S. are subject to Canadian taxation on their profits. 

The profits of the Canadian life branch of PartnerRe Bermuda are taxed at the federal level as well as the Ontario provincial level at a total rate that was 26.50% in 2015. The Canadian non-life branch of PartnerRe U.S. is subject to taxation on its profits at the federal level as well as the Ontario and Quebec provincial level at a total rate that was an average of 26.58% in 2015. See also the discussion of taxation in the United States and Ireland below. 

France 

The French branch of PartnerRe Europe is conducting business in and is subject to taxation in France. The 2014 Finance Bill increased the statutory rate of tax on corporate profits in France to 38.0%, effective for 2013 and 2014. The 2015 Finance Bill subsequently extended this measure to 2015. Since January 1, 2016, the tax on corporate profits in France has been 34.43%. See also the discussion of taxation in Ireland below. 

Ireland 

The Company’s Irish subsidiaries, PartnerRe Holdings Europe Ltd., PartnerRe Europe and PartnerRe Ireland Insurance Ltd, conduct business in and are subject to taxation in Ireland. Profits of an Irish trade or business are subject to Irish corporation tax at the rate of 12.5%, whereas profits arising from other than a trade or business are taxable at the rate of 25%. The Swiss, U.S., French and Singapore branches of PartnerRe Europe are subject to taxation in Ireland at the Irish corporation tax rate of 12.5%. However, under Irish domestic tax law, the amount of tax paid in Switzerland, U.S., France and Singapore can be credited or deducted against the Irish corporation tax. As a result, the Company does not expect to incur significant taxation in Ireland with respect to the Swiss, U.S., French and Singapore branches. 

Singapore 

The Company’s Singapore subsidiary, PartnerRe Asia, and the Singapore branch of PartnerRe Europe are subject to corporate taxation in Singapore at the rate of 17% on profits arising from onshore business and 10% on profits arising from offshore business. However, tax exemption may apply to qualifying profits derived from certain lines of business. 

Switzerland 

The Swiss branch of PartnerRe Europe is subject to Swiss taxation, mainly on profits and capital. To the extent that net profits are generated, profits are taxed at a rate of approximately 21%. The branch pays capital taxes at a rate of approximately 0.17% on its imputed branch capital calculated according to a procured taxation ruling. See also the discussion of taxation in Ireland above. 

United States 

PartnerRe U.S. Companies transact business in Canada and in the U.S. and are subject to taxation in the U.S. 

In addition, PartnerRe Europe writes certain U.S. facultative and Latin American business, through its reinsurance intermediaries, PartnerRe Miami Inc. (PartnerRe Miami) in Miami, Florida and PartnerRe Connecticut Inc. (PartnerRe Connecticut) in Greenwich, Connecticut. As a result, PartnerRe Europe is deemed to be engaged in a U.S. trade or business and thus is subject to taxation in the U.S. Finally, PartnerRe Capital Investments Corporation is also a U.S. corporation subject to taxation in the U.S. The current statutory rate of tax on corporate profits in the U.S. is 35%. See the discussion of U.S. branch taxation below and the discussion of taxation in Ireland above. 

On this basis, the Company does not expect that it and its subsidiaries, other than the PartnerRe U.S. Companies and PartnerRe Europe for its U.S. branches (PartnerRe Miami and PartnerRe Connecticut), will be required to pay U.S. corporate income taxes (other than withholding taxes as described below). However, because there is considerable uncertainty as to the activities that constitute a trade or business in the U.S., there can be no assurance that the IRS will not contend successfully that the Company or its non-U.S. subsidiaries are engaged in a trade or business in the U.S. The maximum federal tax rate is currently 35% for a corporation’s income that is effectively connected with a trade or business in the U.S. In addition, U.S. branches of foreign corporations may be subject to the branch profits tax, which imposes a tax on U.S. branch after-tax earnings that are deemed repatriated out of the U.S., for a potential maximum effective federal tax rate of approximately 54% on the net income connected with a U.S. trade or business. 

Foreign corporations not engaged in a trade or business in the U.S. are subject to U.S. income tax, effected through withholding by the payer, on certain fixed or determinable annual or periodic gains, profits and income derived from sources within the U.S. as enumerated in Section 881(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, such as dividends and interest on certain investments. 

The U.S. also imposes an excise tax on insurance and reinsurance premiums paid to foreign insurers or reinsurers with respect to risks located in the U.S. The rate of tax applicable to reinsurance premiums paid to PartnerRe Bermuda is 1% of gross premiums.
