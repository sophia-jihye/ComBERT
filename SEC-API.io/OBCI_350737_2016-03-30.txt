 Item 1. Business 

&#160; 

General : 

&#160; 

We are principally engaged in the manufacturing, marketing and distribution of a broad line of appearance, performance and maintenance products for the marine, automotive, power sports, recreational vehicle and outdoor power equipment markets, under the Star brite&#174; and Star Tron&#174; brand names. We sell these products within the United States of America and Canada. In addition, we produce private label formulations of many of our products for various customers and provide custom blending and packaging services for these and other products. Unless, the context indicates otherwise, we sometimes refer to Ocean Bio-Chem, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries as &#8220;the Company,&#34; &#34;we&#34; or &#34;our.&#8221; 

&#160; 

We also manufacture, market and distribute disinfectant, sanitizing and deodorizing products under the Performacide&#174; and Star brite&#174; brand names, utilizing a patented delivery system for use with products containing chlorine dioxide that is owned by our wholly-owned subsidiary, OdorStar Technology LLC (&#8220;OdorStar&#8221;). The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has accepted labeling for Performacide&#174; claiming effectiveness as, among other things, a virucide against non-enveloped viruses (such as norovirus, rotavirus, adenovirus and poliovirus), as well as other viruses, and a disinfectant against a number of different types of bacteria. 

&#160; 

Ocean Bio-Chem, Inc. was incorporated in 1973 under the laws of the state of Florida. In 1981, we purchased, from Peter G. Dornau and Arthur Spector, the co-founders of the Company, rights to the Star brite&#174; trademark and related products for the United States and Canada. Mr. Dornau, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, has retained rights to these assets with respect to all other geographic areas. Accordingly, products that we manufacture and are sold outside of the United States and Canada are purchased from us and distributed by two companies owned by Mr. Dornau. Net sales to the two companies in 2015 and 2014 totaled approximately $2,075,000 and $1,956,000 or 6.1% and 5.8% of our net sales, respectively. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information. In addition, in 2010 we formed OdorStar with a joint venture partner. We acquired the joint venture partner&#8217;s interest in OdorStar in 2014, as a result of which OdorStar became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. 

&#160; 

Because our operations involve, in all material respects, substantially similar manufacturing and distribution processes, our operations constitute one reportable segment for financial reporting purposes. 

&#160; 

Products : 

&#160; 

The products that we manufacture and market include the following: 

&#160; 

Marine : Our marine line consists of polishes, cleaners, protectants and waxes under the Star brite &#174; brand name, enzyme fuel treatment under the Star Tron &#174; brand name, and private label products.

Our Star Tron&#174; enzyme fuel treatment is designed to eliminate and prevent engine problems associated with fuel containing ethanol. It also increases fuel economy by cleaning the fuel delivery system and facilitating more complete and uniform combustion. In addition, we produce anti-freeze and windshield washes under the Star brite&#174; brand and under private labels for customers. We also produce automotive polishes, cleaners and other appearance items.

Recreational Vehicle/Power Sports : We also market Star Tron&#174; fuel treatment and other specialty products to the recreational &#160; vehicle market, including snow mobiles, all-terrain vehicles and motorcycles. For power sports enthusiasts, Star Tron&#174; provides a viable solution to a number of problems associated with E-10 fuel, which is fuel containing 10% ethanol.

&#160; 

Disinfectants, Sanitizers and Deodorizers: Our line of disinfectant, sanitizing and deodorizing products are marketed under the Performacide &#174; and Star brite &#174; brand names. Performacide &#174; products include disinfectants for hard, non-porous surfaces, air care products for deodorizing and products to eliminate mold and mildew. When used as directed with respect to hard, non-porous surfaces, Performacide &#174; is effective as a virucide against a variety of viruses, including the Ebola virus, Human HIV-1 Virus, and the Influenza-A virus, a disinfectant against a variety of bacteria, a sanitizer against bacteria, including certain types of bacteria causing food borne illnesses, and, in certain applications, as an algaecide and fungicide. We are directing distribution efforts towards the marine and automotive markets, to institutions such as hospitals and schools and to travel and leisure facilities such as hotels and cruise ships. &#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Contract Filling and Blow Molded Bottles : We blend and package a variety of chemical formulations to our customers&#8217; specifications. In addition, we manufacture for sale to various customers assorted styles of both PVC and HDPE blow molded bottles. 

&#160; 

Manufacturing : We produce the majority of our products at the manufacturing facilities of our subsidiary, Kinpak, Inc. (&#34;Kinpak&#34;), in Montgomery, Alabama. In addition, we contract with various third party manufacturers to manufacture some of our products, which are manufactured to our specifications using our provided formulas. Each third party manufacturer enters into a confidentiality agreement with us. 

&#160; 

We purchase raw materials from a variety of suppliers; all raw materials used in manufacturing are readily available from alternative sources. We design our own packaging and supply our outside manufacturers with the appropriate design or packaging. We believe that our internal manufacturing capacity and our arrangements with our current outside manufacturers are adequate for our present needs. 

&#160; 

In the event that arrangements with any third party manufacturer are discontinued, we believe that we will be able to locate substitute manufacturing facilities without a substantial adverse effect on our manufacturing and distribution. 

&#160; 

Marketing and Significant Customers: Our branded and private label products are sold through national retailers such as Wal-Mart, Tractor Supply, West Marine and Bass Pro Shops. Additionally we market our products via online retailers. We also sell to national and regional distributors that resell our products to specialized retail outlets. In the case of Performacide &#174; disinfectant/sanitizing products, we sell to distributors that resell our products, in some cases under private labels, to end users in the home restoration, health care, transportation, law enforcement, and farm and agriculture markets. 

&#160; 

Sales to each of two customers exceeded 10% of our consolidated net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, and constituted an aggregate of approximately 38.2% and 36.0% of consolidated net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Sales to our five largest unaffiliated customers for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 amounted to approximately 49.0% and 47.0% of our consolidated net sales, respectively, and at December 31, 2015 and 2014, outstanding accounts receivable balances from our five largest unaffiliated customers aggregated approximately 39.4% and 36.2% of our consolidated accounts receivable, respectively. 

&#160; 

We market our products through both internal salesmen and external sales representatives who work on an independent contractor commission basis. Our personnel also participate in sales presentations and trade shows. In addition, we market our brands and products through advertising campaigns in national magazines, on television, on the internet, in newspapers and through product catalogs. Our products are distributed primarily from Kinpak&#8217;s manufacturing and distribution facility in Montgomery, Alabama. Since 2008, we have participated in a vendor managed inventory program with one major customer. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information. 

&#160; 

Backlog, seasonality, and selling terms : We had no significant backlog of orders at December 31, 2015. We generally do not give customers the right to return products. The majority of our products is non-seasonal and is sold throughout the year. Normal trade terms offered to credit customers range from 30 to 180 days depending on the nature of the customer. However, at times we offer extended payment terms or discount arrangements as purchasing incentives to customers. These initiatives do not materially affect customary margins. 

&#160; 

Competition : 

&#160; 

Competition with respect to our principal product lines is described below. The principal elements of competition affecting all of our product lines are brand recognition, price, service and the ability to deliver products on a timely basis. 

&#160; 

Marine : We have several national and regional competitors in the marine marketplace. We do not believe that any competitor or small group of competitors hold a dominant market share. We believe that we can increase or maintain our market share through expenditures directed to our present advertising and distribution channels. 

&#160; 

Automotive : There are a large number of companies, both national and regional, that compete with us. Many are more established and have greater financial resources than we do. While our market share is small, the total market size is substantial. We believe that we have established a reasonable market share through our present advertising and distribution channels, considering the large size of this market. 

&#160; 

Recreational Vehicle/Power Sports : We compete with national and regional competitors. We do not believe that any competitor or small group of competitors hold a dominant market share. We believe that we can increase or maintain our market share by utilizing similar advertising and distribution channels to those we use in the marine market. 

&#160; 

Outdoor Power Equipment/Lawn &#38; Garden : We compete with several established national and regional competitors. We do not believe that any competitor or small group of competitors hold a dominant market share. We have attempted to make inroads in this market by emphasizing Star Tron&#174;&#8217;s unique formulation and by increasing our advertising and attendance at trade shows. 

&#160;

&#160; 2 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Disinfectants, Sanitizers and Deodorants : There are a large number of companies that compete with us, many of which are much larger, and have much greater financial resources than we do. We emphasize the effectiveness of chlorine dioxide, coupled with the convenience in application of our Performacide &#174; products. 

&#160; 

Trademarks : We have obtained registered trademarks for Star brite&#174;, Star Tron&#174;, Performacide &#174; and other trade names used on our products. We view our trademarks as significant assets because they provide product recognition. We believe that our intellectual property is protected, but we cannot assure that our intellectual property rights can be successfully asserted in the future or will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. 

&#160; 

Patents : OdorStar owns patents relating to a delivery system for use with products containing chlorine dioxide. The patents expire in 2022. We have encountered difficulty in protecting the patents through litigation. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, &#8220;If we do not utilize or successfully assert intellectual property rights, our competitiveness could be materially adversely affected,&#8221; for additional information. A 2014 adverse judgment in patent litigation that was upheld on appeal in 2015 has limited the scope of protection provided by the patent, and we are unable to predict the long-term effects of the judgment. To date, however, we do not believe the judgment has materially impaired our ability to effectively market and distribute our Performacide &#174; products. 

&#160; 

New Product Development : We continue to develop specialized products for the marine, automotive, recreational vehicle/power sports and outdoor power equipment/lawn and garden markets. Expenditures for new product development have not been significant and are charged to operations in the year incurred. 

&#160; 

Personne l : At December 31, 2015, we had 123 full-time employees. The following table provides information regarding personnel working for the Company and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2015:
