Business Overview 

&#160;

Siebert&#8217;s principal activity is providing online and traditional discount brokerage and related services to retail investors. On November 4, 2014, the Company sold its capital market business to an affiliate, Siebert Brandford Shank Financial, LLC (&#8220;SBSF&#8221;) (see Note B) and on November 9, 2015, sold its 49% membership interest in SBSF (see Note C).

&#160;

The Retail Division 

&#160;

Discount Brokerage and Related Services. Siebert became a discount broker on May 1, 1975. Siebert believes that it has been in business and a member of The New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (the &#8220;NYSE&#8221;) longer than any other discount broker. In 1998, Siebert began to offer its customers access to their accounts through SiebertNet, its Internet website. Siebert&#8217;s focus in its discount brokerage business is to serve retail clients seeking a wide selection of quality investment services, including trading through a broker on the telephone, through a wireless device or via the Internet, at commissions that are substantially lower than those of full-commission firms. Siebert clears its securities transactions on a fully disclosed basis through National Financial Services Corp. (&#8220;NFS&#8221;), a wholly owned subsidiary of Fidelity Investments.

&#160;

Siebert serves investors who make their own investment decisions. Siebert seeks to assist its customers in their investment decisions by offering a number of value added services, including easy access to account information. Siebert&#8217;s representatives are available to assist customers with information via toll-free 800 service Monday through Friday between 7:30 a.m. and 7:30 p.m.

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

Eastern Time. Through its SiebertNet, Mobile Broker, inter-active voice recognition and Siebert Brokerage Express services, 24-hour access is available to customers.

&#160;

Independent Retail Execution Services. Siebert and NFS monitor order flow in an effort to ensure that we are getting the best possible trade executions for customers. Siebert does not make markets in securities, nor does it take positions against customer orders.

&#160;

Siebert&#8217;s equity orders are routed by NFS in a manner intended to afford its customers the opportunity for price improvement on all orders. The firm also offers customers execution services through various electronic communication networks (&#8220;ECNs&#8221;) for an additional fee. These systems give customer&#8217;s access to numerous ECNs before and after regular market hours. Siebert believes that its over-the counter executions consistently afford its customers the opportunity for price improvement.

&#160;

Customers may also indicate online interest in buying or selling fixed income securities, including municipal bonds, corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities, government sponsored enterprises, unit investment trusts or certificates of deposit. These transactions are serviced by registered representatives.

&#160;

Retail Customer Service. Siebert believes that superior customer service enhances its ability to compete with larger discount brokerage firms and therefore provides retail customers, at no additional charge, with personal service via toll-free access to dedicated customer support personnel for all of its products and services. Customer service personnel are located in each of Siebert&#8217;s branch offices. Siebert has retail offices in New York, New York; Boca Raton, Florida; and Beverly Hills, California. Siebert uses a proprietary Customer Relationship Management System that enables representatives, no matter where located, to view a customer&#8217;s service requests and the response thereto. Siebert&#8217;s telephone system permits the automatic routing of calls to the next available agent having the appropriate skill set.

&#160;

Retirement Accounts. Siebert offers customers a variety of self-directed retirement accounts for which it acts as agent on all transactions. Custodial services are provided through an affiliate of NFS, the firm&#8217;s clearing agent, which also serves as trustee for such accounts. Each IRA, SEP IRA, ROTH IRA, 401(k) and KEOGH account can be invested in mutual funds, stocks, bonds and other investments in a consolidated account.

&#160;

Customer Financing. Customer&#8217;s margin accounts are carried through NFS which lends customers a portion of the market value of certain securities held in the customer&#8217;s account. Margin loans are collateralized by these securities. Customers also may sell securities short in a margin account, subject to minimum equity and applicable margin requirements, and the availability of such securities to be borrowed. In permitting customers to engage in margin, short sale or any other transaction, Siebert assumes the risk of its customers&#8217; failure to meet their obligations in the event of adverse changes in the market value of the securities positions. Both Siebert and NFS reserve the right to set margin requirements higher than those established by the Federal Reserve Board.

&#160;

Siebert has established policies with respect to maximum purchase commitments for new customers or customers with inadequate collateral to support a requested purchase. Managers have some flexibility in the allowance of certain transactions. When transactions occur outside normal guidelines, Siebert monitors accounts closely until their payment obligations are completed; if the customer does not meet the commitment, Siebert takes steps to close out the position and minimize any loss. Siebert has not had significant credit losses in the last five years.

&#160;

Information and Communications Systems. Siebert relies heavily on the data technology platform provided by its clearing agent, NFS. This platform offers an interface to NFS&#8217; main frame computing system where all customer account records are kept and is accessible by Siebert&#8217;s network. Siebert&#8217;s systems also utilize browser based access and other types of data communications. Siebert&#8217;s representatives use NFS systems, by way of Siebert&#8217;s technology platform, to perform daily operational functions which include trade entry, trade reporting, clearing related activities, risk management and account maintenance.

&#160;

Siebert&#8217;s data technology platform offers services used in direct relation to customer related activities as well as support for corporate use. Some of these services include email and messaging, market data systems and third party trading systems, business productivity tools and customer relationship management systems. Siebert&#8217;s branch offices are connected to the main offices in New York, New York and Jersey City, New Jersey via a virtual private network. Siebert&#8217;s data network is designed with redundancy in case a significant business disruption occurs.

&#160;

Siebert&#8217;s voice network offers a call center feature that can route and queue calls for certain departments within the organization. Additionally, the systems call manager offers reporting and tracking features which enable staff to determine how calls are being managed, such as time on hold, call duration and total calls by agent.

&#160;

To ensure reliability and to conform to regulatory requirements related to business continuity, Siebert maintains backup systems and backup data. However, in the event of a wide-spread disruption, such as a massive natural disaster, Siebert&#8217;s ability to satisfy the obligations to customers and other securities firms could be significantly hampered or completely disrupted.

The Capital Markets Division 

&#160;

Siebert&#8217;s Capital Markets Group (&#8220;SCM&#8221;) division served the Company as a co-manager, underwriting syndicate member, or selling group member on a wide spectrum of securities offerings for corporations and Federal agencies. The principal activities of SCM were investment banking and institutional equity execution services. SCM provided Muriel Siebert &#38; Co., Inc. high-quality brokerage service to both institutional investors and issuers of equity and fixed-income securities.

&#160;

On November 4, 2014, the Company, which held a 49% membership interest in, and the other members of, Siebert Brandford Shank &#38; Co., LLC (&#8220;SBS&#8221;), contributed their SBS membership interests into a newly formed Delaware limited liability company, Siebert Brandford Shank Financial, L.L.C. (&#8220;SBSF&#8221;), in exchange for the same percentage interests in SBSF. On the same day, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the &#8220;Purchase Agreement&#8221;) with SBS and SBSF, pursuant to which the Company sold substantially all of the SCM assets to SBSF. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, SBSF assumed post-closing liabilities relating to the transferred business.

&#160;

The Purchase Agreement provides for an aggregate purchase price for the disposition of $3,000,000, payable by SBSF after closing in annual installments commencing on March 1, 2016 and continuing on each of March 1, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020. The transferred business was contributed by SBSF to, and operated by SBS. The amount payable to the Company on each annual payment date will equal 50% of the net income attributable to the transferred business recognized by, SBS in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles during the fiscal year ending immediately preceding the applicable payment date; provided that, if net income attributable to the transferred business generated prior to the fifth annual payment date is insufficient to pay the remaining balance of the purchase price in full on the fifth annual payment date, then the unpaid amount of the purchase price will be paid in full on March 1, 2021. The annual installment payable on March 1, 2016 is based on the net income attributable to the capital markets business for the year ended December 31, 2015, amounted to $493,000.

&#160;

Transferred assets of SCM, consisted of customer accounts and goodwill, which had no carrying value to the Company, and the Company recorded a gain on sale of $1,820,000, which reflected the fair value of the purchase obligation. Such fair value was based on the present value of estimated annual installments to be received during 2016 through 2020 from forecasted net income of the transferred business plus a final settlement in 2021, discounted at 11.5% (representing SBS&#8217;s weighted average cost of capital).

&#160;

The discount recorded for the purchase obligation is being amortized as interest income using an effective yield initially calculated based on the original carrying amount of the obligation and estimated annual installments to be received and adjusted in future periods to reflect actual installments received and changes in estimates of future installments. Interest income recognized on the obligation for the year ended December 31, 2015 amounted to $235,000 based on a yield of approximately 12%.

&#160;

Siebert Brandford Shank Financial, LLC 

&#160;

On November 9, 2015, the Company sold its 49% membership investment in SBSF back to SBSF for $8,000,000 of which $4,000,000 was paid in cash and the balance of which was paid in the form of a secured junior subordinated promissory note of $4,000,000 (the &#8220;SBSF Junior Note&#8221;). The sale of the investment in SBSF, which was accounted for by the equity method, represents a strategic shift for the Company based on its significance to the Company&#8217;s financial condition and results of operations and the major effect it will have on the Company&#8217;s operations and financial results and, accordingly, the Company&#8217;s share of operating results of the investment are reflected as discontinued operations in the accompanying statement of operations. The investment was sold for approximately $448,000 less than the carrying value of the investment at November 9, 2015, after adjusting the carrying value of the investment for the Company&#8217;s equity in SBSF&#8217;s results of operations through such date. Such loss is also included in discontinued operations.

SBS Financial Products Company, LLC 

&#160;

Effective April 19, 2005, Siebert Financial Corp. (&#8220;SFC&#8221;) entered into an Operating Agreement with Suzanne Shank and Napoleon Brandford III, the two individual principals (the &#8220;Principals&#8221;) of SBS Financial Products Company, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (&#8220;SBSFPC&#8221;). Pursuant to the terms of the Operating Agreement, SFC and each of the Principals made an initial capital contribution of 33.33% initial interest in SBSFPC. SBSFPC engaged in derivatives transactions related to the municipal underwriting business. SBSFPC closed down operations as of December 31, 2014.

&#160;

Certain risks are involved in the underwriting of securities. Underwriting syndicates agree to purchase securities at a discount from the initial public offering price. An underwriter is exposed to losses on the securities that it has committed to purchase if the securities must be sold below the cost to the syndicate. In the last several years, investment banking firms have increasingly underwritten corporate and municipal offerings with fewer syndicate participants or, in some cases, without an underwriting syndicate.

&#160;

In these cases, the underwriter assumes a larger part or all of the risk of an underwriting transaction. Under Federal securities laws, other laws and court decisions, an underwriter is exposed to substantial potential liability for material misstatements or omissions of fact in the prospectus used to describe the securities being offered.

&#160;

&#160;

Advertising, Marketing and Promotion 

&#160;

Siebert develops and maintains its retail customer base through printed advertising in financial publications, internet advertising and social media. Additionally, a significant number of the firm&#8217;s new accounts are developed directly from referrals by satisfied customers.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

Siebert encounters significant competition from full-commission, online and discount brokerage firms, as well as from financial institutions, mutual fund sponsors and other organizations, many of which are significantly larger and better capitalized than Siebert. Although there has been consolidation in the industry in both the online and traditional brokerage business during recent years, Siebert believes that additional competitors such as banks, insurance companies, providers of online financial and information services and others will continue to be attracted to the online brokerage industry. Many of these competitors are larger, more diversified, have greater capital resources, and offer a wider range of services and financial products than Siebert. Some of these firms are offering their services over the Internet and have devoted more resources to and have more elaborate websites than Siebert. Siebert competes with a wide variety of vendors of financial services for the same customers. Siebert believes that its main competitive advantages are high quality customer service, responsiveness, cost and products offered, the breadth of product line and excellent executions.

&#160;

Regulation 

&#160;

The securities industry in the United States is subject to extensive regulation under both Federal and state laws. The Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) is the Federal agency charged with administration of the Federal securities laws. Siebert is registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC, and is a member of the New York Stock Exchange (&#8220;NYSE&#8221;) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (&#8220;FINRA&#8221;). Much of the regulation of broker-dealers has been delegated to self-regulatory organizations, principally FINRA and national securities exchanges such as the NYSE, which is Siebert&#8217;s primary regulator with respect to financial and operational compliance. These self-regulatory organizations adopt rules (subject to approval by the SEC) governing the industry and conduct periodic examinations of broker-dealers. Securities firms are also subject to regulation by state securities authorities in the states in which they do business. Siebert is registered as a broker-dealer in 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.

&#160;

The principal purpose of regulation and discipline of broker-dealers is the protection of customers and the securities markets, rather than protection of creditors and stockholders of broker-dealers. The regulations to which broker-dealers are subject cover all aspects of the securities business, including training of personnel, sales methods, trading practices among broker-dealers, uses and safekeeping of customers&#8217; funds and securities, capital structure of securities firms, record keeping, fee arrangements, disclosure to

&#160;

- 5 - 

&#160; 

&#160;

clients, and the conduct of directors, officers and employees. Additional legislation, changes in rules promulgated by the SEC and by self-regulatory organizations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules may directly affect the method of operation and profitability of broker-dealers. The SEC, self-regulatory organizations and state securities authorities may conduct administrative proceedings which can result in censure, fine, cease and desist orders or suspension or expulsion of a broker-dealer, its officers or its employees.

&#160;

As a registered broker-dealer and FINRA member organization, Siebert is required by Federal law to belong to the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (&#8220;SIPC&#8221;) which provides, in the event of the liquidation of a broker-dealer, protection for securities held in customer accounts held by the firm of up to $500,000 per customer, subject to a limitation of $250,000 on claims for cash balances. SIPC is funded through assessments on registered broker-dealers. In addition, Siebert, through NFS, has purchased from private insurers additional account protection in the event of liquidation up to the net asset value, as defined, of each account. Stocks, bonds, mutual funds and money market funds are included at net asset value for purposes of SIPC protection and the additional protection. Neither SIPC protection nor the additional protection insures against fluctuations in the market value of securities.

&#160;

Siebert is also authorized by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (the &#8220;MSRB&#8221;) to effect transactions in municipal securities on behalf of its customers and has obtained certain additional registrations with the SEC and state regulatory agencies necessary to permit it to engage in certain other activities incidental to its brokerage business.

&#160;

Margin lending arranged by Siebert is subject to the margin rules of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the NYSE. Under such rules, broker-dealers are limited in the amount they may lend in connection with certain purchases and short sales of securities and are also required to impose certain maintenance requirements on the amount of securities and cash held in margin accounts. In addition, those rules and rules of the Chicago Board Options Exchange govern the amount of margin customers must provide and maintain in writing uncovered options.

&#160;

Net Capital Requirements 

&#160;

As a registered broker-dealer, Siebert is subject to the SEC&#8217;s Uniform Net Capital Rule (Rule 15c3-1) (the &#8220;Net Capital Rule&#8221;), which has also been adopted by the NYSE. The Net Capital Rule specifies minimum net capital requirements for all registered broker-dealers and is designed to measure financial integrity and liquidity. Failure to maintain the required regulatory net capital may subject a firm to suspension or expulsion by the NYSE and FINRA, certain punitive actions by the SEC and other regulatory bodies and, ultimately, may require a firm&#8217;s liquidation.

&#160;

Regulatory net capital is defined as net worth (assets minus liabilities), plus qualifying subordinated borrowings, less certain deductions that result from excluding assets that are not readily convertible into cash and from conservatively valuing certain other assets. These deductions include charges that discount the value of security positions held by Siebert to reflect the possibility of adverse changes in market value prior to disposition.

&#160;

The Net Capital Rule requires notice of equity capital withdrawals to be provided to the SEC prior to and subsequent to withdrawals exceeding certain sizes. The Net Capital Rule also allows the SEC, under limited circumstances, to restrict a broker-dealer from withdrawing equity capital for up to 20 business days. The Net Capital Rule of the NYSE also provides that equity capital may not be drawn or cash dividends paid if resulting net capital would be less than 5 percent of aggregate debits.

&#160;

Under applicable regulations, Siebert is required to maintain regulatory net capital of at least $250,000. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, Siebert had net capital of $8.1 million and $5.1 million, respectively. Siebert claims exemption from the reserve requirement under Section 15c3-3(k)(2)(ii).

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of March 13, 2016, we had approximately 43 full-time employees, one of whom was a corporate officer. None of our employees are represented by a union, and we believe that relations with our employees are good.
