Business. 

Overview 

We are a preclinical stage biopharmaceutical company with a proprietary protein engineering platform, called AMP-Rx, that we apply to the discovery and development of protein therapeutics to treat diseases of the eye. Our therapeutic approach is based on the role of cytokines in diseases of the eye, our understanding of the structural biology of cytokines and our ability to rationally design and engineer proteins to modulate the effects of cytokines. Cytokines are cell signaling molecules found in the body that can have important inflammatory effects. Our most advanced product candidate, which is still in preclinical development, is EBI-031, which we designed, engineered and generated using our AMP-Rx platform and are developing as an intravitreal injection for diabetic macular edema, or DME, and uveitis. In 2015, we initiated the necessary chemistry, manufacturing and control, or CMC, development work and nonclinical safety studies of EBI-031 to support the submission of an investigational new drug application, or IND, to the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. If the results of these efforts and our additional preclinical studies of EBI-031 are favorable, we intend to submit an IND for EBI-031 for the treatment of DME to the FDA in the first half of 2016 for the purpose of conducting clinical trials. We hold worldwide commercialization rights to EBI-031. 

We believe cytokines play a major role in the pathology underlying many eye diseases and that protein therapeutics are an effective means of modulating the effects of cytokines in diseases of the eye. We have used our AMP-Rx platform to rationally design, engineer and generate a pipeline of innovative protein therapeutic candidates that target cytokines we believe are central to diseases of the eye. We are conducting research and development programs directed at ocular diseases, with a current focus on diseases of the back of the eye, such as DME and uveitis. Our EBI-031 program is based on the role that elevated levels of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6, or IL-6, plays in the initiation and maintenance of the inflammation and pain associated with DME and uveitis. 

DME is characterized by an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the macula, the portion of the retina that provides the clearest and most detailed vision, due to leakage from blood vessels in the retina. According to the American Diabetes Association, DME is one of the most common causes of vision loss in the United States. In studies published in the peer reviewed journal &#32;Ophthalmology , IL-6 levels in the eye positively correlated with the severity of DME. According to a presentation at The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology 2012 Annual Meeting, IL-6 levels in the eye positively correlated with resistance to therapies that target a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF. Anti-VEGF therapies are among the current standard of care for the treatment of DME. 

We previously invested a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in the development of our product candidate isunakinra (EBI-005) for the treatment of patients with dry eye disease and allergic conjunctivitis. Notwithstanding this significant investment, based on the negative results from our completed Phase 3 clinical trials in dry eye disease and allergic conjunctivitis, we do not plan to pursue further development of isunakinra. 

Background 

Until recently, ocular therapies generally have been developed based on a limited understanding of the biology underlying the initiation and maintenance of the disease state. As a result, many of the therapies for diseases of the eye were not the result of rational drug design, but instead were ophthalmic formulations of pharmaceuticals, that were originally developed and approved for non-ocular diseases, such as steroids and antihistamines. We believe this limited understanding of the biology of eye diseases impeded the discovery and development of innovative ophthalmic therapeutics. 

Over the past 15 years, researchers have been developing a greater understanding of the key proteins and pathways involved in ocular disease. For instance, the understanding of the protein pathways involved in the retinal disease wet age-related macular degeneration, or wet AMD, has greatly expanded. Wet AMD is characterized by abnormal new blood vessel growth in the back of the eye. By studying the biological processes associated with this abnormal growth, researchers identified the key role that VEGF plays in the initiation and maintenance of wet AMD. This understanding then led to the successful development of VEGF-blockers, such as Lucentis&#174; and Eylea&#174;, as new treatments for wet AMD that have dramatically improved outcomes for many patients. The developers of these VEGF-blockers have created a multi-billion dollar ophthalmic drug market where none existed 10 years ago. We believe that we can apply similar advances in the understanding of other protein pathways involved in eye diseases to the discovery and development of new treatments for these diseases. 

Our Approach 

We apply a rational, biology-based approach to the discovery and development of novel protein therapeutics for patients suffering from eye diseases. Our therapeutic approach is based on the role of cytokines in diseases of the eye, our understanding of the structural biology of cytokines and our ability to rationally design and engineer proteins to modulate the effects of cytokines. 

AMP-Rx is our proprietary platform that we use to design, engineer and generate novel protein therapies that modulate key molecular targets we believe are responsible for the initiation or maintenance of an ocular disease. We begin by analyzing the target and identifying the protein-based approaches we may use to modulate the target. We then generate protein candidates and model protein/target interactions to inform an iterative protein optimization technique. We use this process to modify protein drugs to meet design specifications for improved biological and drug-like properties. We believe that key advantages of the AMP-Rx platform are: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Broad applicability . We can apply the AMP-Rx platform to select among most forms of protein therapeutics, including antibodies, enzymes, soluble receptors and signaling proteins, for the optimal approach to treatment. 

&#8226; 

Efficiency . We use the AMP-Rx platform to optimize multiple properties of drug candidates simultaneously. We generally avoid the time-consuming approach of traditional protein drug discovery that involves sequential screening and selection of product characteristics. 

&#8226; 

Customized drug design . We use the AMP-Rx platform to design and engineer therapeutics that incorporate a range of key pharmaceutical properties, such as rapid onset of effect, increased half-life and improved ocular surface retention. 

&#8226; 

Manufacturability of drug candidates . We use the AMP-Rx platform to generate drug candidates that have favorable manufacturing characteristics, such as high production yield, improved solubility and thermal stability. We believe these characteristics will allow us to minimize costly or difficult production and purification processes. 

Our Strategy 

Our goal is to become a leading biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing novel protein therapeutics to treat diseases of the eye. The key elements of our strategy in support of this goal are to: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Advance EBI-031 for the treatment of diabetic macular edema. Our most advanced product candidate, which is still in preclinical development, is EBI-031, an optimized version of an anti-IL-6 antibody, for the treatment of DME. We are undertaking the necessary CMC development work and nonclinical safety studies to support the submission of an IND to the FDA. If the results of these efforts and our additional preclinical studies of EBI-031 are favorable, we intend to submit an IND in the first half of 2016 for the purpose of conducting clinical trials of EBI-031 for the treatment of DME. 

&#8226; 

Apply AMP-Rx platform to build a pipeline of product candidates for the treatment of eye diseases. We use our AMP-Rx platform to rationally design, engineer and generate a pipeline of innovative protein therapeutic candidates that target cytokines that we believe are central to diseases of the eye. We have designed, engineered and generated EBI-031 and our other preclinical product candidate using our AMP-Rx platform. We plan to continue to apply our platform to expand our product pipeline. 

&#8226; 

Pursue collaborative and other strategic opportunities. We have established a collaboration with ThromboGenics N.V., or ThromboGenics, a European based, publicly held biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative ophthalmic medicines. In this collaboration, we applied our proprietary AMP-Rx platform to design, engineer and generate protein therapeutics that can modulate a specific novel pathway in retinal disease and that may have key pharmaceutical attributes. This collaboration provided us with funding for the specific program that was the subject of the collaboration and allowed us to apply our AMP-Rx platform to a product discovery effort we might not otherwise have pursued. We plan to evaluate opportunities to enter into other collaborations that may contribute to our ability to advance our product candidates and to progress concurrently a range of discovery and development programs. We also plan to evaluate opportunities to in-license or acquire the rights to other products, product candidates or technologies for the treatment of eye diseases. 

Review of Strategic Alternatives 

We are in the process of reviewing a range of strategic alternatives that could result in potential changes to our current business strategy and future operations. As part of this process, we are reviewing strategic alternatives with a goal to maximize shareholder value. We have engaged an investment bank to advise us in this process. As a result of this process, we could determine to: 

&#8226; 

engage in one or more potential transactions, such as the sale of our company, a strategic partnership with one or more parties or the licensing, sale or divestiture of some of our assets or proprietary technologies; or 

&#8226; 

continue to operate our business in accordance with our existing business strategy. 

Pending any decision to change strategic direction, we are continuing our research and development activities in accordance with our existing business strategy while managing our cash position. We cannot provide any commitment regarding when or if this strategic review process will result in any type of transaction and no assurance can be given that we will determine to pursue a potential sale, strategic partnership or licensing arrangement. 

Our Product Development Programs 

We apply our proprietary AMP-Rx platform to the discovery and development of protein therapeutics to treat diseases of the eye. Our therapeutic approach is based on the role of cytokines in diseases of the eye, our understanding of the structural biology of cytokines and our ability to rationally design and engineer proteins to modulate the effects of cytokines. We have generated a product pipeline of innovative protein therapeutic candidates that address ocular diseases that are not well served by current therapies. 

The following table summarizes key information about our product development programs. 

Our Product Candidates 

EBI-031 &#8211; a Novel Inhibitor of the Cytokine IL-6 

Our most advanced product candidate, which is still in preclinical development, is EBI-031. We designed and engineered EBI-031using our AMP-Rx platform to block two forms of IL-6: free IL-6 and IL-6 bound to soluble IL-6 receptor, or IL-6R. We believe the ability of EBI-031 to block these two forms of IL-6 will result in more effective inhibition of IL-6 activity 

compared to other antibodies that block only one of these two forms of IL-6. We are developing EBI-031 as an intravitreal injection for DME and uveitis. 

Diabetic Macular Edema 

DME is characterized by an abnormal accumulation of fluid, in the macula, the portion of the retina that provides the clearest and most detailed vision, due to leakage from blood vessels in the retina. According to the American Diabetes Association, DME is one of the most common causes of vision loss in the United States. In studies published in the peer reviewed journal Ophthalmology , IL-6 levels in the eye positively correlated with the severity of DME. According to a presentation at The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology 2012 Annual Meeting, IL-6 levels in the eye positively correlated with resistance to anti-VEGF therapies, which are among the current standard of care for the treatment of DME. 

While the pathogenesis of DME is not completely understood, there is evidence that the blood vessel leakage, or vascular leak, associated with DME involves components of both angiogenesis, the physiological process through which new blood vessels form from pre-existing blood vessels, and inflammation. VEGF is likely a primary mediator of the &#8220;angiogenic&#8221; vascular leak as VEGF levels are significantly elevated in DME patients, and the disease is often successfully treated by VEGF blockade. There is also evidence that inflammation is a significant driver of DME as leukocyte infiltration, the abnormal intravascular aggregation and clumping of white blood cells, was observed in animal models and human subjects, and corticosteroids successfully reduce edema in many cases. 

Several lines of evidence suggest that IL-6 is a key mediator of both VEGF-mediated and inflammatory vascular leak in DME, through either direct or indirect effects on the internal lining of blood vessels. First, IL-6 is significantly upregulated in the eyes of patients with DME and diabetic retinopathy and its concentration correlates with disease severity. Second, IL-6 promotes leukocyte infiltration in animal models by directly upregulating intercellular adhesion molecule 1, or ICAM-1, and monocyte chemotactic protein 1, or MCP-1, known pathways involved in inflamation. Third, IL-6 blockade reduces cystoid macular edema, an inflammatory edema in patients with uveitis that is often refractory to anti-VEGF therapy. Fourth, IL-6 directly upregulates VEGF in vitro &#32;and in vivo &#32;and blocking IL-6 signaling with tocilizumab, an anti-IL-6 receptor antibody, in rheumatoid arthritis patients reduces circulating VEGF levels to baseline. Fifth, systemic IL-6 blockade is efficacious in animal models of retinal inflammation and angiogenesis. 

The figure below depicts the mechanisms by which IL-6 may play a central role in both directly and indirectly driving the macular edema associated with inflammatory eye diseases such as DME and uveitis. In diabetes, elevated glucose levels serve as a signal which results in the increased production of pro-inflammatory molecules, including IL-6. As described above, increased local and systemic levels of IL-6 can result in an increase in the levels of VEGF, which directly drives vascular leak by signaling through the VEGFR-2 receptor leading to macular edema, as is shown on the left side of the figure. The right side of the figure shows the pro-inflammatory activity of IL-6 and the potential effect on vascular leak, both through the direct mechanism of recruiting inflammatory cells that can destabilize vessel walls leading to edema, as well as destabilizing vessel walls by increasing the activity of a molecule known as angiopoeitin-2, or Ang 2, which antagonizes the receptor Tie-2's signaling through the stabilizing molecule angiopoeitin-1, or Ang 1. 

Uveitis 

Uveitis is a heterogeneous group of ocular conditions that are characterized by inflammation of the middle layer of the eye known as the uvea. Based on prevalence data published in the peer reviewed journal &#32;American Journal of Ophthalmology &#32;and 2010 United States census data, we estimate that approximately 215,000 to 315,000 individuals in the United States suffer from some form of uveitis. According to the peer reviewed journal &#32;British Journal of Ophthalmology , uveitis also accounts for approximately 10% to 15% of cases of blindness in the United States. According to a poster presented by a group from Barcelona, Spain at the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology 2015 Annual Meeting, the IL-6 receptor inhibitor, tocilizumab, administered systemically led to suppression of uveitis and macular edema in the back of the eye of patients whose disease had been refractory to previous treatments. We believe that IL-6 inhibition could be an effective target for treating uveitis and its associated macular edema. 

Preclinical Studies 

The graphs below illustrate the blocking of IL-6 signaling in an in vitro cell-based assay by increasing concentrations of EBI-031 that blocked IL-6 and of a reference anti-IL-6R antibody, tocilizumab, that it also blocked IL-6 signaling. In contrast, tocilizumab blocked signaling of free IL-6 (referred to as cis-signaling, left panel) but did not block signaling of IL-6 bound to soluble IL-6R (referred to as trans signaling, right panel). 

In order to test the effects of an anti-IL-6 antibody in an animal model, we used a rat model of choroidal neovascularization, or CNV. CNV is abnormal new blood vessel formation and growth in the layer of tissue beneath the retina called the choroid. This CNV model uses a laser beam to damage part of the eye near the retina, resulting in an inflammatory and vascular response that we believe is useful for studying the retinal inflammation that occurs in association with DME. CNV is measured by the size of an area of increased blood vessel growth, or an angiogenic area, at 22 days after laser, or day 22. An active treatment in the CNV model reduces the size of the angiogenic area. 

We are unable to test EBI-031 directly in this rat model because EBI-031 only blocks human and non-human primate IL-6. In the rat model of CNV, we used a commercially available goat anti-IL-6 antibody that blocks rat IL-6 as a surrogate for EBI-031. This study compared the goat anti-IL-6 antibody to a goat anti-VEGF antibody that blocks rat VEGF. In this study, we observed a significant reduction in the angiogenic area at day 22 in animals treated with the goat anti-IL-6 antibody compared to animals that received no treatment. The reduction in the angiogenic area at day 22 in rats treated with the goat anti-IL-6 antibody was comparable to the reduction in angiogenic area observed in rats treated with the goat anti-VEGF antibody. 

The figure below presents the reduction in angiogenic area observed at day 22 in rats treated with vehicle, goat anti-VEGF antibody and goat anti-IL-6 antibody. The difference in angiogenic area between rats treated with goat anti-VEGF antibody and vehicle was statistically significant (p=0.0003). The difference in angiogenic area between rats treated with the goat anti-IL-6 antibody and vehicle also was statistically significant (p=0.0005). As the CNV model is a model for inflammation, we believe that this model suggests IL-6 inhibition may reduce the inflammation associated with DME. 

We believe that a significant shortcoming of current treatments of DME is the need for frequent injections of the therapeutic agent, typically anti-VEGF therapy, into the eye. We compared the half-life of EBI-031 to aflibercept, marketed under the 

trademark Eylea, and tocilizumab, marketed under the trademark Actemra, in a standard rabbit model of pharmacokinetics of intravitreal agents. Aflibercept is an anti-VEGF agent approved for the treatment of DME. Anti-VEGF therapies are the standard of care for the treatment of DME. 

The table below shows that EBI-031 remained in the vitreous, the gel-filled center of the eye, nearly twice as long as aflibercept and twice as long as tocilizumab. We believe that the longer half-life, or T 1/2 , &#32;of EBI-031 in the vitreous compared to aflibercept may lead to less frequent injections of EBI-031 than current treatment regimens with aflibercept.

We have also demonstrated the half-life of EBI-031 in the vitreous in a non-human primate study to be approximately 5 days. This compares with historical studies which demonstrated vitreous half-life of anti-VEGF agents to be approximately 2-4 days. 

We have also engineered EBI-031 to be cleared more rapidly from systemic circulation than most antibodies approved for systemic administration in humans. We believe that more rapid clearance from the systemic circulation of an antibody that transits from the eye lowers systemic exposure, which could reduce the risk of side-effects. 

Our Other Product Candidate 

In addition to EBI-031, we have another proprietary product candidate in early preclinical development which is designed to block VEGF. We are developing this product candidate as an intravitreal injection for the treatment of certain retinal diseases, such as wet AMD. We have engineered a series of recombinant VEGF blockers in a manner that we believe could result in longer intravitreal retention. We are initiating animal studies to evaluate the pharmacology of these candidate VEGF blockers. 

We believe there is substantial unmet medical need to reduce the frequency of intravitreal injections of VEGF inhibitors in the treatment of wet AMD, DME, and other posterior eye vascular disorders. Currently, treatments for wet AMD frequently require monthly intravitreal administration, and even when administered as needed, a patient may require an average of seven to eight injections per year. Our goal is to develop a long-acting VEGF pathway blocker that requires four or fewer intravitreal injections per year once the required initial doses are given to address the disease. 

In part leveraging the increasing understanding of the long intravitreal half-life of EBI-031 in rabbit studies, we believe we can utilize similar approaches to create long-lasting VEGF pathway blockers. 

In addition to this product candidate and EBI-031, we are continuing to apply our AMP-Rx platform to generate new product candidates. 

Intellectual Property 

Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our candidate products, technology and know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. We seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other things, filing U.S. and certain foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business, where patent protection is available. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. 

As of March 15, 2016 , we owned or exclusively in-licensed a total of 14 families of patent applications. As of March 15, 2016 , our patent portfolio includes the following patents and applications that we own or, where noted below, license: 

&#8226; 

a Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, patent application covering the IL-6 antibody EBI-031, which, if granted, is expected to expire in 2035; 

&#8226; 

a United States provisional application covering the IL-6 antibody EBI-031 formulation, which, if converted to a nonprovisional application and if granted, is expected to expire in 2036; 

&#8226; 

a United States, a New Zealand, and a South Africa composition-of-matter patent covering isunakinra which expires in 2031; 

&#8226; 

composition-of-matter patent applications covering isunakinra in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Russia, Singapore, and Taiwan, which, if granted, are expected to expire in 2031; 

&#8226; 

patent applications covering the formulation of isunakinra filed in the United States, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, India, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, Singapore, and South Africa, which, if granted, are expected to expire in 2034; 

&#8226; 

patent applications covering methods of manufacturing isunakinra filed in the United States, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Russia and Singapore, which, if granted are expected to expire in 2032; 

&#8226; 

a European patent and pending applications licensed from The Schepens Eye Research Institute, Inc., or Schepens, pursuant to a license that terminates effective April 12, 2016; the Schepens applications are pending in the United States, Australia, Canada and Japan, and, if granted, are expected to expire in 2030; the Schepens applications cover the use of IL-1 inhibitors to treat certain ocular diseases; 

&#8226; 

patent applications covering IL-6 antibody EBI-029, a precursor of EBI-031, filed in the United States, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, Korean, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, Singapore, and South Africa, which, if granted, are expected to expire in 2033; and 

&#8226; 

a PCT patent application covering methods and compositions for increasing the retention of therapeutic agents in the eye which, if granted, is expected to expire in 2035. 

The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are granted. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a non-provisional patent application in the applicable country. In the United States, a patent&#8217;s term may, in certain cases, be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the United States Patent and Trademark Office in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over a commonly owned patent or a patent naming a common inventor and having an earlier expiration date. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration date of a U.S. patent as partial compensation for the length of time the drug is under regulatory review while the patent is in force. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent applicable to each regulatory review period may be extended and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. 

Similar provisions are available in the European Union and certain other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our product candidates, including EBI-031, receive approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on issued patents covering those products, depending upon the length of the clinical trials for each drug and other factors. The expiration dates referred to above are without regard to potential patent term extension or other market exclusivity that may be available to us. 

We may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. 

Collaboration and License Agreement with ThromboGenics, N.V. 

In May 2013, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with ThromboGenics. Under the agreement, we and ThromboGenics are collaborating to identify protein or peptide therapeutics that directly modulate any of a specified set of targets in a novel pathway in retinal disease. We call the therapeutics that are identified, and whose modulation of one of the targets is confirmed, in the course of the collaboration, collaboration products. 

During the term of the agreement, neither we nor ThromboGenics, nor our respective affiliates other than any entities which become affiliates as a result of an acquisition of us or ThromboGenics, are permitted to research, develop, manufacture or commercialize any protein or peptide therapeutic that directly modulates one of the specified targets, except as otherwise provided in the agreement. 

Research and Development Obligations . The initial research term is for a specified number of months from the date we entered into the agreement, but may be extended on mutual agreement. The research is conducted in accordance with a mutually agreed plan and budget. We are responsible for specified non-clinical activities during the research term. ThromboGenics is responsible for all development, manufacturing and commercialization activities with respect to the collaboration products. ThromboGenics is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to research, develop and obtain all necessary regulatory approvals for the collaboration products and, upon receipt of the applicable marketing approval, to commercialize the collaboration products. The initial research term concluded in November 2015. However the parties have agreed to continue the existing Collaboration and License Agreement to provide us the time required to complete additional research activities for no additional consideration. We expect the relevant data to become available in the second quarter of 2016. To date, no collaboration products have been identified. 

Intellectual Property . We and ThromboGenics jointly own any know-how made by or on behalf of either of us in the course of the research and any patent rights claiming such know-how. We call these patent rights and know-how collaboration intellectual property. We have granted ThromboGenics an exclusive, sublicenseable, royalty-bearing license under our rights in these patent rights and know-how, as well as under any other patent rights and know-how that we control during the research term that are necessary for ThromboGenics to perform its obligations to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize collaboration products. 

Financial Terms . In connection with the agreement, ThromboGenics paid us a technology licensing fee of $1,750,000 and is obligated to pay us to perform our activities under the agreement at a set rate per full-time equivalent person working on the collaboration. ThromboGenics also is obligated to make future payments to us of up to an aggregate of $10,000,000 if ThromboGenics achieves specified preclinical and clinical milestones with respect to collaboration products and up to an aggregate of $15,000,000 if ThromboGenics achieves specified regulatory milestones with respect to collaboration products. ThromboGenics is obligated to pay us a low single digit royalty on sales of collaboration products by ThromboGenics, its affiliates or sublicensees. These royalties may be reduced in specified circumstances. ThromboGenics&#8217; obligation to pay us royalties will expire on a collaboration product-by-collaboration product and country-by-country basis on the latest of ten years after the first commercial sale of such compound in such country, the expiration of the patent rights we licensed to ThromboGenics that cover such compound in such country, and the expiration of any data or other regulatory exclusivity for such compound in such country, after which the licenses granted to ThromboGenics will become perpetual and fully paid-up. 

Term and Termination . The agreement expires when all of ThromboGenics&#8217; payment obligations expire. The agreement provides that either party may terminate the agreement in the event of the other party&#8217;s insolvency, bankruptcy or comparable proceedings, or if the other party materially breaches the agreement and does not cure such breach during a specified cure period. We may terminate the agreement if ThromboGenics or any of its affiliates or licensees challenges the patent rights that we licensed to ThromboGenics. The agreement may be terminated by ThromboGenics for convenience by giving us a specified period of notice following the end of the research term. If ThromboGenics terminates the agreement for our breach or bankruptcy, ThromboGenics&#8217; diligence obligations will terminate, the licenses we granted to ThromboGenics will remain in effect on a perpetual basis, and all milestone and royalty obligations of ThromboGenics will be reduced by a specified percentage. 

Manufacturing 

We do not currently own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical quantities of EBI-031 or any other of our product candidates. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of EBI-031 and our other product candidates. We have personnel with the experience to manage the third-party contract manufacturers producing EBI-031 and other products that we may develop in the future. The process for manufacturing EBI-031 has two main stages: drug substance manufacturing and drug product manufacturing, which results in our finished drug product. We currently engage a single third-party manufacturer to provide drug substance of EBI-031 and a second single third-party manufacturer to provide drug product of EBI-031. We obtain these supplies and services on a purchase order basis. The drug substance manufacturing process utilizes a well-established expression system for recombinant protein therapeutics and includes downstream purification steps using readily available materials. The drug product manufacturing process utilizes our proprietary formulation, is conducted with materials that have been utilized in other approved ophthalmic products, and is configured in a single-use glass vial that has also been used for other intravitreal ocular therapeutic products. The manufacturing process and drug product formulation are proprietary to us and were transferred to third-party vendors for the execution of manufacturing. 

Commercialization 

In light of our stage of development, we have not yet established a commercial organization or distribution capabilities. We generally expect to retain commercial rights in the United States for our product candidates for which we may receive marketing approvals and which we believe we can commercialize through a focused, specialty sales force. We expect to utilize a variety of types of collaboration, distribution and other marketing arrangements with one or more third parties to commercialize EBI-031 and any other products that we develop in markets outside the United States. 

We hold worldwide commercialization rights to EBI-031. We believe that specialists in the United States who treat most of DME patients are sufficiently concentrated that if EBI-031 receives marketing approval in the United States we could effectively promote EBI-031 to these specialists with a specialty sales and marketing group. Therefore, we may decide to build our own focused, specialty sales force in order to commercialize EBI-031 in the United States. We intend to enter into strategic collaborations for the development and commercialization of EBI-031 outside of the United States. 

We also plan to build key capabilities, such as marketing, market access, sales management and medical affairs, to implement marketing and medical strategies for any products that we market through our own sales organization and to oversee and support our sales force. The responsibilities of the marketing organization would include developing educational initiatives with respect to approved products and establishing relationships with thought leaders in relevant fields of medicine. 

Competition 

The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technologies, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. 

Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. 

The key competitive factors affecting the success of each of our product candidates, if approved for marketing, are likely to be its efficacy, safety, method of administration, convenience, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. 

Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors&#8217; establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic products. Generic products are currently being used for the indications that we may pursue, and additional products are expected to become available on a generic basis over the coming years. If our product candidates achieve marketing approval, we expect that they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products. 

Government Regulation and Product Approvals 

Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state, and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 

Review and Licensure of Biologics in the United States 

In the United States, the FDA regulates biological products, or biologics, under the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and regulations and guidances implementing these laws. The failure to comply with the PHSA, FDCA and other applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant and/or sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice, or DOJ, or other federal and state governmental entities. 

An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new biologic product in the United States must typically undertake the following: 

&#8226; 

completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA&#8217;s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations; 

&#8226; 

submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must take effect before human clinical trials may begin; 

&#8226; 

approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated; 

&#8226; 

performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed product for each indication; 

&#8226; 

preparation and submission of a BLA to the FDA; 

&#8226; 

review of the product by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable; satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product&#8217;s identity, strength, quality and purity; 

&#8226; 

satisfactory completion of FDA audits of clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data; 

&#8226; 

payment of user fees and securing FDA approval of the BLA and licensure of the new biologic product; and 

&#8226; 

compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, and any post-approval studies required by the FDA. 

Preclinical Studies and an IND 

Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of the purity and stability of the biologic product, as well as in vitro &#32;and animal studies to assess the safety and activity of the product for initial testing in humans and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical studies, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicology and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. 

Human Clinical Studies in Support of a BLA 

Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational biologic product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. 

An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved product candidate to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer an investigational drug to humans. Such authorization must be secured prior to interstate shipment and administration of any new biologic that is not the subject of an approved BLA. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA 

raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. 

In addition to the foregoing requirements, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with the FDA regulations. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institute of Health for public dissemination on their ClinicalTrials.gov website. These requirements are subject to specific timelines and apply to most controlled clinical trials of FDA-regulated products. 

Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined: 

Phase 1: 

The biologic product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness and to determine optimal dosage. 

Phase 2: 

The biologic product is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. 

Phase 3: 

The biologic product is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. 

Post-approval studies may also be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. In addition, IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA for any of the following: serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions; findings from other studies or animal or in vitro &#32;testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the biologic; and any clinically important increase in the case of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor or the data monitoring committee may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB&#8217;s requirements or if the biologic has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted in a BLA. 

Submission of a BLA to the FDA 

Assuming successful completion of required clinical testing and other requirements, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product&#8217;s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting licensure of the biologic product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most BLAs is additionally subject to an application user fee, currently exceeding $2.3 million, and the sponsor of an approved BLA is also subject to annual product and establishment user fees, currently exceeding $114,000 per product and $585,000 per establishment. These fees are typically increased annually. Certain exceptions and waivers are available for some of these fees, such as an exception from the application fee for biologics with orphan designation and a waiver for certain small businesses, and an exception from the establishment fee when the establishment does not engage in manufacturing during a particular fiscal year. 

The FDA conducts a preliminary review of a BLA within 60 days of its receipt and informs the sponsor by the 74 th &#32;day after the FDA&#8217;s receipt of the submission to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept a BLA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for 

filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review process of BLAs. Most such applications are meant to be reviewed within ten months from the date of filing, and most applications for &#8220;priority review&#8221; products are meant to be reviewed within six months of filing. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission. 

The FDA may also refer an application for a biologic product to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 

Compliance with cGMP Requirements 

Before approving a BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in full compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products like biologics whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. 

Manufacturers and others involved in the manufacture and distribution of biologic products must also register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Both domestic and foreign manufacturing establishments must register and provide additional information to the FDA upon their initial participation in the manufacturing process. Any product manufactured by or imported from a facility that has not registered, whether foreign or domestic, is deemed misbranded under the FDCA. Establishments may be subject to periodic unannounced inspections by government authorities to ensure compliance with cGMPs and other laws. Inspections must follow a &#8220;risk-based schedule&#8221; that may result in certain establishments being inspected more frequently. Manufacturers may also have to provide, on request, electronic or physical records regarding their establishments. Delaying, denying, limiting, or refusing inspection by the FDA may lead to a biologic being deemed to be adulterated. 

FDA&#8217;s Decision on a BLA 

Under the PHSA, the FDA may approve a BLA if it determines that the product is safe, pure and potent and the facility where the product will be manufactured meets standards designed to ensure that it continues to be safe, pure and potent. 

On the basis of the FDA&#8217;s evaluation of the BLA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the biologic product with detailed prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction in a resubmission of the BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. 

If the FDA approves a new biologic product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product. It may also require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may call for post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, to further assess the product&#8217;s safety after approval. The agency may also require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the biologic outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patent registries. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. 

Post-Approval Requirements 

Biologics manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and 

distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. 

A biologic product may also be subject to official lot release, meaning that the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release, the manufacturer must submit samples of each lot, together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer&#8217;s tests performed on the lot, to the FDA. The FDA may in addition perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products before releasing the lots for distribution. Finally, the FDA will conduct laboratory research related to the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products. 

In addition, manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biologics are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. 

The FDA may withdraw the license for a biologic if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with the manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 

&#8226; 

restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, suspension of the approval, or complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 

&#8226; 

fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials; 

&#8226; 

refusal of the FDA to approve pending BLAs or supplements to approved BLAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals; 

&#8226; 

product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or 

&#8226; 

injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 

The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Products may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. 

Biosimilars and Exclusivity 

The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which was signed into law on March 23, 2010, included a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA. That Act established a regulatory scheme authorizing the FDA to approve biosimilars and interchangeable biosimilars. To date, one biosimilar product has been approved by the FDA for use in the United States. No interchangeable biosimilars have been licensed under the BPCIA. The FDA has issued several draft guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars. Additional guidances are expected to be finalized by FDA in the near term. 

Under the Act, a manufacturer may submit an application for licensure of a biologic product that is &#8220;biosimilar to&#8221; or &#8220;interchangeable with&#8221; a previously approved biological product or &#8220;reference product.&#8221; In order for the FDA to approve a biosimilar product, it must find that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the reference product and proposed biosimilar product in terms of safety, purity, and potency. For the FDA to approve a biosimilar product as interchangeable with a reference product, the agency must find that the biosimilar product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product, and (for products administered multiple times) that the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. 

Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date of approval of the reference product. The FDA may not approve a biosimilar product until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was approved. Even if a product is considered to be a reference product eligible for exclusivity, another company could market a competing version of that product if the FDA approves a full BLA for such product containing the sponsor&#8217;s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of their product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed &#8220;interchangeable&#8221; by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law. 

Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity 

Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a biologic product as an &#8220;orphan drug&#8221; if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition (generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a biologic product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product). A company must request orphan product designation before submitting a BLA. If the request is granted, the FDA will disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use. Orphan product designation does not shorten the PDUFA goal dates for the regulatory review and approval process, although it does convey certain advantages such as tax benefits and exemption from the PDUFA application fee. 

If a product with orphan designation receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation or for a select indication or use within the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the product will be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve another sponsor's marketing application for the same product for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. Competitors may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity and may obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication. If a product designated as an orphan product ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan product application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity. 

Pediatric Studies and Exclusivity 

Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, a BLA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. With enactment of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, in 2012, sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans prior to the date of review of any application for marketing approval of the product. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the applicant plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests, and other information required by regulation. The applicant, the FDA, and the FDA&#8217;s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other, and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time. 

The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Additional requirements and procedures relating to deferral requests and requests for extension of deferrals are contained in FDASIA. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation. 

Pediatric exclusivity is an additional type of non-patent exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent and orphan product exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if a BLA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA&#8217;s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot accept or approve a biosimilar application. 

Patent Term Restoration and Extension 

A patent claiming a new biologic product may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act, which permits a patent restoration of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review. The restoration period granted is typically one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA, plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the ultimate approval date. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product&#8217;s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple products for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The United States Patent and Trademark Office reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the FDA. 

Review and Approval of Biologics in the European Union 

In order to market any product outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, the company would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. The approval process ultimately varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. 

Clinical Trial Approval in the European Union 

Pursuant to the currently applicable Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC and the Directive 2005/28/EC on Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, an applicant must obtain approval from the competent national authority of the EU Member State in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. If the clinical trial is conducted in different EU Member States, the competent authorities in each of these EU Member States must provide their approval for the conduct of the clinical trial. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial at a specific study site after the competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. 

In April 2014, the EU adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, which is set to replace the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. The new Clinical Trials Regulation will be directly applicable to and binding in all 28 EU Member States without the need for any national implementing legislation. The new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 will become applicable no earlier than May 28, 2016. It will overhaul the current system of approvals for clinical trials in the EU. Specifically, the new legislation aims at simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical trials in the EU. Under the new coordinated procedure for the approval of clinical trials, the sponsor of a clinical trial will be required to submit a single application for approval of a clinical trial to a reporting EU Member State (RMS) through an EU Portal. The submission procedure will be the same irrespective of whether the clinical trial is to be conducted in a single EU Member State or in more than one EU Member State. The Clinical Trials Regulation also aims to streamline and simplify the rules on safety reporting for clinical trials. 

Marketing Authorization in the European Union 

Pursuant to the European Clinical Trials Directive, a system for the approval of clinical trials in the European Union has been implemented through national legislation of the member states. Under this system, an applicant must obtain approval from the competent national authority of a European Union member state in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial after a competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. Clinical trial application must be accompanied by an investigational medicinal product dossier with supporting information prescribed by the European Clinical Trials Directive and corresponding national laws of the member states and further detailed in applicable guidance documents. 

To obtain marketing approval of a product under European Union regulatory systems, an applicant must submit a marketing authorization application, or MAA, either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. 

The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid for all European Union member states. The centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy products and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases. For products with a new active 

substance indicated for the treatment of other diseases and products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients, the centralized procedure may be optional. 

Under the centralized procedure, the CHMP established at the EMA is responsible for conducting the initial assessment of a product. The CHMP is also responsible for several post-authorization and maintenance activities, such as the assessment of modifications or extensions to an existing marketing authorization. Under the centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions of the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. In this circumstance, the EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days. 

The decentralized procedure is available to applicants who wish to market a product in various European Union member states where such product has not received marketing approval in any European Union member states before. The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more other, or concerned, member states of an assessment of an application performed by one member state designated by the applicant, known as the reference member state. Under this procedure, an applicant submits an application based on identical dossiers and related materials, including a draft summary of product characteristics, and draft labeling and package leaflet, to the reference member state and concerned member states. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment report and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state&#8217;s assessment report and related materials, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. 

If a member state cannot approve the assessment report and related materials on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health, the disputed points are subject to a dispute resolution mechanism and may eventually be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states. 

Data and Market Exclusivity in the European Union 

In the European Union, new chemical entities qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. This data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator&#8217;s data to assess a generic, or abbreviated, application for eight years, after which generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator&#8217;s data may be referenced, but not approved for two years. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered to be a new chemical entity and the sponsor is able to gain the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the product if such company can complete a full MAA with a complete database of pharmaceutical test, preclinical tests and clinical trials and obtain marketing approval of its product. 

Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity in the European Union 

Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 and Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000 provide that a product can be designated as an orphan medicinal product by the European Commission if its sponsor can establish that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of: (1) a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in ten thousand persons in the EU when the application is made, or (2) a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the EU and that without incentives the medicinal product is unlikely to be developed. For either of these conditions, the applicant must demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the EU or, if such method exists, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition. 

Once authorized, orphan medicinal products are entitled to ten years of market exclusivity in all EU Member States and, in addition, a range of other benefits during the development and regulatory review process, including scientific assistance for study protocols, authorization through the centralized marketing authorization procedure covering all member countries and a reduction or elimination of registration and marketing authorization fees. However, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication during the ten year period with the consent of the marketing authorization holder for the original orphan medicinal product or if the manufacturer of the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient quantities. Marketing authorization may also be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication if the product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the original orphan medicinal 

product. The period of market exclusivity may, in addition, be reduced to six years if it can be demonstrated on the basis of available evidence that the original orphan medicinal product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. 

Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 

In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Thus, even if a product candidate is approved, sales of the product will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, the product. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication. 

In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable marketing approvals. Nonetheless, product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product candidate could reduce physician utilization once the product is approved and have a material adverse effect on sales, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, a payor&#8217;s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor&#8217;s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. 

The containment of healthcare costs also has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company&#8217;s revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive marketing approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 

Outside the United States, ensuring adequate coverage and payment for a product also involves challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product and may require a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of a product to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in commercialization. 

In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular drug candidate to currently available therapies or so called health technology assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Recently, many countries in the European Union have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the European Union. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various European Union member states, and parallel trade, i.e., 

arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states, can further reduce prices. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any products, if approved in those countries. 

Healthcare Reform 

A primary trend in the United States healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, limiting coverage and reimbursement for drugs and other medical products, government control and other changes to the healthcare system in the United States. 

By way of example, the United States and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the cost of healthcare. In March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the Affordable Care Act, which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and payment for products under government health care programs. Among the provisions of the Affordable Care Act of importance to potential drug candidates are: 

&#8226; 

an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs, although this fee would not apply to sales of certain products approved exclusively for orphan indications; 

&#8226; 

expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer&#8217;s Medicaid rebate liability; 

&#8226; 

expanded manufacturers&#8217; rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum rebate for both branded and generic drugs and revising the definition of &#8220;average manufacturer price,&#8221; or AMP, for calculating and reporting Medicaid drug rebates on outpatient prescription drug prices and extending rebate liability to prescriptions for individuals enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans; 

&#8226; 

addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; 

&#8226; 

expanded the types of entities eligible for the 340B drug discount program; 

&#8226; 

established the Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program by requiring manufacturers to provide a 50% point-of-sale-discount off the negotiated price of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period as a condition for the manufacturers&#8217; outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; 

&#8226; 

a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; 

&#8226; 

the Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB, which has authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program to reduce expenditures by the program that could result in reduced payments for prescription drugs. However, the IPAB implementation has been not been clearly defined. PPACA provided that under certain circumstances, IPAB recommendations will become law unless Congress enacts legislation that will achieve the same or greater Medicare cost savings; and 

&#8226; 

established the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. Funding has been allocated to support the mission of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation from 2011 to 2019. 

Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. For example, in August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2012 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation&#8217;s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment 

centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 

Healthcare Law and Regulation 

Healthcare providers and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with providers, consultants, third-party payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse, anti-kickback, false claims laws, reporting of payments to physicians and teaching physicians and patient privacy laws and regulations and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain business and/or financial arrangements. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include the following: 

&#8226; 

the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid; 

&#8226; 

the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, which prohibit individuals or entities from among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false, ficticious or fraudulent or knowingly making, using or causing to made or used a false record or statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government; 

&#8226; 

the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created additional federal criminal laws that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully for executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters; 

&#8226; 

HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published in January 2013, which impose obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; 

&#8226; 

the federal false statements statute, which prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services; 

&#8226; 

the federal transparency requirements known as the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act, or the Affordable Care Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services, or CMS, within the United States Department of Health and Human Services, information related to payments and other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and 

&#8226; 

analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to healthcare items or services that are reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers. 

Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry&#8217;s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
