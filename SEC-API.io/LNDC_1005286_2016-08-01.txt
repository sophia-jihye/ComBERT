Corporate Overview 

&#160; 

Landec Corporation and its subsidiaries (&#8220;Landec&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) design, develop, manufacture and sell differentiated health and wellness products for food and biomaterials markets. There continues to be a dramatic shift in consumer behavior to healthier eating habits and preventive wellness to improve quality of life. In our Apio, Inc. (&#8220;Apio&#8221;) Packaged Fresh Vegetable business, we are committed to offering healthy, fresh produce products conveniently packaged to consumers. Apio also exports whole fruit and vegetables, predominantly to Asia through its subsidiary, Cal-Ex Trading Company (&#8220;Cal-Ex&#8221;). In our Lifecore Biomedical, Inc. (&#8220;Lifecore&#8221;) biomaterials business, we commercialize products that enable people to stay more active as they grow older. 

&#160; 

Landec&#8217;s Packaged Fresh Vegetables and Biomaterials businesses utilize polymer chemistry technology, a key differentiating factor. Both businesses focus on business-to-business selling such as selling directly to retail grocery store chains and club stores for Apio and directly to partners in the medical device and pharmaceutical markets, with a concentration in ophthalmology for Lifecore. 

&#160; 

Within our two core businesses, Landec has three operating segments &#8211; Packaged Fresh Vegetables, Food Export and Biomaterials, each of which is described below. Financial information concerning each of these segments for fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014 is summarized in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

&#160; 

Apio operates the Packaged Fresh Vegetables business, which combines our proprietary BreatheWay&#174; food packaging technology with the capabilities of a large national food supplier and value-added produce processor which sells products under the Eat Smart&#174; brand to consumers and the GreenLine&#174; brand to foodservice operators, as well as under private labels. In Apio&#8217;s Packaged Fresh Vegetables operations, produce is processed by trimming, washing, sorting, blending, and packaging into bags and trays that in most cases incorporate Landec&#8217;s BreatheWay membrane technology. The BreatheWay membrane increases shelf-life and reduces shrink (waste) for retailers and helps to ensure that consumers receive fresh produce by the time the product makes its way through the supply chain. Apio also generates revenue from the sale and/or use of its BreatheWay technology by partners such as Chiquita Brands International, Inc. (&#8220;Chiquita&#8221;) for packaging and distribution of bananas and berries and Windset Holding 2010 Ltd., a Canadian corporation (&#8220;Windset&#8221;), for packaging of greenhouse grown cucumbers and peppers, and to Juicero, Inc. (&#8220;Juicero&#8221;) innovator of the first in-home cold-press fruit and vegetable juicing system. Juicero is using BreatheWay membranes to extend the shelf-life of packets of fresh fruit and vegetables. 

&#160; 

Apio also operates the Food Export business. The Food Export business purchases and sells whole fruit and vegetable commodities predominantly to Asian markets. 

&#160; 

Lifecore operates our Biomaterials business and is principally involved in the development and manufacture of pharmaceutical-grade sodium hyaluronate (&#8220;HA&#8221;) products and aseptic contract manufacturing. Sodium hyaluronate is a naturally occurring polysaccharide that is widely distributed in the extracellular matrix in animals and humans. Based upon Lifecore&#8217;s expertise working with highly viscous HA, the Company specializes in fermentation and aseptic filling services, as a contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO), for difficult to handle (viscous) medicines filled in finished dose syringes. 

&#160; 

Landec was incorporated in California on October 31, 1986 and reincorporated as a Delaware corporation on November 6, 2008. Our common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol &#8220;LNDC&#8221;. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Technology Overview 

&#160; 

The Company has two proprietary polymer technology platforms: 1) Intelimer&#174; materials, which are the key technology behind our BreatheWay membrane technology, and 2) hyaluronan biopolymers. The Company&#8217;s materials are generally proprietary as a result of being patented or due to being specially formulated for specific customers to meet specific commercial applications and/or specific regulatory requirements. The Company&#8217;s polymer technologies, customer relationships, trade names and strong channels of distribution are the foundation and key differentiating advantages on which Landec has built its business. 

&#160; 

A) Intelimer Polymers 

&#160; 

Intelimer polymers are crystalline, hydrophobic polymers that use a temperature switch to control and modulate properties such as viscosity, permeability and adhesion when varying the materials&#8217; temperature above and below the temperature switch. The sharp temperature switch is adjustable at relatively low temperatures (0&#176; C to 100&#176; C) and the changes resulting from the temperature switch are relatively easy to maintain in industrial and commercial environments. For instance, Intelimer polymers can change within the range of one or two degrees Celsius from a non-adhesive state to a highly tacky, adhesive state; from an impermeable state to a highly permeable state; or from a solid state to a viscous liquid state. 

&#160; 

Landec&#39;s proprietary polymer technology is based on the structure and phase behavior of Intelimer materials. The abrupt thermal transitions of specific Intelimer materials are achieved through the controlled use of hydrocarbon side chains that are attached to a polymer backbone. Below a pre-determined switch temperature, the polymer&#39;s side chains align through weak hydrophobic interactions resulting in a crystalline structure. When this side chain crystallizable polymer is heated to, or above, this switch temperature, these interactions are disrupted and the polymer is transformed into an amorphous, viscous state. Because this transformation involves a physical and not a chemical change, this process can be repeatedly reversible. Landec can set the polymer switch temperature anywhere between 0&#176; C to 100&#176; C by varying the average length of the side chains. 

&#160; 

Landec&#39;s Intelimer materials are readily available and are generally synthesized from long side-chain acrylic monomers that are derived primarily from natural materials such as coconut and palm oils that are highly purified and designed to be manufactured economically through known synthetic processes. These acrylic-monomer raw materials are then polymerized by Landec leading to many different side-chain crystallizable polymers whose properties vary depending upon the initial materials and the synthetic process. Intelimer materials can be made into many different forms, including films, coatings, microcapsules and discrete forms. Intelimer polymers are the coatings on the substrate used to form our BreatheWay membranes. 

&#160; 

BreatheWay Membrane Packaging &#160; 

&#160; 

Certain types of fresh-cut and whole produce can spoil or discolor rapidly when packaged in conventional packaging materials and, therefore, are limited in their ability to be distributed broadly to markets. The Company&#8217;s proprietary BreatheWay packaging technology utilizes Landec&#8217;s Intelimer polymer technology to naturally extend the shelf-life and quality of fresh-cut and whole produce. 

&#160; 

After harvesting, vegetables and fruit continue to respire, consuming oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide. Too much or too little oxygen can result in premature spoilage and decay. The respiration rate of produce varies for each fruit and vegetable. Conventional packaging films used today, such as polyethylene and polypropylene, can be made with modest permeability to oxygen and carbon dioxide, but often do not provide the optimal atmosphere for the packaged produce. To achieve optimal product performance, each fruit or vegetable requires its own unique package atmosphere conditions. The challenge facing the industry is to develop packaging that meets the highly variable needs that each product requires in order to achieve value-creating performance. The Company believes that its BreatheWay packaging technology possesses all of the critical functionalities required to serve this diverse market. In creating a product package, a BreatheWay membrane is applied over a small cutout section or an aperture of a flexible film bag or plastic tray. This highly permeable &#8220;window&#8221; acts as the mechanism to provide the majority of the gas transmission requirements for the entire package. These membranes are designed to provide three principal benefits: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

High Permeability. Landec&#39;s BreatheWay packaging technology is designed to permit transmission of oxygen and carbon dioxide at 300 to 1,000 times the rate of conventional packaging films. The Company believes that these higher permeability levels will facilitate the packaging diversity required to market many types of fresh-cut and whole produce in many package sizes and configurations. 

&#160; 

Ability to Adjust Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide Ratios. BreatheWay packaging can be tailored with carbon dioxide to oxygen transfer ratios ranging from 1.0 to 12.0 to selectively transmit oxygen and carbon dioxide at optimum rates to sustain the quality and shelf-life of packaged produce. Other high permeability packaging materials, such as micro-perforated films cannot differentially control carbon dioxide permeability, resulting in sub-optimal package atmosphere conditions for many produce products. 

&#160; 

Temperature Responsiveness. Landec has developed breathable membranes that can be designed to increase or decrease permeability in response to environmental temperature changes. The Company has developed packaging that responds to higher oxygen requirements at elevated temperatures, but is also reversible, and returns to its original state as temperatures decline. As the respiration rate of fresh produce also increases with temperature, the BreatheWay membrane&#8217;s temperature responsiveness allows packages to compensate for the change in produce respiration by automatically adjusting gas permeation rates. By doing so, detrimental package atmosphere conditions are avoided and improved quality is maintained through the distribution chain. 

&#160; 

B) Sodium Hyaluronate (HA) 

&#160; 

Sodium hyaluronate is a non-crystalline, hydrophilic polymer that exists naturally as part of the extracellular matrix in many tissues within the human body, most notably within the aqueous humor of the eye, synovial fluid, skin and umbilical cord. The viscoelastic properties and water solubility of HA make it ideal for medical applications where space maintenance, lubricity or tissue protection are critical. Because of its widespread presence in tissues, its critical role in normal physiology, and its high degree of biocompatibility, the Company believes that hyaluronan will continue to be used in existing applications and for an increasing variety of other medical applications. 

&#160; 

Sodium hyaluronate can primarily be produced in two ways, either through bacterial fermentation or through extraction from rooster combs. Lifecore produces HA only from fermentation, using an extremely efficient microbial fermentation process and a highly effective purification operation. 

&#160; 

Sodium hyaluronate was first demonstrated to have commercial medical utility as a viscoelastic solution in cataract surgery. In this application, it is used for maintaining the space in the anterior chamber and protecting corneal tissue during the removal and implantation of intraocular lenses. The first ophthalmic HA product, produced by extraction from rooster comb tissue, became commercially available in the United States in 1981. In 1985, Lifecore introduced the bacterial fermentation process to manufacture premium HA and received patent protection until 2002. HA-based products, produced either by rooster comb extraction or by fermentation processes such as Lifecore&#8217;s, have since gained widespread acceptance in ophthalmology and are currently used in the majority of cataract extraction procedures in the world. HA has also become a significant component in several products used in orthopedics. Lifecore&#8217;s HA is used as a viscous carrier for allogeneic freeze-dried demineralized bone used in spinal surgery, and as the active component of devices to treat the symptoms of osteoarthritis, and as a component to provide increased lubricity to medical devices. Lifecore&#8217;s HA has also been utilized in veterinary drug applications to treat traumatic arthritis. 

&#160; 

Description of Business Segments 

&#160; 

In this Description of Business Segments section, &#8220;Apio&#8221; and the &#8220;Packaged Fresh Vegetables business&#8221; will be used interchangeably; however, when describing Apio&#8217;s export business it will be referred to as the &#8220;Food Export business&#8221;. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

A) Packaged Fresh Vegetables Business 

&#160; 

The Packaged Fresh Vegetables business had revenues of $424 million for the fiscal year ended May 29, 2016, $430 million for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2015 and $361 million for the fiscal year ended May 25, 2014. 

&#160; 

Based in Guadalupe, California, Apio&#8217;s primary business is fresh-cut and whole vegetable products typically packaged in our proprietary BreatheWay packaging. Apio&#8217;s Packaged Fresh Vegetables business markets a variety of fresh-cut and whole vegetables and salad kit products to retail grocery chains, club stores and food service operators. During the fiscal year ended May 29, 2016, Apio shipped approximately 30 million cartons of produce to its customers throughout North America, primarily in the United States. 

&#160; 

Most vegetable products packaged in our BreatheWay packaging have approximately a 17 day shelf-life. In addition to packaging innovation, Apio has developed innovative blends and combinations of vegetables that are sold in flexible film bags or rigid trays. More recently, Apio has launched a family of salad kits that are comprised of &#8220;superfood&#8221; mixtures of vegetables with healthy toppings and dressings. The first salad kit to launch under our Eat Smart&#174; brand was Sweet Kale Salad, which now has wide distribution throughout club and retail stores in North America. Additionally, we have launched under our Eat Smart brand several other superfood salad kits including Ginger Bok Choy, Wild Greens and Quinoa, Beets and Greens, Southwest Salad and Asian Sesame. The Company&#8217;s expertise includes accessing leading culinary experts and nutritionists nationally to help in the new product development process. We believe that our new products are &#8220;on trend&#8221; and strong market acceptance supports this belief. Recent statistics show that more than two-thirds of adults are considered to be overweight or obese and more than one-third of adults are considered to be obese . More and more consumers are beginning to make better food choices in their schools, homes and in restaurants and that is where our superfood products can fit into consumers&#8217; daily healthy food choices. 

&#160; 

In addition to proprietary packaging technology and a strong new product development pipeline, the Company has strong channels of distribution throughout North America with retail grocery store chains and club stores. Landec has one or more of its products in approximately 60% of all retail and club store sites in North America giving us a strong platform for introducing new products. 

&#160; 

The Company sells its products under its nationally-known brand Eat Smart to retail and club and its GreenLine&#174; brand to foodservice operators. The Company also periodically licenses its BreatheWay packaging technology to partners such as Chiquita for packaging bananas and berries and Windset for packaging peppers and cucumbers that are grown hydroponically in greenhouses. The Company also licenses its BreatheWay technology to Juicero to extend the shelf-life of packets of fresh produce for use in a countertop juicing system. These packaging license relationships generate revenues either from product sales or royalties once commercialized. The Company is engaged in the testing and development of other BreatheWay products. Landec manufactures its BreatheWay packaging through selected qualified contract manufacturers. 

&#160; 

Apio Business Model 

&#160;&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Apio delivers its products to leading club stores, retail grocery chains and food service operators throughout North America. The Company believes it will have growth opportunities for the next several years through new customers, the introduction of innovative products and expansion of its existing customer relationships. 

&#160; 

There are four major distinguishing characteristics of Apio that provide competitive advantages in the Packaged Fresh Vegetables market: 

&#160; 

Packaged Vegetables Supplier: Apio has structured its business as a marketer and seller of branded and private label blended, fresh-cut and whole vegetable products. It is focused on selling products primarily under its Eat Smart brand, with some sales under its GreenLine brand and private label brands. As retail grocery chains, club stores and food service operators consolidate, Apio is well positioned as a single source of a broad range of products. 

&#160; 

Nationwide Processing and Distribution: Apio has strategically invested in its Packaged Fresh Vegetables business. Apio&#8217;s largest processing plant is in Guadalupe, CA, and is automated with state-of-the-art vegetable processing equipment in one of the lowest cost, growing regions in California, the Santa Maria Valley. With the acquisition of GreenLine in 2012, Apio added three East Coast processing facilities and five East Coast distribution centers for nationwide delivery of all of its packaged vegetable products in order to meet the next-day delivery needs of customers. 

&#160; 

Expanded Product Line Using Technology and Unique Blends: Apio, through the use of its BreatheWay packaging technology, is introducing new packaged vegetable products each year. These new product offerings range from various sizes of fresh-cut bagged products, to vegetable trays, to whole produce, to vegetable salads and to snack packs. During the last twelve months, Apio has introduced nine new unique products. 

&#160; 

Products Currently in Approximately 60% of U.S. Retail Grocery Stores: Apio has products in approximately 60% of all North American retail grocery stores. This gives Apio the opportunity to sell new products to existing customers and to increase distribution of its approximately 120 unique products within those customers. 

&#160; 

Windset 

&#160; 

The Company believes that hydroponically-grown produce using Windset&#8217;s (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Company&#8217;s investment in Windset) know-how and growing practices will result in higher yields with competitive growing costs that will provide dependable year-round supply to Windset&#8217;s customers. In addition, the produce grown in Windset&#8217;s greenhouses uses significantly less water than field grown crops and has a very high safety profile as no soil is used in the growing process. Windset owns and operates greenhouses in British Columbia, Canada and in Nevada and California. In addition to growing produce in its own greenhouses, Windset has numerous marketing arrangements with other greenhouse growers and utilizes buy/sell arrangements to meet fluctuation in demand from their customers. 

&#160; 

B) Food Export Business 

&#160; 

Food Export revenues consist of revenues generated from the purchase and sale of primarily whole commodity fruit and vegetable products to Asia through Apio&#8217;s export business, Cal-Ex. The Food Export business is a commission-based buy/sell business that typically realizes a gross margin in the 5-10% range. 

&#160; 

The Food Export business had revenues of $64 million for the fiscal year ended May 29, 2016, $68 million for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2015 and $70 million for the fiscal year ended May 25, 2014. 

&#160; 

Apio is strategically positioned with Cal-Ex to benefit from the growing population and wealth in Asia and other parts of the world over the next decade. Through Cal-Ex, Apio is currently one of the largest U.S. exporters of broccoli to Asia. Other large export items include apples, grapes, stonefruit and citrus. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

C) Biomaterials Business 

&#160; 

Our Biomaterials business operates through our Lifecore subsidiary. Lifecore had revenues of $50 million for the fiscal year ended May 29, 2016, $40 million for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2015 and $46 million for the fiscal year ended May 24, 2014. 

&#160; 

Lifecore is principally involved in the manufacture of pharmaceutical-grade sodium hyaluronate in the form of injectable products for ophthalmologic and orthopedic applications. There is now a greater percentage of Americans age 65 and older than at any other time in U.S. history and currently over 46 million Americans are 65 years of age or older and this trend is expected to accelerate dramatically in the upcoming years. As our population ages, eye surgeries, such as cataract surgeries, will increase, and other patients will increasingly seek joint therapy as cartilage and soft tissue deteriorates. HA injections are a primary course of treatment for such conditions and Lifecore has built a leadership position in the markets it serves. The World Health Organization estimates that by 2020, 32 million cataract operations will be performed worldwide, up from 12 million in 2000. Lifecore&#8217;s expertise includes its ability to ferment, separate, purify, and aseptically fill HA for injectable product use. In addition to ophthalmic and orthopedic uses, veterinary medicine is another application for Lifecore&#8217;s HA. Lifecore leverages its fermentation process to manufacture premium, pharmaceutical-grade HA and uses its aseptic filling capabilities to also deliver private-labeled HA finished products to its customers. Lifecore sells its products through partners in the U.S., Europe and South America. Lifecore has built its reputation as a premium supplier of HA and more recently as a specialty contract development and manufacturing organization (&#8220;CDMO&#8221;). 

&#160; 

Lifecore&#8217;s products are primarily sold to strategic marketing partners for use in three medical areas: (1) Ophthalmic, (2) Orthopedic and (3) Other/Non-HA products. In addition, Lifecore provides product development services to its partners for HA-based, as well as non-HA based, aseptically formulated products. These services include activities such as technology transfer, material component changes, analytical method development, pilot studies, stability studies, process validation, and clinical production of materials for clinical studies. 

&#160; 

By leveraging its fermentation process and aseptic formulation and filling expertise, Lifecore has become a leader in the supply of HA-based products for multiple applications, and has taken advantage of non-HA device and drug opportunities by leveraging its expertise in manufacturing and aseptic syringe filling capabilities. Elements of Lifecore&#8217;s strategy include the following: 

&#160; 

&#8226; Establish strategic relationships with market leaders. Lifecore will continue to develop applications for products with partners who have strong marketing, sales and distribution capabilities to end-user markets. Through its strong reputation and history of providing pharmaceutical grade HA products, Lifecore has been able to establish long-term relationships with the market leading ophthalmic surgical companies, and leverages those partnerships to attract new relationships in other medical markets. 

&#160; 

&#8226; Expand medical applications for HA . Due to the growing knowledge of the unique characteristics of HA, and the role it plays in normal physiology, Lifecore continues to identify and pursue opportunities for the use of HA in other medical applications, such as wound care, aesthetic surgery, drug delivery, device coatings and through pharmaceutical sales to academic and corporate research customers. Further applications may involve expanding process development activity and/or additional licensing of technology. 

&#160; 

&#8226; Utilize manufacturing infrastructure to pursue contract aseptic filling and fermentation opportunities. Lifecore has made strategic capital investments in its contract manufacturing and development business focusing on extending its aseptic filling capacity and capabilities. It is investing in this segment to meet increasing partner demand and attract new contract filling opportunities outside of HA markets. Lifecore is using its manufacturing capabilities to provide contract manufacturing and development services to its partners in the area of sterile pre-filled syringes, as well as, fermentation and purification requirements. 

&#160; 

&#8226; Maintain flexibility in product development and supply relationships. Lifecore&#8217;s vertically integrated development and manufacturing capabilities allow it to establish a variety of contractual relationships with global corporate partners. Lifecore&#8217;s role in these relationships extends from supplying HA raw materials to providing technology transfer and development services to manufacturing aseptically-packaged, finished sterile products and to assuming full supply chain responsibilities. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Trademarks/Trade names 

&#160; 

Intelimer&#174;, Landec&#174;, Apio&#8482;, Eat Smart&#174;, BreatheWay&#174;, GreenLine&#174;, Clearly Fresh&#8482;, Lifecore&#174;, LUROCOAT &#174; and Ortholure&#8482; are some of the trademarks or registered trademarks and trade names of the Company in the United States and other countries. This Annual Report on Form 10-K also refers to the trademarks of other companies. 

&#160; 

Sales and Marketing 

&#160; 

Apio is supported by dedicated sales and marketing resources. Apio has 41 sales and marketing employees, located in central California and throughout the U.S., supporting the Packaged Fresh Vegetables business and the Food Export businesses. During fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, sales to the Company&#8217;s top five customers accounted for approximately 45%, 46% and 42%, respectively, of its revenues. The Company&#8217;s top two customers, both from the Packaged Fresh Vegetables segment, were Costco Wholesale Corporation (&#8220;Costco&#8221;) which accounted for approximately 20%, 21%, and 21%, respectively, and Wal-mart, Inc. (&#8220;Wal-mart&#8221;) which accounted for approximately 12%, 11%, and 11%, respectively, of the Company&#8217;s revenues. A loss of either of these customers would have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business. 

&#160; 

Lifecore sells products to partners under supply agreements and also through distribution agreements. Excluding research sales, Lifecore does not sell to end users and, therefore, does not have the traditional infrastructure of a dedicated sales force and marketing employees. It is Lifecore&#8217;s name recognition that allows it to attract new customers and offer its services with a minimal marketing and sales infrastructure. 

&#160; 

Seasonality 

&#160; 

Apio&#8217;s sales are seasonal. The Packaged Fresh Vegetables business can be affected by seasonal weather factors, such as the high cost of sourcing product due to a shortage of essential produce items, which had a severe impact on the Company&#8217;s results during fiscal year 2016. The Food Export business also typically recognizes a much higher percentage of its revenues and profit during the first half of Landec&#8217;s fiscal year compared to the second half. The Biomaterial&#8217;s business is not significantly affected by seasonality. 

&#160; 

Manufacturing and Processing 

&#160; 

Packaged Fresh Vegetables Business 

&#160; 

The manufacturing process for the Company&#39;s proprietary BreatheWay packaging products is comprised of polymer manufacturing, membrane manufacturing and label package conversion. A third-party toll manufacturer currently makes virtually all of the polymers for the BreatheWay packaging system. Select outside contractors currently manufacture the breathable membranes, and Apio performs the label package conversion in its various processing facilities. 

&#160; 

Apio processes a large majority of its packaged fresh vegetable products in its processing facility located in Guadalupe, California. Cooling of produce is done through third parties and Apio Cooling, LP, a separate consolidated subsidiary in which Apio has a 60% ownership interest and is the general partner. 

&#160; 

Apio processes its fresh-cut, packaged green bean products in four processing plants located in Guadalupe, California; Bowling Green, Ohio; Hanover, Pennsylvania; and Vero Beach, Florida. 

&#160; 

Biomaterials Business 

&#160; 

The commercial production of HA by Lifecore requires fermentation, separation and purification and aseptic processing capabilities. Products are supplied in a variety of bulk and single dose configurations. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Lifecore produces its HA through a bacterial fermentation process. Medical grade HA was initially commercially available only through an extraction process from rooster combs. Lifecore believes that the fermentation manufacturing approach is superior to rooster comb extraction because of negativity surrounding animal-sourced materials, greater efficiency and flexibility, a more favorable long-term regulatory environment, and better economies of scale in producing large commercial quantities. Today&#8217;s HA competitors are primarily utilizing a fermentation process. 

&#160; 

Lifecore&#8217;s facilities in Chaska, Minnesota are used primarily for the HA manufacturing process, formulation, aseptic syringe and bulk filling, secondary packaging, and warehousing raw materials and finished goods. The Company considers that the current inventory on-hand, together with its manufacturing capacity, will be sufficient to allow it to meet the needs of its current customers for the foreseeable future. 

&#160; 

Lifecore provides versatility in the manufacturing of various types of finished products. It supplies several different forms of HA in a variety of molecular weight fractions as powders, solutions and gels, and in a variety of bulk and single-use finished packages. Lifecore continues to conduct development work designed to improve production efficiencies and expand its capabilities to achieve a wider range of HA product specifications in order to address the broadening opportunities for using HA in medical applications. 

&#160; 

The FDA inspects the Company&#8217;s manufacturing systems periodically and requires compliance with the FDA&#8217;s Quality System Regulation (&#8220;QSR&#8221;) and its current Good Manufacturing Practices (&#8220;GMP&#8221;) regulations, as applicable. In addition, Lifecore&#8217;s customers conduct intensive quality audits of the facility and its operations. Lifecore also periodically contracts with independent regulatory consultants to conduct audits of its operations. Similar to other manufacturers subject to regulatory and customer specific requirements, Lifecore&#8217;s facility was designed to meet applicable regulatory requirements and has been cleared for the manufacturing of both device and pharmaceutical products. The Company maintains a Quality System which complies with applicable standards and regulations: FDA Medical Device Quality System requirements (21 CFR 820); FDA Drug Good Manufacturing Practices (21 CFR 210-211); European Union Good Manufacturing Practices (EudraLex Volume 4); Medical Device Quality Management System (ISO 13485); European Medical Device Directive; Canadian Medical Device Regulations; International Guide for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (ICH Q7), and Australian Therapeutic Goods Regulations). Compliance with these international standards of quality greatly assists in the marketing of Lifecore&#8217;s products globally. 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

Several of the raw materials used in manufacturing certain of the Company&#8217;s products are currently purchased from a single source. Although to date the Company has not experienced difficulty acquiring materials for the manufacture of its products, no assurance can be given that interruptions in supplies will not occur in the future, that the Company will be able to obtain substitute vendors, or that the Company will be able to procure comparable materials at similar prices and terms within a reasonable time. Any such interruption of supply could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s ability to manufacture and distribute its products and, consequently, could materially and adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, operating results and financial condition. 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

Landec is focusing its research and development resources on both existing and new product applications. Expenditures for research and development for the fiscal years ended May 29, 2016, May 31, 2015 and May 25, 2014 were $7.2 million, $7.0 million and $7.2 million, respectively. Research and development expenditures funded by corporate or governmental partners were zero during fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014. The Company may seek funds for applied materials research programs from U.S. government agencies as well as from commercial entities. The Company anticipates that it will continue to incur significant research and development expenditures in order to maintain its competitive position with a continuing flow of innovative, high-quality products and services. As of May 29, 2016, Landec had 67 employees engaged in research and development with experience in polymer and analytical chemistry, product application, product formulation, and mechanical and chemical engineering.

Competition 

&#160; 

The Company operates in highly competitive and rapidly evolving segments, and new developments are expected to continue at a rapid pace. Competition from large food processors, packaging companies, and medical and pharmaceutical companies is intense. Many of these competitors have substantially greater financial and technical resources and production and marketing capabilities than the Company, and many have substantially greater experience in conducting field trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and manufacturing and marketing commercial products. There can be no assurance that these competitors will not succeed in developing alternative technologies and products that are more effective, easier to use or less expensive than those which have been or are being developed by the Company or that would render the Company&#39;s technology and products obsolete and non-competitive. 

&#160; 

Patents and Proprietary Rights 

&#160; 

The Company&#39;s success depends in large part on its ability to obtain patents, maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties. The Company has had 50 U.S. patents issued of which 33 remain active as of May 29, 2016 with expiration dates ranging from 2016 to 2031. There can be no assurance that any of the pending patent applications will be approved, that the Company will develop additional proprietary products that are patentable, that any patents issued to the Company will provide the Company with competitive advantages, will not be challenged by any third parties or that the patents of others will not prevent the commercialization of products incorporating the Company&#39;s technology. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop similar products, duplicate any of the Company&#39;s products or design around the Company&#39;s patents. Any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#39;s business, operating results and financial condition. 

&#160; 

The commercial success of the Company will also depend, in part, on its ability to avoid infringing patents issued to others. If the Company were determined to be infringing any third-party patent, the Company could be required to pay damages, alter its products or processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. In addition, if patents are issued to others which contain claims that compete or conflict with those of the Company and such competing or conflicting claims are ultimately determined to be valid, the Company may be required to pay damages, to obtain licenses to these patents, to develop or obtain alternative technology or to cease using such technology. If the Company is required to obtain any licenses, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to do so on commercially favorable terms, if at all. The Company&#39;s failure to obtain a license to any technology that it may require to commercialize its products could have a material adverse impact on the Company&#39;s business, operating results and financial condition. 

&#160; 

Government Regulation&#160; 

&#160; 

Government regulation in the United States and other countries is a significant factor in the marketing of certain of the Company&#8217;s products in the Company&#8217;s ongoing research and development activities and contract manufacturing activities. Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (&#8220;FDC Act&#8221;) the FDA regulates the clinical trials, manufacturing, labeling, distribution, sale and promotion of medical devices and drug products in the United States. Some of the Company&#8217;s and customers&#8217; products are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA, which regulates some of the products as medical devices and drug products, which in some cases, requires Pre-Market Approval (&#8220;PMA&#8221;), or New Drug Applications (&#8220;NDA&#8221;) and by foreign countries, which regulate some of the products as medical devices or drug products. 

&#160; 

Other regulatory requirements are placed on the manufacture, processing, packaging, labeling, distribution, recordkeeping and reporting of a medical device or drug products and on the quality control procedures. For example, medical device manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA to assure compliance with device QSR requirements, along with pre-approval inspection (PAI) for PMA and NDA product introduction. Lifecore&#8217;s facility is subject to inspections as both a device and a drug manufacturing operation. For PMA devices and NDA drug products, the company that owns the product submission is required to submit an annual report and also to obtain approval for modifications to the device, drug product or its labeling. Other applicable FDA requirements include the medical device reporting (&#8220;MDR&#8221;) regulation, which requires certain companies to provide information to the FDA regarding deaths or serious injuries alleged to have been associated with the use of its devices, as well as product malfunctions that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s food products and operations are also subject to regulation by various federal, state, and local agencies. Food products are regulated by the FDA under the FDC Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. The FDA has the authority to inspect the Company&#8217;s food facilities, and regulates, among other things, food manufacturing (pursuant to food-related current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs), food packing and holding, food safety, the growing and harvesting of produce intended for human consumption, food labeling, and food packaging. The FDA is in the process of implementing the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act and has recently published a number of final rules related to, among other things, hazard analysis and preventive controls, produce safety, foreign supplier verification programs, sanitary transportation of food, and food defense. The compliance dates for these rules vary and start as early as September, 2016. The FDA also requires companies to report to the FDA via the Reportable Food Registry when there is a reasonable probability that the use of, or exposure to, an article of food will cause serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission (&#8220;FTC&#8221;) and other state authorities regulate how the Company may promote and advertise its food products.
