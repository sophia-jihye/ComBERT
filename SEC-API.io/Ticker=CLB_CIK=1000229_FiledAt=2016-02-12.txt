 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

General 

Core Laboratories N.V. is a Netherlands limited liability company. We were established in 1936 and are one of the world's leading providers of proprietary and patented reservoir description, production enhancement and reservoir management services to the oil and gas industry. These services and products are directed toward enabling our clients to improve reservoir performance and increase oil and gas recovery from their producing fields. We have over 70 &#32;offices in more than 50 &#32;countries and have approximately 4,400 &#32;employees. 

References to "Core Lab", the "Company", "we", "our", and similar phrases are used throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this "Form 10-K") and relate collectively to Core Laboratories N.V. and its consolidated affiliates. 

Business Strategy 

Our business strategy is to provide advanced technologies that improve reservoir performance by (i) continuing the development of proprietary technologies through client-driven research and development, (ii) expanding the services and products offered throughout our global network of offices and (iii) acquiring complementary technologies that add key technologies or market presence and enhance existing services and products. 

Development of New Technologies, Services and Products &#32; 

We conduct research and development to meet the needs of our clients who are continually seeking new services and technologies to lower their costs of finding, developing and producing oil and gas. While the aggregate number of wells being drilled per year has fluctuated relative to market conditions, oil and gas producers have, on a proportional basis, increased expenditures on technology services to improve their understanding of the reservoir and increase production of oil and gas from their producing fields. We intend to continue concentrating our efforts on services and technologies that improve reservoir performance and increase oil and gas recovery. 

International Expansion of Services and Products &#32; 

Another component of our business strategy is to broaden the spectrum of services and products offered to our clients on a global basis. We intend to continue using our worldwide network of offices to offer many of our services and products that have been developed internally or obtained through acquisitions. This allows us to enhance our revenue through efficient utilization of our worldwide network. 

Acquisitions &#32; 

We continually review potential acquisitions to add key services and technologies, enhance market presence or complement existing businesses. 

More information relating to any significant acquisitions is included in Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV of this Form 10-K ("Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements"). 

Operations 

We derive our revenue from services and product sales to clients primarily in the oil and gas industry. 

We operate our business in three reportable segments. These complementary segments provide different services and products and utilize different technologies for improving reservoir performance and increasing oil and gas recovery from new and existing fields. Disclosure relating to the operations and financial information of these business segments is included in Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

&#8226; 

Reservoir Description : Encompasses the characterization of petroleum reservoir rock, fluid and gas samples. We provide analytical and field services to characterize properties of crude oil and petroleum products to the oil and gas industry. 

&#32;1 

&#8226; 

Production Enhancement : Includes products and services relating to reservoir well completions, perforations, stimulations and production. We provide integrated services to evaluate the effectiveness of well completions and to develop solutions aimed at increasing the effectiveness of enhanced oil recovery projects. 

&#8226; 

Reservoir Management : Combines and integrates information from reservoir description and production enhancement services to increase production and improve recovery of oil and gas from our clients' reservoirs. 

We offer our services worldwide through our global network of offices. Services accounted for approximately 77% , 72% &#32;and 71% &#32;of our revenue from operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. 

We manufacture products primarily in four facilities for distribution on a global basis. Product sales accounted for approximately 23% , 28% &#32;and 29% &#32;of our revenue from operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. 

Our product sales backlog at December 31, 2015 &#32;was approximately $10.2 million &#32;compared to $12.2 million &#32;at December 31, 2014 . Sources of raw materials for our products are readily available and we expect that our current sales backlog at December 31, 2015 &#32;will be completed in 2016 . 

Reservoir Description &#32; 

Commercial oil and gas fields consist of porous and permeable reservoir rocks that contain natural gas, crude oil and water. Due to the density differences of the fluids, natural gas typically caps the field and overlies an oil layer, which overlies the water. We provide services that characterize the porous reservoir rock and all three reservoir fluids. Services relating to these fluids include determining quality and measuring quantity of the fluids and their derived products. This includes determining the value of different crude oil and natural gases by analyzing the individual components of complex hydrocarbons. These data sets are used by oil companies to determine the most efficient method by which to recover, process and refine these hydrocarbons to produce the maximum value added to crude oil and natural gas. 

We analyze samples of reservoir rocks for their porosity, which determines reservoir storage capacity, and for their permeability, which defines the ability of the fluids to flow through the rock. These measurements are used to determine how much oil and gas are present in a reservoir and the rates at which the oil and gas can be produced. We also use our proprietary services and technologies to correlate the reservoir description data to wireline logs and seismic data by determining the different acoustic velocities of reservoir rocks containing water, oil and natural gas. These measurements are used in conjunction with our reservoir management services to develop programs to produce more oil and gas from the reservoir. 

Production Enhancement &#32; 

We provide diagnostic services and products to help optimize completion and reservoir operations and field development strategies in order to increase recoverable reserves in the most efficient way. Two production enhancement methods commonly used are (i) hydraulic fracturing of the reservoir rock to improve flow and (ii) flooding a reservoir with water, carbon dioxide, nitrogen or hydrocarbon gases to force more oil and gas to the wellbore. Many oilfields today are hydraulically fractured and/or flooded to maximize oil and gas recovery. Although Core Laboratories is not a hydraulic fracturing company, we do provide services that are used by others to develop and optimize hydraulic fracturing and field flood projects and to evaluate the success of those projects. Our services and technologies play a key role in the success of both methods. 

The hydraulic fracturing of a producing formation is achieved by pumping a fluid slurry containing a proppant material into the reservoir zone at extremely high pressures. This fractures the rock and the proppant material "props" or holds the fractures open after the pressure pumping is complete so that reservoir fluids can flow to the production wellbore. Our data on rock type and strength are critical for determining the proper design of the hydraulic fracturing job. In addition, our testing indicates whether the fluid slurry is compatible with the reservoir rock so that damage does not occur that would restrict production. We also provide testing of various propping agents and software to help pick the best proppant based on net present value calculations of client investments. Our proprietary and patented ZERO WASH &#174; &#32;tracer technology is used to determine that the proppant material was properly placed in the fracture to ensure effective flow and increased recovery. 

SPECTRACHEM &#174; &#32;is another proprietary and patented technology developed for optimizing hydraulic fracture performance. SPECTRACHEM &#174; &#32;is used to aid operators in determining the efficiency of the fracture fluids used. SPECTRACHEM &#174; &#32;tracers allow operators to evaluate the quantity of fracture fluid that returns to the wellbore during the clean-up period after a hydraulic fracturing event. This technology also allows our clients to evaluate load recovery, gas breakthrough, fluid leak-off and breaker 

&#32;2 

efficiency, all of which are important factors for optimizing oil and/or natural gas production after the formation is hydraulically fractured. 

Core's patented and proprietary SPECTRACHEM &#174; &#32;fracture diagnostic service continued to evolve with the introduction of the SPECTRACHEM &#174; Plus service in early 2009. The SPECTRACHEM &#174; Plus service is effective in determining the effectiveness and efficiency of the hydraulic fracture stimulation of long multi-stage horizontal wells in oil- and gas-shale plays throughout North America and with growing demand internationally as unconventional resource plays are developed globally. SPECTRACHEM &#174; Plus data sets are used to determine how each frac stage is flowing. Frac stages with ineffective flows may warrant further stimulation, remedial actions and guide improvements on future frac designs. 

Our unique completion monitoring system, COMPLETION PROFILER&#8482;, helps to determine flow rates from reservoir zones after they have been hydraulically fractured. This provides our clients with a baseline of early production information and can be compared to subsequent production logs later in the life of the well to see if and where hydrocarbon production varies. 

Our FLOWPROFILER TM &#32;service, a proprietary hydrocarbon-based tracer technology, which is a further development of our patented SPECTRACHEM &#174; &#32;technology and has been in use for more than five years, quantifies the hydrocarbon production from discrete segments in multi-stage horizontal well completions and stimulations in unconventional tight-oil or gas plays. We have tracers used for oil reservoirs which are different from our tracers used for gas reservoirs. FLOWPROFILER TM &#32;technology and the analytical methodology for identifying the hydrocarbon-soluble tracers are the protected intellectual property of Core Lab. 

FLOWPROFILER TM &#32;technology employs a unique hydrocarbon-soluble tracer and water-soluble tracer introduced into specific and isolated stages via the stimulating proppant stream. The hydrocarbon-soluble tracers are absorbed by the crude oil or gas associated with each stage while the water-soluble tracer remains in the stimulation fluid. When the well is flowed, crude oil or gas and water samples are collected and analyzed in the laboratory to identify and quantify oil or gas flows from each stage and the cleanup of the stimulation fluid. Stages not at optimum flow rates can be identified, precipitating remedial efforts to increase flow and recovery rates, and to provide valuable insight for future wells. This service, which we first used more than five years ago, is being used to monitor offset well interference by sampling offset well oil or gas and water production. The amount of tracer detected in offset wells is being used to help our clients optimize both lateral and vertical well spacing and the amount of fracturing fluids for each stage. 

We conduct dynamic flow tests of the reservoir fluids through the reservoir rock, at actual reservoir pressure and temperature, to realistically simulate the actual flooding of a producing zone. We use patented technologies, such as our Saturation Monitoring by the Attenuation of X-rays (SMAX&#8482;), to help design the enhanced recovery project. After a field flood is initiated, we are often involved in monitoring the progress of the flood to ensure the maximum amount of incremental production is being achieved through the use of our SPECTRAFLOOD TM &#32;technology, which we developed to optimize sweep efficiency during field floods. 

Our PACKSCAN &#174; &#32;patented technology is used as a tool to evaluate gravel pack effectiveness in an unconsolidated reservoir. PACKSCAN &#174; &#32;measures the density changes in the area around the tool and is designed to observe the changes within the gravel pack annulus to verify the completeness of the gravel pack protection of the wellbore without any additional rig time. 

In addition to our many patented reservoir analysis technologies, we have established ourselves as a global leader in the manufacture and distribution of high-performance perforating products. Our unique understanding of complex reservoirs supports our ability to supply perforating systems engineered to maximize well productivity by reducing, eliminating and overcoming formation damage caused during the drilling and completion of oil and gas wells. Our "systems" approach to the perforating of an oil or gas well has resulted in numerous patented products. Our HERO &#174; &#32;(High Efficiency Reservoir Optimization), SUPERHERO &#174; &#32;and SUPERHERO &#174; Plus perforating systems have quickly become industry leaders in enhancing reservoir performance. The SUPERHERO &#174; &#32;and SUPERHERO &#174; Plus perforating systems complement our successful HERO &#174; &#32;line and are designed to optimize wellbore completions and stimulation programs in oil- and gas-shale reservoirs. Evolved from our HERO &#174; &#32;charges, the SUPERHERO &#174; &#32;and the SUPERHERO &#174; Plus charges use a proprietary and patented design of powdered metal liners and explosives technology that results in a deeper and cleaner perforating tunnel into the oil- and gas-shale reservoir. This allows greater flow of hydrocarbons to the wellbore and helps to maximize hydrocarbon recovery from the reservoir. Moreover, the deeper, near debris-free perforations enable lower fracture initiation pressures, reducing the amount of pressure-pumping horsepower required and its associated cost. SUPERHERO &#174; &#32;and SUPERHERO &#174; Plus charges can eliminate the ineffective perforations that would otherwise limit daily oil and natural gas production and hinder the optimal fracture stimulation programs needed for prolific production from the Bakken, Eagle Ford, Marcellus, Niobrara and similar oil- and gas-shale formations. The latest charge development, our HERO Hard Rock or HERO-HR TM &#32;charges, are the deepest 

&#32;3 

penetrating perforating charges on the market as certified by API testing. Our manufacturing operations in the United States and Canada continue to meet the global demand for our perforating systems through facility expansion in addition to gains in efficiency and productivity. 

Our Horizontal Time-Delayed Ballistics Actuated Sequential Transfer (HTD-BLAST TM ) perforating system is a technology useful for the effective and efficient perforation of extended-reach horizontal completions in the Bakken, Eagle Ford, and other shale formations. The HTD-BLAST TM &#32;perforating system can be deployed via coiled tubing and currently enables up to 10 perforating events, beginning at the farthest reaches, or toe regions, of extended-reach horizontal wells, or up to 27 perforating events in vertical wellbores. The toe region is the most difficult section of an extended-reach well to effectively perforate and fracture stimulate. The HTD-BLAST TM &#32;system significantly improves the potential for production from those sections. A proprietary, time-delayed detonating sequence allows the operator to position and perforate each of the discrete zones being completed in the toe-end of the wellbore. This efficiency, coupled with Core's effective SUPERHERO &#174; Plus perforating charges, results in superior perforations at a greatly reduced operating cost. Superior perforations then allow effective fracture stimulation programs that can maximize production from extended horizontal wells. 

We have developed KODIAK TM &#32;Enhanced Perforating Systems energetic technology which combines our HERO-HR TM &#32;technology, now API-certified as the industry's deepest penetrating perforating charges, with proprietary accelerator propellant pellets to boost the effectiveness of the perforating/stimulating event. The detonation of the perforating charges initiates a complex, sequentially oxidizing reaction of the propellant pellets, thereby generating a high-pressure pulse of gases, which initiates and propagates fractures into the unconventional reservoir sequence, allowing for cleaner perforation tunnels, improvement of the stimulant/proppant injection, and increased hydrocarbon production. 

We have experienced technical services personnel to support clients through our global network of offices for the everyday use of our perforating systems and the rapid introduction of new products. Our personnel are capable of providing client training and on-site services in the completion of oil and gas wells. Our patented X-SPAN &#174; &#32;and GTX-SPAN &#174; &#32;casing patches are supported by our technical services personnel. These systems are capable of performing in high pressure oil and gas environments and are used to seal non-productive reservoir zones from the producing wellbore. 

Reservoir Management &#32; 

Reservoir description and production enhancement information, when applied across an entire oilfield or formation, is used to maximize daily production and the ultimate total recovery from the reservoir. We are involved in numerous large-scale reservoir management projects, applying proprietary and state-of-the-art techniques from the earliest phases of a field development program until the last economic barrel of oil is recovered. These projects are of increasing importance to oil companies as the incremental barrel is often the lowest cost and most profitable barrel in the reservoir. Producing incremental barrels increases our clients' cash flows which we believe will result in additional capital expenditures by our clients, and ultimately further opportunities for us. We also develop and provide industry consortium studies to provide critical reservoir information to a broad spectrum of clients in a cost effective manner, such as our multi-client, basin-wide reservoir optimization projects conducted in North America and international settings. Many of these studies examine unconventional reservoirs. An example is our ongoing global shale study that examines the shale potential in Central and Southern Europe, North Africa, India, China and Australia among other regions. Other joint industry projects evaluate the petrophysical, geochemical and production characteristics of North American unconventional plays such as the Eagle Ford shale in South Texas. Conventional studies currently being conducted are a deep water Gulf of Mexico study, a worldwide characterization of tight-gas sands, with special emphasis in the Middle East region, and deepwater studies off the coasts of West Africa and Brazil. 

We engineer and manufacture permanent real-time reservoir monitoring equipment that is installed in the reservoir for our oil and gas company clients. Our non-electronic ERD TM &#32;Pressure and Temperature sensors are characterized in the industry as having some of the highest reliability (95% in 20 years) and temperature (600&#176; Fahrenheit) ratings. The real-time data obtained from these sensors are used by drilling engineers to make real-time decisions, production engineers to optimize production, and reservoir engineers to prove up models and obtain a clear picture of the reservoir over time. 

Marketing and Sales 

We market and sell our services and products through a combination of sales representatives, technical seminars, trade shows and print advertising. Direct sales and marketing are carried out by our sales force, technical experts and operating managers, as well as by sales representatives and distributors in various markets where we do not have offices. Our Business Development group manages a Large Account Management Program to better serve our largest and most active clients by meeting with key 

&#32;4 

personnel within their organizations to ensure the quality of our services and products are meeting their expectations and we are addressing any issues or needs in a timely manner. 

Research and Development 

The market for our services and products is characterized by changing technology and frequent product introduction. As a result, our success is dependent upon our ability to develop or acquire new services and products on a cost-effective basis and to introduce them into the marketplace in a timely manner. Many of our acquisitions have allowed us to obtain the benefits of the acquired company's research and development projects without the significant costs that would have been incurred if we had attempted to develop the services and products ourselves. We incur costs as part of internal research and development and these costs are charged to expense as incurred. We intend to continue committing financial resources and effort to the development and acquisition of new services and products. Over the years, we have made a number of technological advances, including the development of key technologies utilized in our operations. Substantially all of the new technologies have resulted from requests and guidance from our clients, particularly major oil companies. 

Patents and Trademarks 

We believe our patents, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights are an important factor in maintaining our technological advantage, although no single one of these is considered essential to our success. Typically, we will seek to protect our intellectual property in all jurisdictions where we believe the cost of such protection is warranted. While we have patented some of our key technologies, we do not patent all of our proprietary technology even where regarded as patentable. We protect our intellectual property, including through the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements, legal enforcement proceedings and by other means. 

International Operations 

We operate facilities in more than 50 &#32;countries. Our non-U.S. operations accounted for approximately 58% , 52% &#32;and 55% &#32;of our revenue from operations during the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. Prior to 2014, we attributed revenue to the country in which the revenue was recorded. During 2014, we began attributing sales revenue to the country where the product was shipped as we feel this gives a clearer view of our operations. We do, however, have significant levels of revenue recorded in the U.S., where the services were performed, that are sourced from projects on non-U.S. oilfields. 

The following graphs and table summarize our reported revenue by geographic region (with 2013 revenue reclassified as described above) for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 :

While we are subject to fluctuations and changes in currency exchange rates relating to our international operations, we attempt to limit our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by limiting the amount in which our foreign contracts are denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. However, the ultimate decision as to the proportion of the foreign currency component within a contract usually resides with our clients. Consequently, we are not always able to eliminate our 

&#32;5 

foreign currency exposure. We have not historically engaged in and are not currently engaged in any significant currency hedging or trading transactions designed to compensate for adverse currency fluctuations. 

Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Regulations 

We are subject to stringent governmental laws and regulations, both in the United States and other countries, pertaining to protection of the environment and the manner in which chemicals and gases used in our analytical and manufacturing processes are handled and generated wastes are disposed. Consistent with our quality assurance and control principles, we have established proactive environmental policies for the management of these chemicals and gases as well as the handling, recycling or disposal of wastes resulting from our operations. Compliance with these laws and regulations, whether at the federal, provincial, regional, state or local levels, may require the acquisition of permits to conduct regulated activities, capital expenditures to limit or prevent emissions and discharges, and stringent practices to handle, recycle and dispose of certain wastes. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial or corrective obligations, and the issuance of injunctive relief. 

Moreover, new, modified or stricter environmental laws, regulations or enforcement policies could be adopted or implemented that significantly increase our or our client's compliance costs, pollution mitigation costs, or the cost of any remediation of environmental contamination that may become necessary, and these costs could be material. For example, from time to time, legal requirements have been agreed to or proposed and adopted, in the United States that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows related to the following: 

* Reduction of Methane and Ozone Emissions. In August 2015, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;) published a proposed rule under the federal Clean Air Act (&#8220;CAA&#8221;) that will establish emission standards for methane and volatile organic compounds released from new and modified oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing and transmissions facilities. This rulemaking, which is a part of the Obama Administration&#8217;s efforts to reduce methane emissions from the oil and natural gas sector by up to 45 percent from 2012 levels by 2025, is expected to be finalized by the EPA in 2016. More recently, in October 2015, the EPA issued a final rule under the CAA lowering the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ground-level ozone to 70 parts per billion under both the primary and secondary standards to provide requisite protection of public health and welfare, respectively. 

* Climate Change. &#32;&#32;A number of state and regional efforts exist that are aimed at tracking or reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by means of cap and trade programs that typically require major sources of GHG emissions to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those GHGs. In addition, the EPA has determined that GHG emissions present a danger to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to the warming of the earth&#8217;s atmosphere and other climatic changes and has adopted regulations that, among other things, restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the CAA, and require monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain onshore and offshore production facilities and onshore processing, transmission and storage facilities in the petroleum and natural gas system sources. On an international level, the United States is one of almost 200 nations that agreed in December 2015 to an international climate change agreement in Paris, France that calls for countries to set their own GHG emissions targets and be transparent about the measures each country will use to achieve its GHG emissions targets but it is not possible at this time to predict how or when the United State might impose legal requirements as a result of this international agreement. 

* Hydraulic Fracturing . Several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over aspects of hydraulic fracturing, including the EPA, which proposed rulemakings in April and August 2015 that would establish respective effluent limit guidelines for wastewater from shale natural-gas extraction operations being discharged to a treatment plant and first-time standards to address emissions of methane from hydraulically fractured oil and natural-gas well completions, and the federal Bureau of Land Management (&#8220;BLM&#8221;), which published a final rule in March 2015 that establishes new or more stringent standards for performing hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands but, in September 2015, the U.S. District Court of Wyoming issued a preliminary injunction barring implementation of this rule, which order is being appealed by certain environmental groups. Moreover, the EPA is one of several federal governmental agencies that has conducted or is conducting studies on the environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing, with the EPA releasing its draft report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources in June 2015, which report concluded, among other things, that hydraulic fracturing activities have not led to widespread, systemic impacts on drinking water sources in the United States although there are above and below ground mechanisms by which hydraulic fracturing activities have the potential to impact drinking water sources. However, in January 2016, the EPA&#8217;s Science Advisory Board provided its comments on the draft study, indicating its concern that the EPA&#8217;s conclusion of no widespread, systemic impacts on drinking water sources arising from 

&#32;6 

fracturing activities did not reflect the uncertainties and data limitations associated with such impacts, as described in the body of the draft report. In addition, Congress, some states and certain local governments have from time to time considered or adopted or implemented legal requirements that have imposed, and in the future could continue to impose, new or more stringent permitting, disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. 

* Offshore Compliance . In response to the Deepwater Horizon &#32;incident in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, federal governmental agencies under the U.S. Department of the Interior, have imposed new and more stringent permitting procedures and regulatory safety and performance requirements for new wells to be drilled in federal waters. These governmental agencies have pursued, implemented or enforced new rules, Notices to Lessees and Operators (&#8220;NTLs&#8221;) and temporary drilling moratoria that imposed safety and operational performance measures on exploration, development and production operators in the Gulf of Mexico or otherwise resulted in a temporary cessation of drilling activities. For example, in September 2015, the BOEM issued draft guidance relating to supplemental bonding procedures that will be released as an NTL and, among other things, eliminate the &#8220;waiver&#8221; exemption currently allowed by the BOEM with respect to supplemental bonding in favor of a broader self-insurance approach that would allow more operators in federal waters to seek self-insurance for a portion of their supplemental bond obligations, but only for an amount not to exceed 10% of such operators&#8217; tangible net worth. 

Our compliance with such new or amended legal requirements that are applicable to us could result in our incurring significant additional expense and operating restrictions with respect to our operations, which may not be fully recoverable from our clients and, thus, could reduce net income. Our clients, to whom we provide our services, may similarly incur increased costs or restrictions that may limit or decrease those clients&#8217; operations and have an indirect material adverse effect on our business. 

Our analytical and manufacturing processes involve the handling and use of numerous chemicals and gases as well as the generation of wastes. Spills or releases of these chemicals, gases, and wastes at our facilities, whether by us or prior owners or operators, or at offsite locations where we transport them for recycling or disposal could subject us to environmental liability, either from the applicable government agency or private landowners or other third parties. Such liabilities could be strict, joint and several, as is applicable in the United States under such laws as the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. This could also include costs of cleaning up chemicals and wastes released into the environment and for damages to persons, properties or natural resources. As a result of such actions, we could be required to remove previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators), remediate environmental contamination (including contaminated groundwater), and undertake measures to prevent future contamination. We may not be able to recover some or any of these remedial or corrective costs from insurance. While we believe that we are in substantial compliance with current applicable environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on us, we cannot give any assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation, and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate. 

Our operations are also subject to stringent governmental laws and regulations, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended ("OSHA"), and comparable state laws in the United States, whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. In the United States, the OSHA hazard communication standard and applicable community right-to-know regulations require that information is maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information is provided to employees, state and local government authorities, and citizens. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations relating to worker health and safety. 

Competition 

The businesses in which we engage are competitive. Some of our competitors are divisions or subsidiaries of companies that are larger and have greater financial and other resources than we have. While no one company competes with us in all of our product and service lines, we face competition in these lines, primarily from independent regional companies and internal divisions of major integrated oil and gas companies. We compete in different product and service lines to various degrees on the basis of price, technical performance, availability, quality and technical support. Our ability to compete successfully depends on elements both within and outside of our control, including successful and timely development of new services and products, performance and quality, client service, pricing, industry trends and general economic trends. 

&#32;7 

Reliance on the Oil and Gas Industry 

Our business and operations are substantially dependent upon the condition of the global oil and gas industry. Future downturns in the oil and gas industry, or in the oilfield services business, may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

The oil and gas industry is highly cyclical and has been subject to significant economic downturns at various times as a result of numerous factors affecting the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, including the level of capital expenditures of the oil and gas industry, the level of drilling activity, the level of production activity, market prices of oil and gas, economic conditions existing in the world, interest rates and the cost of capital, environmental regulations, tax policies, political requirements of national governments, coordination by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ("OPEC"), cost of producing oil and natural gas, and technological advances. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had approximately 4,400 &#32;employees. We do not have any material collective bargaining agreements and consider relations with our employees to be good.
