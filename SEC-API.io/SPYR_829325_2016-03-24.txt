History 

&#160;

The Company was incorporated as Conceptualistics, Inc., on January 6, 1988, in Delaware as a wholly owned subsidiary of Halter Venture Corporation (&#34;HVC&#34;), a publicly-owned corporation (now known as Debbie Reynolds Hotel and Casino, Inc.). In 1988, HVC divested itself of approximately 14% of its holdings in the Company by distributing 1,777,000 shares of the issued and outstanding stock of the Company to its shareholders. The then majority shareholder of HVC became the majority shareholder of the Company. Its authorized capital stock is 50,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share.

&#160;

During the period from September 30, 1988 to March 1, 1990, the Company remained in the development stage while attempting to enter the mining industry. The Company was unsuccessful in this start up effort and all activity ceased during 1992 as a result of foreclosure on various loans in default and/or abandonment of all assets. Subsequently, the Company did not engage in any business activities up to January, 1997.

&#160;

On January 1, 1997, the Shareholders adopted a plan of reorganization and merger between the Company and E. A. J. Holding Corp. Inc. (&#8220;Hold&#8221;) to be effective on or before January 31, 1997. Under the plan, the Company acquired all the issued and outstanding shares of &#8220;Hold,&#8221; a Delaware corporation making &#8220;Hold&#8221; a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company for 5,505,000 common shares of the Company. Since that time &#8220;Hold&#8221; has been dissolved.

&#160;

On December 16, 2014, the Company amended it articles of incorporation and changed its domicile to Nevada.

&#160;

On February 23, 2015, the Company issued an aggregate of 2.5 million shares of the its restricted common stock valued at $1,700,000, in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding shares of an internet company, Franklin Networks, Inc. (Franklin). By virtue of the agreement, the Company acquired the assets and business of Franklin including, but not limited to: employment contracts, consulting contracts, customer lists, customer relationships, trade secrets, trade designs, technical expertise, know how, proposals, internet web domains, internet web sites, trade names, and other intellectual property, and contractual relationships with Ad Service providers.

&#160;

On December 31, 2015, the Company unwound the Franklin agreement via a separate Unwind Agreement. Pursuant to the Unwind Agreement, Franklin returned all of the Company&#8217;s stock to Company in exchange for the return of the shares of Franklin stock, the Franklin web domains, websites, trade names and contractual relationships with Ad Service providers. The Company retained all mobile game-related IP and contractual agreements.

&#160;

In February 2015, pursuant to the approval of the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors and shareholders, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to change its name from Eat at Joe&#8217;s, Ltd. to SPYR, Inc. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) processed the Company&#8217;s name change and assigned the new ticker symbol &#8220;SPYR&#8221; effective March 12, 2015.

&#160; 

&#160;

On March 24, 2015, the Company organized its wholly owned subsidiary SPYR APPS, LLC, (&#8220;Apps&#8221;) a Nevada Limited Liability Company for the purpose of expanding the Company&#8217;s digital media presence into the mobile app industry.

&#160;

The Company has the following wholly owned subsidiaries:

&#160;

&#183; SPYR APPS, LLC a Nevada Limited Liability Company; &#183; E.A.J.: PHL, Airport Inc. a Pennsylvania corporation; and &#183; E.A.J. Market East, Inc., a Nevada corporation. &#160;

Through our wholly owned subsidiary SPYR APPS, LLC, we develop, publish and co-publish mobile games, and then generate revenue through those games by way of advertising and in-app purchases. The Company recognizes revenue using four basic criteria that must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred; (3) the selling price is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured, which is typically after receipt of payment and delivery. The Company&#8217;s gaming applications can be downloaded through Apple and Google, and the Company receives revenue from sale of advertising provided with games.

&#160;

Each of the E.A.J. subsidiaries was organized to operate a single restaurant. Though our wholly owned subsidiary E.A.J.: PHL, Airport, Inc. we generate revenue from the sale of food and beverage products through our theme restaurant located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Revenue from the restaurant is recognized upon sale to a customer and receipt of payment.

Our subsidiary E.A.J. Market East, Inc. is dormant.

&#160;

All administrative activities of the Company have been conducted by corporate officers from either their home or shared business offices located at 670 White Plains Road, Suite 120, Scarsdale, NY 10583. Beginning May 2015, administrative activities have been conducted from the Company&#8217;s new corporate headquarters located at 4643 South Ulster Street, Suite 1510, Denver, Colorado.

&#160;

OPERATING LOSSES 

&#160;

The Company has incurred net losses from operations of approximately $3,981,000 and $4,190,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Such operating losses reflect developmental and other administrative costs for 2015 and 2014. The Company expects to incur losses in the near future until profitability is achieved. The Company&#8217;s operations are subject to numerous risks associated with establishing any new business, including unforeseen expenses, delays and complications. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve or sustain profitable operations.

&#160;

FUTURE CAPITAL NEEDS AND UNCERTAINTY OF ADDITIONAL FUNDING 

&#160;

Revenues are not yet sufficient to support the Company&#8217;s operating expenses and are not expected to reach such levels until the Company implements a plan of expansion through acquisitions and/or building a portfolio of mobile games developed and/or published under its umbrella. The Company may seek additional financing in the future to help fund such expansion and growth. There can be no assurance that such financing will be available at all or available on terms acceptable to the Company.

&#160;

GOVERNMENT REGULATION 

&#160;

The Company is subject to all pertinent Federal, State, and Local laws governing its business. Each subsidiary is subject to licensing and regulation by a number of authorities in its State or municipality. These may include health, safety, and fire regulations. The Company&#8217;s operations are also subject to Federal and State minimum wage laws governing such matters as working conditions, overtime and tip credits.

&#160;

COMPETITION 

&#160;

The Company faces competition from a wide variety of participants in the mobile games industry and restaurants, many of which have substantially greater financial, marketing and technological resources than the Company.
