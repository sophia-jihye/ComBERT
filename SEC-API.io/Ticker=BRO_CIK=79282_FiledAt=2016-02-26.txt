 ITEM 1. Business. 

General 

Brown &#38; Brown is a diversified insurance agency, wholesale brokerage, insurance programs and service organization with origins dating from 1939 and is headquartered in Daytona Beach, Florida. We market and sell to our customers insurance products and services, primarily in the property, casualty and employee benefits areas. We provide our customers with quality, non-investment insurance contracts, as well as other targeted, customized risk management products and services. As an agent and broker, we do not assume underwriting risks with the exception of the activity in The Wright Insurance Group, LLC (&#8220;Wright&#8221;), which was acquired in May 2014. Within Wright, we operate a write-your-own flood insurance carrier, Wright National Flood Insurance Company (&#8220;WNFIC&#8221;), which is a Wright subsidiary. WNFIC&#8217;s entire business consists of policies written pursuant to the National Flood Insurance Program (&#8220;NFIP&#8221;), the program administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (&#8220;FEMA&#8221;) and excess flood insurance policies which are fully reinsured, thereby substantially eliminating WNFIC&#8217;s exposure to underwriting risk, as these policies are backed by either FEMA or a reinsurance carrier with an AM Best Company rating of &#8220;A&#8221; or better. 

The Company is compensated for our services primarily by commissions paid by insurance companies and to a lesser extent, by fees paid directly by customers for certain services. Commission revenues are usually a percentage of the premium paid by the insured and generally depend upon the type of insurance, the particular insurance company and the nature of the services provided by us. In some limited cases, we share commissions with other agents or brokers who have acted jointly with us in a transaction. We may also receive from an insurance company, a &#8220;profit-sharing contingent commission,&#8221; which is a profit-sharing commission based primarily on underwriting results, but may also contain considerations for volume, growth and/or retention. Fee revenues are generated primarily by: (1) our Services Segment, which provides insurance-related services, including third-party claims administration and comprehensive medical utilization management services in both the workers&#8217; compensation and all-lines liability arenas, as well as Medicare Set-aside services, Social Security disability and Medicare benefits advocacy services, and other claims adjusting services, (2) our National Programs and Wholesale Brokerage Segments, which earn fees primarily for the issuing of insurance policies on behalf of insurance carriers, and (3) our Retail Segment for fees received in lieu of commissions. The amount of our revenues from commissions and fees is a function of, among other factors, continued new business production, retention of existing customers, acquisitions and fluctuations in insurance premium rates and &#8220;insurable exposure units,&#8221; which are units that insurance companies use to measure or express insurance exposed to risk (such as property values, sales and payroll levels) to determine what premium to charge the insured. Insurance companies establish these premium rates based upon many factors, including loss experience, risk profile and reinsurance rates paid by such insurance companies, none of which we control. 

As of December 31, 2015 , our activities were conducted in 236 &#32;locations in 41 states as follows, as well as in England, Bermuda, and the Cayman Islands:

Industry Overview 

Premium pricing within the property and casualty insurance underwriting (risk-bearing) industry has historically been cyclical in nature, and has varied widely based on market conditions with a &#8220;hard&#8221; market in which premium rates are stable or increasing or a &#8220;soft&#8221; market, characterized by stable or declining premium rates in many lines and geographic areas. Premium pricing is influenced by many factors including loss experience, interest rates and the availability of capital being deployed into the market in search of returns.

None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory. 

Competition 

The insurance intermediary business is highly competitive, and numerous firms actively compete with us for customers and insurance markets. Competition in the insurance business is largely based on innovation, terms and condition of coverage, quality of service and price. A number of firms and banks with substantially greater resources and market presence compete with us. 

A number of insurance companies directly sell insurance, primarily to individuals, and do not pay commissions to third-party agents and brokers. In addition, the Internet continues to be a source for direct placement of personal lines business. While it is difficult to quantify the impact on our business from individuals purchasing insurance over the Internet, we believe this risk would generally be isolated to personal lines customers with single-line coverage, which represent a small portion of our overall Retail Segment. 

Regulation, Licensing and Agency Contracts 

We and/or our designated employees must be licensed to act as agents, brokers, intermediaries or third-party administrators by state regulatory authorities in the locations in which we conduct business. Regulations and licensing laws vary by individual state and international location and are often complex. 

The applicable licensing laws and regulations in all states and international jurisdictions are subject to amendment or reinterpretation by regulatory authorities, and such authorities are vested in most cases with relatively broad discretion as to the granting, revocation, suspension and renewal of licenses. The possibility exists that we and/or our employees could be excluded or temporarily suspended from carrying on some or all of our activities in, or could otherwise be subjected to penalties by a particular jurisdiction.
