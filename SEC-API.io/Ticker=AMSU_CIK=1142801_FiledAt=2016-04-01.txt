General 

Amanasu Environment Corporation&#8217;s (herein after the "Company") principle business is in complete development of Environmental Technologies to improve the quality of life for the future of the planet. The Company is involved in all aspects of environmental technology development: research and development, marketing, sales. It also produces and acquires environmental technology and related patents. Environmental technologies that the Company has been a part of range from water filtration systems, industrial/medical waste incinerators, solar panels, to name a few. The Company chose to have its headquarters in the United States in order to bridge environmental technology development internationally, with particular attention to leading innovations in Japan. The Company's parent company Amanasu Corporation, is a Japanese Corporation. The Company hopes to utilize existing associations and partnerships in order to bring environmental technologies from the United States and market them in Japan and other surrounding countries. 

Current 

During recent years, the Company has embarked on a mission to achieve a capital-raising goal of $30,000,000 to increase the Company&#8217;s potential by entering into the NASDAQ global market. The Company&#8217;s main objective has not changed for the coming fiscal year ending December 31, 2016. 

Aside from capital raising efforts, the Company has been supporting Amanasu Maritek Corporation, in the development and required regulatory approval for the Commercial Cargo Ship Ballast Water Purification System. The Company and Amanasu Maritek Corporation have been working through the approval process of this type of product with the Japanese regulatory bodies. Also, required documentation, and translations have been prepared for additional approval by the main global governing body for marine technologies, IMO the International Marine Organization. So far, the Company has been unable to obtain approval for the Commercial Cargo Ship Ballast Water Purification System. In adhering to the guidelines set by the IMO and the Japanese Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, the Company needs to collaborate with a shipbuilding company to conduct experiments and tests, requiring 2-3 years and a minimum budget of $10,000,000. Due to a lack of resources, the Company is currently seeking partners who are interested in developing such businesses and technologies acquired by Amanasu Maritek Corporation, the Company's subsidiary. Furthermore, the Company is making plans to enter the reforestation industry in Japan, through Amanasu Maritek Corporation. Following the Great East Japan Earthquake, approximately 1 million houses need to be rebuilt, causing wood to be in high demand. Also, the Japanese Government currently subsidizes new firms entering the reforestation industry, giving the Company an opportunity to enter an industry that is reflective of its vision.

Overview and History 

Amanasu Environment Corporation ("Company") was incorporated in the State of Nevada on February 22, 1999 under the name of Forte International Inc. On March 27, 2001, the Company's name was changed to Amanasu Energy Corporation, and on November 13, 2002, its name was changed to Amanasu Environment Corporation.

It has acquired the exclusive, worldwide license rights to a high temperature furnace, a hot water boiler, and ring-tube desalination methodology. At this time, the Company is not engaged in the commercial sale of any of its licensed technologies. Its operations to date have been limited to acquiring the technologies, conducting limited product marketing, and testing the technologies for commercial sale. For each such technology, proto-type or demonstrational units have been constructed by each licensor or inventor of the technology. The Company has conducted various internal tests on these units to determine the commercial viability of the underlying technologies. As a result of such testing, the Company believes that the products are not commercially ready for sale, and that product refinements are necessary with respect to each of the technologies. In addition, the Company may seek joint venture or other affiliations with companies competitive in each respective product market whereby the Company can capitalize on the existing infrastructure of such other companies, such as product design and engineering, marketing and sales, and warranty and post-warranty service and repair. The Company believes that its marketing efforts to sell any of its products will be limited until such time as it can complete the refinements of its technologies. The Company cannot predict whether it will be successful in developing commercial products, or establishing affiliations with any operating company. 

&#160; 

On June 8, 2000, the Company obtained the exclusive, worldwide license to a technology that disposes of toxic and hazardous wastes through a proprietary, high temperature combustion system, known as the Amanasu Furnace. The rights were obtained pursuant to a license agreement with Masaichi Kikuchi, the inventor of the technology, for a period of 30 years. The Company issued 1,000,000 share of common stock to the inventor and 200,000 shares of common stock to a director of the inventor's company. Under the licensing agreement; the Company is required to pay the licensor a royalty of two percent of the gross receipts from the sale of products using the technology. If the Company fails to comply with any provision of the agreement after a 90-day notice period, the licensor may terminate the agreement. 

Effective September 30, 2002, the Company obtained the exclusive, worldwide license to a hot water boiler technology that incinerates waste tires in a safe and non-polluting manner and extracts heat energy from the incineration process. The rights were obtained pursuant to a license agreement with Sanyo Kogyo Kabushiki Gaisha and Ever Green Planet Corporation, both Japanese companies, for a period of 30 years. As consideration for this acquisition, the Company paid the licensors $250,000, of which the Company's President paid $95,000, issued to them 600,000 shares of common stock, and issued to an affiliate of the licensors 50,000 shares of common stock. The licensors are entitled to receive a two percent royalty on the gross receipts from the sale of the products related to the technology. If the Company fails to comply with any provision of the agreement after a 90-day notice period, the licensor may terminate the agreement. 

&#160; 

On June 30, 2003, the Company acquired the exclusive worldwide rights to produce and market a patented technology that purifies seawater, and removes hazardous pollutants from wastewater. The rights were obtained pursuant to a license agreement with Etsuro Sakagami, the inventor, for a period of 30 years. As consideration for obtaining the license, the Company issued 1,000,000 shares to the inventor, and 50,000 shares to a finder. The licensor is entitled to receive a two percent royalty on the gross receipts from the sale of the products related to the technology. If the Company fails to comply with any provision of the agreement after a 90-day notice period, the licensor may terminate the agreement. 

The Company&#8217;s goal for the next few years is to enter into the NASDAQ global market.
