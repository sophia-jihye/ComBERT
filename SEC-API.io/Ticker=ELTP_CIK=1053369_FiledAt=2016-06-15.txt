 ITEM 1 BUSINESS &#160;

General 

&#160; 

Elite Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the &#8220;Company&#8221;, &#8220;Elite&#8221;, &#8220; Elite Pharmaceuticals &#8221;, the &#8220;registrant&#8221;, &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221;) was incorporated on October 1, 1997 under the laws of the State of Delaware, and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Elite Laboratories, Inc. ( &#8220;Elite Labs&#8221;&#8221; ), was incorporated on August 23, 1990 under the laws of the State of Delaware. On January 5, 2012, Elite Pharmaceuticals was reincorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada.

&#160;

We are a specialty pharmaceutical company principally engaged in the development and manufacture of oral, controlled-release products, using proprietary know-how and technology, particularly as it relates to abuse resistant products and the manufacture of generic pharmaceuticals. Our strategy includes improving off-patent drug products for life cycle management, developing generic versions of controlled-release drug products with high barriers to entry and the development of branded and generic products that utilize our proprietary and patented abuse resistance technologies.

&#160;

We own and occupy manufacturing, warehouse, laboratory and office space at 165 Ludlow Avenue and 135 Ludlow Avenue in Northvale, NJ (the &#8220;Northvale Facility&#8221;). The Northvale Facility operates under Current Good Manufacturing Practice (&#8220;cGMP&#8221;) and is a United States Drug Enforcement Agency (&#8220;DEA&#8221;) registered facility for research, development and manufacturing.

&#160;

Strategy 

Elite is focusing its efforts on the following areas: (i) development of Elite&#8217;s pain management products; (ii) manufacturing of a line of generic pharmaceutical products with approved ANDAs; (iii) development of additional generic pharmaceutical products; (iv) development of the other products in our pipeline including the products with our partners; (v) commercial exploitation of our products either by license and the collection of royalties, or through the manufacture of our formulations; and (vi) development of new products and the expansion of our licensing agreements with other pharmaceutical companies, including co-development projects, joint ventures and other collaborations.

&#160;

Elite is focusing on the development of various types of drug products, including branded drug products which require new drug applications (&#8220;NDAs&#8221;) under Section 505(b)(1) or 505(b)(2) of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (the &#8220; Drug Price Competition Act &#8221;) as well as generic drug products which require ANDAs.

&#160;

Elite believes that its business strategy enables it to reduce its risk by having a diverse product portfolio that includes both branded and generic products in various therapeutic categories and to build collaborations and establish licensing agreements with companies with greater resources thereby allowing us to share costs of development and improve cash-flow.

Lodrane D&#174; Immediate Release capsules 

On September 27, 2011, the Company, along with ECR Pharmaceuticals (&#8220;ECR&#8221;), launched Lodrane D&#174;, an immediate release formulation of brompheniramine maleate and pseudoephedrine HCl, an effective, low-sedating antihistamine combined with a decongestant.

&#160;

ECR products have since been divested so that Lodrane D&#174; is promoted and distributed in the U.S. now by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. Lodrane D&#174; is available over-the-counter but also has physician promotion. Lodrane D&#174; is one of the only adult brompheniramine containing products available to the consumer at this time.

&#160;

Lodrane D&#174; is marketed under the Over-the-Counter Monograph (the &#8220;OTC Monograph&#8221;) and accordingly, under the Code of Federal Regulations can be lawfully marketed in the US without prior approval. Under the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act (&#8220;FDCA&#8221;), FDA regulations and statements of FDA policy, certain drug products are permitted to be marketed in the U.S. without prior approval. Within the past few years, the FDA has revised its enforcement policies, significantly limiting the circumstances under which these unapproved products may be marketed. If the FDA determines that a company is distributing an unapproved product that requires approval, the FDA may take enforcement action in a variety of ways, including, without limitation, product seizures and seeking a judicial injunction against distribution.

&#160;

There have been several mergers relating to ECR and successor entities and transfer of brand name ownership since this product was originally launched. Lodrane D&#174; is accordingly currently promoted and distributed in the U.S. by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. (&#8220;Valeant&#8221;). Lodrane D&#174; is available over-the-counter but also has physician promotion. Lodrane D&#174; is the one of the only adult brompheniramine containing products available to the consumer at this time.

&#160;

Elite is manufacturing the product for Valeant and will receive revenues for the manufacturing of Lodrane D&#174;.

Elite may also terminate the exclusive marketing rights if Epic Pharma is unable to meet the annual unit volume forecast for a designated product group for any year, subject to the ability of Epic Pharma, during the succeeding six month period, to achieve at least one-half of the prior year&#8217;s minimum annual unit forecast. The Epic Pharma Manufacturing and License Agreement may be terminated by mutual agreement of Elite and Epic Pharma, as a result of a breach by either party that is not cured within 60 days notice of the breach, or by Elite as a result of Epic Pharma becoming a party to a bankruptcy, reorganization or other insolvency proceeding that continues for a period of 30 days or more.

&#160;

Pursuant to the Precision Dose License Agreement, Elite will receive a license fee and milestone payments. The license fee will be computed as a percentage of the gross profit, as defined in the Precision Dose License Agreement, earned by Precision Dose as a result of sales of the products. The license fee is payable monthly for the term of the Precision Dose License Agreement. The milestone payments will be paid in six installments. The first installment was paid upon execution of the License Agreement. The remaining installments are to be paid upon FDA approval and initial shipment of the products to Precision Dose. The term of the License Agreement is 15 years and may be extended for 3 successive terms, each of 5 years. Please see Part II, Item 1, Legal Proceedings below for details of an arbitration proceeding commenced by Precision Dose related to certain terms and conditions of the Precision Dose License Agreement.

&#160;

Development agreement with Akorn Pharmaceuticals 

On January 10, 2011, Elite and Hi-Tech Pharmacal Co, Inc. (subsequently acquired by Akorn Pharmaceuticals), entered into an agreement for Elite to develop an intermediate product for a generic version of a prescription product for Akorn Pharmaceuticals (&#8220;Akorn&#8221;). Under the terms of the agreement, Elite will undertake a development program for an intermediate product that Akorn shall then incorporate into a final product. Akorn or its designees, shall be responsible for the filing of the ANDA for the finished product and the ANDA will be filed under the Akorn name. Upon approval of the ANDA, Elite will manufacture the intermediate product. Akorn will manufacture the final product and will be responsible for the marketing and sales of the final product. Akorn will pay Elite milestone payments for the development work. Upon commercialization, Elite will receive payment for the manufacturing of the intermediate product and a percentage of the profits generated from the sale of the product.

&#160;

As of the date of filing of this annual report on Form 10-K, there has been minimal to no development activity conducted in relation to this agreement for substantially all of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016. Furthermore, there can be no assurances that development activities will resume or that the resumption of development activities, is such were to occur, would result in the successful development of the product identified.

&#160;

For further details, please refer to Exhibit 10.51 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

&#160;

&#160;

Research and Development 

Elite&#8217;s research and development activities are primarily focused on developing its proprietary abuse deterrent technology and the development of a range of abuse deterrent opioid products that utilize this technology.

&#160;

Elite&#8217;s proprietary abuse-deterrent technology, utilizes the pharmacological approach to abuse deterrence and consists of a multi-particulate capsule which contains an opioid agonist in addition to naltrexone, an opioid antagonist used primarily in the management of alcohol dependence and opioid dependence. When this product is taken as intended, the naltrexone is designed to pass through the body unreleased while the opioid agonist releases over time providing therapeutic pain relief for which it is prescribed. If the multi-particulate beads are crushed or dissolved, the opioid antagonist, naltrexone, is designed to release. The absorption of the naltrexone is intended to block the euphoria by preferentially binding to same receptors in the brain as the opioid agonist and thereby reducing the incentive for abuse or misuse by recreational drug abusers.

&#160;

We filed an NDA for the first product to utilize our abuse deterrent technology, Immediate Release Oxycodone 5mg, 10mg, 15mg, 20mg and 30mg with sequestered Naltrexone (collectively and individually referred to as &#8220;SequestOx&#8482;&#8221;), on January 14, 2016. On March 17, 2016, the FDA notified Elite that its NDA application was accepted and granted priority review. The Company believes that, subject to the risks described below, approval of this NDA filing could be received during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017.

&#160;

The Company believes that the abuse deterrent technology can be applied to and incorporated into a wide range of opioids used today for pain management and has, to date, identified 10 additional products for potential development. All of these products are at early stages of development, with research and development activities mainly consisting of in-house process development and laboratory studies. Extensive efficacy and safety studies, similar to those conducted for SequestOx&#8482; have not yet been conducted for these other products. As a result, costs incurred in relation to the development of these 10 products have not been material.

&#160;

Research and development costs were $12.4 million, $14.7 million and $4.0 million for the years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, with such costs relating almost entirely to the development of SequestOx&#8482;, the first product developed by Elite that incorporates the technology.

&#160;

On June 4, 2015, the Company entered into a sales and distribution licensing agreement which included a non-refundable payment of $5 million to Elite for prior research and development activities, with such representing the first material net cash inflows being generated by ELI-200. On January 14, 2016, the Company filed an NDA with the FDA for SequestOx&#8482;, thereby earning a non-refundable $2.5 million milestone. An additional $7.5 million non-refundable milestone is due upon the FDA&#8217;s approval of Elite&#8217;s NDA. Please note, as further detailed below, there can be no assurances of the Company receiving marketing authorization for SequestOx&#8482;, and accordingly, there can be no assurances that the Company will earn and receive the additional $7.5 million or future license fees. The non receipt by the Company of these payments and or fees may materially and adversely affect our financial condition.

&#160;

Please note that, while the FDA is required to review applications within certain timeframes, during the review process, the FDA frequently requests that additional information be submitted. The effect of such request and subsequent submission can significantly extend the time for the NDA review process. Until an NDA is actually approved, there can be no assurances that the information requested and submitted will be considered adequate by the FDA to justify approval. The packaging and labeling of our developed products are also subject to FDA regulation. Based on the foregoing, it is impossible to anticipate the amount of time that will be needed to obtain FDA approval to market any product. In addition, there can be no assurances of the Company filing the required application(s) with the FDA or of the FDA approving such application(s) if filed, and the Company&#8217;s ability to successfully develop and commercialize products incorporating its abuse deterrent technology is subject to a high level of risk as detailed in &#8220;Item 1A-Risk Factors-Risks Related to our Business&#8221; of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

&#160;

&#160;

Abuse-Deterrent and Sustained Release Opioids 

The abuse-deterrent opioid products utilize our patented abuse-deterrent technology that is based on a pharmacological approach. These products are combinations of a narcotic agonist formulation intended for use in patients with pain, and an antagonist, formulated to deter abuse of the drug. Both, agonist and antagonist, have been on the market for a number of years and sold separately in various dose strengths. Elite has filed INDs for two abuse resistant products under development and has tested products in various pharmacokinetic studies. Elite expects to continue to develop multiple abuse resistant products. Products utilizing the pharmacological approach to deter abuse such as Suboxone&#174;, a product marketed in the United States by Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Embeda&#174;, a product marketed in the United States by Pfizer, Inc., have been approved by the FDA and are being marketed in the United States.

&#160;

Elite has developed, and retains the rights to these abuse resistant and sustained release opioid products. Elite may license these products at a later date to a third party who could provide funding for the remaining clinical studies and who could provide sales and distribution for the product.

&#160;

Elite also developed controlled release technology for oxycodone under a joint venture with Elan which terminated in 2002. According to the Elan Termination Agreement, Elite acquired all proprietary, development and commercial rights for the worldwide markets for the products developed by the joint venture, including the sustained release opioid products. Upon licensing or commercialization of an oral controlled release formulation of oxycodone for the treatment of pain, Elite will pay a royalty to Elan pursuant to the Termination Agreement. If Elite were to sell the product itself, Elite will pay a 1% royalty to Elan based on the product&#8217;s net sales, and if Elite enters into an agreement with another party to sell the product, Elite will pay a 9% royalty to Elan based on Elite&#8217;s net revenues from this product. (Elite&#8217;s net product revenues would include license fees, royalties, manufacturing profits and milestones) Elite is allowed to recoup all development costs including research, process development, analytical development, clinical development and regulatory costs before payment of any royalties to Elan.

&#160;

Patents 

Since our incorporation, we have secured the following patents, of which two have been assigned for a fee to another pharmaceutical company. Elite&#8217;s patents are:

&#160;

PATENT &#160; EXPIRATION DATE U.S. patent 5,837,284 (assigned to Celgene Corporation) &#160; November 2018 U.S. patent 6,620,439 &#160; October 2020 U.S. patent 6,635,284 (assigned to Celgene Corporation) &#160; March 2018 U.S. patent 6,926,909 &#160; April 2023 U.S. patent 8,182,836 &#160; April 2024 U.S. patent 8,425,933 &#160; April 2024 U.S. patent 8,703,186 &#160; April 2024 Canadian patent 2,521,655 &#160; April 2024 Canadian patent 2,541,371 &#160; September 2024 U.S. patent 9,056,054 &#160; June 2030 &#160;

&#160; 13 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

We also have pending applications for two additional U.S. patents and three foreign patents. We intend to apply for patents for other products in the future; however, there can be no assurance that any of the pending applications or other applications which we may file will be granted. We have also filed corresponding foreign applications for key patents.

&#160;

Prior to the enactment in the United States of new laws adopting certain changes mandated by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (&#8220;GATT&#8221;), the exclusive rights afforded by a U.S. Patent were for a period of 17 years measured from the date of grant. Under GATT, the term of any U.S. Patent granted on an application filed subsequent to June 8, 1995 terminates 20 years from the date on which the patent application was filed in the United States or the first priority date, whichever occurs first. Future patents granted on an application filed before June 8, 1995, will have a term that terminates 20 years from such date, or 17 years from the date of grant, whichever date is later.

&#160;

Under the Drug Price Competition Act, a U.S. product patent or use patent may be extended for up to five years under certain circumstances to compensate the patent holder for the time required for FDA regulatory review of the product. Such benefits under the Drug Price Competition Act are available only to the first approved use of the active ingredient in the drug product and may be applied only to one patent per drug product. There can be no assurance that we will be able to take advantage of this law.

&#160;

Also, different countries have different procedures for obtaining patents, and patents issued by different countries provide different degrees of protection against the use of a patented invention by others. There can be no assurance, therefore, that the issuance to us in one country of a patent covering an invention will be followed by the issuance in other countries of patents covering the same invention, or that any judicial interpretation of the validity, enforceability, or scope of the claims in a patent issued in one country will be similar to the judicial interpretation given to a corresponding patent issued in another country. Furthermore, even if our patents are determined to be valid, enforceable, and broad in scope, there can be no assurance that competitors will not be able to design around such patents and compete with us using the resulting alternative technology.

&#160;

We also rely upon unpatented proprietary and trade secret technology that we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our collaborative partners, employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers, and other advisors. There can be no assurance that these agreements provide meaningful protection or that they will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any such breach, or that our trade secrets, proprietary know-how, and technological advances will not otherwise become known to others. In addition, there can be no assurance that, despite precautions taken by us, others have not and will not obtain access to our proprietary technology.

&#160;

Trademarks 

SequestOx&#8482; is a trademark owned by Elite, which received a Notice of Allowance by the United States Patent and Trademark Office on December 22, 2015.

&#160;

In addition, we currently plan to license at least some of our products to other entities in the marketing of pharmaceuticals, but may also sell products under our own brand name in which case we may register trademarks for those products.

Discontinued Products, Terminated Agreements, Prior Investments 

&#160; 

Discontinued Products - Lodrane 24&#174; and Lodrane 24D&#174; 

On March 3, 2011, the FDA announced its intention to remove approximately 500 cough/cold and allergy related products from the U.S. market. The once daily allergy products manufactured by Elite, Lodrane 24&#174; and Lodrane 24D&#174; (the &#8220;Lodrane&#174; Extended Release Products&#8221;), were included in the FDA list of 500 products. After this announcement by the FDA, the Company&#8217;s customer for the Lodrane&#174; Extended Release Products cancelled all outstanding orders and manufacturing of the Lodrane&#174; Extended Release Products has ceased. The shipments made during the quarter ended June 30, 2011 consisted solely of quantities that were in production at the time ECR cancelled all outstanding orders. There were no shipments of the Lodrane Extended Release Products subsequent to those that were made during the quarter ended June 30, 2011.

&#160;

ECR (the owner and marketer of the Lodrane&#174; Extended Release Products) initiated a formal approval process with the FDA in 2010 regarding the Lodrane&#174; Extended Release Products and issued a press release on March 3, 2011 stating that they will continue to actively pursue approval for the Lodrane&#174; Extended Release Products. In addition, on April 29, 2011, ECR filed a Petition for Review with the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, petitioning such court to review and set aside the final order of the FDA with relation to the Lodrane&#174; Extended Release Products. The Company has received no further information from ECR with regards to the status of the Petition filed.

&#160;

The Lodrane&#174; Extended Release Products were co-developed with our partner, ECR, and the Company was receiving revenues from the manufacture of the Lodrane&#174; Products and laboratory stability study services, as well as royalties on in-market sales. Contracts relating to the manufacture and sale of the Lodrane&#174; Extended Release Products were formally terminated on April 26, 2013.

&#160;

During the three months ended June 30, 2011, Elite made its final shipments of the Lodrane&#174; Extended Release Products. In addition, the Company sold to ECR, at cost without markup, all raw materials related to the manufacture of the Lodrane&#174; Extended Release Products which remained in stock subsequent to the final shipment of the Lodrane&#174; Extended Release Products. As manufacturing of the Lodrane&#174; Extended Release Products has ceased, there will be no further manufacturing revenues derived from the Lodrane&#174; Extended Release Products unless and until such products receive the necessary approvals from the FDA.

&#160;

Please note that there can be no assurances that such approvals will be granted or that future manufacturing revenues will be earned by the Company from the manufacture of the Lodrane&#174; Extended Release Products, should such approvals be granted by the FDA. Furthermore, the Company has been advised that ECR has decided not to proceed with the development of the extended release formulations marketed under the Lodrane&#174; brand. The Company also has no plans currently to proceed with the development of an extended release brompheniramine/pseudoephedrine product. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Elite may proceed with the development of these formulations and may seek partners in conjunction with such activities, but there can be no assurances that the Company will pursue the development of these formulations, or that such development activities, if pursued, will result in approvals from the FDA. Please also note that the Company does not have ownership of the Lodrane&#174; brand name, and that if any products containing the formulations associated with the Lodrane&#174; brand name are approved and marketed, such would be done under a different brand name.

&#160;

While Elite&#8217;s manufacturing of the Lodrane&#174; Extended Release Products has ceased, the sale of such products in the US market was still permitted by the FDA until August 30, 2011. The Company earned royalties on any in-market sales that occurred up to that date.

&#160;

Terminated Agreement - Contract Manufacturing of Isradipine and Phendimetrazine 

On June 1, 2011, Elite executed a Manufacturing and Supply Agreement (the &#8220;Isradipine/ Phendimetrazine Agreement&#8221;) with Mikah Pharma, LLC (&#8220;Mikah&#8221;) to undertake and perform certain services relating to two generic products: Isradipine Capsules USP, 2.5 mg and 5 mg (&#8220;Isradipine&#8221;) and Phendimetrazine Tartrate Tablets USP, 35 mg (&#8220;Phendimetrazine&#8221;), including (a) developing and preparing the documentation required for the transfer of the manufacturing process to Elite&#8217;s facility and the appropriate regulatory filing for the ANDA, and (b) manufacturing finished dosage forms appropriate for commercial sale, marketing and distribution in the United States, its territories, possessions, and commonwealths in accordance with the requirements of the Isradipine/ Phendimetrazine Agreement; Elite is required to perform, at its sole cost and expense, all Technology Transfer, validation and qualification services (including: equipment, methods and facility qualification), validation and stability services required by Applicable Laws to commence manufacturing Isradipine and Phendimetrazine for commercial sale by Mikah or its designees in accordance with the terms of the Isradipine/ Phendimetrazine Agreement. During the term of the Isradipine/ Phendimetrazine Agreement and subject to the provisions therein, Mikah is required to purchase from Elite and Elite agrees to manufacture and supply solely and exclusively to Mikah, such Isradipine and Phendimetrazine as Mikah may order from time to time pursuant to the Isradipine/ Phendimetrazine Agreement. Mikah will compensate Elite at an agreed upon transfer price for the manufacturing and packaging of Isradipine and Phendimetrazine. For the Isradipine product, Elite will also receive a 10% royalty on net profits of the finished Product. The payment is to be calculated and paid quarterly. Elite will also receive a onetime milestone payment for each Product for the work associated with the Technology transfer. The milestone payment shall be made upon the successful manufacturing and testing of the exhibit batch. The Isradipine/ Phendimetrazine Agreement has a term of five years and automatically renews for additional periods of one year unless Mikah provides written notice of termination to Elite at least six months prior to the expiration of the Term or any Renewal Term.

&#160;

On November 13, 2012, the Company made the initial shipment of Phendimetrazine tartrate 35mg tablets, the generic equivalent of Bontril PDM&#174; 35mg tablets under a previously announced manufacturing and supply agreement with Mikah Pharma (&#8220;Mikah&#8221;).

&#160;

Bontril PDM&#174; and its generic equivalents had total U.S. sales of approximately $3.5 million for the twelve months ended September 2012, based on IMS Health Data. The Company will be compensated at an agreed upon price for the manufacturing and packaging of this product.

&#160;

On August 1, 2013, Elite executed the Mikah Purchase Agreement in relation to the Mikah 13 ANDA Acquisition, with such transaction including the transfer of ANDAs for Phendimetrazine 35mg and Isradipine 2.5mg and 5mg. In addition, the principal owner of Mikah, Mr. Nasrat Hakim, assumed the position of Elite&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer and President on August 2, 2013. Accordingly, the Isradipine/Phendimetrazine Agreement has been terminated by mutual consent of the parties thereto.

&#160;

Terminated Agreement &#8211; Mikah Development Agreement 

On January 28, 2015, The Development and License Agreement dated August 27, 2010 and between the Company and Mikah Pharma LLC (the &#8220;Mikah Development Agreement&#8221;) was terminated by mutual agreement of the Company and Mikah Pharma LLC.

&#160;

Pursuant to the Mikah Development Agreement, Mikah Pharma LLC (&#8220;Mikah&#8221;) made advance consideration payments to the Company totaling $200,000 in exchange for product development services to be provided at a future date. Subsequent to the execution of the Mikah Development Agreement, and before any development milestones were achieved, the sole owner of Mikah, Mr. Nasrat Hakim, became the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Mikah has accordingly ceased operating and is in the process of winding down and liquidating its assets.

&#160;

&#160; 16 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Any further development of the product related to this agreement will belong to the Company, although there can be no assurances that such development will occur or be successful.

&#160;

The Mikah Development Agreement requires that the consideration paid in advance to the Company be refunded in the event of no milestones being achieved. Mr. Hakim, as owner of Mikah, has directed that the $200,000 refund due to Mikah not be paid currently, but rather be added to the amounts due under the Hakim Credit Line.

&#160;

For further details on the Mikah Development Agreement, please see Exhibit 10.6 of the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 14, 2010, with such filing being herein incorporated by reference.

&#160;

For further details on the termination of the Mikah Development Agreement, please see Exhibit 10.84 of the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, filed with the SEC on February 17, 2015, with such filing being herein incorporated by reference.

&#160;

Terminated Agreement - Development and License Agreement with Hong Kong based company 

On January 19, 2016 , the Development and License Agreement (&#8220;D&#38;L Agreement&#8221;) between the Company and a private Hong-Kong based company dated March 16, 2016 was terminated. The D&#38;L Agreement was for Elite to develop for the Hong Kong-based Customer a branded prescription pharmaceutical product in the United States. The Hong Kong-based Customer has informed us that it has been in business for more than five years and it has multiple FDA approved manufacturing sites outside of the United States.

&#160;

Pursuant to the D&#38;L Agreement, the Hong Kong-based Customer engaged Elite to develop and manufacture a prescription pharmaceutical product (the &#8220;Prescription Product&#8221;), with such development not being successfully completed.

&#160;

For further details on the D&#38;L Agreement, please refer to Exhibit 10.77 to the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on June 29, 2012.

&#160;

Novel Labs Investment 

At the end of 2006, Elite entered into a joint venture with VGS Pharma, LLC (&#8220;VGS&#8221;) and created Novel Laboratories, Inc. (&#8220;Novel&#8221;), a privately-held company specializing in pharmaceutical research, development, manufacturing, licensing, acquisition and marketing of specialty generic pharmaceuticals. Novel's business strategy is to focus on its core strength in identifying and timely executing niche business opportunities in the generic pharmaceutical area. Elite owned less than 10% of the outstanding shares of Class A Voting Common Stock of Novel.

&#160;

Elite commenced an action against VGS, Novel and related parties (collectively, the &#8220;VGS Parties&#8221;) related to the Novel transactions. The action was settled and, pursuant to that settlement, in June 2014, Elite received $5,000,000 from the VGS Parties in exchange for 9,800 shares of Novel Class A common stock owned by Elite. This resolved all disputes and claims between the Company and the VGS Parties and ended the Company&#8217;s ownership in Novel.

&#160;

Other Business Factors and Details 

&#160; 

Government Regulation and Approval 

The design, development and marketing of pharmaceutical compounds, on which our success depends, are intensely regulated by governmental regulatory agencies, in particular the FDA. Non-compliance with applicable requirements can result in fines and other judicially imposed sanctions, including product seizures, injunction actions and criminal prosecution based on products or manufacturing practices that violate statutory requirements. In addition, administrative remedies can involve voluntary withdrawal of products, as well as the refusal of the FDA to approve ANDAs and NDAs. The FDA also has the authority to withdraw approval of drugs in accordance with statutory due process procedures.

&#160; 

Before a drug may be marketed, it must be approved by the FDA either by an NDA or an ANDA, each of which is discussed below.

&#160; 

Please note that, as discussed in &#8220;Discontinued Products&#8221; above, in March 2011, the FDA announced its intention to remove approximately 500 cough/cold and allergy related products from the U.S. market, with such list of 500 products including the Lodrane Extended Release Products. After this announcement by the FDA, the Company&#8217;s customer for the Lodrane Products cancelled all outstanding orders and manufacturing of the Lodrane Products ceased. This cancellation of outstanding orders and the cessation of manufacturing of Lodrane Products had a material adverse effect on revenues for periods beginning subsequent to March 31, 2011.

&#160; 

Lodrane D&#174; which is an immediate release product that is different from the Lodrane Products that were included in the list of products removed from the market by the FDA, is marketed under the Over-the-Counter Monograph (the &#8220;OTC Monograph&#8221;) and accordingly, under the Code of Federal Regulations can be lawfully marketed in the U.S. without prior approval. Under the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act (&#8220;FDCA&#8221;), FDA regulations and statements of FDA policy, certain drug products are permitted to be marketed in the U.S. without prior approval. Within the past few years, the FDA has revised its enforcement policies, significantly limiting the circumstances under which these unapproved products may be marketed. If the FDA determines that a company is distributing an unapproved product that requires approval, the FDA may take enforcement action in a variety of ways, including, without limitation, product seizures and seeking a judicial injunction against distribution.

&#160;

NDAs and NDAs under Section 505(b) of the Drug Price Competition Act 

The FDA approval procedure for an NDA is generally a two-step process. During the Initial Product Development stage, an investigational new drug application (&#8220;IND&#8221;) for each product is filed with the FDA. A 30-day waiting period after the filing of each IND is required by the FDA prior to the commencement of initial clinical testing. If the FDA does not comment on or question the IND within such 30-day period, initial clinical studies may begin. If, however, the FDA has comments or questions, they must be answered to the satisfaction of the FDA before initial clinical testing may begin. In some instances this process could result in substantial delay and expense. Initial clinical studies generally constitute Phase I of the NDA process and are conducted to demonstrate the product tolerance/safety and pharmacokinetic in healthy subjects.

&#160;

After Phase I testing, extensive efficacy and safety studies in patients must be conducted. After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is filed, and its approval, which is required for marketing in the United States, involves an extensive review process by the FDA. The NDA itself is a complicated and detailed application and must include the results of extensive clinical and other testing, the cost of which is substantial. However, the NDA filings contemplated by us, which are already marketed drugs, would be made under Sections 505 (b)(1) or 505 (b)(2) of the Drug Price Competition Act, which do not require certain studies that would otherwise be necessary; accordingly, the development timetable should be shorter. While the FDA is required to review applications within a certain timeframe, during the review process, the FDA frequently requests that additional information be submitted. The effect of such request and subsequent submission can significantly extend the time for the NDA review process. Until an NDA is actually approved, there can be no assurance that the information requested and submitted will be considered adequate by the FDA to justify approval. The packaging and labeling of our developed products are also subject to FDA regulation. It is impossible to anticipate the amount of time that will be needed to obtain FDA approval to market any product.

Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of the product by comparable regulatory authorities in any foreign country must be obtained prior to the commencement of marketing of the product in that country. We intend to conduct all marketing in territories other than the United States through other pharmaceutical companies based in those countries. The approval procedure varies from country to country, can involve additional testing, and the time required may differ from that required for FDA approval. Although there are some procedures for unified filings for certain European countries, in general each country has its own procedures and requirements, many of which are time consuming and expensive. Thus, there can be substantial delays in obtaining required approvals from both the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities after the relevant applications are filed. After such approvals are obtained, further delays may be encountered before the products become commercially available.

&#160;

ANDAs 

The FDA approval procedure for an ANDA differs from the procedure for a NDA in that the FDA waives the requirement of conducting complete clinical studies, although it normally requires bioavailability and/or bioequivalence studies. &#8220;Bioavailability&#8221; indicates the rate and extent of absorption and levels of concentration of a drug product in the blood stream needed to produce a therapeutic effect. &#8220;Bioequivalence&#8221; compares the bioavailability of one drug product with another, and when established, indicates that the rate of absorption and levels of concentration of the active drug substance in the body are equivalent for the generic drug and the previously approved drug. An ANDA may be submitted for a drug on the basis that it is the equivalent of a previously approved drug or, in the case of a new dosage form, is suitable for use for the indications specified.

&#160;

The timing of final FDA approval of an ANDA depends on a variety of factors, including whether the applicant challenges any listed patents for the drug and whether the brand-name manufacturer is entitled to one or more statutory exclusivity periods, during which the FDA may be prohibited from accepting applications for, or approving, generic products. In certain circumstances, a regulatory exclusivity period can extend beyond the life of a patent, and thus block ANDAs from being approved on the patent expiration date.

&#160;

In May 1992, Congress enacted the Generic Drug Enforcement Act of 1992, which allows the FDA to impose debarment and other penalties on individuals and companies that commit certain illegal acts relating to the generic drug approval process. In some situations, the Generic Drug Enforcement Act requires the FDA to not accept or review ANDAs for a period of time from a company or an individual that has committed certain violations. It also provides for temporary denial of approval of applications during the investigation of certain violations that could lead to debarment and also, in more limited circumstances, provides for the suspension of the marketing of approved drugs by the affected company. Lastly, the Generic Drug Enforcement Act allows for civil penalties and withdrawal of previously approved applications. Neither we nor any of our employees have ever been subject to debarment. We do not believe that we receive any services from any debarred person.

&#160;

Controlled Substances 

We are also subject to federal, state, and local laws of general applicability, such as laws relating to working conditions. We are also licensed by, registered with, and subject to periodic inspection and regulation by the Drug Enforcement Agency (&#8220;DEA&#8221;) and New Jersey state agencies, pursuant to federal and state legislation relating to drugs and narcotics. Certain drugs that we currently develop or may develop in the future may be subject to regulations under the Controlled Substances Act and related statutes. As we manufacture such products, we may become subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, which regulates wholesale distributors of prescription drugs.

&#160;

&#160; 19 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

cGMP 

All facilities and manufacturing techniques used for the manufacture of products for clinical use or for sale must be operated in conformity with cGMP regulations issued by the FDA. We engage in manufacturing on a commercial basis for distribution of products, and operate our facilities in accordance with cGMP regulations. If we hire another company to perform contract manufacturing for us, we must ensure that our contractor&#8217;s facilities conform to cGMP regulations.

&#160; 

Compliance with Environmental Laws 

We are subject to comprehensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern, among other things, air polluting emissions, waste water discharges, solid and hazardous waste disposal, and the remediation of contamination associated with current or past generation handling and disposal activities, including the past practices of corporations as to which we are the legal successor or in possession. We do not expect that compliance with such environmental laws will have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position in the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance, however, that future changes in environmental laws or regulations, administrative actions or enforcement actions, or remediation obligations arising under environmental laws will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.

&#160;

Competition 

We have competition with respect to our principal areas of operation. We develop and manufacture generic products, products using controlled-release drug technology, products utilizing abuse deterrent technologies, and we develop and market (either on our own or by license to other companies) generic and proprietary controlled-release and abuse deterrent pharmaceutical products. In both areas, our competition consists of those companies which develop controlled-release, abuse deterrent drugs and alternative drug delivery systems. We do not represent a significant presence in the pharmaceutical industry.

&#160;

An increasing number of pharmaceutical companies have become interested in the development and commercialization of products incorporating advanced or novel drug delivery systems. Some of the major pharmaceutical companies have invested and are continuing to invest significant resources in the development of their own drug delivery systems and technologies and some have invested funds in such specialized drug delivery companies. Many of these companies have greater financial and other resources as well as more experience than we do in commercializing pharmaceutical products. Certain companies have a track record of success in developing controlled-release drugs. Significant among these are, without limitation, Pfizer, Sandoz (a Novartis company), Durect Corporation, Mylan Laboratories, Inc., Par Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Alkermes, Inc., Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd., Impax Laboratories, Inc., and Allergen. Each of these companies has developed expertise in certain types of drug delivery systems, although such expertise does not carry over to developing a controlled-release version of all drugs. Such companies may develop new drug formulations and products or may improve existing drug formulations and products more efficiently than we can. In addition, almost all of our competitors have vastly greater resources than we do. While our product development capabilities and, if obtained, patent protection may help us to maintain our market position in the field of advanced drug delivery, there can be no assurance that others will not be able to develop such capabilities or alternative technologies outside the scope of our patents, if any, or that even if patent protection is obtained, such patents will not be successfully challenged in the future.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

In addition to competitors that are developing products based on drug delivery technologies, there are also companies that have announced that they are developing opioid abuse-deterrent products that might compete directly or indirectly with Elite&#8217;s products. These include, but are not limited to Pfizer Inc., Pain Therapeutics (which has an agreement with Durect Corporation and Pfizer Inc.), Collegium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Purdue Pharma LP, and Acura Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

&#160;

We also face competition in the generic pharmaceutical market. The principal competitive factors in the generic pharmaceutical market include: (i) introduction of other generic drug manufacturers&#8217; products in direct competition with our products under development, (ii) introduction of authorized generic products in direct competition with any of our products under development, particularly if such products are approved and sold during exclusivity periods, (iii) consolidation among distribution outlets through mergers and acquisitions and the formation of buying groups, (iv) ability of generic competitors to quickly enter the market after the expiration of patents or exclusivity periods, diminishing the amount and duration of significant profits, (v) the willingness of generic drug customers, including wholesale and retail customers, to switch among pharmaceutical manufacturers, (vi) pricing pressures and product deletions by competitors, (vii) a company&#8217;s reputation as a manufacturer and distributor of quality products, (viii) a company&#8217;s level of service (including maintaining sufficient inventory levels for timely deliveries), (ix) product appearance and labeling and (x) a company&#8217;s breadth of product offerings.

&#160; 

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials; Manufacturing 

A significant portion of our raw materials may be available only from foreign sources. Foreign sources can be subject to the special risks of doing business abroad, including:

&#160;

&#183; greater possibility for disruption due to transportation or communication problems; &#183; the relative instability of some foreign governments and economies; &#183; interim price volatility based on labor unrest, materials or equipment shortages, export duties, restrictions on the transfer of funds, or fluctuations in currency exchange rates; and &#183; uncertainty regarding recourse to a dependable legal system for the enforcement of contracts and other rights. &#160;

Please see the Risk Factor in Part I, Item 1A entitled &#8220;We are dependent on a small number of suppliers for our raw materials and any delay or unavailability of raw materials can materially adversely affect our ability to produce products&#8221;.

&#160;

While we currently obtain the raw materials that we need from over 20 suppliers, some materials used in our products are currently available from only one supplier or a limited number of suppliers. The FDA requires identification of raw material suppliers in applications for approval of drug products. If raw materials were unavailable from a specified supplier, FDA approval of a new supplier could delay the manufacture of the drug involved.

&#160;

We have acquired pharmaceutical manufacturing equipment for manufacturing our products. We have registered our facilities with the FDA and the DEA.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Dependence on One or a Few Major Customers 

Each year we have had one or a few customers that have accounted for a large percentage of our limited revenues therefore the termination of a contract with a customer may result in the loss of substantially all of our revenues. We are constantly working to develop new relationships with existing or new customers, but despite these efforts we may not, at the time that any of our current contracts expire, have other contracts in place generating similar or material revenue. We have agreements with Epic, Precision Dose and Ascend for the sales and distribution of products that we manufacture. We receive revenues to manufacture these products and also receive a profit split or royalties based on in-market sales of the products. Please see the Risk Factor in Part I, Item 1A entitled &#8220;We depend on a limited number of customers and any reduction, delay or cancellation of an order from these customers or the loss of any of these customers could cause our revenue to decline.&#8221;

&#160;

Employees 

As of June 7, 2016, we had 35 full time employees. Full-time employees are engaged in operations, administration, research and development. None of our employees is represented by a labor union and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We believe our relationship with our employees to be good. However, our ability to achieve our financial and operational objectives depends in large part upon our continuing ability to attract, integrate, retain and motivate highly qualified personnel, and upon the continued service of our senior management and key personnel.
