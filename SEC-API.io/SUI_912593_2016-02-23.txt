 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

GENERAL 

Sun Communities, Inc., a Maryland corporation, and all wholly-owned or majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries, including Sun Communities Operating Limited Partnership, a Michigan limited partnership (the &#8220;Operating Partnership&#8221;), and Sun Home Services, Inc. ("SHS") are referred to herein as the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221;. We are a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust (&#8220;REIT&#8221;). 

We are a fully integrated real estate company which, together with our affiliates and predecessors, have been in the business of acquiring, operating, developing, and expanding manufactured housing ("MH") and recreational vehicle ("RV") communities since 1975. We lease individual parcels of land (&#8220;sites&#8221;) with utility access for placement of manufactured homes and RVs to our customers. We are also engaged through a taxable subsidiary, SHS, in the marketing, selling, and leasing of new and pre-owned homes to current and future residents in our communities. The operations of SHS support and enhance our occupancy levels, property performance, and cash flows. 

We own, operate, and develop MH and RV communities throughout the United States ("U.S."). As of December 31, 2015 , we owned and operated a portfolio of 231 &#32;properties located in 30 &#32;states (collectively, the &#8220;Properties&#8221;), including 185 &#32;MH communities, 36 &#32;RV communities, and 10 &#32;Properties containing both MH and RV sites. As of December 31, 2015 , the Properties contained an aggregate of 88,612 &#32;developed sites comprised of 69,682 &#32;developed MH sites, 9,559 &#32;annual RV sites (inclusive of both annual and seasonal usage rights), 9,371 &#32;transient RV sites, and approximately 7,181 &#32;additional MH and RV sites suitable for development. 

Our executive and principal property management office is located at 27777 Franklin Road, Suite 200, Southfield, Michigan 48034 and our telephone number is (248) 208-2500. We have regional property management offices located in Austin, Texas; San Antonio, Texas; Dayton, Ohio; Grand Rapids, Michigan; Elkhart, Indiana; Indianapolis, Indiana; Traverse City, Michigan; Charlotte, North Carolina; Denver, Colorado; Ft. Myers, Florida; and Orlando, Florida; and we employed an aggregate of 1,790 &#32;full and part time employees as of December 31, 2015 . 

Our website address is www.suncommunities.com &#32;and we make available, free of charge, on or through our website all of our periodic reports, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K, as soon as reasonably practicable after we file such reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). 

STRUCTURE OF THE COMPANY 

The Operating Partnership is structured as an umbrella partnership REIT, or UPREIT. In 1993, we contributed our net assets to the Operating Partnership in exchange for the sole general partner interest in the Operating Partnership and the majority of all the Operating Partnership&#8217;s initial capital. We substantially conduct our operations through the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership owns, either directly or indirectly through other subsidiaries, all of our assets. This UPREIT structure enables us to comply with certain complex requirements under the federal tax rules and regulations applicable to REITs, and to acquire MH and RV communities in transactions that defer some or all of the sellers&#8217; tax consequences. The financial results of the Operating Partnership and our other subsidiaries are consolidated in our Consolidated Financial Statements. The financial results include certain activities that do not necessarily qualify as REIT activities under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#8220;Code&#8221;). We have formed taxable REIT subsidiaries, as defined in the Code, to engage in such activities. We use taxable REIT subsidiaries to offer certain services to our residents and engage in activities that would not otherwise be permitted under the REIT rules if provided directly by us or by the Operating Partnership. The taxable REIT subsidiaries include our home sales business, SHS, which provides manufactured home sales, leasing, and other services to current and prospective tenants of the Properties. 

Under the partnership agreement, the Operating Partnership is structured to make distributions with respect to certain of the Operating Partnership units ("OP units") at the same time that distributions are made to our common stockholders. The Operating Partnership is structured to permit limited partners holding certain classes or series of OP units to exchange those OP units for shares of our common stock (in a taxable transaction) and achieve liquidity for their investment. 

As the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, we generally have the power to manage and have complete control over the conduct of the Operating Partnership's affairs and all decisions or actions made or taken by us as the general partner pursuant to the partnership agreement are generally binding upon all of the partners and the Operating Partnership. 

SUN COMMUNITIES, INC. 

We do not own all of the OP units. As of December 31, 2015 , the Operating Partnership had issued and outstanding:

&#8226;

finally, the common OP units. 

Common OP Units 

Subject to certain limitations, the holder of each common OP unit at its option may convert such common OP unit at any time into one share of our common stock. Holders of common OP units are entitled to receive distributions from the Operating Partnership as and when declared by the general partner, provided that all accrued distributions payable on OP units ranking senior to the common OP units have been paid. The holders of common OP units generally receive distributions on the same dates and in amounts equal to the distributions paid to holders of our common stock. 

Aspen Preferred OP Units 

Subject to certain limitations, at any time prior to January 1, 2024, the holder of each Aspen preferred OP unit at its option may convert such Aspen preferred OP unit into: (a) if the market price of our common stock is $68.00 per share or less, 0.397 common OP units, or (b) if the market price of our common stock is greater than $68.00 per share, the number of common OP units determined by dividing (i) the sum of (A) $27.00 plus (B) 25% of the amount by which the market price of our common stock exceeds $68.00 per share, by (ii) the per-share market price of our common stock. The holders of Aspen preferred OP units are entitled to receive distributions not less than quarterly. Distributions on Aspen preferred OP units are generally paid on the same dates as distributions are paid to holders of common OP units. Each Aspen preferred OP unit is entitled to receive distributions in an amount equal to the product of (x) $27.00, multiplied by (y) an annual rate equal to the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond yield plus 239 basis points; provided, however, that the aggregate distribution rate shall not be less than 6.5% nor more than 9%. On January 2, 2024, we are required to redeem all Aspen preferred OP units that have not been converted to common OP units. In addition, we are required to redeem the Aspen preferred OP units of any holder thereof within five days after receipt of a written demand during the existence of certain uncured Aspen preferred OP unit defaults, including our failure to pay distributions on the Aspen preferred OP units when due and our failure to provide certain security for the payment of distributions on the Aspen preferred OP units. We may also redeem Aspen preferred OP units from time to time if we and the holder thereof agree to do so. 

SUN COMMUNITIES, INC. 

Series A-1 Preferred OP Units 

Subject to certain limitations, the holder of each Series A-1 preferred OP unit at its option may exchange such Series A-1 preferred OP unit at any time into 2.439 shares of our common stock (which exchange rate is subject to adjustment upon stock splits, recapitalizations, and similar events). The holders of Series A-1 preferred OP units are entitled to receive distributions not less than quarterly. Distributions on Series A-1 preferred OP units are generally paid on the same dates as distributions are paid to holders of common OP units. Each Series A-1 preferred OP unit is entitled to receive distributions in an amount equal to the product of $100.00 multiplied by an annual rate equal to 6.0%. Series A-1 preferred OP units do not have any voting or consent rights on any matter requiring the consent or approval of the Operating Partnership's limited partners. 

Series A-3 Preferred OP Units 

Subject to certain limitations, the holder of each Series A-3 preferred OP unit at its option may exchange such Series A-3 preferred OP unit at any time into 1.8605 shares of our common stock (which exchange rate is subject to adjustment upon stock splits, recapitalizations, and similar events). The holders of Series A-3 preferred OP units are entitled to receive distributions not less than quarterly. Each Series A-3 preferred OP unit is entitled to receive distributions in an amount equal to the product of $100.00 multiplied by an annual rate equal to 4.5%. Series A-3 preferred OP units do not have any voting or consent rights on any matter requiring the consent or approval of the Operating Partnership's limited partners. 

Series A-4 Preferred OP Units 

In connection with the issuance of our 6.50% Series A-4 Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (the "Series A-4 Preferred Stock&#8221;) in November 2014, the Operating Partnership created the Series A-4 preferred OP units as a new class of OP units. Series A-4 preferred OP units have economic and other rights and preferences substantially similar to those of the Series A-4 Preferred Stock, including rights to receive distributions at the same time and in the same amounts as distributions paid on Series A-4 Preferred Stock. Each Series A-4 preferred OP unit is exchangeable into approximately 0.4444 shares of common stock or common OP units (which exchange rate is subject to adjustment upon stock splits, recapitalizations, and similar events). The Operating Partnership issued Series A-4 preferred OP units to us in connection with our acquisition of the American Land Lease ("ALL") portfolio of MH communities from Green Courte Real Estate Partners, LLC, Green Courte Real Estate Partners II, LLC, Green Courte Real Estate Partners III, LLC and certain of their affiliated entities (collectively, the "Green Courte parties" or the "Green Courte entities"). In 2014, we issued 669,449 Series A-4 preferred OP units to the sellers &#32; as consideration for the ALL acquisition. In January 2015, we issued 200,000 Series A-4 Preferred OP units in a private placement in connection with the ALL acquisition. In June 2015, we issued 34,219 Series A-4 preferred OP units to GCP Fund III Ancillary Holding, LLC. In July 2015, we repurchased 4,066,586 Series A-4 preferred OP units. At December 31, 2015 we hold 2,067,091 &#32;Series A-4 preferred OP units. The rights of the 2,067,091 &#32;Series A-4 preferred OP units held by us mirror the economic rights of the Series A-4 preferred OP units issued to the Green Courte entities, but certain voting, consent, and other rights do not apply to the Series A-4 preferred OP units held by us. 

If certain change of control transactions occur or if our common stock ceases to be listed or quoted on an exchange or quotation system, then at any time after November 26, 2019, we or the holders of shares of Series A-4 Preferred Stock and Series A-4 preferred OP units may cause all or any of those shares or units to be redeemed for cash at a redemption price equal to the sum of (i) the greater of (x) the amount that the redeemed shares of Series A-4 Preferred Stock and Series A-4 preferred OP units would have received in such transaction if they had been converted into shares of our common stock immediately prior to such transaction, or (y) $25.00 &#32;per share, plus (ii) any accrued and unpaid distributions thereon to, but not including, the redemption date. 

7.125% Series A OP Units 

In connection with the issuance of our 7.125% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock ("Series A Preferred Stock") in November 2012, the Operating Partnership created the 7.125% Series A OP units as a new class of OP units. All of the outstanding 7.125% Series A OP units are held by us and they have rights, preferences, and other terms substantially similar to the Series A Preferred Stock, including rights to receive distributions at the same time and in the same amounts as distributions paid on Series A Preferred Stock. The Operating Partnership issued the 7.125% Series A OP units to us in consideration of our contributing to the Operating Partnership the net proceeds of our November 2012 offering of shares of Series A Preferred Stock. 

Series B-3 Preferred OP Units 

SUN COMMUNITIES, INC. 

Series B-3 preferred OP units are not convertible. The holders of Series B-3 preferred OP units generally receive distributions on the same dates as distributions are paid to holders of common OP units. Each Series B-3 preferred OP unit is entitled to receive distributions in an amount equal to the product of $100.00 multiplied by an annual rate equal to 8.0%. As of December 31, 2015, there were outstanding 36,700 Series B-3 preferred OP units which were issued on December 1, 2002, 33,450 Series B-3 preferred OP units which were issued on January 1, 2003, and 42,250 Series B-3 preferred OP units which were issued on January 5, 2004. Subject to certain limitations, (x) during the 90-day period beginning on each of the tenth through fifteenth anniversaries of the issue date of the applicable Series B-3 preferred OP units, (y) at any time after the fifteenth anniversary of the issue date of the applicable Series B-3 preferred OP units, or (z) after our receipt of notice of the death of the electing holder of a Series B-3 preferred OP unit, each holder of Series B-3 preferred OP units may require us to redeem such holder's Series B-3 preferred OP units at the redemption price of $100.00 per unit. In addition, at any time after the fifteenth anniversary of the issue date of the applicable Series B-3 preferred OP units we may redeem, at our option, all of the Series B-3 preferred OP units of any holder thereof at the redemption price of $100.00 per unit. Series B-3 preferred OP units do not have any voting or consent rights on any matter requiring the consent or approval of the Operating Partnership's limited partners. 

Series C Preferred OP Units 

Subject to certain limitations, the holder of each Series C preferred OP unit at its option may exchange such Series C preferred OP unit at any time into 1.11 shares of our common stock (which exchange rate is subject to adjustment upon stock splits, recapitalizations, and similar events). The holders of Series C preferred OP units are entitled to receive distributions not less than quarterly. Each Series C preferred OP unit is entitled to receive distributions in an amount equal to the product of $100.00 multiplied by an annual rate equal to (i) 4.0% until April 1, 2016, (ii) 4.5% from April 1, 2016 until April 1, 2019, and (c) 5.0% after April 1, 2019. Series C preferred OP units do not have any voting or consent rights on any matter requiring the consent or approval of the Operating Partnership's limited partners. 

REAL PROPERTY OPERATIONS 

Properties are designed and improved for several home options of various sizes and designs and consist of both MH communities and RV communities. 

A MH community is a residential subdivision designed and improved with sites for the placement of manufactured homes, related improvements, and amenities. Manufactured homes are detached, single&#8209;family homes which are produced off&#8209;site by manufacturers and installed on sites within the community. Manufactured homes are available in a wide array of designs, providing owners with a level of customization generally unavailable in other forms of multi-family housing developments. 

Modern manufactured housing communities contain improvements similar to other garden&#8209;style residential developments, including centralized entrances, paved streets, curbs and gutters, and parkways. In addition, these communities also often provide a number of amenities, such as a clubhouse, a swimming pool, shuffleboard courts, tennis courts, and laundry facilities. 

A RV community is a resort or park designed and improved with sites for the placement of RVs for varied lengths of time. Properties may also provide vacation rental homes. RV communities include a number of amenities, such as restaurants, golf courses, swimming pools, tennis courts, fitness centers, planned activities, and spacious social facilities. 

The owner of each home on our Properties leases the site on which the home is located. We own the underlying land, utility connections, streets, lighting, driveways, common area amenities, and other capital improvements and are responsible for enforcement of community guidelines and maintenance. Some of the Properties provide water and sewer service through public or private utilities, while others provide these services to residents from on&#8209;site facilities. Each owner of a home within our Properties is responsible for the maintenance of the home and leased site. As a result, our capital expenditure needs tend to be less significant relative to multi&#8209;family rental apartment complexes. 

PROPERTY MANAGEMENT 

Our property management strategy emphasizes intensive, hands&#8209;on management by dedicated, on&#8209;site district and community managers. We believe that this on&#8209;site focus enables us to continually monitor and address resident concerns, the performance of competitive properties, and local market conditions. As of December 31, 2015 , we employed 1,790 &#32;full and part time employees, of which 1,511 were located on&#8209;site as property managers, support staff, or maintenance personnel. 

Our community managers are overseen by John B. McLaren, our President and Chief Operating Officer, who has been in the manufactured housing industry since 1995, four Senior Vice Presidents of Operations and Sales, five Division Vice Presidents and 

SUN COMMUNITIES, INC. 

25 Regional Vice Presidents. The Regional Vice Presidents are responsible for semi-annual market surveys of competitive communities, interaction with local manufactured home dealers, regular property inspections, and oversight of property operations and sales functions for eight to twelve properties. 

Each district or community manager performs regular inspections in order to continually monitor the Property&#8217;s physical condition and to effectively address tenant concerns. In addition to a district or community manager, each district or property has on-site maintenance personnel and management support staff. We hold mandatory training sessions for all new property management personnel to ensure that management policies and procedures are executed effectively and professionally. All of our property management personnel participate in on-going training to ensure that changes to management policies and procedures are implemented consistently. We offer 145 courses for our team members through our Sun University, which has led to increased knowledge and accountability for daily operations and policies and procedures. 

HOME SALES AND RENTALS 

SHS is engaged in the marketing, selling and leasing of new and pre-owned homes to current and future residents in our communities. Since tenants often purchase a home already on-site within a community, such services enhance occupancy and property performance. Additionally, because many of the homes on the Properties are sold through SHS, better control of home quality in our communities can be maintained than if sales services were conducted solely through third-party brokers. SHS also leases homes to prospective tenants. At December 31, 2015 , SHS had 10,685 &#32;occupied leased homes in its portfolio. New homes are also purchased for the Rental Program. Leases associated with the Rental Program generally have a term of one year. The Rental Program requires intensive management of costs associated with repair and refurbishment of these homes as the tenants vacate and the homes are re-leased, similar to apartment rentals. We received approximately 47,000 applications during 2015 &#32;to live in our Properties, providing a significant "resident boarding" system allowing us to market purchasing a home to the best applicants and to rent to the remainder of approved applicants. Through the Rental Program we are able to demonstrate our product and lifestyle to the renters, while monitoring their payment history and converting qualified renters to owners. 

REGULATIONS AND INSURANCE 

General 

MH and RV community properties are subject to various laws, ordinances and regulations, including regulations relating to recreational facilities such as swimming pools, clubhouses, and other common areas. We believe that each Property has the necessary operating permits and approvals. 

Insurance 

Our management believes that the Properties are covered by adequate fire, flood (where appropriate), property, and business interruption insurance provided by reputable companies with commercially reasonable deductibles and limits. We maintain a blanket policy that covers all of our Properties. We have obtained title insurance insuring fee title to the Properties in an aggregate amount which we believe to be adequate. Claims made to our insurance carriers that are determined to be recoverable are classified in other receivables as incurred. 

SITE LEASES OR USAGE RIGHTS 

The typical lease we enter into with a tenant for the rental of a manufactured home site is month&#8209;to&#8209;month or year&#8209;to&#8209;year, renewable upon the consent of both parties, or, in some instances, as provided by statute. Certain of our leases, mainly Florida properties, are tied to consumer price index or other indices as it relates to rent increase. Generally, market rate adjustments are made on an annual basis. These leases are cancelable for non&#8209;payment of rent, violation of community rules and regulations or other specified defaults. During the five calendar years ended December 31, 2015 , on average 2.4% of the homes in our communities have been removed by their owners and 5% of the homes have been sold by their owners to a new owner who then assumes rental obligations as a community resident. The cost to move a home is approximately $4,000 to $10,000. The average resident remains in our communities for approximately 12 years, while the average home, which gives rise to the rental stream, remains in our communities for approximately 50 years.
