 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Overview 

We are the leading platform solution for the connected home. Through our cloud-based services, we make connected home technology broadly accessible to millions of home and business owners. Our multi-tenant software-as-a-service, or SaaS, platform enables home and business owners to intelligently secure their properties and automate and control a broad array of connected devices through a single, intuitive user interface. 

Our connected home platform currently has more than 2.6 million residential and business subscribers and connects to tens of millions of devices. More than 20 billion data points were generated and processed by those subscribers and devices in the last year alone. We believe that this scale of subscribers, devices and data makes us the leader in the smart home services market. 

Our solutions are delivered through an established network of over 5,000 trusted service providers, who are experts at designing, selling, installing and supporting our solutions. 

We primarily generate SaaS and license revenue, our largest source of revenue, through our service providers who resell our services and pay us monthly fees. Our service providers have indicated that they typically have three to five-year service contracts with home or business owners, whom we call subscribers. We believe that the length of these contracts, combined with our SaaS model and over a decade of operating experience, provides us with reasonable visibility into our future operating results. In addition, we generate hardware and other revenue primarily by selling our service providers and distributors an Alarm.com gateway module that enables cellular communications between the devices installed in the home or business and our cloud-based platform. We also sell other hardware devices, such as video cameras as part of our video monitoring solution. 

We have experienced significant growth since inception. We generated total revenue of $208.9 million , $167.3 million and $130.2 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013. Our SaaS and license revenue was $140.9 million , $111.5 million and $82.6 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, representing a compound annual growth rate of approximately 31%. We also generated net income of $11.8 million , $13.5 million and $4.5 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, as well as Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP metric, of $34.3 million , $28.3 million and $28.3 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013. See footnote 4 to the table contained in the section of this Annual Report titled &#8220;Selected Consolidated Financial Data&#8221; for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. 

Our Solutions and Integrated Platform 

Our technology platform was purpose-built for the entire connected home ecosystem, including the consumers who use it, the service providers who deliver it and the hardware partners whose devices are enabled by the platform. Our solutions are used by both home and business owners, and we refer to this market as the connected home market. 

We invented solutions that connect people in new ways with their properties and devices, making them safer, smarter and more efficient. Our scalable, flexible platform is designed to meet a wide range of user needs with its breadth of services, depth of feature capability and broad support for the growing Internet of Things devices in the home.

Web and mobile apps integrate with connected thermostats, power meters, lights, shades and appliances to control devices and manage temperature as well as provide real-time insights into home energy usage and efficiency. The capabilities associated with this solution include: 

&#9702; 

Smart Thermostat Schedules. System activity patterns are analyzed over time to recommend a more energy efficient thermostat schedule that can maximize efficiency during periods when the property is not likely to be occupied. 

&#9702; 

Responsive Savings . The thermostats can respond to other devices and sensors in the home to reduce energy waste and improve efficiency. When the security system is armed away, an arming state used when the property is not occupied, the thermostat can automatically go back to an energy saving mode. If a door or window is left open, after a pre-defined period of time, then the HVAC system can be set to automatically turn off to reduce energy waste. 

&#9702; 

Energy Usage Monitoring. Real-time and historical energy usage data at the whole-home or business and individual device level gives users greater insight into the property&#8217;s energy consumption profile to drive more efficient use of energy-consuming devices in and around the home or business. 

&#9702; 

Thermodynamic Modeling . &#160; Each home or business has a unique fingerprint with respect to energy usage for heating and cooling. Our algorithms analyze HVAC data, weather information and other factors to determine the unique heating and cooling attributes of a property and use this information as a foundation for smarter thermostat programming and other energy efficiency recommendations. 

&#9702; 

Geo-Service . The location of users further calibrates and optimizes thermostat settings, enabling effortless energy management with changes happening automatically without need for a user action or rigid schedule. 

&#9702; 

Demand Response . Homes and businesses with connected thermostats and other connected appliances can be accessed to reduce power consumption during peak demand periods.

Our addressable market consists of residential homes and businesses. We believe that the major technology trends of cloud computing, the Internet of Things, Mobile Access and Big Data will dramatically change the ability for people to control and access their homes and businesses and provide new insights into the activity and efficiency of those properties. These trends have already made connected services and devices broadly available and affordable for households and businesses across North America. These large technology trends are also making these connected services and devices accessible and relevant to households and small businesses worldwide. 

Our residential subscribers are typically owners of single-family homes, while our business subscribers include retail businesses, restaurants, small-scale commercial facilities, offices of professional services providers and similar businesses. According to a new market research report, "Internet of Things (IoT) Security Market by Technologies, Industry Verticals and Applications - Global Forecast to 2020", published by MarketsandMarkets, the Internet of Things (IoT) Security Market is expected to grow from USD $7 Billion in 2015 to USD $29 Billion by 2020, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 33.2% from 2015 to 2020. According the U.S. Census, there were 133 million housing units in 2014, however, according to April 2015 data from Parks Associates, smart home controller penetration was only at 7.8% of U.S. households in 2014. According to Parks Associates research data, there were 22.5 million US households with a professionally monitored home security system in 2015 and this is projected to grow to 29.9 million households by 2020. We believe there is an opportunity for penetration rates to significantly increase, largely driven by the mass market adoption of connected home solutions by households with no solution today. In addition, we believe there are commonalities between the residential and business markets for these services, and the business market therefore represents a sizable related opportunity.

Our solutions are sold, installed and serviced by a network of professional, licensed service providers. We have developed an extensive professional service provider channel in North America consisting of over 5,000 service providers. Our service provider network is highly effective at account creation, installation and ongoing monitoring and has extended the traditional home security business model to include connected home and business services. We believe this highly trusted, established network is a core strategic strength that enables an efficient, scalable customer acquisition model and allows us to focus on technology innovation. 

&#32;10 

Our service providers today are primarily licensed and authorized security dealers ranging from small, local providers to larger regional providers to national service providers with thousands of employees. With a strong reputation for trust and established practice of in-home installation and ongoing professional monitoring, our service providers are driving the adoption of connected home solutions through their established businesses and now serve as connected home solution providers. According to a 2015 report from Parks Associates, security and safety continue to be the leading features driving smart home adoption. To help drive adoption, we have developed powerful tools enabling our service providers to more effectively sell, install and manage our connected home solutions. We believe that the combination of our solutions and our service providers, with their strong pedigree in security, is the most effective way to drive mass market adoption of the connected home. 

Our channels increasingly include new providers in the intelligent automation, HVAC and property management markets as well as service providers in international markets. 

The traditional security and home automation market is highly fragmented with over 13,000 dealers nationally. According to the February 2015 Barnes Buchanan Conference Report, the top 5 service providers represented 36% of all industry recurring monthly revenue in 2014. The distribution of revenue among our service providers is reflective of the industry overall. Vivint represented greater than 10% but not more than 15% of our revenue in 2014 and 2013. Monitronics International, Inc. represented greater than 15% but not more than 20% of our revenue in 2015, 2014 and 2013. United Technologies Corporation represented greater than 10% but not more than 15% of our revenue in 2014. 

Subscribers 

We define our subscribers as the number of residential or commercial properties to which we are delivering at least one of our solutions. A subscriber who subscribes to one of our service level packages as well as one or more of our a la carte add-ons is counted as one subscriber. The number of subscribers represents our number of subscribers, rounded to the nearest thousand, on the last day of the applicable year. Our number of subscribers does not include the customers of our service providers to whom we license our intellectual property as they do not utilize our SaaS platform. While fewer than 1% of subscribers utilize a commercial service plan, we do not have exact data regarding the actual number of commercial properties utilizing our services. 

We classify our subscribers into two groups: standard subscribers, which represented approximately three-quarters of our total subscriber base as of December 31, 2015, and other subscribers, which represented approximately a quarter of our total subscriber base as of the same date. For our standard subscribers, our service providers pay us on a per subscriber basis for access to our cloud-based connected home solution, to provide a supervised cellular network service to the home or business, and to deliver an enterprise back-end software service. Our other subscribers are comprised of carrier operated subscribers where the service provider utilizes its own cellular network or partners with a cellular network provider. As we continue to expand our business into new markets or acquire businesses with different business models as was the case with our acquisition of EnergyHub, in the future our other subscribers may include subscribers where we offer a basic service for no monthly fee with the option to upgrade the service for a monthly fee or where we generate revenue from the subscriber by other means. 

As of December 31, 2015, we had more than 2.6 million subscribers. Our subscriber acquisition cost payback period has historically been less than one year. 

Sales and Marketing 

The goal of our sales team is to help our service providers be successful in selling, installing and supporting the full suite of our solutions. Our sales team is also responsible for recruiting new service providers to Alarm.com. We also have a business development team dedicated to developing new service provider and distribution relationships in international markets. 

Our marketing team is focused on empowering our service providers to most effectively promote and sell our connected home solutions. We have developed a high value, highly scalable marketing services platform to serve the breadth of our service providers both large and small. We design, develop and provide end-to-end marketing services through our integrated marketing solution, which includes tools and content for end-to-end lifecycle marketing to build awareness, create interest, drive trials, activate subscribers, develop the ongoing customer relationship and drive upsell. This solution is highly scalable and flexible with smaller service providers leveraging the full suite of marketing services and larger service providers adopting specific elements to enhance their existing marketing activities. We also provide comprehensive training through our Alarm.com Academy that includes sales and marketing and technical training courses through in-person classes and an always-available online learning management system. 

Additionally, we manage targeted consumer marketing campaigns on behalf of our service provider network to increase awareness of the connected home, raise overall awareness and preference for Alarm.com solutions and drive prospective customers to our service providers. 

We believe our sales and marketing approach enables us to expand our breadth of service providers, provide highly custom services and scale quickly with only incremental costs. As of December 31, 2015, we had a total of 188 employees engaged in sales and marketing functions. 

Service Provider Support 

&#32;11 

We have a dedicated service operations team that strives to deliver an exceptional service experience to our service providers and our subscribers. We support the full suite of software and hardware on the Alarm.com platform through a highly trained and experienced team of United States based professionals using a tiered structure to efficiently escalate and resolve issues of varying complexity. This structure enables us to scale our organization in line with service provider and subscriber growth while building on our reputation as a source for answers in the connected home industry. We offer support via phone, web ticketing, and email for our service providers and maintain a commitment to industry-leading response times. While we primarily support our service providers and in turn the service providers provide support to their customers, who are our subscribers, we are committed to delivering a great end-user experience. To that end, subscribers may sometimes reach us directly with service concerns or questions, and we either assist the subscriber directly or, when appropriate, route the subscriber to his or her applicable service provider for additional assistance. Our staff is multilingual and we continue to grow our language capabilities to support our emerging international initiatives. 

Our Competition 

The market for connected home solutions is fragmented, highly competitive and constantly evolving. We expect competition to continue from existing competitors as well as potential new market entrants. Our current primary competitors include providers of other technology platforms for the connected home, including iControl Networks, Inc. and Honeywell International Inc. that sell to dealers such as cable operators and other home automation providers. In addition, our service providers compete with managed service providers, such as cable television, telephone and security companies like Comcast Corporation, AT&#38;T Inc. and Time Warner Cable Inc., as well as providers of point products, including Nest Labs, Inc. (acquired by Google Inc.), which offers a thermostat, and Nest Cam, which offers video monitoring. Because our service providers compete with these entities, we consider them competitive. 

In addition, we may in the future compete with other large technology companies that offer control capabilities among their products, applications and services, and have ongoing development efforts to address the broader connected home market. Such companies may have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution or other resources and greater name recognition than we do. In some instances, we may have commercial partnerships with technology or services providers in the connected home market with whom we may otherwise compete and our relationships with both our competitors and partners may change through time. 

We expect to encounter new competitors as we enter new markets as well as increased competition, both domestically and internationally, from other established and emerging security, home automation and energy management companies. Our current and potential competitors may also establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties and rapidly acquire significant market share. 

We believe the principal competitive factors in the connected home market include the following: 

&#8226; simplicity and ease of use; 

&#8226; ability to offer persistent awareness, control and intelligent automation; 

&#8226; breadth of features and functionality provided on the connected home platform; 

&#8226; flexibility of the solutions and ability to personalize for the individual consumer; 

&#8226; compatibility with a wide selection of third-party devices; 

&#8226; pricing, affordability and accessibility; 

&#8226; sales reach and local installation and support capabilities; and 

&#8226; brand awareness and reputation. 

We believe that we compete favorably with respect to each of these factors. In addition, we believe that our cloud-based software platform, connected home solutions and proven scalability help further differentiate us from competitors. Nevertheless, our competitors may have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, greater name recognition, larger sales and marketing budgets and broader distribution channels than we do. 

Our Intellectual Property 

Our success and ability to compete effectively depend in part on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and to establish and adequately protect our intellectual property rights. To accomplish these objectives, we rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as license agreements, confidentiality agreements and other contractual protections. 

As of December 31, 2015, we owned 50 issued United States patents that are scheduled to expire between 2021 and 2034. We continue to file patent applications and as of December 31, 2015, we had 48 pending utility patent applications and 27 provisional patent applications filed in the United States. We also had five pending patent applications in Canada and three 

&#32;12 

international patent applications pending under the Patent Cooperation Treaty. The claims for which we have sought patent protection apply to both our platform and solutions. Our patent and patent applications generally apply to the features and functions of our platform, and solutions and the applications associated with our platform. We also have, and may be required to seek, licenses under patents or intellectual property rights owned by third parties, including open-source software and other commercially available software. 

We also rely on several registered and unregistered trademarks to protect our brand. We have 16 registered trademarks in the United States, including Alarm.com and the Alarm.com logo and design, and three registered trademarks in Canada. 

We seek to protect our intellectual property rights by requiring our employees and independent contractors involved in development to enter into agreements acknowledging that all inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship, developments, concepts, processes, improvements and other works generated by them on our behalf are our intellectual property, and assigning to us any rights, including intellectual property rights, that they may claim in those works. 

We expect that products in our industry may be subject to third-party infringement lawsuits as the number of competitors grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps. We have brought infringement claims against third parties in the past and may do so in the future to defend our intellectual property position. In addition, from time to time, we may face claims by third parties that we infringe upon or misappropriate their intellectual property rights, and we may be found to be infringing upon or to have misappropriated such rights. In the future, we, or our service providers or subscribers, may be the subject of legal proceedings alleging that our solutions or underlying technology infringe or violate the intellectual property rights of others. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 507 full-time employees. We also engage consultants and temporary employees. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
