 Item 1. Business. Overview 

Terreno Realty Corporation (&#147;Terreno&#148;, and together with its subsidiaries, &#147;we&#148;, &#147;us&#148;, &#147;our&#148;, &#147;our company&#148; or &#147;the company&#148;) acquires, owns and operates industrial real estate in six major coastal U.S. markets: Los Angeles; Northern New Jersey/New York City; San Francisco Bay Area; Seattle; Miami; and Washington, D.C./Baltimore. We invest in several types of industrial real estate, including warehouse/distribution (approximately 92.2% of our total portfolio square footage as of December 31, 2015), flex (including light industrial and research and development, or R&#38;D) (approximately 6.3%) and trans-shipment (approximately 1.5%). We target functional buildings in infill locations that may be shared by multiple tenants and that cater to customer demand within the various submarkets in which we operate. Infill locations are geographic locations surrounded by high concentrations of already developed land and existing buildings. As of December 31, 2015, we owned 148 buildings (including one building held for sale) aggregating approximately 11.1 million square feet, one redevelopment property expected to contain approximately 0.2 million square feet and two improved land parcels consisting of 3.5 acres, which we purchased for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.1 billion. As of December 31, 2015, our properties were approximately 91.5% leased to 352 customers, the largest of which accounted for approximately 4.4% of our total annualized base rent. 

We are an internally managed Maryland corporation. We were incorporated in November 2009 and on February 16, 2010 we completed our initial public offering of 8,750,000 shares of our common stock and a concurrent private placement of an aggregate of 350,000 shares of our common stock to our executive officers. 

We elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2010. 

Our Investment Strategy 

We acquire, own and operate in industrial properties in six major coastal U.S. markets: Los Angeles; Northern New Jersey/New York City; San Francisco Bay Area; Seattle; Miami; and Washington, D.C./Baltimore. 

As described in more detail in the table below, we invest in several types of industrial real estate, including warehouse/distribution, flex (including light industrial and R&#38;D) and trans-shipment. We target functional buildings in infill locations that may be shared by multiple tenants and that cater to customer demand within the various submarkets in which we operate.

Flex (including light industrial and R&#38;D, approximately 6.3% of our total portfolio square footage as of December 31, 2015) 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Single and multiple tenant facilities that typically serve tenants less than 10,000 square feet of space

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Staging for a high volume of truck activity and trailer storage 

We selected our target markets by drawing upon the experience of our executive management investing and operating in over 50 global industrial markets located in North America, Europe and Asia, the fundamentals of supply and demand, and in anticipation of trends in logistics patterns resulting from population changes, regulatory and physical constraints, changes in technology, potential long term increases in carbon prices and other factors. We believe that our target markets have attractive long term investment attributes. We target assets with characteristics that include, but are not limited to, the following: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Located in high population coastal markets; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Close proximity to transportation infrastructure (such as sea ports, airports, highways and railways); 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Situated in supply-constrained submarkets with barriers to new industrial development, as a result of physical and/or regulatory constraints; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Functional and flexible layout that can be modified to accommodate single and multiple tenants; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Acquisition price at a discount to the replacement cost of the property; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Potential for enhanced return through re-tenanting or operational or physical improvements; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Opportunity for higher and better use of the property over time. 

In general, we prefer to utilize local third party property managers for day-to-day property management. We believe outsourcing property management is cost effective and provides us with operational flexibility and is a source of acquisition opportunities. We currently manage one of our properties directly and may directly manage other properties in the future if we determine such direct property management is in our best interest. 

&#160; 

We have no current intention to acquire undeveloped industrial land or to pursue ground up development. However, we may pursue redevelopment and expansion opportunities of properties that we own or acquire adjacent land to expand our existing facilities. 

We expect that we will continue to acquire the significant majority of our investments as equity interests in individual properties, portfolios of properties or acquired improved industrial land parcels which may be rented without a building in place. We may also acquire industrial properties through the acquisition of other corporations or entities that own industrial real estate. We will opportunistically target investments in debt secured by industrial real estate that would otherwise meet our investment criteria with the intention of ultimately acquiring the underlying real estate. We currently do not intend to target specific percentages of holdings of particular types of industrial properties. This expectation is based upon prevailing market conditions and may change over time in response to different prevailing market conditions. 

The properties we acquire may be stabilized (fully leased) or unstabilized (have near term lease expirations or be partially or fully vacant). During the period from February 16, 2010 to December 31, 2015, we acquired 48 unstabilized properties of which 33 have been stabilized. 

We sell properties from time to time when we believe the prospective total return from a property is particularly low relative to its market value or the market value of the property is significantly greater than its estimated replacement cost. Capital from such sales is reinvested into properties that are expected to provide better prospective returns or returned to shareholders. We have disposed of four properties since inception for a cumulative sales price of approximately $60.6 million and a total gain of approximately $17.4 million. 

Competitive Strengths 

We believe we distinguish ourselves from our competitors through the following competitive advantages: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Focused Investment Strategy. We invest exclusively in six major coastal U.S. markets and focus on infill locations. We selected our six target markets based upon the experience of our executive management investing and operating in over 50 global industrial markets located in North America, Europe and Asia, the fundamentals of supply and demand, and in anticipation of trends in logistics patterns resulting from population changes, regulatory and physical constraints, changes in technology, potential long term increases in carbon prices and other factors. We have no current intention to acquire undeveloped land or pursue ground up development, but we may pursue redevelopment and expansion activities. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Highly Aligned Compensation Structure. We believe that executive compensation should be closely aligned with long-term stockholder value creation. As a result, all of the long-term equity incentive compensation of our executive officers is based solely on our total shareholder return exceeding the total shareholder return of the MSCI U.S. REIT Index (RMS) or the FTSE NAREIT Equity Industrial Index. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Commitment to Strong Corporate Governance. We are committed to strong corporate governance, as demonstrated by the following: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; all members of our board of directors serve annual terms; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; we have adopted a majority voting standard in non-contested director elections; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; we have opted out of two Maryland anti-takeover provisions and, in the future, we may not opt back in to these provisions without stockholder approval; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; we designed our ownership limits solely to protect our status as a REIT and not for the purpose of serving as an anti-takeover device; and 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; we have no stockholder rights plan. In the future, we will not adopt a stockholder rights plan unless our stockholders approve in advance the adoption of such a plan or, if adopted by our board of directors, we will submit the stockholder rights plan to our stockholders for a ratification vote within 12 months of adoption or the plan will terminate. 

Our Financing Strategy 

The primary objective of our financing strategy is to maintain financial flexibility with a conservative capital structure using retained cash flows, long-term debt and the issuance of common and perpetual preferred stock to finance our growth. Over the long term, we intend to: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; limit the sum of the outstanding principal amount of our consolidated indebtedness and the liquidation preference of any outstanding perpetual preferred stock to less than 40% of our total enterprise value; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio in excess of 2.0x; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; maintain a debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio below 6.5x; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; limit the principal amount of our outstanding floating rate debt to less than 20% of our total consolidated indebtedness; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; have staggered debt maturities that are aligned to our expected average lease term (5-7 years), positioning us to re-price parts of our capital structure as our rental rates change with market conditions. 

We intend to preserve a flexible capital structure with a long-term goal to maintain our investment grade rating and be in a position to issue additional unsecured debt and additional perpetual preferred stock. During 2015, Fitch Ratings assigned us an initial issuer rating of BBB- with a stable outlook. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit rating. Our credit rating can affect the amount and type of capital we can access, as well as the terms of any financings we may obtain. In the event our current credit rating is downgraded, it may become difficult or expensive to obtain additional financing or refinance existing obligations and commitments. We intend to primarily utilize unsecured bonds, recourse bank term loans, credit facilities and perpetual preferred stock. We may also assume debt in connection with property acquisitions which may have a higher loan-to-value. 

Our Corporate Structure 

We are a Maryland corporation formed on November 6, 2009 and have been publicly held and subject to U.S. Security and Exchange Commission, or SEC, reporting obligations since 2010. We are not structured as an Umbrella Partnership Real Estate Investment Trust, or UPREIT. We currently own our properties indirectly through subsidiaries and may utilize one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries as appropriate. 

Our Tax Status 

We elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2010. We believe that our organization and method of operation has enabled and will continue to enable us to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. To maintain REIT status we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we annually distribute at least 90% of our net taxable income to our stockholders, excluding net capital gains. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on REIT taxable income we currently distribute to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be 

&#160; 

subject to some federal, state and local taxes on our income or property and the income of our taxable REIT subsidiaries, if any, will be subject to taxation at regular corporate rates. We do not currently own any taxable REIT subsidiaries but may in the future. 

Competition 

We believe the current market for industrial real estate acquisitions to be competitive. We compete for real property investments with pension funds and their advisors, bank and insurance company investment accounts, other public and private real estate investment companies, including other REITs, real estate limited partnerships, owner-users, individuals and other entities engaged in real estate investment activities, some of which have greater financial resources than we do. In addition, we believe the leasing of real estate to be highly competitive. We experience competition for customers from owners and managers of competing properties. As a result, we may have to provide free rental periods, incur charges for tenant improvements or offer other inducements, all of which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations. 

Environmental Matters 

The industrial properties that we own and will acquire are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws. Under these laws, courts and government agencies have the authority to require us, as owner of a contaminated property, to clean up the property, even if we did not know of or were not responsible for the contamination. These laws also apply to persons who owned a property at the time it became contaminated, and therefore it is possible we could incur these costs even after we sell some of our properties. In addition to the costs of cleanup, environmental contamination can affect the value of a property and, therefore, an owner&#146;s ability to borrow using the property as collateral or to sell the property. Under applicable environmental laws, courts and government agencies also have the authority to require that a person who sent waste to a waste disposal facility, such as a landfill or an incinerator, pay for the clean-up of that facility if it becomes contaminated and threatens human health or the environment. 

Furthermore, various court decisions have established that third parties may recover damages for injury caused by property contamination. For instance, a person exposed to asbestos at one of our properties may seek to recover damages if he or she suffers injury from the asbestos. Lastly, some of these environmental laws restrict the use of a property or place conditions on various activities. An example would be laws that require a business using chemicals to manage them carefully and to notify local officials that the chemicals are being used. 

We could be responsible for any of the costs discussed above. The costs to clean up a contaminated property, to defend against a claim, or to comply with environmental laws could be material and could adversely affect the funds available for distribution to our stockholders. We generally obtain &#147;Phase I environmental site assessments&#148;, or ESAs, on each property prior to acquiring it. However, these ESAs may not reveal all environmental costs that might have a material adverse effect on our business, assets, results of operations or liquidity and may not identify all potential environmental liabilities. 

In general, we utilize local third party property managers for day-to-day property management and will rely on these third parties to operate our industrial properties in compliance with applicable federal, state and local environmental laws in their daily operation of the respective properties and to promptly notify us of any environmental contaminations or similar issues. As a result, we may become subject to material environmental liabilities of which we are unaware. We can make no assurances that (1) future laws or regulations will not impose material environmental liabilities on us, or (2) the environmental condition of our industrial properties will not be affected by the condition of the properties in the vicinity of our industrial properties (such as the presence of leaking underground storage tanks) or by third parties unrelated to us. We were not aware of any significant or material exposures as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. 

&#160; 

Employees 

As of February 10, 2016, we have 18 employees. None of our employees is a member of any union. 

Supplemental Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations 

Supplemental Tax Disclosures &#150; Updates to REIT Rules 

The &#147;Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015&#148; (the &#147;PATH Act&#148;) was enacted on December 18, 2015 and contains several provisions pertaining to REIT qualification and taxation. Some of these provisions implicate certain tax-related disclosures contained in the prospectus supplement, dated March 31, 2015, with respect to our at-the-market equity offering program and are briefly summarized below: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; For taxable years beginning before January 1, 2018, no more than 25% of the value of our assets may consist of stock or securities of one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, the PATH Act reduces this limit to 20%. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; For purposes of the REIT asset tests, the PATH Act provides that debt instruments issued by publicly offered REITs will constitute &#147;real estate assets.&#148; However, unless such a debt instrument is secured by a mortgage or otherwise would have qualified as a real estate asset under prior law, (i) interest income and gain from such a debt instrument is not qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test and (ii) all such debt instruments may represent no more than 25% of the value of our total assets. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2015, certain obligations secured by a mortgage on both real property and personal property will be treated as a qualifying real estate asset and give rise to qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test if the fair market value of such personal property does not exceed 15% of the total fair market value of all such property. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; A 100% excise tax is imposed on &#147;redetermined TRS service income,&#148; which is income of a taxable REIT subsidiary attributable to services provided to, or on behalf of its associated REIT and which would otherwise be increased on distribution, apportionment, or allocation under Section 482 of the Code. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; For distributions made in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2014, the preferential dividend rules no longer apply to us. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Additional exceptions to the rules under the Foreign Investment in Real Property Act (&#147;FIRPTA&#148;) were introduced for non-U.S. persons that constitute &#147;qualified shareholders&#148; (within the meaning of Section 897(k)(3) of the Code) or &#147;qualified foreign pension funds&#148; (within the meaning of Section 897(l)(2) of the Code). 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; After February 16, 2016, the FIRPTA withholding rate under Section 1445 of the Code for dispositions of U.S. real property interests is increased from 10% to 15%. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The PATH Act increases from 5% to 10% the maximum stock ownership of the REIT that a non-U.S. shareholder may have held to avail itself of the FIRPTA exception for shares regularly traded on an established securities market.
