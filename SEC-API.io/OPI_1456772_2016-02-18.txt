 Item 1. Business 

The Company. We are a real estate investment trust, or REIT, formed in 2009 under Maryland law . As of December 31, 201 5 , excluding one property (one building) classified as discontinued operations , &#160; we owned 7 1 properties (9 1 buildings) with an undepreciated carrying value of approximately $1.7 billion and a depreciated carrying value of approximately $1 .4 billion. These 7 1 properties have approximately 10.7 million rentable square feet. 

As of December 31, 201 5 , we also owned 2 4 , 9 18 , 421 common shares of beneficial interest, par value $.01 per share, of Select Income REIT, or SIR , or approximately 27 .9% of the then outstanding common shares of SIR. SIR is a REIT that is primarily focused on owning and investing in net leased, single tenant properties. As of December 31, 201 5 our investment in SIR had a carrying value of approximately $491.4 million . See Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding our investment in SIR . We account for our investment in SIR under the equity method. 

Our principal executive offices are located at Two Newton Place, 255 Washington Street, Suite 300, Newton, Massachusetts 02458 &#8209;1634, and our telephone number is (617) 219 &#8209;1440. 

Our Business . Our business plan is to maintain our properties, seek to extend or enter into new leases as leases approach expiration , enter into new leases for our vacant space, selectively acquire additional properties that are majority leased to government tenants, selectively dispose of properties when we determine that our continued ownership will not achieve desired returns or if the opportunity costs for continuing to own those properties exceed our expected returns from those properties and pay distributions to our shareholders. As our current leases expire, we will attempt to renew our leases with existing tenants or to ent er into leases with new tenants, in both circumstances at rents equal to or higher than the rents we now receive. Our ability to renew leases with our existing tenants or to enter into new leases with new tenants and the rents we are able to charge will depend in large part upon market conditions which are generally beyond our control. 

Our Growth Strategy. Our internal growth strategy is to attempt to increase the rents we receive from our current properties. To achieve rent increases we may invest in our properties to make improvements requested by existing tenants or to induce lease renewals or new tenant leases when our current leases expire or vacant space is leased. However, as noted above, our ability to maintain or increase the rents we receive from our current properties will depend in large part upon market conditions which are beyond our control. 

Our external growth strategy is defined by our acquisition, disposition and financing policies. Our acquisition, disposition and financing policies are established by our Board of Trustees and may be changed by our Board of Trustees at any time without shareholder approval. 

Acquisition Policies. &#160; We expect to acquire additional properties that are majori ty leased to government tenants and we expect to use the extensive nationwide resources of The RMR Group LLC, a Maryland limited liability company, or RMR LLC, to locate and acquire such properties. We believe that current government budgetary pressures may cause an increased demand for leased space by government tenants, as opposed to governments acquiring buildings or constructing new buildings. However, these same budgetary pressures have also resul t ed in a decrease in government employment, government tenants improving &#160; their space utilization and consolidation into existing government owned properties, thereby reducing the demand for government leased space. &#160; We expect to acquire additional properties primarily for purposes of realizing income from the operations of those properties rather than to realize capital gains by selling those properties. 

In implementing our acquisition strategy , we consider a range of factors relating to proposed property purchases including: 

&#8226; the historic and projected rents received and likely to be received from the property; 

&#160;

&#8226; the historic and expected operating expenses, including real estate taxes, incurred and expected to be incurred at the property; 

&#8226; the strategic fit of the property with the rest of our properties ; 

&#8226; the growth, tax and regulatory environments of the markets in which the property is located; 

&#8226; the quality and credit worthiness of the property&#8217;s tenants and how essential the occupant&#8217;s mission is to the tenant; 

&#8226; occupancy and demand for similar properties in the same or nearby markets; 

&#8226; the tenant&#8217;s utilization of the leased space in the building and the likelihood of tenants renewing at lease expiration; 

&#8226; the construction quality, physical condition and design of the property and expected capital expenditures that may be needed at the property; 

&#8226; the estimated replacement cost of the property; 

&#8226; our weighted average long term cost of capital compared to the projected returns we may realize by owning the propert y ; &#160; 

&#8226; the location and type of property; 

&#8226; the pricing of comparable properties as evidenced by recent arm&#8217;s length market sales ; and 

&#8226; the existence of alternative sour ces, uses or needs for our capital. 

We have no policies which specifically limit the percentage of our assets that may be invested in any individual property, in any one type of property, in properties managed by or leased to any one entity, in properties managed by or leased to any affiliated group of entities, or in securities of one or more other persons. 

We may in the future acquire additional common shares of SIR or securities of other persons, including persons engaged in real estate activities. We may invest in the securities of other persons for the purpose of exercising control, or otherwise, make loans to other persons, engage in the sale of investments, offer securities in exchange for property or repurchase or reacquire our securities. 

We have in the past considered, and may in the future consider, the possibility of entering into mergers or strategic combinations with other companies. A principal goal of any such transaction may be to further diversify our revenue sources and increase our cash flow from operations. 

Disposition P olicies. W e generally consider ourselves to be a long term owner of properties and are more interested in the long term earnings potential of our properties than selling properties for short term gains. However, f rom time to time, we consider th e sale of properties. W e make disposition decisions based on a number of factors including, but not limited to, the following: 

&#8226; whether the property is leased and the expected cost and required time to re &#8209;lease the property; 

&#8226; our expectation regarding tenant lease renewals or the likelihood of finding a replacement tenant; 

&#8226; our evaluation of future rent for the property relative to leasing costs; 

&#8226; the strategic fit of the property or investment with the rest of our portfolio; 

&#8226; the estimated value we may receive by selling the property; 

&#160;

&#8226; our intended use of the proceeds we may realize from the sale of a property; 

&#8226; the proposed sale price; and 

&#8226; the existence of alternative sources, uses or needs for capital. 

Financing Policies. To qualify for taxation as a REIT under the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the IRC, we must distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income (excluding capital gains) and satisfy a number of organizational and operational requirements. Accordingly, we generally will not be able to retain sufficient cash from operations to repay our debts, invest in our properties or fund acquisitions. Instead, we expect to repay our debts, invest in our properties and fund acquisitions by borrowing and issuing equity securities or using retained cash from operations which may exceed our distributions. We currently have a $750 million unsecured revolving credit facility, or our unsecured revolving credit facility, that we use for working capital and general business purposes and to fund acquisitions. In some instances, we may assume outstanding mortgage debt in connection with our acquisition s or place new mortgages on properties we own. In the past we refinanced or reduced amounts outstanding under our then existing revolving credit facility with term debt or equity issuances , and we expect to continue this practice in the future. We will decide when and whether to issue new debt or equity depending upon market conditions and other factors . Because our ability to raise capital may depend, in large part, upon market conditions, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient capital to repay our deb t or to fund our growth strategies . 

Although there are no limitations in our organizational documents on the amount of indebtedness we may incur, the borrowing limitations established by the covenants in the agreement governing our revolving credit and term loan facilities, or our credit agreement , and our senior unsecured notes indenture and its supplement currently restrict our ability to incur indebtedness and require us to maintain certain financial ratios . However, we may seek to amend these covenants or seek replacement financings with less restrictive covenants. We may from time to time reevaluate and modify our financing policies in light of then current market conditions, relative availability and costs of debt and equity capital, the changing values of properties, growth and acquisition opportunities and other factors, and we may increase or decrease our ratio of debt to total capitalization. 

Our Manager. The RMR Group Inc. (NASDAQ: RMR) , a Maryland corporation, &#160; or RMR Inc., is a holding company and substantially all of it s business is conducted by its majority owned subsidiary , &#160; RMR LLC. Barry Portnoy and Adam Portnoy, our Managing Trustees , &#160; are the controlling shareholders , directors and officers of RMR Inc . Our day to day operations are conducted by RMR LLC. RMR LLC originates and presents investment and divestment opportunities to our Board of Trustees and provides management and administrative services to us. &#160; RMR LLC &#160; has a principal place of business at Two Newton Place, 255 Washington Street, S uite 300, Newton, Massachusetts 02458 &#8209;1634, and its tele phone number is (617) 796 &#8209;8390. RMR LLC also acts as the manager to SIR , Hospitality Properties Trust, or HPT , and Senior Housing Properties Trust, or SNH, and provides management and other services to other private and public companies, including Five Star Quality Care, Inc., or FVE, TravelCenters of America LLC, or TA, and Sonesta International Hotels Corporation, or Sonesta. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10 &#8209;K, the executive officers of RMR LLC are: Adam Portnoy, President and Chief Executive Officer; Barry Portnoy, Chairman ; David M. Blackman, Executive Vice President; Jennifer B. Clark, Executive Vice President , General Counsel and Secretary ; David J. Hegarty, Executive Vice President; Mark L. Kleifges, Executive Vice President; Bruce J. Mackey Jr., Executive Vice President; John G. Murray, Executive Vice President; Thomas M. O&#8217;Brien, Executive Vice President; and John C. Po peo, Executive Vice President. David M. Blackman and Mark L. Kleifges a re also our executive officers. Messrs. Blackman and Kl eifges and other officers of RMR LLC &#160; also serve as officers of other companies to which RMR LLC provides management services. 

Employees. We have no employees. Services which would otherwise be provided to us by employees are provided by RMR LLC and by our Managing Trustees and officers. As of February 1 0 , 201 6 , RMR LLC had approximately 4 20 full t ime employees in its headquarters and regional offices located throughout the United States. 

Competition. Investing in and operating office buildings and maintaining relationships with government tenants and attracting new government tenants is a highly competitive business. We compete against other REITs, numerous financial institutions, individuals and public and private companies who are actively engaged in this business. Also, we compete for investments based on a number of factors including purchase prices, closing terms, underwriting criteria and our reputation. Our ability to successfully compete is also materially impacted by the availability and cost of capital to us. We do not believe we have a dominant position in any of the geographic markets in which we operate, but some of our competitors are dominant in selected 

&#160;

markets. Some of our competitors may hav e greater financial and other resources than we have. We believe we have some competitive advantages in leasing to government tenants and purchasing government leased properties because of our experience and familiarity with government leasing procedures. We also believe the experience and abilities of our management and the quality of our properties may afford us some competitive advantages and allow us to operate our business successfully despite the competitive nature of our business. 

For additional information about competition and other risks associated with our business, please see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in this Annual Report on Form 10 &#8209;K. 

Environmental Matters. Under various laws, owners as well as tenants and operators of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up or remove hazardous substances present at or migrating from properties they own, lease or operate and may be held liable for property damage or personal injuries that result from hazardous substances. These laws also expose us to the possibility that we may become liable to governmental agencies or third parties for costs and damages they incur in connection with hazardous substances. I t is our practice to obtain and review &#8220;Phase I&#8221; environmental surveys prior to our acquisition of properties in order to assess the possible presence of and cost of removing hazardous substances. Certain of our buildings contain asbestos. We believe any asbestos in our buildings is contained in accordance with current regulations, and we have no current plans to remove it. If we remove the asbestos or renovate or demolish these properties, certain environmental regulations govern the manner in which the asbestos must be handled and removed. We do not believe that there are environmental conditions at any of our properties that have had or will have a material adverse effect on us. However, no assurances can be given that conditions are not present at our properties or that costs we may be required to incur in the future to remediate contamination will not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition. For more information, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to Our Business&#8212;Ownership of real estate is subject to environmental and climate change risks.&#8221; 

In reaction to the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the U.S. Government has instituted &#8220;green lease&#8221; policies which include the &#8220;Promotion of Energy Efficiency and Use of Renewable Energy&#8221; as one of the factors it considers when leasing property. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 also allows the General Services Administration, or GSA, to give preference to buildings for lease that have received an &#8220; ENERGY STAR &#8221; certification . The ENERGY STAR program is a joint program of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Energy which is focuse d on promoting energy efficient products and buildings. Buildings that reach a specified level of energy efficiency may receive the ENERGY STAR &#160; recognition for a period of 12 months before the requirement that they be recertified . Furthermore, certain buildings are not eligible for ENERGY STAR certification. For example, lab uses, medical office buildings and buildings less than 50% occupied cannot be ENERGY STAR certified. For the year ended &#160; December 31, 201 5 , 42 of our buildings with an aggregate of 5 , 223 , 769 rentable square feet ( 47 . 2 % and 49 . 9 % of our eligible buildings and eligible rentable square feet, respectively) were ENERGY STAR certified . 

The U.S. Government&#8217;s &#8220;gr een lease&#8221; policies also permit government tenants to require leadership in energy and environmental design, or LEED &#174; , certification in selecting new premises or renewing leases at existing premises. The LEED &#174; certification program is administered by the U.S. Green Building Council, a nonprofit organization focused on promoting environmental sustainability for the built environment. Buildings that reach specified level s of sustainability may receive a LEED &#174; certification . As of December 31, 201 5 , 15 of our buildings with an aggregate of 2,087,112 rentable square feet (16. 5 % and 19 . 5 % of our total buildings and total rentable square feet, respectively) were LEED &#174; &#160; certified . 

We and our manager , &#160; RMR LL C, cont inuously study ways to improve energy efficiency and reduce environmental impacts at our properties. We and &#160; RMR LLC are member s of the ENERGY STAR Partner program and RMR LLC is a member of the U.S. Green Building Council. Our effort to obtain additional ENERGY STAR labels and/or LEED &#174; certifications &#160; and manage our properties in a sustainable manner benefit our business while also bettering the environment . For more information, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to Our Business&#8212;The U.S. Government&#8217;s &#8220;green lease&#8221; policies may adversely affect us.&#8221; 

Insurance. We &#160; generally have insurance coverage for our properties and the operation s conducted on them, including for casualty, liability, fire and e xtended coverage. W e participate with RMR LLC and other companies to which RMR LLC provides management services in a combined property insurance program through Affiliates Insurance Company, or AIC, and with respect to which AIC is a reinsurer of certain coverage amounts. For more information, see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Related Person Transactions&#8221; and Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

&#160;

Other Matters. Legislative and regulatory developments may occur at the federal, state and local levels that have direct or indirect impact on the ownership, leasing and operation of our properties. We may need to make expenditures, to the extent these costs are not paid by our tenants, due to changes in government regulations, or the application of such regulations to our properties, including the Americans with Disabilities Act, or the ADA, fire and safety regulations, building codes, land use regulations or environmental regulations on containment, abatement or removal. 

Segment Information. We operate in two business segments: ownership of properties that are primarily leased to government tenants and our equity method investment in SIR.

&#160; 

UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS 

The following summary of United States federal income tax considerations is based on existing law, and is limited to investors who own our shares as investment assets rather than as inventory or as property used in a trade or business. The summary does not discuss all of the particular tax consequences that might be relevant to you if you are subject to special rules under federal income tax law, for example if you are: 

&#183; 

a bank, insurance company or other financial institution; 

&#183; 

a regulated investment company or REIT ; 

&#183; 

a subchapter S corporation; 

&#183; 

a broker, dealer or trader in securities or foreign currency; 

&#183; 

a person who marks-to-market our shares; 

&#183; 

a person who has a functional currency other than the United States dollar; 

&#183; 

a person who acquires or owns our shares in connection with employment or other performance of services; 

&#183; 

a person subject to alternative minimum tax; 

&#183; 

a person who acquires or owns our shares as part of a straddle, hedging transaction, constructive sale transaction, constructive ownership transaction or conversion transaction; 

&#183; 

a United States expatriate; 

&#183; 

a &#8220;qualified shareholder&#8221; (as defined in Section 897(k)(3)(A) of the &#160; IRC ); 

&#183; 

a &#8220;qualified foreign pension fund&#8221; (as defined in Section 897(l)(2) of the IRC ) or any entity wholly owned by a qualified foreign pension fund; or 

&#183; 

except as specifically described in the following summary, a trust, estate, tax - exempt entity or foreign person. 

The sections of the IRC &#160; that govern the federal income tax qualification and treatment of a REIT and its shareholders are complex. This presentation is a summary of applicable IRC provisions, related rules and regulations, and administrative and judicial interpretations, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. Future legislative, judicial or administrative actions or decisions could also affect the accuracy of statements made in this summary. We have not received a ruling from the United States Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS, with respect to any matter described in this summary, &#160; and we cannot assure you that the IRS or a court will agree with all of the statements made in this summary. The IRS could, for example, take a different position from that described in this summary with respect to our acquisitions, operations, restructurings or other matters, which, if a court agreed, could result in significant tax liabilities for applicable parties. In addition, this summary is not exhaustive of all possible tax consequences, and does not discuss any estate, gift, state, local or foreign tax consequences. For all these reasons, we urge you and any prospective acquiror of our shares to consult with a tax advisor about the federal income tax and other tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of our shares. Our intentions and beliefs described in this summary are based upon our understanding of applicable laws and regulations that are in effect as of the date of this Annual Report on Form &#160; 10-K. If new laws or regulations are enacted which impact us directly or indirectly, we may change our intentions or beliefs. 

Your federal income tax consequences generally will differ depending on whether or not you are a &#8220;U.S. shareholder.&#8221; For purposes of this summary, a &#8220;U.S. shareholder&#8221; is a beneficial owner of our shares that is: 

&#183; 

a citizen or resident of the United States, including an alien individual who is a lawful permanent resident of the United States or meets the substantial presence residency test under the federal income tax laws; 

&#160;

&#183; 

an entity treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes that is created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; 

&#183; 

an estate the income of which is subject to federal income taxation regardless of its source; or 

&#183; 

a trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more United States persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or, to the extent provided in Treasury regulations, a trust in existence on August 20, 1996 that has elected to be treated as a domestic trust; 

whose status as a U.S. shareholder is not overridden by an applicable tax treaty. Conversely, a &#8220;non-U.S. shareholder &#8221; is a beneficial owner of our shares other than a partnership or a U.S. shareholder. &#160; &#160; 

If any entity treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes is a beneficial owner of our shares, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Any entity or other arrangement treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes that is a beneficial owner of our shares and the partners in such a partnership (as determined for federal income tax purposes ) are urged to consult their own tax advisors about the federal income tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of our shares. 

Taxation as a REIT 

&#160; We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the IRC , commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2009. Our REIT election, assuming continuing compliance with the then applicable qualification tests, has continued and will continue in effect for subsequent taxable years. Although no assurance can be given, we believe that we have been organized and have operated, and will continue to be organized and to operate, in a manner that qualified and will continue to qualify us to be taxed under the IRC as a REIT. 

As a REIT, we generally are not subject to federal income tax on our net income distributed as dividends to our shareholders. Distributions to our shareholders generally are included in their income as dividends to the extent of our available current or accumulated earnings and profits. Our dividends are not generally entitled to the preferential tax rates on qualified dividend income, but a portion of our dividends may be treated as capital gain dividends or as qualified dividend income, all as explained below . No portion of any of our dividends is eligible for the dividends received deduction for corporate shareholders. Distributions in excess of current or accumulated earnings and profits generally are treated for federal income tax purposes as returns of capital to the extent of a recipient shareholder&#8217;s basis in our shares, and will reduce this basis. Our current or accumulated earnings and profits are generally allocated first to distributions made on our preferred shares, of which there are none outstanding at this time, and thereafter to distributions made on our common shares . &#160; For all these purposes, our distributions include cash distributions, any in kind distributions of property that we might make , and deemed or constructive distributions resulting from capital market activities, as described below. 

Our counsel, Sullivan &#38; Worcester LLP, has provided to us an opinion that we have been organized and have qualified for taxation as a REIT under the IRC for our 2009 through 2015 taxable years, and that our current and anticipated investments and plan of operation will enable us to continue to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the IRC. Our counsel&#8217;s opinions are conditioned upon the assumption that our leases, our declaration of trust and all other legal documents to which we are or have been a party have been and will be complied with by all parties to those documents, upon the accuracy and completeness of the factual matters described in this Annual Report on Form &#160; 10-K and upon representations made by us as to certain factual matters relating to our organization and operations and our expected manner of operation. If this assumption or a representation is inaccurate or incomplete, our counsel&#8217;s opinions may be adversely affected and may not be relied upon. The opinions of our counsel are based upon the law as it exists today, but the law may change in the future, possibly with retroactive effect. Given the highly complex nature of the rules governing REITs, the ongoing importance of factual determinations, and the possibility of future changes in our circumstances, no assurance can be given by Sullivan &#38; Worcester LLP or us that we will qualify as or be taxed as a REIT for any particular year. Any opinion of Sullivan &#38; Worcester LLP as to our qualification or taxation as a REIT will be expressed as of the date issued. Our counsel will have no obligation to advise us or our shareholders of any subsequent change in the matters stated, represented or assumed, or of any subsequent change in the applicable law. Also, the opinions of our counsel are not binding on either the IRS or a court, and either could take a position different from that expressed by our counsel. 

&#160;

Our continued qualification and taxation as a REIT will depend upon our compliance on a continuing basis with various qualification tests imposed under the IRC and summarized below. While we believe that we have satisfied and will satisfy these tests, our counsel does not review compliance with these tests on a continuing basis. If we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT in any year , we will be subject to federal income taxation as if we were a corporation taxed under subchapter C of the IRC, or a C corporation, and our shareholders will be taxed like shareholders of C corporations, meaning that federal income tax generally will be applied at both the corporate and shareholder levels. In this event, we could be subject to significant tax liabilities, and the amount of cash available for distribution to our shareholders could be reduced or eliminated. 

If we qualify for taxation as a REIT and meet the tests described below, we generally will not pay federal income tax on amounts we distribute to our shareholders. However, even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to federal tax in the following circumstances: 

&#183; 

We will be taxed at regular corporate rates on any undistributed &#8220;real estate investment trust taxable income, &#8221; determined by including our undistributed net capital gains , if any . 

&#183; 

If our alternative minimum taxable income exceeds our taxable income, we may be subject to the corporate alternative minimum tax on our items of tax preference. 

&#183; 

If we have net income from the disposition of &#8220;foreclosure property&#8221; that is held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business or from other nonqualifying income from foreclosure property, we will be subject to tax on this income at the highest regular corporate rate, currently 35%. 

&#183; 

If we have net income from prohibited transactions &#8212; that is, dispositions of inventory or property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business other than dispositions of foreclosure property and other than dispositions excepted under a statutory safe harbor &#8212; we will be subject to tax on this income at a 100% rate. 

&#183; 

If we fail to satisfy the 75% gross income test or the 95% gross income test discussed below, due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, but nonetheless maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT because of specified cure provisions , we will be subject to tax at a 100% rate on the greater of the amount by which we fail the 75% gross income test or the 95% gross income test, with adjustments, multiplied by a fraction intended to reflect our profitability for the taxable year. 

&#183; 

If we fail to satisfy the REIT asset tests described below, due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, but nonetheless maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT because of specified cure provisions, we will be subject to a tax equal to the greater of $50,000 or the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the nonqualifying assets that caused us to fail the test. 

&#183; 

If we fail to satisfy any provision of the IRC that would result in our failure to qualify for taxation as a REIT (other than violations of the REIT gross income tests or violations of the REIT asset tests described below), due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, we may retain our qualification for taxation as a REIT but will be subject to a penalty of $50,000 for each failure. 

&#183; 

If we fail to distribute for any calendar year at least the sum of 85% of our REIT ordinary income for that year, 95% of our REIT capital gain net income for that year and any undistributed taxable income from prior periods, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on the excess of the required distribution over the amounts actually distributed. 

&#183; 

If we recognized gain on the disposition of a REIT asset where our basis in the asset is determined by reference to the basis of the asset in the hands of a C &#160; corporation during a five-year period beginning on the date on which the asset ceased to be owned by the C &#160; corporation, then we will pay tax at the highest regular corporate tax rate, currently 35%, on the lesser of the excess of the fair market value of the asset over the C &#160; corporation&#8217;s basis in the asset on the date the asset ceased to be owned by the C &#160; corporation, or the gain we recognize in the disposition. 

&#183; 

If we acquire a corporation in a transaction where we succeed to its tax attributes, to preserve our qualification for taxation as a REIT we must generally distribute all of the C corporation earnings and profits inherited in that acquisition, if any, not later than the end of our taxable year in which the acquisition occurs. However, if we fail to do so, relief provisions would allow us to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT provided we distribute any subsequently discovered C corporation earnings and profits and pay an interest charge in respect of the period of delayed distribution. &#160; 

&#160;

&#183; 

As summarized below, REITs are permitted within limits to own stock and other securities of a &#8220;taxable REIT subsidiary.&#8221; A domestic taxable REIT subsidiary &#160; is separately taxed on its net income as a C corporation, and is subject to limitations on the deductibility of interest expense paid to its REIT parent. While a foreign taxable REIT subsidiary &#160; is taxed in the United States only to the extent it has income that is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States or that is investment income from United States sources, a foreign taxable REIT subsidiary &#160; is generally subject to foreign taxes in the jurisdictions in which its assets or operations are located. In addition, the REIT parent is subject to a 100% tax on the amount by which various charges and reimbursements between the parent REIT and its taxable REIT subsidiaries are determined to be priced excessively in favor of the REIT rather than on arm &#8217;s length bases. 

&#183; 

To the extent we invest in properties in foreign jurisdictions, our income from those properties will generally be subject to tax in those jurisdictions . If we continue to operate as we do, then we will distribute all of our &#8220;real estate investment trust taxable income&#8221; to our shareholders such that we will generally not pay United States federal income tax. As a result, we cannot recover the cost of foreign income taxes imposed on our foreign investments by claiming foreign tax credits against our United States federal income tax liability. Also, as a REIT, we cannot pass through any foreign tax credits to our shareholders. 

If we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT or elect not to qualify for taxation as a REIT, then we will be subject to federal income tax in the same manner as a regular C corporation. Further, as a regular C corporation, distributions to our shareholders will not be deductible by us, nor will distributions be required under the IRC. Also, to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, all distributions to our shareholders will generally be taxable as ordinary dividends potentially eligible for the preferential tax rates discussed below in &#8220;Taxation of Taxable U.S. Shareholders&#8221; and, subject to limitations in the IRC, will be potentially eligible for the dividends received deduction for corporate shareholders. Finally, we will generally be disqualified from qualification for taxation as a REIT for the four taxable years following the taxable year in which the termination is effective. Our failure to qualify for taxation as a REIT for even one year could result in us reducing or eliminating distributions to our shareholders, or in us incurring substantial indebtedness or liquidating substantial investments in order to pay the res ulting corporate-level taxes. R elief provisions under the IRC may allow us to continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT even if we fail to comply with various REIT requirements, all as discussed in more detail below. 

REIT Qualification Requirements 

General Requirements. Section 856(a) of the IRC defines a REIT as a corporation, trust or association: 

(1) that is managed by one or more trustees or directors; 

(2) the beneficial ownership of which is evidenced by transferable shares or by transferable certificates of beneficial interest; 

(3) that would be taxable, but for Sections 856 through 859 of the IRC, as a domestic C corporation; 

(4) that is not a financial institution or an insurance company subject to special provisions of the IRC; 

(5) the beneficial ownership of which is held by 100 or more persons; 

(6) that is not &#8220;closely held&#8221; as defined under the personal holding company stock ownership test, as described below; and 

(7) that meets other tests regarding the nature of its income and assets and the amount of its distributions, all as described below. 

Section 856(b) of the IRC provides that conditions (1) through (4) must be met during the entire taxable year and that condition (5) must be met during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months, or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months. Section 856(h)(2) of the IRC provides that neither condition (5) nor (6) need to have been met during our first taxable year as a REIT. We believe that we have met conditions (1) &#160; through (7) during &#160; each of the requisite periods ending on or before the close of our most recently completed taxable year, and that we will continue to meet these conditions in future taxable years. There can, however, be no assurance in this regard. 

&#160;

By reason of condition (6), we will fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT for a taxable year if at any time during the last half of a year (except for our first taxable year as a REIT) more than 50% in value of our outstanding shares is owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals . To help comply with condition (6), our declaration of trust restricts transfers of our shares that would otherwise result in concentrated ownership positions. In addition, if we comply with applicable Treasury regulations to ascertain the ownership of our outstanding shares and do not know, or by exercising reasonable diligence would not have known, that we failed condition (6), then we will be treated as having met condition (6). However, our failure to comply with these regulations for ascertaining ownership may result in a penalty of $25,000, or $50,000 for intentional violations. Accordingly, we have complied and will continue to comply with these regulations, including requesting annually from record holders of significant percentages of our shares information regarding the ownership of our shares. Under our declaration of trust, our shareholders are required to respond to these requests for information. A shareholder who fails or refuses to comply with the request is required by Treasury regulations to submit a statement with its federal income tax return disclosing its actual ownership of our shares and other information. 

For purposes of condition (6), the term &#8220;individuals&#8221; is defined in the IRC to include natural persons, supplemental unemployment compensation benefit plans, private foundations and portions of a trust permanently set aside or used exclusively for charitable purposes, but not other entities or qualified pension plans or profit-sharing trusts. As a result, REIT shares owned by an entity that is not an &#8220;individual&#8221; are considered to be owned by the direct and indirect owners of the entity that are individuals (as so defined), rather than to be owned by the entity itself. Similarly, REIT shares held by a qualified pension plan or profit-sharing trust are treated as held directly by the individual beneficiaries in proportion to their actuarial interests in such plan or trust. Consequently, five or fewer such trusts could own more than 50% of the interests in an entity without jeopardizing that entity&#8217;s qualification for taxation as a REIT. However, as discussed below in &#8220;Taxation of Tax-Exempt U.S. Shareholders,&#8221; if a REIT is a &#8220;pension-held REIT,&#8221; each qualified pension plan or profit-sharing pension trust owning more than 10% of the REIT&#8217;s shares by value generally may be taxed on a portion of the dividends it receives from the REIT. 

The IRC provides that we will not automatically fail to qualify as a REIT if we do not meet conditions (1) through (6), provided we can establish that such failure was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect. Each such excused failure will result in the imposition of a $50,000 penalty instead of REIT disqualification. It is impossible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to the benefit of this relief provision. This relief provision applies to any failure of the applicable conditions, even if the failure first occurred in a prior taxable year. 

Our Wholly Owned Subsidiaries and Our Investments Through Partnerships. Except in respect of taxable REIT subsidiaries as discussed below, Section 856(i) of the IRC provides that any corporation, 100% of whose stock is held by a REIT and its disregarded subsidiaries, is a qualified REIT subsidiary and shall not be treated as a separate corporation. The assets, liabilities and items of income, deduction and credit of a qualified REIT subsidiary are treated as the REIT&#8217;s. We believe that each of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries, other than the taxable RE IT subsidiaries discussed below (and entities owned in whole or in part by the taxable REIT subsidiaries), will be either a qualified REIT subsidiary within the meaning of Section 856(i) of the IRC, or a noncorporate entity that for federal income tax purposes is not treated as separate from its owner under Treasury regulations issued under Section 7701 of the IRC. Thus, except for the taxable REIT subsidiaries discussed below (and entities owned in whole or in part by the taxable REIT subsidiaries) , in applying all of the federal income tax REIT qualification requirements described in this summary, all assets, liabilities and items of income, deduction and credit of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries are treated as ours. 

We may invest in real estate through one or more entities that are treated as partnerships for federal income tax purposes . In the case of a REIT that is a partner in a partnership, Treasury regulations under the IRC provide that, for purposes of the REIT qualification requirements regarding income and assets discussed below, the REIT is deemed to own its proportionate share of the assets of the partnership corresponding to the REIT&#8217;s proportionate capital interest in the partnership and is deemed to be entitled to the income of the partnership attributable to this proportionate share. In addition, for these purposes, the character of the assets and items of gross income of the partnership generally remains the same in the hands of the REIT. Accordingly, our proportionate share of the assets, liabilities, and items of income of each partnership in which we become a partner is treated as ours for purposes of the income tests and asset tests discussed below. In contrast, for purposes of the distribution requirement discussed below, we would take into account as a partner our share of the partnership&#8217;s income as determined under the general federal income tax rules governing partners and partnerships under Sections 701 through 777 of the IRC. 

Subsidiary REITs. We may in the future &#160; invest in real estate through one or more subsidiary entities that are intended to qualify for taxation as REITs. Any subsidiary REIT will generally be subject to the various REIT qualification requirements and other limitations described in this summary that are applicable to us. If one of our subsidiary REITs were to fail to qualify for taxation as a 

&#160;

REIT, then (a) the subsidiary REIT would become subject to regular United States corporate income tax, as described above, and (b) our ownership of shares in the subsidiary REIT would cease to be a qualifying real estate asset for purposes of the 75% asset test and would become subject to the 5% asset test, the 10% vote test and the 10% value test generally applicable to our ownership in corporations other than REITs, qualified REIT subsidiaries and taxable REIT subsidiaries, all as described under &#8220;Asset Tests&#8221; below. If a subsidiary REIT were to fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT, it is possible that we would not meet the 5% asset test, the 10% vote test or the 10% value test with respect to our interest in the subsidiary REIT, in which event we would fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT unless we could utilize applicable relief provisions. We may make protective taxable REIT subsidiary elections as described below with respect to our subsidiary REITs and may implement other protective arrangements intended to avoid a cascading REIT failure if any of our subsidiary REITs were not to qualify for taxation as a REIT, but there can be no assurance that such protective elections and other arrangements will be effective to avoid the resulting adverse consequences to us. 

Taxable REIT Subsidiaries. We are permitted to own any or all of the securities of a &#8220;taxable REIT subsidiary&#8221; as defined in Section 856(l) of the IRC, provided that no more than 25% (20% beginning with our 2018 taxable year) of the total value of our assets, at the close of each quarter, is comprised of our investments in the stock or other securities of our taxable REIT subsidiaries . Our ownership of stock and other securities in taxable REIT subsidiaries is exempt from the 10% and 5% REIT asset tests discussed below . Among other requirements, a taxable REIT subsidiary of ours must: 

(1) be a corporation (other than a REIT) for federal income tax purposes in which we directly or indirectly own shares; 

(2) join with us in making a taxable REIT subsidiary election; 

(3) not directly or indirectly operate or manage a lodging facility or a health care facility; and 

(4) not directly or indirectly provide to any person, under a franchise, license or otherwise, rights to any brand name under which any lodging facility or health care facility is operated, except that in limited circumstances a subfranchise, sublicense or similar right can be granted to an independent contractor to operate or manage a lodging facility or a health care facility. 

In addition, any corporation (other than a REIT) in which a taxable REIT subsidiary directly or indirectly owns more than 35% of the voting power or value of the outstanding securities of such corporation will automatically be treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary. Subject to the discussion below, we believe that we and each of our taxable REIT subsidiaries have complied with, and will continue to comply with, on a continuous basis, the requirements for taxable REIT subsidiary status at all times during which the subsidiary&#8217;s taxable REIT subsidiary election is reported as being in effect, and we believe that the same will be true for any taxable REIT subsidiary that we later form or acquire. &#160; 

We acquired in the second quarter of 2015, and owned until the fourth quarter of 2015, an ownership position in RMR Inc. that was in excess of 10% of RMR Inc. &#8217;s outstanding securities by vote or value. Accordingly, we elected to tre at RMR Inc. as a taxable REIT subsidiary effec tive as of June 5, 2015. RMR Inc. , through its principal subsidiary RMR LLC, has provided and continues to provide business and property management and other services to us and to other public and private companies, including other public REITs. Among these clients were and are operators of lodging facilities, operators of health care facilities, and owners of such facilities. Our counsel, Sullivan &#38; Worcester LLP, has provided to us an opinion that the activities proscribed to taxable REIT subsidiaries under Section 856(l)(3) of the IRC relating to operating or managing lodging facilities or health care facilities should include only regular onsite services or day-to-day operational activities at or for lodging facilities or health care facilities. To the best o f our knowledge, neither RMR Inc. nor RMR LLC has been or is involved in proscribed activities at or for lodging facilities or health care facilities. Thus, we do not believe that Section 856(l)(3) of the IR C precluded or precludes RMR Inc. from being treated as our taxable REIT subsidiary. In addition, because we acquired a significant port ion of our investment in RMR Inc. in exchange for our common shares that were newly issued, our counsel, Sullivan &#38; Worcester LLP, is of the opinio n that our investment in RMR Inc. should qualify as a &#8220;temporary investment of new capital&#8221; under Section 856(c)(5)(B) of the IRC to the extent related to such issuance of our common shares. To the exten t our investment in RMR Inc. so qualifies, it will constitute a &#8220;real estate asset&#8221; under Section 856(c) of the IRC and would not constitute a security subject to the REIT asset test limitations discussed below for a one-year period commencing June 5, 2015. If the IRS or a court determines, contrary to the opin ion of our counsel, that RMR Inc. was or is precluded from being treated as our taxable REIT subsidiary, then o ur ownership position in RMR Inc. in excess of 10% of RMR Inc. &#8217;s outstanding securities by vote or value, except to the extent and for the period qualifying as a &#8220;temporary investment of new capital ,&#8221; would be in violation of the applicable REIT asset tests described below. Under those 

&#160;

circumstances, however, we expect that we would qualify for the REIT asset tests&#8217; relief provision described below, and thereby would preserve our qualification for taxation as a REIT. If the relief provision below were to apply to us, we would be subject to tax at the highest corporate rate, currently 35%, on the net income generated by our investment in RMR I nc. in excess of a 10% owne rship position in that company. 

As discussed below, taxable REIT subsidiaries can perform services for our tenants without disqualifying the rents we receive from those tenants under the 75% gross income test or the 95% gross income test discussed below. Moreover, because our taxable REIT subsidiaries are taxed as C corporations that are separate from us, their assets, liabilities and items of income, deduction and credit generally are not imputed to us for purposes of the REIT qualification requirements described in this summary. Therefore, our taxable REIT subsidiaries may &#160; generally undertake third-party management and development activities and activities not related to real estate. 

Restrictions are imposed on taxable REIT subsidiaries to ensure that they will be subject to an appropriate level of federal income taxation. For example, a taxable REIT subsidiary may not deduct interest paid in any year to an affiliated REIT to the extent that the interest payments exceed, generally, 50% of the taxable REIT subsidiary&#8217;s adjusted taxable income for that year. However, the taxable REIT subsidiary may carry forward the disallowed interest expense to a succeeding year, and deduct the interest in that later year subject to that year&#8217;s 50% adjusted taxable income limitation. In addition, if a taxable REIT subsidiary pays interest, rent or other amounts to its affiliated REIT in an amount that exceeds what an unrelated third party would have paid in an arm&#8217;s length transaction, then the REIT generally will be subject to an excise tax equal to 100% of the excessive portion of the payment. Further, if in comparison to an arm&#8217;s length transaction, a third - party tenant has overpaid rent to the REIT in exchange for underpaying the taxable REIT subsidiary &#160; for services rendered, and if the REIT has not adequately compensated the taxable REIT subsidiary for services provided to or on behalf of the third - party &#160; tenant, then the REIT may be subject to an excise tax equal to 100% of the undercompensation t o the taxable REIT subsidiary. A safe harbor exception to this excise tax applies if the taxable REIT subsidiary has been compensated at a rate at least equal to 150% of its direct cost in furnishing or rendering the service. Finally, beginning in 2016, the 100% excise tax also applies to the underpricing of services by a taxable REIT subsidiary to its parent REIT in contexts where the services are unrelated to services for REIT tenants. There can be no assurance that arrangements involving our taxable REIT subsidiaries will not result in the imposition of one or more of these deduction limitations or excise taxes, but we do not believe that we or our taxable REIT subsidiaries are or will be subject to these impositions. 

Income Tests. There are two gross income requirements for qualification as a REIT under the IRC: 

&#183; 

At least 75% of our gross income for each taxable year (excluding: (a) gross income from sales or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale; (b) any income arising from &#8220;clearly identified&#8221; hedging transactions that we enter into to manage interest rate or price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings we incur to acquire or carry real estate assets; (c) any income arising from &#8220;clearly identified&#8221; hedging transactions that we enter into primarily to manage risk of currency fluctuations relating to any item that qualifies under the 75% gross income test or the 95% gross income test (or any property that generates such income or gain) ; (d) beginning with our 2016 taxable year, any income from &#8220;clearly identified&#8221; hedging transactions that we enter into to manage risk associated with extant hedges of liabilities or property that have been extinguished or disposed; (e) real estate foreign exchange gain (as defined in Section 856(n)(2) of the IRC); and (f) income from the repurchase or discharge of indebtedness) must be derived from investments relating to real property, including &#8220;rents from real property&#8221; as defined under Section 856 of the IRC, interest and gain from mortgages on real property or on interests in real property, income and gain from foreclosure property, gain from the sale or other disposition of real property other than dealer property, or dividends on and gain from the sale or dispos ition of shares in other REITs. When we receive new capital in exchange for our shares or in a public offering of our five-year or longer debt instruments, income attributable to the temporary investment of this new capital in stock or a debt instrument, if received or accrued within one year of our receipt of the new capital, is generally also qualifying income under the 75% gross income test. 

&#183; 

At least 95% of our gross income for each taxable year (excluding: (a) gross income from sales or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale; (b) any income arising from &#8220;clearly identified&#8221; hedging transactions that we enter into to manage interest rate or price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings we incur to acquire or carry real estate assets; (c) any income arising from &#8220;clearly identified&#8221; hedging transactions that we enter into primarily to manage risk of currency fluctuations relating to any item that qualifies under the 75% gross income test or the 95% gross income test (or any property that generates such income or gain) ; (d) beginning with our 2016 taxable year, any income from &#8220;clearly identified&#8221; hedging transactions that we enter into to manage risk associated with extant hedges of liabilities or property that have been extinguished or disposed; (e) passive foreign exchange gain (as defined in Section 856(n)(3) of the IRC); and (f) income from the repurchase or discharge of indebtedness) must be derived from a combination of items of real property 

&#160;

income that satisfy the 75% gross income test described above, dividends, interest, or gains from the sale or disposition of stock, securities or real property. 

For purposes of the 75% and 95% gross income tests outlined above, income derived from a &#8220;shared appreciation provision&#8221; in a mortgage loan is generally treated as gain recognized on the sale of the property to which it relates. Although we will use our best efforts to ensure that the income generated by our investments will be of a type that satisfies both the 75% and 95% gross income tests, there can be no assurance in this regard. 

In order to qualify as &#8220;rents from real property&#8221; under Section 856 of the IRC, several requirements must be met: 

&#183; 

The amount of rent received generally must not be based on the income or profits of any person, but may be based on a fixed percentage or percentages of receipts or sales. 

&#183; 

Rents do not qualify if the REIT owns 10% or more by vote or value of the tenant (or 10% or more of the interests in the assets or net profits of the tenant, if the tenant is not a corporation), whether directly or after application of attribution rules. While we intend not to lease property to any party if rents from that property would not qualify as &#8220; rents from real property,&#8221; application of the 10% ownership rule is dependent upon complex attribution rules and circumstances that may be beyond our control. For example, a third party&#8217;s ownership directly or by attribution of 10% or more by value of our shares, as well as an ownership position in the stock of one of our tenants which, when added to our own ownership position in that tenant, totals 10% or more by vote or value of the stock of that tenant (or 10% or more of the interests in the assets or net profits of the tenant, if the tenant is not a corporation), would result in that tenant&#8217;s rents not qualifying as &#8220; rents from real property.&#8221; Our declaration of trust generally disallows transfers or purported acquisitions, directly or by attribution, of our shares to the extent necessary to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT under the IRC. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that these restrictions &#160; will be effective to prevent our qualification for taxation as a REIT from being jeopardized under the 10% affiliated tenant rule. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to monitor and enforce these restrictions, nor will our shareholders necessarily be aware of ownership of our shares attributed to them under the IRC&#8217;s attribution rules. 

&#183; 

There is a limited exception to the above prohibition on earning &#8220;rents from real property&#8221; from a 10% affiliated tenant where the tenant is a taxable REIT subsidiary. If at least 90% of the leased space of a property is leased to tenants other than taxable REIT subsidiaries and 10% affiliated tenants, and if the taxable REIT subsidiary&#8217;s rent to us for space at that property is substantially comparable to the rents paid by nonaffiliated tenants for comparable space at the property, then otherwise qualifying rents paid by the taxable REIT subsidiary to the REIT will not be disqualified on account of the rule prohibiting 10% affiliated tenants. 

&#183; 

In order for rents to qualify, we generally must not manage the property or furnish or render services to the tenants of the property, except through an independent contractor from whom we derive no income or through one of our taxable REIT subsidiaries. There is an exception to this rule permitting a REIT to perform customary tenant services of the sort that a tax-exempt organization could perform without being considered in receipt of &#8220;unrelated business taxable income, &#8221; or UBTI, under Section 512(b)(3) of the IRC. In addition, a de minimis amount of noncustomary services provided to tenants will not disqualify income as &#8220;rents from real property&#8221; so long as the value of the impermissible tenant services does not exceed 1% of the gross income from the property. 

&#183; 

If rent attributable to personal property leased in connection with a lease of real property is 15% or less of the total rent received under the lease, then the rent attributable to personal property qualifies &#160; as &#8220;rents from real property&#8221;; if this 15% threshold is exceeded, the rent attributable to personal property does &#160; not so qualify. The portion of rental income treated as attributable to personal property is determined according to the ratio of the fair market value &#160; of the personal property to the total fair market value of the real and personal property that is rented. 

&#183; 

In addition, &#8220;rents from real property&#8221; includes both charges we receive for services customarily rendered in connection with the rental of comparable real property in the same geographical area, whether or not the charges are separately stated, as well as charges we receive for services provided by our taxable REIT subsidiaries when the charges are not separately stated. Whether separately stated charges received by a REIT for services that are not geographically customary and provided by a taxable REIT subsidiary are included in &#8220;rents from real property&#8221; has not been addressed clearly by the IRS in published authorities; however, our counsel, Sullivan &#38; Worcester LLP, is of the opinion that , although the matter is not free from doubt, &#8220;rents from real property&#8221; also includes charges we receive for services provided by our taxable REIT subsidiaries when the charges are separately stated. Accordingly, we believe that our revenues from taxable REIT subsidiary-provided services, whether the charges are separately stated or not, qualify as &#8220;rents from real property&#8221; because 

&#160;

the services satisfy the geographically customary standard, because the services have been provided by a taxable REIT subsidiary, or for both reasons. 

We believe that &#160; all or substantially all of &#160; our rents and related service charges have qualified and will continue to &#160; qualify as &#8220; rents from real property &#8221; for purposes of Section 856 of the IRC. 

In order to qualify as mortgage interest on real property for purposes of the 75% gross income test, interest must derive from a mortgage loan secured by real property or on interests in real property with a fair market value at the time the loan is made (reduced by any senior liens on the property) at least equal to the amount of the loan. If the amount of the loan exceeds the fair market value of the real property (as so reduced by senior liens), the interest will be treated as interest on a mortgage loan in a ratio equal to the ratio of the fair market value of the real property (as so reduced by senior liens) to the total amount of the mortgage loan. 

Absent the &#8220;foreclosure property&#8221; rules of Section 856(e) of the IRC, a REIT&#8217;s receipt of active, nonrental gross income from a property would not qualify under the 75% and 95% gross income tests. But as foreclosure property, the active, nonrental gross income from a property would so qualify. In the case of property leased by a REIT to a tenant, foreclosure property generally consists of the real property and incidental personal property that the REIT has reduced to possession upon a default or imminent default under the lease by the tenant, and as to which a timely foreclosure property election is made. Any gain that a REIT recognizes on the sale of foreclosure property held as inventory or primarily for sale to customers, plus any income it receives from foreclosure property that would not qualify under the 75% gross income test in the absence of foreclosure property treatment, reduced by expenses directly connected with the production of those items of income, would be subject to income tax at the maximum corporate rate, currently 35%, under the foreclosure property income tax rules of Section 857(b)(4) of the IRC. Thus, if a REIT should lease foreclosure property in exchange for rent that qualifies as &#8220;rents from real property&#8221; as described above, then that rental income is not subject to the foreclosure property income tax . 

Other than sales of foreclosure property, any gain we realize on the sale of property held as inventory or other property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business will be treated as income from a prohibited transaction that is subject to a penalty tax at a 100% rate. This prohibited transaction income also may adversely affect our ability to satisfy the 75% and 95% gross income tests for federal income tax qualification as a REIT. Whether property is held as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction. &#160; There can be no assurance as to whether or not the IRS might successfully assert that one or more of our dispositions is subject to the 100% penalty tax. Sections 857(b)(6)(C) and (E) of the IRC provide a safe harbor pursuant to which limited sales of real property held for at least two years and meeting specified additional requirements will not be treated as prohibited transactions. However, compliance with the safe harbor is not always achievable in practice. 

We believe that any gain from dispositions of assets that we &#160; have made , or that we might make in the future, will generally qualify &#160; as income that satisfies the 75% and 95% gross income tests and will not be subject to the 100% penalty tax, because our general intent has been and is to: 

&#183; 

own our assets for investment with a view to long-term income production and capital appreciation; 

&#183; 

engage in the business of developing, owning, leasing and managing our existing properties and acquiring, developing, owning, leasing and managing new properties; and 

&#183; 

make occasional dispositions of our assets consistent with our long-term investment objectives. 

If we fail to satisfy one or both of the 75% gross income test or the 95% gross income test in any taxable year, we may nevertheless qualify for taxation as a REIT for that year if we satisfy the following requirements: 

&#183; 

our failure to meet the test is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect ; and 

&#183; 

after we identify the failure, we file a schedule describing each item of our gross income included in the 75% gross income test or the 95% gross income test for that taxable year. 

&#160;

I t is impossible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to the benefit of this relief provision for the 75% gross income test or the 95% gross income test. Even if this relief provision does apply, a 100% tax is imposed upon the greater of the amount by which we failed the 75% gross income test or the amount by which we failed the 95% gross income test, with adjustments, multiplied by a fraction intended to reflect our profitability &#160; for the taxable year . This relief provision applies to any failure of the applicable income tests, even if the failure first occurred in a year prior to the taxable year in which the failure was discovered. 

Based on the discussion above, we believe that we have satisfied, and will continue to satisfy, the 75% and 95% gross income tests outlined above on a continuing basis beginning with our first taxable year as a REIT. 

Asset Tests. At the close of each calendar quarter of each taxable year, we must also satisfy the following asset percentage tests in order to qualify for taxation as a REIT for federal income tax purposes: 

&#183; 

At least 75% of the value of our total assets must consist of real estate assets (which includes, beginning with our 2016 taxable year, ancillary personal property to the extent that rents attributable to such personal property are treated as rents from real property in accordance with the rules described above), cash and cash items, shares in other REITs, debt instruments issued by &#8220;publicly offered REITs&#8221; as defined in Section 562(c)(2) of the IRC (beginning with our 2016 taxable year), government securities and temporary investments of new capital (that is, any stock or debt instrument that we hold that is attributable to any amount received by us (a) in exchange for our stock or (b) in a public offering of our five-year or longer debt instruments, but only for the one year period commencing with our receipt of the new capital). 

&#183; 

Not more than 25% of the value of our total assets may be represented by securities other than those securities that count favorably toward the preceding 75% asset test. 

&#183; 

Of the investments included in the preceding 25% asset class, the value of any one non-REIT issuer&#8217;s securities that we own may not exceed 5% of the value of our total assets. In addition, we may not own more than 10% of the vote or value of any one non-REIT issuer&#8217;s outstanding securities, unless the securities are &#8220;straight debt&#8221; securities or otherwise excepted as discussed below. Our stock and other securities in a taxable REIT subsidiary or a qualified REIT subsidiary are exempted from these 5% and 10% asset tests. 

&#183; 

Not more than 25% (20% beginning with our 2018 taxable year) of the value of our total assets may be represented by stock or other securities of taxable REIT subsidiaries. 

&#183; 

B eginning with our 2016 taxable year, not more than 25% of the value of our total assets may be represented by &#8220;nonqualified publicly offered REIT debt instruments&#8221; as defined in Section 856(c)(5)(L)(ii ) of the IRC . 

Our counsel, Sullivan &#38; Worcester LLP, is of the opinion that our investments in the equity or debt of a taxable REIT subsidiary, to the extent and during the period they qualify as temporary investments of new capital, should be treated as a real estate asset, and not as a security , for purposes of the above REIT asset tests. 

The above REIT asset tests must be satisfied at the close of each calendar quarter of each taxable year as a REIT. After a REIT meets the asset tests at the close of any quarter, it will not lose its qualification for taxation &#160; as a REIT in any subsequent quarter solely because of fluctuations in the values of its assets. T his grandfathering rule may be of limited benefit to a REIT such as us that makes periodic acquisitions of both qualifying and nonqualifying REIT assets . When a failure to satisfy the above asset tests results from an acquisition of securities or other property during a quarter, the failure can be cured by disposition of sufficient nonqualifying assets within 30 &#160; days after the close of that quarter. 

In addition, if we fail the 5% value test or the 10% vote or value tests at the close of any quarter and we &#160; do not cure such failure within 30 &#160; days after the close of that quarter, that failure will nevertheless be excused if (a) the failure is &#8220; de minimis &#8221; and (b) within six months after the last day of the quarter in which we identify the failure, we either dispose of the assets causing the failure or otherwise satisfy the 5% value and 10% vote and value asset tests. For purposes of this relief provision, the failure will be de minimis if the value of the assets causing the failure does not exceed the lesser of (a) 1% of the total value of our assets at the end of the relevant quarter or (b) $10,000,000. If our failure is not de minimis, or if any of the other REIT asset tests have been violated, we may nevertheless qualify for taxation as a REIT if (a) we provide the IRS with a description of each asset causing the failure, (b) the failure was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect, (c) we pay a tax equal to the greater of (1) $50,000 or (2) the highest rate of corporate tax imposed , currently 35 %, on the net income generated by the assets causing the failure during the period of the failure, and (d) within six months after the last day of the quarter in which we identify the failure, we either dispose of the assets causing the 

&#160;

failure or otherwise satisfy all of the REIT asset tests. These relief provisions apply to any failure of the applicable asset tests, even if the failure first occurred in a year prior to the taxable year in which the failure was discovered. 

The IRC also provides an excepted securities safe harbor to the 10% value test that includes among other items (a) &#8220;straight debt&#8221; securities, (b) certain rental agreements in which payment is to be made in subsequent years, (c) any obligation to pay &#8220; rents from real property, &#8221; (d) securities issued by governmental entities that are not dependent in whole or in part on the profits of or payments from a nongovernmental entity, and (e) any security issued by another REIT. We have maintained and will continue to maintain records of the value of our assets to document our compliance with the above asset tests, and intend to take actions as may be required to cure any failure to satisfy the tests within 30 &#160; days after the close of any quarter or within the six month periods described above. 

Based on the discussion above, we believe that we have satisfied, and will continue to satisfy , the above REIT asset tests on a continuing basis beginning with our first taxable year as a REIT . 

Annual Distribution Requirements. In order to qualify for taxation as a REIT under the IRC, we are required to make annual distributions other than capital gain dividends to our shareholders in an amount at least equal to the excess of: 

(1) the sum of 90% of our &#8220;real estate investment trust taxable income &#8221; and 90% of our net income after tax, if any, from property received in foreclosure, over 

(2) the amount by which our noncash income ( e.g., imputed rental income or income from transactions inadvertently failing to qualify as like-kind exchanges ) exceeds 5% of our &#8220;real estate investment trust taxable income.&#8221; 

For these purposes, our &#8220;real estate investment trust taxable income&#8221; is as defined under Section 857 of the IRC and is computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain and will generally be reduced by specified corporate-level taxes that we pay (e.g., taxes on built-in gains or taxes on foreclosure property income). 

For our 2014 and prior taxable years, a distribution of ours that was not pro rata within a class of our beneficial interests entitled to a distribution, or which was not consistent with the rights to distributions among our classes of beneficial interests, would have been a preferential distribution that would not have been taken into consideration for purposes of the distribution requirements, and accordingly the payment of a preferential distribution would have affected our ability to meet the distribution requirements. Taking into account our distribution policies, including any dividend reinvestment plan we adopted, we do not believe that we made any preferential distributions in 2014 or prior taxable years. Because we are a &#8220;publicly offered REIT&#8221; (as defined in Section 562(c)(2) of the IRC) that is required to file annual and periodic reports with the SEC under the Exchange Act, the preferential distribution rule does not apply to us beginning with our 2015 taxable year. 

Distributions must be paid in the taxable year to which they relate, or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our federal income tax return for the earlier taxable year and if paid on or before the first regular distribution payment after that declaration. If a dividend is declared in October, November or December to shareholders of record during one of those months, and is paid during the following January, then for federal income tax purposes the dividend will be treated as having been both paid and received on December 31 of the prior taxable year. The 90% &#160; distribution requirements may be waived by the IRS if a REIT establishes that it failed to meet them by reason of distributions previously made to meet the requirements of the 4% excise tax discussed below. To the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain and all of our &#8220;real estate investment trust taxable income,&#8221; as adjusted, we will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates on undistributed amounts. 

In addition, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax to the extent we fail within a calendar year to make required distributions to our shareholders of 85% of our ordinary income and 95% of our capital gain net income plus the excess, if any, of the &#8220;grossed up required distribution&#8221; for the preceding calendar year over the amount treated as distributed for that preceding calendar year. For this purpose, the term &#8220;grossed up required distribution&#8221; for any calendar year is the sum of our taxable income for the calendar year without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and all amounts from earlier years that are not treated as having been distributed under the provision. We will be treated as having sufficient earnings and profits to treat as a dividend any distribution by us up to the amount required to be distributed in order to avoid imposition of the 4% excise tax. 

&#160;

If we do not have enough cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90% distribution requirements, or if we so choose, we may find it necessary or desirable to arrange for new debt or equity financing to provide funds for required distributions in order to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT. We can provide no assurance that financing would be available for these purposes on favorable terms , if at all . 

We may be able to rectify a failure to pay sufficient dividends for any year by paying &#8220;deficiency dividends&#8221; to shareholders in a later year. These deficiency dividends may be included in our deduction for dividends paid for the earlier year, but an interest charge would be imposed upon us for the delay in distribution. 

In addition to the other distribution requirements above, to preserve our qualification for taxation &#160; as a REIT we are required to timely distribute all C corporation earnings and profits that we inh erit from acquired corporations, as described below. 

Our Relationship with SIR 

We own a substantial amount of the outstanding common shares of SIR, which we currently expect is and will remain qualified for taxation as a REIT under the IRC. For any of our taxable years in which SIR qualifies for taxation as a REIT, our investment in SIR will count as a qualifying REIT asset toward the REIT gross asset tests and our gains and dividends from SIR common shares will count as qualifying income under the 75% and 95% gross income tests, all as described above. However, because we do not and cannot control SIR&#8217;s compliance with the federal income tax requirements for REIT qualification and taxation, we can provide no assurance that SIR is or will remain qualified for taxation as a REIT under the IRC. Accordingly, we have joined with SIR in filing a protective taxable REIT subsidiary election under Section 856(l) of the IRC , effective for the third quarter of 2014, and we have reaffirmed this protective election with SIR every January 1 thereafter, and may continue to do so, unless and until our ownership of SIR falls below 10%. Pursuant to this protective taxable REIT subsidiary election, we believe that even if SIR is not a REIT for some reason, then it would instead be considered one of our taxable REIT subsidiaries, and as such its value would either fit within our REIT gross asset tests described above or would be such that any penalty taxes associated with our remediation of a REIT asset test failure for which there is reasonable cause, as described above, would be much lower than if no such taxable REIT subsidiary election were in place, though any applicable penalty taxes might still be substantial. The protective taxable REIT subsidiary election will not impact our compliance with the 75% and 95% gross income tests described above; we do not expect our gains and dividends from SIR common shares to jeopardize compliance with these tests, even if for some reason SIR is not a REIT. 

Acquisitions of C Corporations 

We &#160; may in the future engage in transactions where we acquire all of the outstanding stock of a C corporation. Upon these acquisitions, except to the extent we &#160; make an applicable taxable REIT subsidiary election, each of the acquired entities and their various corporate and noncorporate subsidiaries generally will become either our qualified REIT subsidiaries under Section 856(i) of the IRC or disregarded entities under Treasury regulations issued under Section 7701 of the IRC. Thus, after the acquisition, all assets, liabilities and items of income, deduction and credit of the acquired and then disregarded entities &#160; will be treated as ours for purposes of the various REIT qualification tests described above. In addition, we generally &#160; will be treated as the successor to the acquired and then disregarded entities&#8217; (a) federal income tax attributes, such as those entities&#8217; adjusted tax bases in their assets and their depreciation schedules; and (b) earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes, if any. The carryover of these attributes creates REIT implications such as built-in gains tax exposure and additional distribution requirements, as described below. However, where we &#160; make an election under Section 338(g) of the IRC with respect to corporations that we acquire, we generally &#160; will not be subject to such attribute carryovers. 

Built-in Gains from C Corporations. As described above, notwithstanding our qualification and taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to corporate taxation if we dispose of assets previously held by a C corporation . Specifically, if we acquire an asset from a corporation in a transaction in which our adjusted tax basis in the asset is determined by reference to the adjusted tax basis of that asset in the hands of a C corporation, and if we subsequently recognize gain on the disposition of that asset during a five-year period &#160; beginning on the date on which the asset ceased to be owned by the C corporation, then we will generally pay tax at the highest regular corporate tax rate, currently 35%, on the lesser of (a) the excess, if any, of the asset&#8217;s fair market value over its adjusted tax basis, each determined as of the time the asset ceased to be owned by the C corporation or (b) our gain recognized in the disposition. Accordingly, any taxable disposition of an asset so acquired during such five-year period &#160; could be subject to this built-in gains tax. To the extent of our gains in a taxable year that are subject to the built-in gains tax, net of any taxes paid on such 

&#160;

gains with respect to that taxable year, our taxable dividends paid to you in the following year will be potentially eligible for treatment as qualified dividends that are taxed to our noncorporate U.S. shareholders at preferential rates. However, we &#160; do not expect to sell any assets if that sale would result in the imposition of a material tax liability. We cannot, however, provide assurance that we will not change our plans in this regard. 

Earnings and Profits. Following a corporate acquisition, we must generally distribute no later than the end of the applicable tax year all of the C corporation earnings and profits inherited in that transaction, if any, to preserve our qualification for taxation as a REIT. If we &#160; fail to do so, we would not qualify for taxation as a REIT for that year and a number of years thereafter, unless we are able to rely on the relief provision described below. Although Sullivan &#38; Worcester LLP is unable to render an opinion on factual determinations such as the amount of our undistributed earnings and profits, we will compute, with the assistance of accountants as needed, the amount of undistributed earnings and profits that we inherit in our corporate acquisitions. However, there can be no assurance that , &#160; if audited, the IRS would not, upon subsequent examination, propose adjustments to our calculation of the undistributed earnings and profits that we inherit, including adjustments that might be deemed necessary by the IRS as a result of its examination of the companies we acquired. In any such examination, the IRS might consider all taxable years of the acquired entities as open for review for purposes of its proposed adjustments. If it is subsequently determined that we had undistributed earnings and profits as of the end of the applicable tax year, we may be eligible for a relief provision similar to the &#8220;deficiency dividends&#8221; procedure described above. To utilize this relief provision, we would have to pay an interest charge for the delay in distributing the undistributed earnings and profits; in addition, we would be required to distribute to our shareholders, in addition to our other REIT distribution requirements, the amount of the undistributed earnings and profits less the interest charge paid. 

Depreciation and Federal Income Tax Treatment of Leases 

Our initial tax bases in our assets will generally be our acquisition cost. We will generally depreciate our depreciable real property on a straight-line basis over 40 &#160; years and our personal property over the applicable shorter periods. These depreciation schedules may vary for properties that we acquire through tax-free or carryover basis acquisitions. 

We are entitled to depreciation deductions from our facilities only if we are treated for federal income tax purposes as the owner of the facilities. This means that the leases of the facilities must be classified for federal income tax purposes as true leases, rather than as sales or financing arrangements, and we believe this to be the case. 

Distributions to our Shareholders 

As discussed above, we expect to make distributions to our shareholders from time to time. These distributions may include cash distributions, in kind distributions of property, and deemed or constructive distributions resulting from capital market activities. The United States federal income tax treatment of our distributions will vary based on the status of the recipient shareholder as more fully described below under &#8220;Taxation of Taxable U.S. Shareholders,&#8221; &#8220;Taxation of Tax-Exempt U.S. Shareholders,&#8221; and &#8220;Taxation of Non-U.S. Shareholders.&#8221; 

A redemption of our shares for cash only will be treated as a distribution under Section 302 of the IRC, and hence taxable as a dividend to the extent of our available current or accumulated earnings and profits, unless the redemption satisfies one of the tests set forth in Section 302(b) of the IRC enabling the redemption to be treated as a sale or exchange of the shares. The redemption for cash only will be treated as a sale or exchange if it (a) is &#8220;substantially disproportionate&#8221; with respect to the surrendering shareholder&#8217;s ownership in us, (b) results in a &#8220;complete termination&#8221; of the surrendering shareholder&#8217;s entire share interest in us, or (c) is &#8220;not essentially equivalent to a dividend&#8221; with respect to the surrendering shareholder, all within the meaning of Section 302(b) of the IRC. In determining whether any of these tests have been met, a shareholder must generally take into account shares considered to be owned by such shareholder by reason of constructive ownership rules set forth in the IRC, as well as shares actually owned by such shareholder. In addition, if a redemption is treated as a distribution under the preceding tests, then a shareholder&#8217;s tax basis in the redeemed shares generally will be transferred to the shareholder&#8217;s remaining shares in us, if any, and if such shareholder owns no other shares in us, such basis generally may be transferred to a related person or may be lost entirely. Because the determination as to whether a shareholder will satisfy any of the tests of Section 302(b) of the IRC depends upon the facts and circumstances at the time that our shares are redeemed, we urge you to consult your own tax advisor to determine your particular tax treatment of any redemption. 

&#160;

Taxation of Taxable U.S. Shareholders 

For noncorporate U.S. shareholders, to the extent that their total adjusted income does not exceed applicable thresholds, the maximum federal income tax rate for long-term capital gains and most corporate dividends is generally 15%. For those noncorporate U.S. shareholders whose total adjusted income exceeds the applicable thresholds, the maximum federal income tax rate for long-term capital gains and most corporate dividends is generally 20%. However, because we are not generally subject to federal income tax on the portion of our &#8220;real estate investment trust taxable income&#8221; distributed to our shareholders, dividends on our shares generally are not eligible for such preferential tax rates, except that any distribution of C corporation earnings and profits and taxed built-in gain items will potentially be eligible for these preferential tax rates. As a result, our ordinary dividends are generally &#160; taxed at the higher federal income tax rates applicable to ordinary income. To summarize , the preferential federal income tax rates for long-term capital gains and for qualified dividends generally apply to: 

(1) long-term capital gains, if any, recognized on the disposition of our shares ; 

(2) our distributions designated as long-term capital gain dividends (except to the extent attributable to real estate depreciation recapture, in which case the distributions are subject to a maximum 25% federal income tax rate); 

(3) our dividends attributable to dividend income , if any, received by us from C corporations such as taxable REIT subsidiaries; 

(4) our dividends attributable to earnings and profits that we inherit from C corporations; and 

(5) our dividends to the extent attributable to income upon which we have paid federal corporate income tax (such as sale gains subject to the 35% built-in gains tax), net of the corporate taxes thereon . 

As long as we qualify for taxation as a REIT, a distribution to our U.S. shareholders that we do not designate as a capital gain dividend generally will be treated as an ordinary income dividend to the extent of our available current or accumulated earnings and profits. Distributions made out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits that we properly designate as capital gain dividends generally will be taxed as long-term capital gains, as discussed below, to the extent they do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year. However, corporate shareholders may be required to treat up to 20% of any capital gain dividend as ordinary income under Section 291 of the IRC. 

In addition, we may elect to retain net capital gain income and treat it as constructively distributed. In that case: 

(1) we will be taxed at regular corporate capital gains tax rates on retained amounts; 

(2) each U.S. shareholder will be taxed on its designated proportionate share of our retained net capital gains as though that amount were distributed and designated a capital gain dividend; 

(3) each U.S. shareholder will receive a credit or refund for its designated proportionate share of the tax that we pay; 

(4) each U.S. shareholder will increase its adjusted basis in our shares by the excess of the amount of its proportionate share of these retained net capital gains over the U.S. shareholder&#8217;s proportionate share of the tax that we pay; and 

(5) both we and our corporate shareholders will make commensurate adjustments in our respective earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes. 

If we elect to retain our net capital gains in this fashion, we will notify our U.S. shareholders of the relevant tax information within 60 &#160; days after the close of the affected taxable year. 

If for any taxable year we designate capital gain dividends for our shareholders, then a portion of the capital gain dividends we designate will be allocated to the holders of a particular class of shares on a percentage basis equal to the ratio of the amount of the total dividends paid or made available for the year to the holders of that class of shares to the total dividends paid or made available for the year to holders of all outstanding classes of our shares. We will similarly designate the portion of any capital gain dividend that is 

&#160;

to be taxed to noncorporate U.S. shareholders at preferential maximum rates (including any capital gains attributable to real estate depreciation recapture that are subject to a maximum 25% federal income tax rate) so that the designations will be proportionate among all outstanding classes of our shares. 

Distributions in excess of current or accumulated earnings and profits will not be taxable to a U.S. shareholder to the extent that they do not exceed the shareholder&#8217;s adjusted tax basis in the shareholder&#8217;s shares, but will reduce the shareholder&#8217;s basis in those shares. To the extent that these excess distributions exceed a U.S. shareholder&#8217;s adjusted basis in our shares, they will be included in income as capital gain, with long-term gain generally taxed to noncorporate U.S. shareholders at preferential maximum rates. No U.S. shareholder may include on its federal income tax return any of our net operating losses or any of our capital losses. 

If a dividend is declared in October, November or December to shareholders of record during one of those months, and is paid during the following January, then for federal income tax purposes the dividend will be treated as having been both paid and received on December 31 of the prior taxable year. Also, items that are treated differently for regular and alternative minimum tax purposes are to be allocated between a REIT and its shareholders under Treasury regulations which are to be prescribed. It is possible that these Treasury regulations will permit or require tax preference items to be allocated to our shareholders with respect to any accelerated depreciation or other tax preference items that we claim. Also, until such time as regulations are issued, we may choose to allocate applicable tax preference items to our shareholders. 

A U.S. shareholder will generally recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and the shareholder&#8217;s adjusted basis in our shares that are sold or exchanged. This gain or loss will be capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the shareholder&#8217;s holding period in our &#160; shares exceeds one year. In addition, any loss upon a sale or exchange of our shares held for six months or less will generally be treated as a long-term capital loss to the extent of any long-term capital gain dividends we &#160; paid on such shares during the holding period. 

U.S. shareholders who are individuals, estates or trusts are generally required to pay a 3.8% Medicare tax on their net investment income (including dividends on and gains from the sale or other disposition of our shares), or in the case of estates and trusts on their net investment income that is not distributed, in each case to the extent that their total adjusted income exceeds applicable thresholds. 

If a U.S. shareholder recognizes a loss upon a disposition of our shares in an amount that exceeds a prescribed threshold, it is possible that the provisions of Treasury regulations involving &#8220;reportable transactions&#8221; could apply, with a resulting requirement to separately disclose the loss-generating transaction to the IRS. These Treasury regulations are written quite broadly, and apply to many routine and simple transactions. A reportable transaction currently includes, among other things, a sale or exchange of our shares resulting in a tax loss in excess of (a) $10 million in any single year or $20 million in a prescribed combination of succeeding tax years in the case of our shares held by a C corporation or by a partnership with only C corporation partners or (b) $2 million in any single year or $4 million in a prescribed combination of succeeding tax years in the case of our shares held by any other partnership or an S corporation, trust or individual, including losses that flow through pass through entities to individuals. A taxpayer discloses a reportable transaction by filing IRS Form 8886 with its federal income tax return and, in the first year of filing, a copy of Form 8886 must be sent to the IRS&#8217;s Office of Tax Shelter Analysis. The annual maximum penalty for failing to disclose a reportable transaction is generally $10,000 in the case of a natural person and $50,000 in any other case. 

Noncorporate U.S. shareholders who borrow funds to finance their acquisition of our shares could be limited in the amount of deductions allowed for the interest paid on the indebtedness incurred. Under Section 163(d) of the IRC, interest paid or accrued on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry property held for investment is generally deductible only to the extent of the investor&#8217;s net investment income. A U.S. shareholder&#8217;s net investment income will include ordinary income dividend distributions received from us and, if an appropriate election is made by the shareholder, capital gain dividend distributions and qualified dividends received from us; however, distributions treated as a nontaxable return of the shareholder&#8217;s basis will not enter into the computation of net investment income. 

Taxation of Tax-Exempt U.S. Shareholders 

The rules governing the federal income taxation of tax-exempt entities are complex, and the following discussion is intended only as a summary of these rules. If you are a tax-exempt shareholder, we urge you to consult with your own tax advisor to determine 

&#160;

the impact of federal, state, local and foreign tax laws, including any tax return filing and other reporting requirements, with respect to your investment in our shares. 

Subject to the pension-held REIT rules discussed below, our distributions made to shareholders that are tax-exempt pension plans, individual retirement accounts or other qualifying tax-exempt entities should not constitute UBTI , provided that the shareholder has not financed its acquisition of our shares with &#8220;acquisition indebtedness&#8221; within the meaning of the IRC, that the shares are not otherwise used in an unrelated trade or business of the tax-exempt entity, and that, consistent with our present intent, we do not hold a residual interest in a real estate mortgage investment conduit. 

Any trusts that are described in Section 401(a) of the IRC and are tax-exempt under Section 501(a) of the IRC, or tax-exempt pension trusts, that own more than 10% by value of a &#8220;pension-held REIT&#8221; at any time during a taxable year may be required to treat a percentage of all dividends received from the pension-held REIT during the year as UBTI. This percentage is equal to the ratio of: 

(1) the pension-held REIT&#8217;s gross income derived from the conduct of unrelated trades or businesses, determined as if the pension-held REIT were a tax-exempt pension trust, less direct expenses related to that income, to 

(2) the pension-held REIT&#8217;s gross income from all sources, less direct expenses related to that income, 

except that this percentage shall be deemed to be zero unless it would otherwise equal or exceed 5%. 

A REIT is a pension-held REIT if: 

&#183; 

the REIT is &#8220;predominantly held&#8221; by tax-exempt pension trusts; and 

&#183; 

the REIT would fail to satisfy the &#8220;closely held&#8221; ownership requirement , discussed above in &#8220;REIT Qualification Requirements,&#8221; if the stock or beneficial interests in the REIT held by tax-exempt pension trusts were viewed as held by the tax-exempt pension trusts rather than by their respective beneficiaries. 

A REIT is predominantly held by tax-exempt pension trusts if at least one tax-exempt pension trust owns more than 25% by value of the interests in such REIT , or if one or more tax-exempt pension trusts, each owning more than 10% by value of the interests in such REIT , own in the aggregate more than 50% by value of the interests in such REIT. Because of the share ownership concentration restrictions contained in our declaration of trust, we believe that we have &#160; not &#160; been &#160; and will not become a pension-held REIT and accordingly, the tax treatment described above should be inapplicable to our tax-exempt shareholders. However, because our shares &#160; have been and are expected to remain publicly traded, we cannot completely control whether or not we are or will become a pension-held REIT. 

Social clubs, voluntary employee benefit associations and supplemental unemployment benefit trusts exempt from federal income taxation under Sections 501(c)(7), (c)(9) and (c)(17) of the IRC, respectively, are subject to different UBTI rules, which generally will require them to characterize distributions from a REIT as UBTI . In addition, these prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors concerning any &#8220;set aside&#8221; or reserve requirements applicable to them. 

Taxation of Non-U.S. Shareholders 

The rules governing the United States federal income taxation of non-U.S. shareholders are complex, and the following discussion is intended only as a summary of these rules. If you are a non-U.S. shareholder, we urge you to consult with your own tax advisor to determine the impact of United States federal, state, local and foreign tax laws, including any tax return filing and other reporting requirements, with respect to your investment in our shares. 

In general, a non-U.S. shareholder will be subject to regular United States federal income tax in the same manner as a U.S. shareholder with respect to its investment in our shares if that investment is effectively connected with the non-U.S. shareholder&#8217;s conduct of a trade or business in the United States (and, if provided by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base the non-U.S. shareholder maintains in the United States). In addition, a corporate non-U.S. shareholder that receives income that is or is deemed effectively connected with a trade or business in the United States may also be subject to the 30% branch profits tax under Section 884 of the IRC, or lower applicable tax treaty rate , which is payable in addition to regular United States federal corporate income tax. The balance of this discussion of the United States federal income taxation of non-U.S. 

&#160;

shareholders addresses only those non-U.S. shareholders whose investment in our shares is not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States. 

A distribution by us to a non-U.S. shareholder that is not attributable to gain from the sale or exchange of a &#8220; United States real property interest &#8221; within the meaning of Section 897 of the IRC , or a USRPI, and that is not designated as a capital gain dividend will be treated as an ordinary income dividend to the extent that it is made out of current or accumulated earnings and profits. A distribution of this type will generally be subject to United States federal income tax and withholding at the rate of 30%, or at a lower rate if the non-U.S. shareholder has in the manner prescribed by the IRS demonstrated to the applicable withholding agent its entitlement to benefits under a tax treaty. In the case of any deemed or constructive distributions or a distribution in kind, the applicable withholding agent will have to collect the amount required to be withheld by reducing to cash for remittance to the IRS a sufficient portion of the property that the non-U.S. shareholder would otherwise receive or own , and the non-U.S. shareholder may bear brokerage or other costs for this withholding procedure. Because we cannot determine our current and accumulated earnings and profits until the end of the taxable year, withholding at the rate of 30% or applicable lower treaty rate will generally be imposed on the gross amount of any distribution to a non-U.S. shareholder that we make and do not designate as a capital gain dividend. Notwithstanding this potential withholding on distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, these distributions are a nontaxable return of capital to the extent that they do not exceed the non-U.S. shareholder&#8217;s adjusted basis in our shares, and the nontaxable return of capital will reduce the adjusted basis in these shares. To the extent that distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits exceed the non-U.S. shareholder&#8217;s adjusted basis in our shares, the distributions will give rise to tax liability if the non-U.S. shareholder would otherwise be subject to tax on any gain from the sale or exchange of these shares, as discussed below. A non-U.S. shareholder may seek a refund from the IRS of amounts withheld on distributions to it in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. 

From time to time, some of our distributions may be attributable to the sale or exchange of USRPIs. However, capital gain dividends that are received by a non-U.S. shareholder, as well as dividends attributable to our sales of USRPIs , will be subject to the taxation and withholding regime applicable to ordinary income dividends and the branch profits tax will not apply, provided that ( a ) these dividends are received with respect to a class of shares that is &#8220;regularly traded&#8221; on a domestic &#8220;established securities market&#8221; such as the New York Stock Exchange, or the &#160; NYSE , both terms as defined by applicable Treasury regulations, and ( b ) the non-U.S. shareholder does not own more than 10% ( 5% for dividends before December 18, 2015) of that class of shares at any time during the one-year period ending on the date of distribution of the applicable capital gain and USRPI dividends. If both of these provisions are satisfied, qualifying non-U.S. shareholders will not be subject to withholding either on capital gain dividends or on dividends that are attributable to our sales of USRPIs as though those amounts were effectively connected with a United States trade or business, and qualifying non-U.S. shareholders will not be required to file United States federal income tax returns or pay branch profits tax in respect of these dividends. Instead, these dividends will be subject to United States federal income tax and withholding as ordinary dividends, currently at a 30% tax rate unless , as discussed below, reduced by an applicable treaty . Although there can be no assurance in this regard, w e believe that our common shares have been and will remain &#8220;regularly traded&#8221; on a domestic &#8220;established securities market&#8221; within the meaning of applicable Treasury regulations ; however, we can provide no assurance that our shares will continue to be &#8220;regularly traded&#8221; on a domestic &#8220;established securities market&#8221; in future taxable years. 

Except as discussed above, for any year in which we qualify for taxation as a REIT, distributions that are attributable to gain from the sale or exchange of a USRPI are taxed to a non-U.S. shareholder as if these distributions were gains effectively connected with a trade or business in the United States conducted by the non-U.S. shareholder. Accordingly, a non-U.S. shareholder that does not qualify for the special rule above (a) will be taxed on these amounts at the normal capital gain and other tax rates applicable to a U.S. shareholder, subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax and to a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals, (b) will be required to file a United States federal income tax return reporting these amounts, even if applicable withholding is imposed as described below, and (c) if such non-U.S. shareholder is also a corporation, it may owe the 30% branch profits tax under Section 884 of the IRC , or lower applicable tax treaty rate, in respect of these amounts. The applicable withholding agent will be required to withhold from distributions to such non-U.S. shareholders, and remit to the IRS, 35% of the maximum amount of any distribution that could be designated as a capital gain dividend. In addition, for purposes of this withholding rule, if we designate prior distributions as capital gain dividends, then subsequent distributions up to the amount of the designated prior distributions will be treated as capital gain dividends. The amount of any tax withheld is creditable against the non-U.S. shareholder&#8217;s United States federal income tax liability, and the non-U.S. shareholder may file for a refund from the IRS of any amount of withheld tax in excess of that tax liability. 

&#160;

A special &#8220;wash sale&#8221; rule may apply to a non-U.S. shareholder who owns any class of our shares if ( a ) the non-U.S. shareholder owns more than 5% of that class of shares at any time during the one-year period ending on the date of the distribution described below, or ( b ) that class of o ur shares is not, within the meaning of applicable Treasury regulations, &#8220;regularly traded&#8221; on a domestic &#8220;established securities market&#8221; such as the NYSE. Although there can be no assurance in this regard, we believe that our common shares have been and will remain &#8220;regularly traded&#8221; on a domestic &#8220;established securities market&#8221; within the meaning of applicable Treasury regulations, all as discussed above; however, we can provide no assurance that our shares will continue to be &#8220;regularly traded&#8221; on a domestic &#8220;established securities market&#8221; in future taxable years . We anticipate this wash sale rule will apply, if at all, only &#160; (a) to a non-U.S. shareholder that owns more than 10% ( 5% for dispositions before December 18, 2015) of either our common shares or any class of our preferred shares or (b) if the particular class of our shares were to be no longer &#8220;regularly traded .&#8221; Such a non-U.S. shareholder will be treated as having made a &#8220;wash sale&#8221; of our shares if it ( a ) disposes of an interest in our shares during the 30 &#160; days preceding the ex-dividend date of a distribution by us that, but for such disposition, would have been treated by the non-U.S. shareholder in whole or in part as gain from the sale or exchange of a USRPI , and then ( b ) acquires or enters into a contract to acquire a substantially identical interest in our shares, either actually or constructively through a related party, during the 61 &#160; day period beginning 30 &#160; days prior to the ex-dividend date. In the event of such a wash sale, the non-U.S. shareholder will have gain from the sale or exchange of a USRPI in an amount equal to the portion of the distribution that, but for the wash sale, would have been a gain from the sale or exchange of a USRPI . As discussed above, a non-U.S. shareholder&#8217;s gain from the sale or exchange of a USRPI can trigger increased United States taxes, such as the branch profits tax applicable to non-U.S. corporations, and increased United States tax filing requirements. 

If for any taxable year we designate capital gain dividends for our shareholders, then a portion of the capital gain dividends we designate will be allocated to the holders of a particular class of shares on a percentage basis equal to the ratio of the amount of the total dividends paid or made available for the year to the holders of that class of shares to the total dividends paid or made available for the year to holders of all outstanding classes of our shares. 

Tax treaties may reduce the withholding obligations on our distributions. Under some treaties, however, rates below 30% that are applicable to ordinary income dividends from United States corporations may not apply to ordinary income dividends from a REIT or may apply only if the REIT meets specified additional conditions. A non-U.S. shareholder must generally use an applicable IRS Form W-8, or substantially similar form, to claim tax treaty benefits. If the amount of tax withheld with respect to a distribution to a non-U.S. shareholder exceeds the shareholder&#8217;s United States federal income tax liability with respect to the distribution, the non-U.S. shareholder may file for a refund of the excess from the IRS. The 35% withholding tax rate discussed above on some capital gain dividends corresponds to the maximum income tax rate applicable to corporate non-U.S. shareholders but is higher than the current preferential maximum rates on capital gains generally applicable to noncorporate non-U.S. shareholders. Treasury regulations also provide special rules to determine whether, for purposes of determining the applicability of a tax treaty, our distributions to a non-U.S. shareholder that is an entity should be treated as paid to the entity or to those owning an interest in that entity , &#160; and whether the entity or its owners are entitled to benefits under the tax treaty. In the case of any deemed or constructive distribution or &#160; a distribution in kind , the applicable withholding agent may collect the amount required to be withheld by reducing to cash for remittance to the IRS a sufficient portion of the property that the non-U.S. shareholder would otherwise receive or own if the cash portion of any such distribution is not sufficient to cover the withholding liability , and the non-U.S. shareholder may bear brokerage or other costs for this withholding procedure. 

Non-U.S. shareholders should generally be able to treat amounts we designate as retained but constructively distributed capital gains in the same manner as actual distributions of capital gain dividends by us. In addition, a non-U.S. shareholder should be able to offset as a credit against its federal income tax liability the proportionate share of the tax paid by us on such retained but constructively distributed capital gains. A non-U.S. shareholder may file for a refund from the IRS for the amount that the non-U.S. shareholder&#8217;s proportionate share of tax paid by us exceeds its federal income tax liability on the constructively distributed capital gains. 

If our shares are not USRPIs, then a non-U.S. shareholder&#8217;s gain on the sale of these shares generally will not be subject to United States federal income taxation, except that a nonresident alien individual who was in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year may be subject to a 30% tax on this gain. Our shares will not constitute a USRPI if we are a &#8220;domestically controlled REIT.&#8221; A domestically controlled REIT is a REIT in which at all times during the preceding five-year period less than 50% of the fair market value of the outstanding shares was directly or indirectly held by foreign persons. From and after December 18, 2015, a person who at all relevant times holds less than 5% of a REIT&#8217;s shares that are regularly traded on an established securities 

&#160;

market in the United States is deemed to be a U.S. person in making the determination of whether a REIT is domestically controlled, unless the REIT has actual knowledge that the person is not a U.S. person. Other presumptions apply in making the determination with respect to other classes of REIT shareholders. As a result of applicable presumptions, we expect to be able to demonstrate from and after December 18, 2015 that we are less than 50% foreign owned . For periods prior to December 18, 2015, we believe that we were less than 50% foreign owned , but that may not be possible to demonstrate. Accordingly, we can provide no assurance that we have been or will remain a domestically controlled REIT, particularly if that determination includes the period before December 18, 2015, when the presumptions described above did not apply . Even if we are not a domestically controlled REIT, a non-U.S. shareholder&#8217;s gain on the sale of our shares will not be subject to United States federal income taxation as a sale of a USRPI , &#160; if that class of shares is &#8220;regularly traded,&#8221; as defined by applicable Treasury regulations, on an established securities market such as the NYSE, and the non-U.S. shareholder has at all times during the preceding five years owned 10% ( 5% for dispositions before December 18, 2015) or less by value of that class of shares. In this regard, because the shares held by others may be redeemed, &#160; a non-U.S. shareholder&#8217;s percentage interest in a class of our shares may increase even if it acquires no additional shares in that class. If a gain on the sale of our shares is subject to United States federal income taxation under these rules , the non-U.S. shareholder will generally be subject to the same treatment as a U.S. shareholder with respect to its gain (subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals) and will be required to file a United States federal income tax return reporting that gain. A purchaser of our shares from a non-U.S. shareholder will not be required to withhold on the purchase price if the purchased shares are regularly traded on an established securities market or if we are a domestically controlled REIT. Otherwise, a purchaser of our shares from a non-U.S. shareholder may be required to withhold 15% ( 10% for dispositions on or before February 16, 2016) of the purchase price paid to the non-U.S. shareholder and to remit the withheld amount to the IRS. 

Information Reporting , Backup Withholding, and Foreign Account Withholding 

Information reporting , backup withholding, and foreign account withholding may apply to distributions or proceeds paid to our shareholders under the circumstances discussed below. If a shareholder is subject to backup or other United States federal income tax withholding, then the applicable withholding agent will be required to withhold the appropriate amount with respect to a deemed or constructive distribution or a distribution in kind &#160; even though there is insufficient cash from which to satisfy the withholding obligation. To satisfy this withholding obligation, the applicable withholding agent may collect the amount of United States federal income tax required to be withheld by reducing to cash for remittance to the IRS a sufficient portion of the property that the shareholder would otherwise receive or own, and the shareholder may bear brokerage or other costs for this withholding procedure. 

The backup withholding rate is currently 28%. Amounts withheld under backup withholding are generally not an additional tax and may be refunded by the IRS or credited against the shareholder&#8217;s federal income tax liability. A U.S. shareholder may be subject to backup withholding when it receives distributions on our shares or proceeds upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other disposition of our shares, unless the U.S. shareholder properly executes, or has previously properly executed, under penalties of perjury an IRS Form W-9 or substantially similar form that: 

&#183; 

provides the U.S. shareholder&#8217;s correct taxpayer identification number; and 

&#183; 

certifies that the U.S. shareholder is exempt from backup withholding because it comes within an enumerated exempt category, it has not been notified by the IRS that it is subject to backup withholding, or it has been notified by the IRS that it is no longer subject to backup withholding. 

If the U.S. shareholder has not provided and does not provide its correct taxpayer identification number on an IRS Form W-9 or substantially similar form, it may be subject to penalties imposed by the IRS, and the applicable withholding agent may have to withhold a portion of any distributions or proceeds paid to such U.S. shareholder. Unless the U.S. shareholder has established on a properly executed IRS Form W-9 or substantially similar form that it comes within an enumerated exempt category, distributions or proceeds on our shares paid to it during the calendar year, and the amount of tax withheld, if any, will be reported to it and to the IRS. 

Distributions on our shares to a non-U.S. shareholder during each calendar year and the amount of tax withheld, if any, will generally be reported to the non-U.S. shareholder and to the IRS. This information reporting requirement applies regardless of whether the non-U.S. shareholder is subject to withholding on distributions on our shares or whether the withholding was reduced or eliminated by an applicable tax treaty. Also, distributions paid to a non-U.S. shareholder on our shares will generally &#160; be subject to backup withholding, unless the non-U.S. shareholder properly certifies to the applicable withholding agent its non-U.S. shareholder status on an &#160; applicable IRS Form W-8 or substantially similar form . Information reporting and backup withholding will not apply to proceeds 

&#160;

a non-U.S. shareholder receives upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other disposition of our shares, if the non-U.S. shareholder properly certifies its non-U.S. shareholder status on an applicable IRS Form W-8 or substantially similar form . Even without having executed an applicable &#160; IRS Form W-8 or substantially similar form , however, in some cases information reporting and backup withholding will not apply to proceeds that a non-U.S. shareholder receives upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other disposition of our shares if the non-U.S. shareholder receives those proceeds through a broker&#8217;s foreign office. 

Non-United States financial institutions and other non-United States entities are subject to diligence and reporting requirements for purposes of identifying accounts and investments held directly or indirectly by United States persons. The failure to comply with these additional information reporting, certification and other requirements could result in a 30% withholding tax on applicable payments to non-United States persons. In particular, a payee that is a foreign financial institution that is subject to the diligence and reporting requirements described above must enter into an agreement with the United States Department of the Treasury requiring, among other things, that it undertake to identify accounts held by &#8220;specified United States persons&#8221; or &#8220;United States owned foreign entities&#8221; (each as defined in the IRC), annually report information about such accounts, and withhold 30% on applicable payments to noncompliant foreign financial institutions and account holders. Foreign financial institutions located in jurisdictions that have an intergovernmental agreement with the United States with respect to these requirements may be subject to different rules. The foregoing withholding regime &#160; generally applies &#160; to payments of dividends on our shares, and &#160; is expected to generally apply &#160; to other &#8220; withholdable payments &#8221; (including payments of gross proceeds from a sale or other disposition of our shares) made after December 31, 2018 . In general, to avoid withholding, any non-United States intermediary through which a shareholder owns our shares must establish its compliance with the foregoing regime, and a non-U.S. shareholder must provide certain documentation (usually an applicable IRS Form W-8) containing information about its identity, its status, and if required, its direct and indirect U.S. owners. &#160; Non-U.S. shareholders and shareholders who hold our shares through a non-United States intermediary are encouraged to consult with their own tax advisor regarding foreign account tax compliance. 

Other Tax Considerations 

Our tax treatment and that of our shareholders may be modified by legislative, judicial or administrative actions at any time, which actions may be retroactive in effect. The rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by the United States Congress, the IRS and the United States Department of the Treasury , and statutory changes, new regulations, revisions to existing regulations and revised interpretations of established concepts are issued frequently. Likewise, the rules regarding taxes other than United States federal income taxes may also be modified. No prediction can be made as to the likelihood of passage of new tax legislation or other provisions, or the direct or indirect effect on us and our shareholders. Revisions to tax laws and interpretations of these laws could adversely affect our ability to qualify and be taxed as a REIT, as well as the tax or other consequences of an investment in our shares. We and our shareholders may also be subject to taxation by state, local or other jurisdictions, including those in which we or our shareholders transact business or reside. These tax consequences may not be comparable to the United States federal income tax consequences discussed above. 

&#160;

ERISA PLANS, KEOGH PLANS AND INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS 

General Fiduciary Obligations 

Fiduciaries of a pension, profit-sharing or other employee benefit plan subject to Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or ERISA, must consider whether: 

&#183; 

their investment in our shares or other securities satisfies the diversification requirements of ERISA; 

&#183; 

the investment is prudent in light of possible limitations on the marketability of our shares; 

&#183; 

they have authority to acquire our shares or other securities under the applicable governing instrument and Title I of ERISA; and 

&#183; 

the investment is otherwise consistent with their fiduciary responsibilities. 

Trustees and other fiduciaries of an ERISA plan may incur personal liability for any loss suffered by the plan on account of a violation of their fiduciary responsibilities. In addition, these fiduciaries may be subject to a civil penalty of up to 20% of any amount recovered by the plan on account of a violation. Fiduciaries of any individual retirement account or annuity, or IRA, Roth IRA, tax-favored account (such as an Archer MSA, Coverdell education savings account or health savings account), Keogh Plan or other qualified retirement plan not subject to Title I of ERISA, or non-ERISA plans, should consider that the plan may only make investments that are authorized by the appropriate governing instrument. 

Fiduciaries considering an investment in our securities should consult their own legal advisors if they have any concern as to whether the investment is consistent with the foregoing criteria or is otherwise appropriate. The sale of our securities to an ERISA or non-ERISA plan is in no respect a representation by us or any underwriter of the securities that the investment meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to investments by plans generally or any particular plan, or that the investment is appropriate for plans generally or any particular plan. 

Prohibited Transactions 

Fiduciaries of ERISA plans and persons making the investment decision for an IRA or other non-ERISA plan should consider the application of the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and the IRC in making their investment decision. Sales and other transactions between an ERISA or non-ERISA plan, and persons related to it, are prohibited transactions. The particular facts concerning the sponsorship, operations and other investments of an ERISA plan or non-ERISA plan may cause a wide range of other persons to be treated as disqualified persons or parties in interest with respect to it. A prohibited transaction, in addition to imposing potential personal liability upon fiduciaries of ERISA plans, may also result in the imposition of an excise tax under the IRC or a penalty under ERISA upon the disqualified person or party in interest with respect to the plan. If the disqualified person who engages in the transaction is the individual on behalf of whom an IRA or Roth IRA is maintained or his beneficiary, the IRA or Roth IRA may lose its tax-exempt status and its assets may be deemed to have been distributed to the individual in a taxable distribution on account of the prohibited transaction, but no excise tax will be imposed. Fiduciaries considering an investment in our securities should consult their own legal advisors as to whether the ownership of our securities involves a prohibited transaction. 

&#8220;Plan Assets&#8221; Considerations 

The United States Department of Labor has issued a regulation defining &#8220;plan assets.&#8221; The regulation generally provides that when an ERISA or non-ERISA plan acquires a security that is an equity interest in an entity and that security is neither a &#8220;publicly offered security&#8221; nor a security issued by an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, the ERISA plan&#8217;s or non-ERISA plan&#8217;s assets include both the equity interest and an undivided interest in each of the underlying assets of the entity, unless it is established either that the entity is an operating company or that equity participation in the entity by benefit plan investors is not significant. 

Each class of our shares (that is, our common shares and any class of preferred shares that we may issue) must be analyzed separately to ascertain whether it is a publicly offered security. The regulation defines a publicly offered security as a security that is &#8220;widely held,&#8221; &#8220;freely transferable&#8221; and either part of a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act , or sold under an effective 

&#160;

registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended , provided the securities are registered under the Exchange Act within 120 days after the end of the fiscal year of the issuer during which the offering occurred. Each class of our outstanding shares has been registered under the Exchange Act within the necessary time frame to satisfy the foregoing condition. 

The regulation provides that a security is &#8220;widely held&#8221; only if it is part of a class of securities that is owned by 100 or more investors independent of the issuer and of one another. However, a security will not fail to be &#8220;widely held&#8221; because the number of independent investors falls below 100 subsequent to the initial public offering as a result of events beyond the issuer&#8217;s control. We believe our common shares have been and will remain widely held, and we expect the same to be true of any class of preferred shares that we may issue, but we can give no assurances in this regard. 

The regulation provides that whether a security is &#8220;freely transferable&#8221; is a factual question to be determined on the basis of all relevant facts and circumstances. The regulation further provides that, where a security is part of an offering in which the minimum investment is $10,000 or less, some restrictions on transfer ordinarily will not, alone or in combination, affect a finding that these securities are freely transferable. The restrictions on transfer enumerated in the regulation as not affecting that finding include: 

&#183; 

any restriction on or prohibition against any transfer or assignment that would result in a termination or reclassification for federal or state tax purposes, or would otherwise violate any state or federal law or court order; 

&#183; 

any requirement that advance notice of a transfer or assignment be given to the issuer and any requirement that either the transferor or transferee, or both, execute documentation setting forth representations as to compliance with any restrictions on transfer that are among those enumerated in the regulation as not affecting free transferability, including those described in the preceding clause of this sentence; 

&#183; 

any administrative procedure that establishes an effective date, or an event prior to which a transfer or assignment will not be effective; and 

&#183; 

any limitation or restriction on transfer or assignment that is not imposed by the issuer or a person acting on behalf of the issuer. 

We believe that the restrictions imposed under our declaration of trust on the transfer of shares do not result in the failure of our shares to be &#8220;freely transferable.&#8221; Furthermore, we believe that there exist no other facts or circumstances limiting the transferability of our shares that are not included among those enumerated as not affecting their free transferability under the regulation, and we do not expect or intend to impose in the future, or to permit any person to impose on our behalf, any limitations or restrictions on transfer that would not be among the enumerated permissible limitations or restrictions. 

Assuming that each class of our shares will be &#8220;widely held&#8221; and that no other facts and circumstances exist that restrict transferability of these shares, our counsel, Sullivan &#38; Worcester LLP, is of the opinion that our shares will not fail to be &#8220;freely transferable&#8221; for purposes of the regulation due to the restrictions on transfer of our shares under our declaration of trust and that under the regulation each class of our currently outstanding shares is publicly offered and our assets will not be deemed to be &#8220;plan assets&#8221; of any ERISA plan or non-ERISA plan that acquires our shares in a public offering. This opinion is conditioned upon certain assumptions and representations, as discussed above in &#8220;United States Federal Income Tax Considerations&#8212;Taxation as a REIT.&#8221;
