 ITEM 1. OUR BUSINESS 

Alaska Air Group ("Air Group") operates Alaska Airlines ("Alaska") and Horizon Air ("Horizon"), which together with its partner regional airlines serve more than 100 cities through an expansive network in Alaska, the Lower 48, Hawaii, Canada, Mexico, and Costa Rica. During 2015 , we carried an all-time high 32 million &#32;passengers and earned record full-year adjusted earnings of $842 million . 

Our objective is to be one of the most respected U.S. airlines by our customers, employees, and shareholders. We believe our success depends on our ability to provide safe air transportation, develop relationships with customers by providing exceptional customer service and low fares, and maintain a competitive cost structure to compete effectively. It is important to us that we achieve our objective as a socially responsible company that values not just our performance, but also our people, our community, and our environment. 

While aircraft and technology enable us to provide air transportation, we recognize this is fundamentally a people business. Our employees maintain and strengthen our relationships with customers, and our success depends on our employees working together to successfully execute on our strategy. In 2015, Alaska was named one of America's Top 100 Employers by Forbes Magazine. We launched our "Beyond Service" two-day customer service workshop for all of our customer-facing employees to provide them with the framework and tools they need to improve upon our already award-winning customer service. In that vein, in 2015 , Alaska Airlines ranked "Highest in Customer Satisfaction among Traditional Network Carriers" by J.D. Power for the eighth year in a row. Alaska Airlines also held the No. 1 spot in the Wall Street Journal's "Middle Seat" scorecard for U.S. airlines for three years in a row. We have been the leader in the industry for on-time performance among major airlines for the past six years. For achieving safety, customer service, operational and financial goals, we rewarded our employees with a record $120 million &#32;in incentive pay during 2015 . 

In support of the communities that we serve, we strive to be an industry leader in environmental and community stewardship. In 2015 , Air Group improved fuel efficiency by 2.2% &#32;from the prior year, as measured by available seat miles flown per gallon. Air Group donated $12 million to approximately 1,050 charitable organizations and our employees volunteered more than 27,000 hours of community service. Included in this amount are annual contributions of our ongoing multi-year grants to several organizations - we pledged $1.5 million to support job training for workers at Seattle-Tacoma airport through Port Jobs, $2.5 million for Seattle's bike-share program, $1 million for the Alaska Native Science and Engineering Program, and $2.5 million to Seattle's Museum of Flight to guide students toward a future in science, technology, engineering, and math. In 2015, we granted additional support to Washington Information Science Education Consortium, Washington State University, Kupu of Hawaii, University of Hawaii, and pledged $40 million to the the University of Washington, in part, to increase our impact on education supporting specific programs and scholarships. 

We earned record financial results in 2015 , marking our 12th &#32;consecutive annual profit on an adjusted basis. We achieved an after-tax return on invested capital of 25.2% , approximately three times our weighted average cost of capital. Strong earnings improved our cash flow and strengthened our balance sheet resulting in a debt-to-capital ratio of 27% , which compares favorably with other high-quality industrial transport companies and the companies in the S&amp;P 500. Due to our strong financial health, we are one of only two U.S. airlines with investment grade credit ratings. With the cash generated by the continued success we have had in the past decade, we are able to continue to invest in our business for profitable growth and to enhance the customer experience. All of our 737-800/900/900ER aircraft feature innovative Recaro seats with power at every seat, our Wi-Fi enabled in-flight entertainment system, and our branded in-flight experience, Alaska Beyond&#8482;. 

As we look to the future, we will build on the success of the past few years by executing our strategic plan — the Five Focus Areas: 

Safety and Compliance 

We have an unwavering commitment to run a safe and compliant operation, and we will not compromise this commitment in the pursuit of other initiatives. Alaska and Horizon are awaiting final FAA certification of our fully-implemented Safety Management System (SMS). SMS helps identify and manage risk and builds a sustainable culture of safety for every Air Group employee. Once again, for 2015, 100% of our Alaska and Horizon aircraft technicians completed the requirements for the FAA's "Diamond Certificate of Excellence" award. This is the 14th consecutive year Alaska Airlines has received the award and the 14th time in the last 16 years for Horizon. In 2014, we launched Ready, Safe, Go - a safety campaign designed to increase safety awareness across the Air Group System. With our Ready, Safe, Go program in its second year, employee 

&#32;4 

awareness of their individual contributions to a strong culture of safety continues to increase. In 2015, Alaska and Horizon employees made a "Personal Commitment to Safety" during facilitated discussions with company leaders. 

People Focus 

Our success depends on our employees. Higher employee engagement drives higher productivity, superior execution, and better customer service, which is why we listen to our employees for feedback in shaping our strategy. Employee engagement scores from our annual employee survey are at historical highs. In addition to the "Beyond Service" training for our customer-facing employees, all of Air Group's leaders participated in a multi-day leadership training called "Gear Up 2." This is the second phase of our award-winning leadership training where our leaders spent time focusing on several of our core leadership principles in an effort to give them the tools they need to effectively lead a highly-engaged workforce. 

We understand that aligning our employees' goals with the Company's goals is important in achieving success. All employees participate in our Performance-Based Pay (PBP) and Operational Performance Rewards (OPR) programs, which encourage employees to work together to achieve metrics related to safety, profitability, on-time performance, low costs and customer satisfaction. Over the last five years, our incentive programs have paid out on average, over 8.6% of annual pay, or more than one month's pay, for most employees. This is consistent with one of our guiding principles that we want to pay our people well with a goal of reaching the industry’s best productivity over time. To that end, we are currently in long-term agreements with all of our major work groups, which provide the Company, employees, and investors with long-term stability. 

Hassle-Free Customer Experience 

We want to be the easiest airline to fly. In each step of the customer's journey, from booking a ticket to check-in, from flying in our aircraft to claiming baggage at the final destination, we want to provide a hassle-free experience for our customers. Our industry-leading on-time performance for the past six years reflects the reliable service we provide our customers, and we were the first airline to guarantee checked baggage delivery to the carousel within 20 minutes. Customers can tag their own bags at airport kiosks, or from their homes, and we have fingerprint scan entry to our airport lounges. We lead the travel industry in mobile innovation with a 5-star rated iPhone app, and Android and Microsoft apps that allow passengers to purchase tickets, check-in, upgrade seats, and reserve food for the flight - all with helpful notifications that inform customers when there are changes to their flights. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Pre-Check Program is available in 60 of our locations, which allows eligible customers to opt-in for reduced screening requirements. To hear directly from our customers, we have the Alaska Listens survey with five simple questions designed to get timely feedback - and we guarantee a response within 72 hours if there is an issue that needs to be resolved. As passengers take more control of their travel experience, we are able to reduce the time it takes a customer to move from the airport curb to the aircraft. 

Energetic and Compelling Brand 

We want to be recognized as the preferred airline to fly. In January 2016, we introduced a bold new brand expression, including an updated identity, livery, and look and feel for our digital and physical experiences. We believe there’s an opportunity to deepen the emotional connection with our customers as we continue to expand and grow. Our updated brand expression draws upon our rich heritage while infusing it with additional warmth and energy - to better reflect how customers feel about our brand and the great service that we pride ourselves in delivering. 

We continue to invest in a better customer experience. Onboard, customers will continue to enjoy more of what they love with free and premium entertainment direct to their devices, Pacific Northwest-inspired food and beverages and custom leather seats with power outlets for laptops and personal devices and larger overhead bins for carry-on bags. In the fall of 2016, we will introduce a new Premium Class section in the main cabin with increased pitch and other amenities. 

We also continue to invest in advertising across markets. We recently renewed our partnership with Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson, as our Chief Football Officer. We also announced a ten-year sponsorship with the University of Washington, which includes naming rights to the Alaska Airlines Field at Husky Stadium and the Alaska Airlines Arena at Hec Edmunson Pavillion, among other benefits. 

Low Fares, Low Costs and Network Growth 

We believe that in order to provide low fares for customers in a growing network of destinations, while returning value to our shareholders, it is imperative for us to maintain a competitive cost structure. In 2015 , we lowered our unit costs, excluding fuel, by 0.7% &#32;on a consolidated basis, representing the sixth consecutive year of annual reduction. We achieved this through a continued focus on productivity, cost management, and network growth. We increased employee productivity in 2015 &#32;and will continue to focus on that metric as we leverage growth. We also manage fuel costs by flying larger, more fuel-efficient aircraft, which have increased our fuel efficiency as measured by available seat miles flown per gallon by 5.6% &#32;over the last five years. Additionally, we have added split-scimitar winglets to 94 aircraft, which are expected to increase fuel efficiency by 

&#32;5 

approximately 1.5% per aircraft. Looking forward, we have committed to purchasing 31 &#32;737-900ER and 37 &#32;737-MAX aircraft with deliveries from 2016 &#32;to 2022 , and two &#32;Q400 aircraft with deliveries in 2018 , although these are subject to change. In addition, we will increase regional capacity by adding 18 &#32;E175s with contractual deliveries from 2016 &#32;to 2017 &#32;and we may order an additional 30 regional jets with delivery beginning in 2017 if we reach acceptable commercial terms. These aircraft deliveries position us for growth and help to ensure that we will continue to operate the most fuel-efficient aircraft available for the foreseeable future. 

In 2015 , we added 20 new markets to our route structure. We continued to strengthen our Seattle network to offer further utility to our customers by offering non-stop flights to markets like New York (JFK), Charleston, Raleigh-Durham, Nashville, Oklahoma City, and Milwaukee. We also added flying from Los Angeles (LAX) to Liberia and San Jose, Costa Rica and Baltimore. We have grown capacity over 7% annually on average for the past 20 years and we plan to continue to grow between 4% and 8% annually in the next several years. For 2016 , we plan to grow capacity approximately 8%. 

AIR GROUP 

Alaska Air Group is a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1985 and the holding company of Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air. Although Alaska and Horizon both operate as airlines, their business plans, competition, and economic risks differ substantially. Alaska Airlines is an Alaska corporation that was organized in 1932 and incorporated in 1937. Horizon Air Industries is a Washington corporation that first began service and was incorporated in 1981. Horizon was acquired by Air Group in 1986. Alaska operates a fleet of passenger jets (mainline) and contracts with Horizon, SkyWest Airlines, Inc. (SkyWest) and Peninsula Airways, Inc. (PenAir) for regional capacity such that Alaska receives all passenger revenue from those flights. Horizon operates a fleet of turboprop aircraft and sells all of its capacity to Alaska pursuant to a capacity purchase arrangement. The majority of our revenues are generated by transporting passengers. The percentage of revenues by category is as follows:

REGIONAL 

Our regional operations consist of flights operated by Horizon, SkyWest and PenAir. In 2015 , our regional operations carried approximately 9 million &#32;revenue passengers, primarily in the states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho and California. Horizon is the largest regional airline in the Pacific Northwest and carries about 85% of Air Group's regional revenue passengers. 

Based on 2015 &#32;passenger enplanements on regional aircraft, our leading airports are Seattle and Portland. At December 31, 2015 , Horizon’s operating fleet consisted of 52 &#32;Bombardier Q400 turboprop aircraft. Horizon flights are listed under Alaska's designator code in airline reservation systems, and in customer-facing locations. The regional fleet operated by SkyWest consisted of eight &#32;CRJ 700 aircraft and five &#32;E175 aircraft.

MILEAGE PLAN 

The Alaska Airlines Mileage Plan&#8482; program provides a comprehensive suite of frequent flier benefits. Miles can be earned by flying on Alaska or on one of our 16 &#32;airline partners, or by using the Alaska Airlines Visa Signature card, or through other non-airline partners. Our extensive list of airline partners includes carriers associated with two of the three major global alliances (Oneworld and SkyTeam), making it easier for our members to earn miles and reach preferred status in our Mileage Plan&#8482;, and have access to a large network of travel destinations. Further, members can receive 25,000 bonus miles (30,000 beginning in the Spring of 2016) upon signing up for the Alaska Airlines Visa Signature card and earn triple miles on purchases made on Alaska Airlines flights or on alaskaair.com. Alaska Airlines Visa Signature cardholders also receive an annual companion ticket that allows members to purchase an additional ticket for $99 plus taxes, with no restrictions or black-out dates, and a free first checked bag for all parties in the same itinerary. Earned miles can be redeemed for flights on Alaska Airlines or on any of our partner airlines, or for upgrades to First Class on Alaska Airlines for as low as 15,000 miles. All of these benefits give our Mileage Plan&#8482; members more value for their travel on Alaska Airlines, which led to our Mileage Plan&#8482; receiving the highest ranking by frequent fliers in the first-ever J.D. Power Airline Loyalty/Rewards Program Satisfaction Report in 2014 and again in 2015. 

Mileage Plan&#8482; revenues represent approximately 11% of Air Group's total revenues. Furthermore, our Mileage Plan&#8482; helps drive more revenue by attaining new customers and building customer loyalty through the benefits that we provide. The Mileage Plan&#8482; provides more value per dollar spent on the Alaska Airlines Visa Signature card, in comparison to other frequent flier programs in the industry. Summary of the benefits provided in comparison to some of our competitors are as follows:

AGREEMENTS WITH OTHER AIRLINES 

Our agreements fall into three different categories: Frequent Flier, Codeshare, and Interline agreements. Frequent Flier agreements offer mileage credits and redemptions for our Mileage Plan&#8482; members. Alaska offers one of the most comprehensive frequent flier programs for our Mileage Plan&#8482; members through our frequent flier partnerships with 16 &#32;domestic and international carriers. 

Codeshare agreements allow one or more marketing carriers to sell seats on a single operating carrier that services passengers under multiple flight numbers. The sale of codeshare seats can vary depending on the sale arrangement. For example, in a free-sale arrangement, the marketing carrier sells the operating carrier's inventory without any restriction; whereas in a block space arrangement, a fixed amount of seats are sold to the marketing carrier by the operating carrier. The interchangeability of the flight code between carriers provides a greater selection of flights for customers, along with increased flexibility for mileage accrual and redemption. 

Interline agreements allow airlines to jointly offer a competitive, single-fare itinerary to customers traveling via multiple carriers to a final destination. An interline itinerary offered by one airline may not necessarily be offered by the other, and the fares collected from passengers are prorated and distributed to interline partners according to preexisting agreements between the carriers. Frequent Flier, Codeshare, and Interline agreements help increase our traffic and revenue by providing more route choices to customers. 

We have marketing alliances with a number of airlines that provide frequent flier and codesharing opportunities. Alliances are an important part of our strategy and enhance our revenues by: 

-  offering our customers more travel destinations and better mileage credit/redemption opportunities, including elite qualifying miles on all of our major U.S. and international airline partners; 

-  giving our Mileage Plan&#8482; program a competitive advantage because of our partnership with carriers from two of the three major global alliances (Oneworld and SkyTeam); 

-  giving us access to more connecting traffic from other airlines; and 

-  providing members of our alliance partners’ frequent flier programs an opportunity to travel on Alaska and its regional affiliates while earning mileage credit in our partners’ programs. 

Most of our codeshare relationships are free-sale codeshares, where the marketing carrier sells seats on the operating carrier’s flights from the operating carrier’s inventory, but takes no inventory risk. Our marketing agreements have various termination dates, and at any time, one or more may be in the process of renegotiation.

OTHER REVENUE 

Other revenue consists of freight and mail revenue, and ancillary revenue such as bag fees, change fees, on-board food and beverage, and Boardroom membership. Total other revenue, excluding Mileage Plan&#8482; revenue, represents about 7% of our total revenues. In recent years, we have seen growth in our ancillary revenue as we expand services on-board such as Tom Douglas signature meals, in-flight entertainment, and Wi-Fi. Although we do charge bag fees, we offer a 20-minute bag guarantee so that we deliver value to our customers through fast, reliable service. In 2015, we added a free bag as a permanent feature of our affinity credit card. As we focus on ways to better serve our customers, we expect our ancillary revenues will continue to grow. 

GENERAL 

The airline industry is highly competitive, subject to various uncertainties, and has historically been characterized by low profit margins. Uncertainties include general economic conditions, volatile fuel prices, industry instability, new competition, a largely unionized work force, the need to finance large capital expenditures and the related availability of capital, government regulation, including taxes and fees, and potential aircraft incidents. Airlines have high fixed costs, primarily for wages, aircraft fuel, aircraft ownership, and facilities rents. Because expenses of a flight do not vary significantly based on the number of passengers carried, a relatively small change in the number of passengers or in pricing has a disproportionate effect on an airline’s operating and financial results. In other words, a minor shortfall in expected revenue levels could cause a disproportionately negative impact on our operating and financial results. Passenger demand and ticket prices are, to a large measure, influenced by the general state of the economy, current global economic and political events, and total available airline seat capacity. 

In 2015 , the airline industry reported record revenues and profits as the global economy continued to recover and oil prices declined significantly. As the industry strengthens, airlines are now making significant investments in airports, in new planes, and in new services to differentiate their customer service offering. Thus, the level of competition is expected to increase. 

FUEL 

Our business and financial results are highly affected by the price and, potentially, the availability of aircraft fuel. The cost of aircraft fuel is volatile and outside of our control, and it can have a significant and immediate impact on our operating results. Over the past five years, aircraft fuel expense ranged from 22% &#32;to 35% &#32;of operating expenses. Fuel prices are impacted by changes in both the price of crude oil and refining margins, and can vary by region in the U.S. 

The average annual price of crude oil in the last five years has ranged from a low of $49 &#32;per barrel in 2015 &#32;from a high of $98 &#32;in 2013 . For us, a $1 per barrel change in the price of oil equates to approximately $12 million &#32;of fuel cost annually. Said another way, a one-cent change in our fuel price per gallon will impact our expected annual fuel cost by approximately $5 million &#32;per year. 

&#32;8 

Refining margins, which represent the price of refining crude oil into aircraft fuel, are a smaller portion of the overall price of jet fuel, but also contributed to the price volatility in recent years. Average annual refining margin prices have fluctuated between $20 &#32;per barrel and $36 &#32;per barrel in the last five years, and averaged $20 &#32;in 2015 . 

Generally, West Coast jet fuel prices are somewhat higher and more volatile than prices in the Gulf Coast or on the East Coast. Our average raw fuel cost per gallon decreased &#32; 39% &#32;in 2015 , decreased 6% in 2014 , and 4% in 2013 . 

The percentages of our aircraft fuel expense by crude and refining margins, as well as the percentage of our aircraft fuel expense of operating expenses are as follows:

Other includes gains and losses on settled fuel hedges, unrealized mark-to-market fuel hedge gains or losses, taxes and other into-plane costs. 

We use crude oil call options as hedges to decrease our exposure to the volatility of jet fuel prices. Historically, we have had jet fuel refining margin swap contracts, but we discontinued the use of the refining margin swaps in the third quarter of 2014. Call options effectively cap our pricing for crude oil, limiting our exposure to increasing fuel prices for about half of our planned fuel consumption. With call options, we are hedged against spikes in crude oil prices, and during a period of decline in crude oil prices, we only forfeit cash previously paid for hedge premiums. Currently, we start hedging approximately 18 months in advance of crude oil consumption. 

We believe that operating fuel-efficient aircraft is the best hedge against high fuel prices. Alaska operates an all-Boeing 737 fleet and Horizon operates an all-Bombardier Q400 turboprop fleet. Air Group's fuel-efficiency rate expressed in available seat miles flown per gallon (ASMs/g) improved from 74.4 &#32;ASMs/g in 2011 &#32;to 78.6 &#32;ASMs/g in 2015 . These improvements have not only reduced our fuel consumption rate, but also the amount of greenhouse gases and other pollutants that our operations emit. 

COMPETITION 

Competition in the airline industry is intense and unpredictable. Our competitors consist primarily of other airlines and, to a lesser extent, other forms of transportation. Competition can be direct, in the form of another carrier flying the exact non-stop route, or indirect, where a carrier serves the same two cities non-stop from an alternative airport in that city or via an itinerary requiring a connection at another airport. We compete with other domestic airlines, and a limited number of international airlines, on nearly all of our scheduled routes. Our largest competitor is Delta Air Lines, who has significantly increased their capacity in Seattle over the past two years. Approximately 60% of our capacity to and from Seattle competes with Delta. Based on schedules filed with the U.S. Department of Transportation, we expect the amount of competitive capacity overlap with all carriers to increase more than 13% in the first half of 2016 , weighted based on our network. 

We believe that the following principal competitive factors are important to our customers: 

-  Safety record 

-  Customer service and reputation 

We compete with other airlines in areas of customer service such as on-time performance, passenger amenities - including first class seating, quality of on-board products, aircraft type, and comfort. In 2015 , Alaska Airlines ranked "Highest in Customer Satisfaction among Traditional Network Carriers" by J.D. Power and Associates for the eighth &#32;year in a row. All of our 2015 &#32;mainline aircraft deliveries included the Boeing Sky Interior, our Alaska Beyond&#8482; in-flight experience, which features our streaming in-flight entertainment, gourmet food designed by Tom Douglas, and comfortable seats with additional space and power as part of our exceptional, above and beyond flight experience. In 2015 , we introduced Preferred Plus seating and Boeing's new Space Bins TM . Preferred Plus gives customers the option to upgrade to bulkhead and exit row seats at check-in for a nominal fee and includes early boarding and a free cocktail. Space Bins TM &#32;provide space for up to 50% more carry-on bags on board our aircraft, providing a more hassle-free boarding experience for our passengers. In 2016, we will be launching a Premium Class of service on our airplanes that will provide extra legroom, early boarding, premium snacks and complimentary alcoholic beverages. 

-  Fares and ancillary services 

The pricing of fares is a significant competitive factor in the airline industry, and the increased availability of fare information on the Internet allows travelers to easily compare fares and identify competitor promotions and discounts. Pricing is driven by a variety of factors including, but not limited to, market-specific capacity, market share per route/geographic area, cost structure, fare vs. ancillary revenue strategies, and demand. 

For example, airlines often discount fares to drive traffic in new markets or to stimulate traffic when necessary to improve load factors. In addition, traditional network carriers have been able to reduce their operating costs through bankruptcies and mergers, while low-cost carriers have continued to grow their fleets and expand their networks, potentially enabling them to better control costs per available seat mile (the average cost to fly an aircraft seat one mile), which in turn may enable them to lower their fares. These factors can reduce our pricing power and that of the airline industry as a whole. 

Domestic airline capacity is dominated by four large carriers, representing approximately 85% of total seats. Accordingly, if these carriers discount their fares or enter into our core markets, we must match those fares in order to maintain our load factors, often resulting in year-over-year decreases in our yields. We will defend our core markets vigorously and, if necessary, redeploy capacity to better match supply with demand. We believe the restructuring we've completed over the past decade has decreased our costs, enabling us to offer competitive fares while still earning appropriate returns for our shareholders. 

-  Routes served, flight schedules, codesharing and interline relationships, and frequent flier programs 

We also compete with other airlines based on markets served, the frequency of service to those markets, and frequent flier opportunities. Some airlines have more extensive route structures than we do, and they offer significantly more international routes. In order to expand opportunities for our customers, we enter into codesharing and interline relationships with other airlines that provide reciprocal frequent flier mileage credit and redemption privileges. These relationships allow us to offer our customers access to more destinations than we can on our own, gain exposure in markets we don't serve and allow our customers more opportunities to earn and redeem frequent flier miles. Our Mileage Plan&#8482; offers one of the most comprehensive benefits to our members with the ability to earn and redeem miles on 16 &#32;of our partner carriers. 

In addition to domestic or foreign airlines that we compete with on most of our routes, we compete with ground transportation in our short-haul markets. Both carriers, to some extent, also compete with technology such as video conferencing and internet-based meeting tools that have changed the need for, or frequency of face-to-face business meetings. 

TICKET DISTRIBUTION 

Our tickets are distributed through three primary channels: 

-  Alaskaair.com: &#32;It is less expensive for us to sell through this direct channel and, as a result, we continue to take steps to drive more business to our website. In addition, we believe this channel is preferable from a branding and customer-relationship standpoint in that we can establish ongoing communication with the customer and tailor offers accordingly. 

-  Traditional and online travel agencies: &#32;Both traditional and online travel agencies typically use Global Distribution Systems (GDS) to obtain their fare and inventory data from airlines. Bookings made through these agencies result in a fee that is charged to the airline. Many of our large corporate customers require us to use these agencies. Some of our competitors do not use this distribution channel and, as a result, have lower ticket distribution costs. 

-  Reservation call centers: &#32;These call centers are located in Phoenix, AZ, Kent, WA, and Boise, ID. We generally charge a $15 fee for booking reservations through these call centers. 

Our sales by channel are as follows:

SEASONALITY AND OTHER FACTORS 

Our results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of those for the entire year because our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Our profitability is generally lowest during the first and fourth quarters due principally to fewer departures and passengers. Profitability typically increases in the second quarter and then reaches its highest level during the third quarter as a result of vacation travel, including increased activity in the state of Alaska. However, we have taken steps over the past few years to better manage the seasonality of our operations by adding flights to leisure destinations, like Hawaii, and expanding to cities in the mid-continental and eastern U.S. 

In addition to passenger loads, factors that could cause our quarterly operating results to vary include: 

-  general economic conditions and resulting changes in passenger demand, 

- changes in fuel costs, 

-  pricing initiatives by us or our competitors, 

-  increases in competition at our primary airports, and 

-  increases or decreases in passenger and volume-driven variable costs. 

Many of the markets we serve experience inclement weather conditions in the winter, causing increased costs associated with deicing aircraft, canceling flights, and accommodating displaced passengers. Due to our geographic area of operations, we can be more susceptible to adverse weather conditions, particularly in the state of Alaska and the Pacific Northwest, than some of our competitors, who may be better able to spread weather-related risks over larger route systems. 

No material part of our business or that of our subsidiaries is dependent upon a single customer, or upon a few high-volume customers. 

EMPLOYEES 

Our business is labor intensive. As of December 31, 2015 , we employed 15,143 &#32;( 11,614 &#32;at Alaska and 3,529 &#32;at Horizon) active full-time and part-time employees. Wages and benefits, including variable incentive pay, represented approximately 41% &#32;of our total non-fuel operating expenses in both 2015 &#32;and 2014 . 

Most major airlines, including ours, have employee groups that are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Airlines with unionized work forces generally have higher labor costs than carriers without unionized work forces, and they may not have the ability to adjust labor costs downward quickly enough to respond to new competition or slowing demand. At December 31, 2015 , labor unions represented 83% &#32;of Alaska’s and 44% &#32;of Horizon’s employees. Our relations with U.S. labor organizations are governed by the Railway Labor Act (RLA). Under this act, collective bargaining agreements do not expire but instead become amendable as of a stated date. If either party wishes to modify the terms of any such agreement, it must notify the other party in the manner prescribed by the RLA and/or described in the agreement. After receipt of such notice, the parties must meet for direct negotiations, and if no agreement is reached, either party may request the National Mediation Board (NMB) to initiate a process including mediation, arbitration, and a potential "cooling off" period that must be followed before either party may engage in self-help.

REGULATION 

GENERAL 

The airline industry is highly regulated, most notably by the federal government. The Department of Transportation (DOT), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) exercise significant regulatory authority over air carriers. 

-  DOT: In order to provide passenger and cargo air transportation in the U.S., a domestic airline is required to hold a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by the DOT. Subject to certain individual airport capacity, noise and other restrictions, this certificate permits an air carrier to operate between any two points in the U.S. Certificates do not expire, but may be revoked for failure to comply with federal aviation statutes, regulations, orders or the terms of the certificates. While airlines are permitted to establish their own fares without governmental regulation, the DOT has jurisdiction over the approval of international codeshare agreements, marketing alliance agreements between major domestic carriers, international and some domestic route authorities, Essential Air Service market subsidies, carrier liability for personal or property damage, and certain airport rates and charges disputes. International treaties may also contain restrictions or requirements for flying outside of the U.S. and impose different carrier liability limits than those applicable to domestic flights. The DOT has been active in implementing a variety of "consumer protection" regulations, covering subjects such as advertising, passenger communications, denied boarding compensation and tarmac delay response. &#32;&#32; Airlines are subject to enforcement actions that are brought by the DOT from time to time for alleged violations of consumer protection and other economic regulations. We are not aware of any enforcement proceedings that could either materially affect our financial position or impact our authority to operate. 

-  FAA: &#32;The FAA, through Federal Aviation Regulations (FARs), generally regulates all aspects of airline operations, including establishing personnel, maintenance and flight operation standards. Domestic airlines are required to hold a valid air carrier operating certificate issued by the FAA. Pursuant to these regulations we have established, and the FAA has approved, our operations specifications and a maintenance program for each type of aircraft we operate. The maintenance program provides for the ongoing maintenance of such aircraft, ranging from frequent routine inspections to major overhauls. From time to time the FAA issues airworthiness directives (ADs) that must be incorporated into our aircraft maintenance program and operations. All airlines are subject to enforcement actions that are brought by the FAA from time to time for alleged violations of FARs or ADs. At this time, we are not aware of any enforcement proceedings that could either materially affect our financial position or impact our authority to operate. 

-  TSA: &#32; &#32; Airlines serving the U.S. must operate a TSA-approved Aircraft Operator Standard Security Program (AOSSP), and comply with TSA Security Directives (SDs) and regulations. Airlines are subject to enforcement actions that are brought by the TSA from time to time for alleged violations of the AOSSP, SDs or security regulations. We are not aware of any enforcement proceedings that could either materially affect our financial position or impact our authority to operate. Under TSA authority, we are required to collect a September 11 Security Fee of $5.60 per one-way trip from passengers and remit that sum to the government to fund aviation security me asures. 

The Department of Justice and DOT have jurisdiction over airline antitrust matters. The U.S. Postal Service has jurisdiction over certain aspects of the transportation of mail and related services. Labor relations in the air transportation industry are regulated under the Railway Labor Act. To the extent we continue to fly to foreign countries and pursue alliances with international carriers, we may be subject to certain regulations of foreign agencies and international treaties. 

ENVIRONMENTAL AND OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY MATTERS 

We are subject to various laws and government regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the U.S. and other countries. U.S. federal laws that have a particular effect on us include the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990, the Clean Air Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act, and the Oil Pollution Control Act. We are also subject to the oversight of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) concerning employee safety and health matters. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, OSHA, and other federal agencies have been authorized to create and enforce regulations that have an impact on our operations. In addition to these federal activities, various states have been delegated certain authorities under these federal statutes. Many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations. We maintain our safety, health and environmental programs in order to meet or exceed these requirements. 

We expect there will be legislation in the future to reduce carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions. Alaska and Horizon have transitioned to more fuel-efficient aircraft fleets. 

The Airport Noise and Capacity Act recognizes the rights of airport operators with noise problems to implement local noise abatement programs so long as they do not interfere unreasonably with interstate or foreign commerce or the national air transportation system. Authorities in several cities have established aircraft noise reduction programs, including the imposition of nighttime curfews. We believe we have sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions. 

Although we do not currently anticipate that these regulatory matters, individually or collectively, will have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, new regulations or compliance issues that we do not currently anticipate could have the potential to harm our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in future periods. 

INSURANCE 

We carry insurance of types customary in the airline industry and in amounts deemed adequate to protect our interests and property and to comply both with federal regulations and certain credit and lease agreements. The insurance policies principally provide coverage for Airline Hull, Spares and Comprehensive Legal Liability Insurance, War and Allied Perils, and Workers’ Compensation. In addition, we currently carry a Cyber Liability policy in the event of security breaches from malicious parties. 

We believe that our emphasis on safety and our state-of-the-art flight deck safety technology help to control the cost of our insurance.
