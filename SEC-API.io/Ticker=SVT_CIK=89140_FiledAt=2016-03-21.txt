Products 

&#160; 

Advanced Technology Products 

&#160;

The Company designs, manufactures and markets a variety of servo-control components which convert an electrical current into a mechanical force or movement and other related products. The principal servo-control components produced include torque motors, electromagnetic actuators, hydraulic valves, pneumatic valves and similar devices, all of which perform the same general function. These are sold principally to the commercial aerospace, aircraft and government related industries, as well as medical and industrial markets.

&#160;

To fill most of its orders for components, the Company must either modify a standard model or design a new product in order to satisfy the customer&#8217;s particular requirements. The Company also produces unique products based on specifications provided by its customers. The Company produces under long-term contracts and other types of orders.

&#160;

The Company may from time to time produce metallic seals of various cross-sectional configurations. These seals fit between two surfaces, usually metal, to produce a more secure and leak-proof joint. The Company manufactures these seals to close tolerances from standard and special alloy steels. Ductile coatings are often applied to the seals in order to increase their effectiveness.

&#160;

The Company has also produced other products of its own and/or of a given design to meet customers&#8217; requirements.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The cost of compliance with current environmental laws has not been material and the Company does not anticipate that it will be in the future.

&#160; 

Manufacturing 

&#160;

&#160; 

Raw Materials and Other Supplies 

&#160;

The Company purchases raw materials and certain components for its products from outside vendors. The Company is generally not dependent upon a single source of supply for any raw material or component used in its operations.

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160;

Although no reliable industry statistics are available to enable the Company to determine accurately its relative competitive position with respect to any of its products, the Company believes that it is a significant factor with respect to certain of its servo-control components. The Company&#8217;s share of the overall cutlery market is not significant.

&#160;

The Company has many different competitors with respect to servo-control components because of the nature of that business and the fact that these products also face competition from other types of control components which, at times, can accomplish the desired result.

&#160;

The Company encounters active competition with respect to its consumer products from numerous companies, many of which are larger in terms of manufacturing capacity, financial resources and marketing organization. Its principal competitors vary depending upon the customer and/or the products involved. The Company believes that it competes primarily with more than 20 companies with respect to its consumer products, in addition to foreign imports. To the Company&#8217;s knowledge, its principal competitors with regard to cutlery include World Kitchen, Inc., Benchmade Knife Company, Inc., Tramontina, Inc., Dexter-Russell Inc., W. R. Case &#38; Sons Cutlery Company, Lifetime Hoan Corp., Cutco Corporation and Gerber. The Company also competes with other regional manufacturing companies for its molded plastic and metal and plastic fabrication services. To the Company&#8217;s knowledge, its principal competitors with regard to manufacturing services include PM Plastics, Monarch Plastics and Ontario Plastics.

&#160;

The Company markets most of its products throughout the United States and to a lesser extent in select foreign markets. The Company believes that it competes in marketing its servo-control products primarily on the basis of operating performance, adherence to rigid specifications, quality, price and delivery and its consumer products primarily on the basis of price, quality and delivery.
