 Item 1. Business 

Overview 

Our Company 

Two Harbors Investment Corp. is a Maryland corporation focused on investing in, financing and managing residential mortgage-backed securities, or RMBS, residential mortgage loans, mortgage servicing rights, or MSR, commercial real estate and other financial assets, which we collectively refer to as our target assets. We operate as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, as defined under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. The terms &#8220;Two Harbors,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; and the &#8220;company&#8221; refer to Two Harbors Investment Corp. and its subsidiaries as a consolidated entity. 

We were incorporated on May 21, 2009 and commenced operations as a publicly traded company on October 28, 2009, upon completion of a merger with Capitol Acquisition Corp., or Capitol, which became our wholly owned indirect subsidiary as a result of the merger. Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, under the symbol &#8220;TWO&#8221;. 

Our objective is to provide attractive risk-adjusted total return to our stockholders over the long term, primarily through dividends and secondarily through capital appreciation. We selectively acquire and manage an investment portfolio of our target assets, which is constructed to generate attractive returns through market cycles. We focus on asset selection and implement a relative value investment approach across various sectors within the mortgage market. Our target assets include the following: 

&#8226; 

Agency RMBS, meaning RMBS whose principal and interest payments are guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association (or Ginnie Mae), the Federal National Mortgage Association (or Fannie Mae), or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (or Freddie Mac); 

&#8226; 

Non-Agency RMBS, meaning RMBS that are not issued or guaranteed by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac; 

&#8226; 

Residential mortgage loans; 

&#8226; 

MSR; 

&#8226; 

Commercial real estate assets; and 

&#8226; 

Other financial assets comprising approximately 5% to 10% of the portfolio. 

We seek to deploy moderate leverage as part of our investment strategy. We generally finance our RMBS, residential mortgage loans and commercial real estate assets through short- and long-term borrowings structured as repurchase agreements and advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines, or the FHLB. We do not currently finance our MSR assets, but may in the future if we determine financing is available on terms we believe are favorable to us. 

We have elected to be treated as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. To qualify as a REIT, we are required to meet certain investment and operating tests and annual distribution requirements. We generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes on our taxable income to the extent that we annually distribute all of our net taxable income to stockholders, do not participate in prohibited transactions and maintain our intended qualification as a REIT. However, certain activities that we may perform may cause us to earn income which will not be qualifying income for REIT purposes. We have designated certain of our subsidiaries as taxable REIT subsidiaries, or TRSs, as defined in the Code, to engage in such activities, and we may form additional TRSs in the future. We also operate our business in a manner that will permit us to maintain our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the 1940 Act. 

Our Manager 

We are externally managed and advised by PRCM Advisers LLC, or PRCM Advisers, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pine River Capital Management L.P, or Pine River. Pine River formed PRCM Advisers for the purpose of providing management services to us. PRCM Advisers is responsible for administering our business activities and day-to-day operations. Pursuant to the terms of the management agreement between us and PRCM Advisers, PRCM Advisers provides us with our management team, including our executive officers and support personnel. In addition, PRCM Advisers provides us with the expertise of a dedicated team of investment professionals, proprietary analytical tools and other infrastructure support. PRCM Advisers is at all times subject to the supervision and oversight of our board of directors. Each of our executive officers is an employee or partner of Pine River; we do not have any employees. We do not pay any of our executive officers cash compensation; rather, we pay PRCM Advisers a base management fee equal to 1.5% per annum of our stockholders&#8217; equity, adjusted to exclude any unrealized gains, losses or other items that do not affect realized net income, among other adjustments, as defined by the management agreement. We also reimburse PRCM Advisers for the allocable share of the compensation paid by Pine River to its personnel serving as our principal financial officer and general counsel and other reimbursable costs under the management agreement. We do not pay PRCM Advisers any incentive-based fees or other incentive-based compensation. 

Through our relationship with PRCM Advisers, we benefit from Pine River&#8217;s disciplined and highly analytical investment approach, extensive long-term relationships in the financial community, and established infrastructure. Pine River&#8217;s disciplined investment process utilizes a cross-product approach, conducting top-down market assessments with respect to various subsets of the RMBS and mortgage market in order to identify the most attractive segments and investment opportunities. Our investment process leverages proprietary and third-party analytic tools to conduct a detailed analysis of factors that influence our target assets. We select our target assets after extensive analysis of the asset, including the underlying collateral, prepayment trends, average remaining life, amortization schedules, fixed versus floating interest rates, geographic concentration, property type, loan-to-value ratios and credit scores, among others. 

The dedicated team of investment professionals provided to us by PRCM Advisers has broad experience in managing our target assets and has demonstrated the ability to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns under different market conditions and cycles. Pine River maintains extensive long-term relationships with financial intermediaries, including prime brokers, investment banks, broker-dealers and asset custodians. We believe these relationships enhance our ability to source, finance, protect and hedge our investments and, thus, enable us to succeed in various credit and interest rate environments. We also benefit from Pine River&#8217;s comprehensive finance, operational and administrative infrastructure, including its risk management and accounting operations, as well as its legal, compliance and software development teams. Through the use of existing resources within Pine River, the addition of new personnel having significant experience in managing our target assets, and the use of experienced outside advisors, we believe that we have sufficient experience to execute on our business diversification initiatives, including commercial real estate assets.

Our Business 

Our Investment Strategy 

Our investment objective is to provide attractive risk-adjusted total return to our stockholders over the long-term, primarily through dividends and secondarily through capital appreciation. We intend to achieve this objective by constructing a well-balanced portfolio consisting of RMBS, residential mortgage loans, MSR, commercial real estate and other financial assets, with a focus on managing various associated risks, including interest rate, prepayment, mortgage spread and financing risk. The preservation of book value is of paramount importance to our ability to generate total return on an ongoing basis. Consistent with the objective of achieving attractive risk-adjusted total return over various market cycles, we intend to maintain a balanced approach to these various risks. 

We rely on PRCM Advisers&#8217; expertise in identifying assets within our target asset classes. PRCM Advisers makes investment decisions based on a rigorous asset selection process that takes into consideration a variety of factors, including expected cash yield, risk-adjusted returns, current and projected credit fundamentals, current and projected macroeconomic considerations, current and projected supply and demand, credit and market risk concentration limits, liquidity, cost of financing and financing availability. It is our intention to select our assets in such a way as to maintain our REIT qualification and our exemption from registration under the 1940 Act. 

Our Target Assets 

Our portfolio can be categorized into three strategies based on investment characteristics, which embodies our hybrid investment approach. All three strategies are managed by our Chief Investment Officer and resources are allocated and financial performance is assessed on a consolidated basis. The categories and their respective target asset classes are as follows: 

&#8226; 

Rates Strategy - Includes Agency RMBS, MSR and related hedging transactions. The performance of this strategy is most affected by changes in interest rates, prepayments and mortgage spreads. These assets have minimal exposure to the underlying credit performance of the investments. 

Agency RMBS 

Agency RMBS collateralized by fixed rate mortgage loans, adjustable-rate mortgage (or ARM) loans or hybrid mortgage loans, or derivatives thereof, including: 

&#160; 

&#159; 

mortgage pass-through certificates; 

&#160; 

&#159; 

collateralized mortgage obligations; 

&#160; 

&#159; 

Freddie Mac gold certificates; 

&#160; 

&#159; 

Fannie Mae certificates; 

&#160; 

&#159; 

Ginnie Mae certificates; 

&#160; 

&#159; 

&#8220;to-be-announced&#8221; forward contracts, or TBAs, which are pools of mortgages with specific investment terms to be issued by government sponsored entities, or GSEs, at a future date; and 

&#160; 

&#159; 

interest-only and inverse interest-only securities. 

MSR 

The right to control the servicing of mortgage loans and receive the servicing income therefrom; the actual servicing functions are outsourced to fully licensed third-party subservicers. 

&#8226; 

Credit Strategy - Includes non-Agency RMBS, residential mortgage loans and related hedging transactions. The performance of this strategy is most affected by changes in credit performance of the underlying mortgage loan collateral. These assets have interest rate and mortgage spread exposure, although such exposures are not viewed to be the main drivers of performance. 

Non-Agency RMBS 

Non-Agency RMBS collateralized by prime mortgage loans, Alt-A mortgage loans, pay-option ARM loans and subprime mortgage loans, which may have fixed rate, adjustable rate or hybrid rate terms. 

&#160; 

Non-Agency RMBS includes both senior and mezzanine RMBS. Senior RMBS refers to non-Agency RMBS that represent the senior-most tranches (that is, the tranches which have the highest priority claim to cash flows from the related collateral pool) within the RMBS structure. Mezzanine RMBS refers to subordinated tranches within the collateral pool. The non-Agency RMBS we purchase may include investment-grade and non-investment grade classes, including non-rated securities. 

&#160; 

Hybrid mortgage loans have terms with interest rates that are fixed for a specified period of time and, thereafter, generally adjust annually to an increment over a specified interest rate index. ARMs refer to hybrid and adjustable-rate mortgage loans which typically have interest rates that adjust annually to an increment over a specified interest rate index. 

Residential Mortgage Loans 

Prime nonconforming and credit sensitive residential mortgage loans. 

&#8226; 

Commercial Strategy - Includes first mortgage and mezzanine commercial real estate loans, debt-like preferred equity, b-notes, commercial mortgage-backed securities, or CMBS, and related hedging transactions. The performance of this strategy is affected by changes in interest rates and mortgage spreads as well as changes in performance of the underlying commercial collateral. 

Commercial Real Estate Loans 

Floating and fixed rate commercial real estate loans, including: 

&#160; 

&#159; 

first mortgage loans secured by a first priority mortgage on commercial real estate assets; 

&#160; 

&#159; 

mezzanine loans secured by a pledge of equity interests in the borrower and structurally subordinate to any loan made directly to the borrower; 

&#160; 

&#159; 

b-notes, which represent interests in a junior portion of a commercial mortgage loan; and 

&#160; 

&#159; 

debt-like preferred equity which is senior to the common equity and subordinate to any loan made directly to the borrower. 

CMBS 

CMBS collateralized by commercial real estate loans. 

Other assets include financial and mortgage-related assets other than those in our rates, credit and commercial strategies, including asset backed securities and certain non-hedging transactions that may produce non-qualifying income for purposes of the REIT gross income tests. 

Our Investment Activities 

At December 31, 2015 , we had total assets of approximately $14.6 billion . Our RMBS portfolio represented $7.8 billion , or 53.7% , of our assets and was comprised of $6.1 billion , or 76.8% , of Agency RMBS; $1.3 billion , or 16.4% , of senior non-Agency RMBS; and $0.5 billion , or 6.8% , of other non-Agency RMBS. Additionally, we held other investments including residential mortgage loans held-for-sale of $0.8 billion , or 5.6% ; residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts of $3.2 billion , or 21.8% ; commercial real estate assets of $661.0 million , or 4.5% ; and MSR of $0.5 billion , or 3.4% , of total assets. Remaining assets of $1.6 billion &#32;consist of cash, restricted cash, receivables, derivative assets and prepaid assets. 

Agency and Non-Agency RMBS 

We believe our hybrid Agency and non-Agency RMBS investment model allows management to allocate capital across various sectors within the residential mortgage market, with a focus on security selection and implementation of a relative value investment approach. Our capital allocation factors in the opportunities in the marketplace, cost of financing and cost of hedging interest rate, prepayment, credit and other portfolio risks. As a result, RMBS asset allocation reflects management&#8217;s opportunistic approach to investing in the marketplace. During the year ended &#32; December 31, 2015 , we did not significantly modify our RMBS asset allocation between Agency and non-Agency RMBS, but reduced our overall capital allocation to RMBS. 

Within our non-Agency RMBS portfolio, we have historically had a substantial emphasis on &#8220;legacy&#8221; securities, which include securities issued prior to 2009, many subprime. We believe these deeply discounted securities can add relative value as the economy and housing markets continue to improve. There remains upside optionality to lower delinquencies, higher recoveries and faster prepays. Throughout the past year, however, we have sold a number of these securities that we believe had reached maximum value, some of which were replaced with &#8220;new issue&#8221; non-Agency RMBS. We believe these &#8220;new issue&#8221; securities, which include some GSE credit risk transfer securities, have enabled us to find attractive returns and further diversify our non-Agency RMBS portfolio. 

Residential Mortgage Loans 

In order to diversify our investment opportunities, we have established a sustainable model for creating residential mortgage investments at attractive yields. We have developed and continue to advance a high-quality, multi-originator whole loan conduit program involving a network of reliable securitization partners including originators, servicers, master servicers, bankers, attorneys, trustees and custodians. We acquire prime nonconforming residential mortgage loans from select mortgage loan originators and secondary market institutions with whom we have chosen to build strategic relationships, including those with a national presence. We have expanded our prime program to include a high loan-to-value, or LTV, product and launched an expanded credit program. The high LTV product includes loans with high credit quality borrowers who prefer or require a lower down payment. The expanded credit program is geared toward borrowers of average credit quality who have the financial wherewithal to buy a home, but haven&#8217;t been able to get a mortgage due to exceptionally tight credit standards. We expect the high LTV product and the expanded credit program to drive volumes over time. 

We do not originate loans or provide direct financing to lenders; rather, through our mortgage loan conduit we contract with originators to acquire loans they originate that meet our purchase criteria. One of our subsidiaries has obtained the requisite licenses and approvals to purchase and sell mortgage loans in the states in which we conduct our conduit activities. We do not directly service the mortgage loans we acquire, and instead contract with fully licensed third-party subservicers to handle substantially all servicing functions. 

Through our mortgage loan conduit program, we believe we can provide capital solutions to a variety of sellers. Generally, our objective is to securitize the mortgage loans we acquire and create attractive securities with high quality underlying collateral. Since early 2013, we have participated in multiple securitizations. However, depending on market conditions and other factors, we may also choose to hold and finance certain of the loans or exit through a whole loan sale to a third party. 

In 2013, we acquired a portfolio of credit sensitive residential mortgage loans, or CSL, which are loans that were performing, but with respect to which the borrower had previously experienced payment delinquencies and was more likely to be underwater ( i.e. , the amount owed on a mortgage loan exceeds the current market value of the home). As a result, there is a higher probability of default on CSL than on newly originated residential mortgage loans. We sold substantially all of our CSL portfolio during the first quarter of 2014. As of December 31, 2015 , we had CSL with a carrying value of $11.0 million &#32;remaining. 

Commercial Real Estate Assets 

We originate and purchase commercial real estate debt and related instruments generally to be held as long-term investments. Pine River employs a seasoned commercial real estate team with broad experience across multiple segments of the commercial real estate market to manage this initiative. The commercial real estate loan market is over $3.0 trillion in size and over $1.5 trillion in loans are expected to mature in the next several years. This business meets the criteria we desire in respect of opportunity, scale and investment runway. As of December 31, 2015 , we had invested in first mortgage and mezzanine commercial real estate loans and it is our intention to continue to allocate capital towards this business. 

Mortgage Servicing Rights 

On April 30, 2013, one of our wholly owned subsidiaries acquired a company that holds the requisite approvals from Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae to own and manage MSR. The MSR acquired in conjunction with the acquisition of this entity and those subsequently purchased represent a contractual right to service a mortgage loan and collect a fee for performing servicing activities, such as collecting principal and interest from a borrower and distributing those payments to the owner of the loan. We do not directly service the mortgage loans underlying the MSR we acquire; rather, we contract with fully licensed third-party subservicers to handle substantially all servicing functions for the loans underlying our MSR. 

We believe MSR are a natural fit for our portfolio over the long term. Our MSR strategy leverages our core competencies in prepayment and credit risk analytics and the MSR assets are a natural hedge to our Agency RMBS, hedging both interest rate as well as mortgage spread risk. Our goal is to create long-lasting relationships with high quality originators in both flow and bulk acquisitions of MSR. We have completed multiple substantial bulk acquisitions of MSR and have in place flow arrangements with multiple sellers through which we purchase MSR on new-origination production. 

Discontinued Operations 

On December 19, 2012, we completed the contribution of our portfolio of single-family rental properties to Silver Bay Realty Trust Corp., or Silver Bay, a newly organized Maryland corporation managed by a subsidiary of Pine River, that intended to qualify as a REIT and was focused on the acquisition, renovation, leasing and management of single-family residential properties for rental income and long-term capital appreciation. We effected this transaction by contributing our equity interests in our then wholly owned subsidiary, Two Harbors Property Investment LLC, to Silver Bay, and in exchange for the contribution, received shares of common stock of Silver Bay. Silver Bay completed its initial public offering, or IPO, of its common stock on December 19, 2012 and is listed on the NYSE under the symbol &#8220;SBY&#8221;. We distributed the shares of Silver Bay common stock we received in the transaction to our stockholders on or about April 24, 2013. Because we will not have any significant continuing involvement in Two Harbors Property Investment LLC, all of the associated operating results were removed from continuing operations and are presented separately as discontinued operations for the year ended &#32; December 31, 2013 . No remaining associated operating results were recognized during the years ended &#32; December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 . 

Our Investment Guidelines 

Our board of directors has approved the following investment guidelines: 

&#8226; 

no investment shall be made that would cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes; 

&#8226; 

no investment shall be made that would cause us to be regulated as an investment company under the 1940 Act; 

&#8226; 

we will primarily invest within our target assets, consisting primarily of Agency RMBS, non-Agency RMBS, residential mortgage loans, MSR and commercial real estate assets, inclusive of commercial real estate loans, commercial real property, CMBS, commercial corporate debt and loans and other commercial real estate-related investments in the U.S.; approximately 5% to 10% of our portfolio may include other financial assets; and 

&#8226; 

until appropriate investments can be identified, we will invest available cash in interest-bearing and short-term investments that are consistent with (i) our intention to qualify as a REIT and (ii) our exemption from investment company status under the 1940 Act. 

These investment guidelines may be changed from time to time by our board of directors in its discretion without the approval of our stockholders. 

Within the constraints of the foregoing investment guidelines, PRCM Advisers has broad authority to select, finance and manage our investment portfolio. As a general matter, our investment strategy is designed to enable us to: 

&#8226; 

build an investment portfolio consisting of Agency RMBS, non-Agency RMBS, residential mortgage loans, MSR, commercial real estate and other financial assets that will generate attractive returns while having a moderate risk profile; 

&#8226; 

manage financing, interest, prepayment rate, credit and similar risks; 

&#8226; 

capitalize on discrepancies in the relative valuations in the mortgage and housing markets; and 

&#8226; 

provide regular quarterly dividend distributions to stockholders. 

Within the requirements of the investment guidelines, PRCM Advisers makes determinations as to the percentage of our assets that will be invested in each of our target assets. Our investment decisions depend on prevailing market conditions and may change over time in response to opportunities available in different interest rate, economic and credit environments. As a result, we cannot predict the percentage of our assets that will be invested in any of our target asset classes at any given time. We believe that the diversification of our portfolio of assets and the flexibility of our strategy, combined with the expertise of PRCM Advisers and its affiliates, will enable us to achieve attractive risk-adjusted total return under a variety of market conditions and economic cycles. 

Financing Strategy 

We deploy moderate leverage to increase potential returns to our stockholders and to fund the acquisition of our target assets. We are not required to maintain any particular leverage ratio. The amount of leverage we deploy for particular investments in our target assets depends upon a variety of factors, including without limitation: general economic, political and financial market conditions; the anticipated liquidity and price volatility of our assets; the gap between the duration of assets and liabilities, including hedges; the availability and cost of financing the assets; our opinion of the credit worthiness of financing counterparties; the health of the U.S. residential mortgage and housing markets; our outlook for the level, slope and volatility of interest rates; the credit quality of the loans underlying our Agency RMBS and non-Agency RMBS; the rating assigned to RMBS assets; and our outlook for asset spreads relative to the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, curve. 

Our primary financing sources are repurchase agreements and FHLB advances. Repurchase agreements are financings pursuant to which one party, the seller/borrower, sells assets to the repurchase agreement counterparty, the buyer/lender, for an agreed price with the obligation to repurchase the assets from the buyer at a future date and at a price higher than the original purchase price. The amount of financing available under a repurchase agreement is limited to a specified percentage of the estimated market value of the assets. The difference between the sale price and repurchase price is the interest expense of financing under a repurchase agreement. Under repurchase agreement financing arrangements, if the value of the collateral decreases, the buyer could require the seller to provide additional cash collateral to re-establish the ratio of value of the collateral to the amount of borrowing ( i.e. , a margin call). In the current economic climate, lenders under repurchase agreements generally advance approximately 90% to 97% of the market value of the Agency RMBS financed (a discount from market value, generally referred to as a haircut, of 3% to 10%), 50% to 75% of the market value of the non-Agency RMBS financed ( i.e. , a haircut of 25% to 50%), 80% to 90% of the market value of prime nonconforming residential mortgage loans ( i.e. , a haircut of 10% to 20%), 50% to 60% of the market value of CSL ( i.e. , a haircut of 40% to 50%), 25% to 50% of the market value of mezzanine commercial real estate loans ( i.e. , a haircut of 50% to 75%), 65% to 80% of the market value of commercial real estate first mortgages ( i.e. , a haircut of 20% to 35%), and 65% to 75% of the market value of CMBS ( i.e. , a haircut of 25% to 35%). 

A significant decrease in the advance rate or an increase in the haircut could result in our having to sell assets in order to meet additional margin requirements by the lender. We expect to mitigate our risk of margin calls under repurchase agreements by deploying leverage at an amount that is below what could be used under current advance rates. 

In order to reduce our exposure to risks associated with lender counterparty concentration, we generally seek to diversify our exposure by entering into repurchase agreements with multiple counterparties. At December 31, 2015 , we had $5.0 billion &#32;of outstanding balances under repurchase agreements with 21 &#32;counterparties, with a maximum net exposure (the difference between the amount loaned to us, including interest payable, and the value of the assets pledged by us as collateral, including accrued interest receivable on such assets) to any single lender of $217.7 million , or 6.1% &#32;of equity. 

In December 2013, our wholly owned subsidiary, TH Insurance Holdings Company LLC, or TH Insurance, was accepted for membership in the FHLB. As a member of the FHLB, TH Insurance has access to a variety of products and services offered by the FHLB, including secured advances. Eligible collateral may include conventional 1-4 family residential loans, commercial real estate loans, Agency RMBS and non-Agency RMBS with a rating of A and above. 

We use FHLB advances to finance our Agency and non-Agency RMBS, residential mortgage loans held-for-sale and commercial real estate assets. Similar to repurchase agreements, if the value of our assets pledged to the FHLB as collateral for advances decreases, the FHLB could require us to provide additional collateral to re-establish the ratio of value of the collateral to the amount of advances outstanding. The FHLB generally advances approximately 90% to 95% of the market value of the Agency RMBS financed ( i.e. , a haircut of 5% to 10%), 85% to 90% of the market value of the non-Agency RMBS financed ( i.e. , a haircut of 10% to 15%), and 60% to 80% of the market value of the residential mortgage and commercial real estate loans financed ( i.e. , a haircut of 20% to 40%). 

In January 2016, the FHFA released a final rule regarding membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank system. Among other effects, the ruling excludes captive insurers from membership eligibility, including our subsidiary member, TH Insurance Holdings Company LLC, or TH Insurance. Since TH Insurance was admitted as a member in 2013, it is eligible for a five-year membership grace period, during which new advances or renewals that mature beyond the grace period will be prohibited. However, any existing advances that mature beyond this grace period will be permitted to remain in place subject to their terms insofar as we maintain good standing with the FHLB. If any new advances or renewals occur, TH Insurance&#8217;s outstanding advances will be limited to forty percent of its total assets. Notwithstanding the FHFA&#8217;s ruling, we continue to believe our mission aligns well with that of the Federal Home Loan Bank system. 

Our MSR are currently unlevered with limited ability to borrow against such assets. We are currently funding these assets with equity of the company, but may finance them with third parties in the future if funding is available on terms we believe are favorable to us. 

Interest Rate Hedging and Risk Management Strategy 

We enter into a variety of derivative and non-derivative instruments in connection with our risk management activities. Our primary objective for executing these derivative and non-derivative instruments is to mitigate our exposure to future events that are outside our control. Our derivative financial instruments are utilized principally to manage market risk and cash flow volatility associated with interest rate risk (including associated prepayment risk) and credit risk related to certain assets and liabilities. As part of our risk management activities, we may, at times, enter into various forward contracts including short securities, Agency TBAs, options, futures, swaps and caps. In executing on our current risk management strategy, we have entered into interest rate swap and swaption agreements, TBAs, short U.S. Treasuries, put and call options for TBAs and U.S. Treasuries, constant maturity swaps, credit default swaps, total return swaps (based on the Markit IOS Index) and forward purchase commitments. We have also entered into a number of non-derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk, principally U.S. Treasuries and Agency interest-only securities. 

Our Competitive Advantages 

Our investment strategy is focused on utilizing our underlying core strengths, described below in further detail, which we believe offer competitive advantages in the marketplace: 

Significant Experience of Our Management Team 

We believe that the extensive experience of our management team and, through our relationship with PRCM Advisers, the employees of Pine River, provides us with significant expertise across our target assets. Our team of dedicated investment professionals has managed our target assets through a variety of credit and interest rate environments and has demonstrated strong ability to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns under different market conditions, on both a levered and unlevered basis. Pine River also employs a seasoned commercial real estate team with broad experience across multiple segments of the commercial real estate market. 

Our Chief Investment Officer and the other senior members of our investment team have extensive experience in investing in our target assets, including experience in performing advisory services for investment banks, funds, other investment vehicles and other managed and discretionary accounts. Our team of dedicated investment professionals includes seasoned traders, analysts and risk managers, and is backed by Pine River&#8217;s extensive infrastructure in the areas of credit analysis, trade execution, risk management, valuation, accounting, operations and law. 

Ability to Provide Capital Solutions to the Residential Mortgage Market 

We believe our investment diversification strategy into MSR and residential mortgage loans, combined with our state licenses and seller-servicer approvals from Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae to own and manage MSR, our state licenses and approvals to purchase and sell mortgage loans, and the expansion of our infrastructure necessary to support these businesses, including technology, servicing oversight and re-underwriting capabilities, allows us to provide attractive capital solutions to originators, servicers and RMBS investor partners. We are not, nor do we currently intend to be, an originator or servicer of residential mortgage loans. As such, we believe our current business model is complementary to the objectives of our business partners. 

Disciplined Relative Value Investment Approach 

Disciplined security and asset selection is a key element of our overall investment strategy. We are a relative value investor in residential mortgage-backed securities. We use a cross-product approach, conducting top-down market assessments with respect to various subsets of the RMBS market in order to identify the most attractive segments and investment opportunities. In employing this detailed analysis, we seek to best capture market inefficiencies and identify the most attractive securities. We select our RMBS based on factors that include extensive analysis of the underlying loans, including prepayment trends, average remaining life, amortization schedules, fixed versus floating interest rates, geographic concentration, property type, LTV ratios and credit scores. Considering the multi-trillion dollar size of the U.S. RMBS market, we can be selective with our investments and buy only the securities we deem to be the most attractive. We believe this holistic, relative-value approach to the non-Agency and Agency RMBS investments may achieve higher risk-adjusted returns than an approach that focuses on a single sector of the residential mortgage market. 

Within the commercial market, we employ a bottom-up methodology to assess properties based on the type of sponsor or property owner, the building type and local market demand, cash flow and stress analysis and structural protections within the loan agreements to protect our investments. In applying this detailed analysis, we seek to capture market inefficiencies and identify the most attractive investment opportunities on a risk-adjusted basis. We are diversified with respect to property type and geographic location. Commercial assets are generally floating-rate assets, providing a complement to our RMBS portfolio from an interest rate exposure perspective. Within the multi-trillion dollar size of the U.S. commercial mortgage market, it is estimated that $1.5 trillion of maturities are due in the next several years, providing ample opportunity with respect to asset selection. 

Portfolio Construction 

Our objective is to provide attractive risk-adjusted total return to our stockholders over the long term, primarily through dividends and secondarily through capital appreciation. We intend to achieve this objective by constructing a well-balanced portfolio consisting primarily of RMBS, MSR, residential mortgage loans and commercial real estate assets, with a focus on managing the various associated risks, including interest rate, prepayment, mortgage spread and financing risk. We use the expertise of our dedicated team of investment professionals in the RMBS, MSR, residential mortgage loan and commercial real estate markets to construct our diverse portfolio, balancing the relative attractiveness of assets with the aforementioned risks. Across our portfolio we are mindful with respect to leverage and other risks. Through the careful and disciplined selection of assets, and continual portfolio monitoring, we seek to build and maintain an investment portfolio that provides value to stockholders over time both in absolute terms and relative to other residential and commercial mortgage-related portfolios. 

Analytical Tools, Infrastructure and Expertise 

Our experienced investment team constructs and manages our investment portfolio through the use of focused qualitative and quantitative analysis, which helps us manage risk on an asset-level and portfolio basis. We rely on a variety of proprietary and third-party analytical tools and models, which we customize to our needs. We focus on in-depth analysis of the numerous factors that influence our target assets, including: 

&#8226; 

fundamental market and sector review; 

&#8226; 

cash flow analysis; 

&#8226; 

disciplined asset selection; 

&#8226; 

controlled risk exposure; and 

&#8226; 

prudent balance sheet management. 

&#32; We also use these tools to guide our hedging strategies to the extent consistent with the requirements for qualification as a REIT. 

Our focus on loan-level and local market analysis allows us to track and understand borrower performance, which we consider important to our overall investment strategy. Our ability to track real-time variables such as market-specific home prices and unemployment rates provides us with valuable insights and helps with specific asset selection decisions. We believe that sophisticated analysis of both macro- and micro-economic factors will enable us to manage cash flow and distributions while preserving our stockholders&#8217; capital. 

Through a shared facilities and services agreement with Pine River, PRCM Advisers has access to analytical and portfolio management capabilities to aid in asset selection and risk management. We capitalize on the market knowledge and ready access to data across our target markets that PRCM Advisers and its affiliates obtain through their established platform. We also benefit, through PRCM Advisers, from Pine River&#8217;s comprehensive finance, operational and administrative infrastructure, including its risk management and financial reporting and accounting operations, as well as its business development, legal, compliance, operations, settlement, and software development teams. 

Extensive Strategic Relationships and Experience of PRCM Advisers and its Affiliates 

PRCM Advisers and its affiliates maintain extensive long-term relationships with financial intermediaries including prime brokers, investment banks, broker-dealers and asset custodians. We believe these relationships enhance our ability to source, finance, protect and hedge our investments and, thus, enable us to succeed in various credit and interest rate environments. Members of the investment team have many years of experience and well-established contacts within the mortgage industry. This experience and the associated relationships are beneficial to our stockholders. 

Management Agreement 

Pursuant to the management agreement between us and PRCM Advisers, PRCM Advisers provides a dedicated team of investment and management professionals to carry out our business strategy as well as operational and administrative infrastructure to support our operations, subject to oversight by our board of directors. PRCM Advisers is responsible for, among other duties, (i) performing all of our day-to-day functions; (ii) determining investment criteria in conjunction with our board of directors; (iii) sourcing, analyzing and executing investments, asset sales and financings; and (iv) performing asset management duties. 

The current term of the management agreement expires on October 28, 2016 , and will continue to automatically renew thereafter for successive one-year terms unless terminated in accordance with the agreement. Our independent directors review PRCM Advisers&#8217; performance annually and the management agreement may be terminated by us without cause upon the vote of at least two-thirds of our independent directors or by a vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock, based upon: (i) PRCM Advisers&#8217; unsatisfactory performance that is materially detrimental to us or (ii) our determination that the management fees payable to PRCM Advisers are not fair, subject to PRCM Advisers&#8217; right to prevent termination based on unfair fees by accepting a reduction of management fees agreed to by at least two-thirds of our independent directors. We are required to provide PRCM Advisers with 180 days&#8217; prior notice of such termination. Upon termination of the management agreement by us without cause or by PRCM Advisers due to our material breach of the management agreement, we are required to pay a termination fee equal to three times the sum of the average annual base management fee earned by PRCM Advisers during the 24-month period immediately preceding the date of termination, calculated as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal quarter prior to the date of termination. We may terminate the management agreement with 30 days&#8217; prior notice from our board of directors, without payment of a termination fee, for cause, as defined in the management agreement. PRCM Advisers may terminate the management agreement if we become required to register as an investment company under the 1940 Act, with such termination deemed to occur immediately before such event, and may also decline to renew the management agreement by providing us with 180 days&#8217; prior notice; in either case, we would not be required to pay a termination fee. 

Base Management Fee 

The base management fee paid to PRCM Advisers is 1.5% of our stockholders&#8217; equity per annum, calculated and payable quarterly in arrears. 

For purposes of calculating the management fee, our stockholders&#8217; equity means the sum of the net proceeds from all issuances of our equity securities since inception (allocated on a pro rata daily basis for such issuances during the fiscal quarter of any such issuance), plus our retained earnings at the end of the most recently completed calendar quarter (without taking into account any non-cash equity compensation expense incurred in current or prior periods), less any amount that we have paid for repurchases of our common stock since inception, and excluding any unrealized gains, losses or other items that do not affect realized net income (regardless of whether such items are included in other comprehensive income or loss, or in net income). This amount will be adjusted to exclude one-time events pursuant to changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP, and certain non-cash items after discussions between PRCM Advisers and our independent directors and approval by a majority of our independent directors. To the extent asset impairments reduce our retained earnings at the end of any completed calendar quarter it will reduce the base management fee for such quarter. Our stockholders&#8217; equity for the purposes of calculating the base management fee could be greater than the amount of stockholders&#8217; equity shown on the consolidated financial statements. In connection with the Silver Bay transaction, the management fee payable by us to PRCM Advisers for the year ended December 31, 2013 was reduced by $4.3 million. 

Expense Reimbursement 

We reimburse PRCM Advisers for (i) our allocable share of the compensation paid by Pine River to its personnel serving as our principal financial officer and general counsel and personnel employed by Pine River as in-house legal, tax, accounting, consulting, auditing, administrative, information technology, valuation, computer programming and development and back-office resources to us and (ii) any amounts for personnel of Pine River&#8217;s affiliates arising under a shared facilities and services agreement. We also have certain costs allocated to us by PRCM Advisers for data services and proprietary technology, but most direct expenses with third-party vendors are paid directly by us. 

Operating and Regulatory Structure 

Our business is subject to extensive regulation by U.S. federal and state governmental authorities, self-regulatory organizations and securities exchanges. We are required to comply with numerous federal and state laws, including those described below. The laws, rules and regulations comprising this regulatory framework change frequently, as can the interpretation and enforcement of existing laws, rules and regulations. Some of the laws, rules and regulations to which we are subject are intended primarily to safeguard and protect consumers, rather than stockholders or creditors. From time to time, we may receive requests from U.S. federal and state agencies for records, documents and information regarding our policies, procedures and practices regarding our business activities. We incur significant ongoing costs to comply with these government regulations. 

REIT Qualification 

We elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code, commencing with our taxable period ended December 31, 2009. Our qualification as a REIT depends upon our ability to meet on a continuing basis, through actual investment and operating results, various complex requirements under the Code relating to, among other things, the sources of our gross income, the composition and value of our assets, our distribution levels and the diversity of ownership of our shares. We believe that we are organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code, and we conduct our operations in a manner which will enable us to continue to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT. Certain activities that we may perform may cause us to earn income that will not be qualifying income for REIT purposes. We have designated certain of our subsidiaries as TRSs to engage in such activities, and we may in the future form additional TRSs. 

As long as we continue to qualify as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the REIT taxable income we distribute currently to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates and may be precluded from qualifying as a REIT for the subsequent four taxable years following the year during which we lost our REIT qualification. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain U.S. federal, state and local taxes on our income or property. 

Investment Company Act of 1940 

We conduct our operations so that we are not required to register as an investment company under the 1940 Act. If we were to fall within the definition of an investment company, we would be unable to conduct our business as described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the 1940 Act defines an investment company as any issuer that &#8220;is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities.&#8221; Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the 1940 Act also defines an investment company as any issuer that &#8220;is engaged or proposes to engage in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of the issuer&#8217;s total assets (exclusive of U.S. Government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis.&#8221; Excluded from the term &#8220;investment securities,&#8221; among other things, are U.S. Government securities and securities issued by majority-owned subsidiaries that are not themselves investment companies and are not relying on the exclusion from the definition of investment company set forth in Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act. 

We are organized as a holding company that conducts business primarily through our subsidiaries. Any business conducted through our subsidiaries will be conducted in such a manner as to ensure that we do not meet the definition of &#8220;investment company&#8221; because less than 40% of the value of our total assets on an unconsolidated basis would consist of &#8220;investment securities.&#8221; 

To avoid registration as an investment company, certain of our subsidiaries rely on certain exemptions from the 1940 Act, including Section 3(c)(5)(C), which exempts entities that are &#8220;primarily engaged in the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate.&#8221; Under the SEC staff&#8217;s current guidance, to qualify for this exemption, we must maintain (i) at least 55% of our assets in qualifying interests (referred to as the 55% Test) and (ii) at least 80% of our assets in qualifying interest plus other real estate related assets (referred to as the 80% Test). Qualifying interests for this purpose include mortgage loans and other assets, such as whole pool Agency and non-Agency RMBS, which are considered the functional equivalent of mortgage loans for the purposes of the 1940 Act. We expect each of our subsidiaries relying on Section 3(c)(5)(C) to invest at least 55% of its assets in qualifying interests in accordance with SEC staff guidance, and an additional 25% of its assets in either qualifying interests or other types of real estate related assets that do not constitute qualifying interests. We believe that we conduct our business so that we are exempt from the 1940 Act under Section 3(c)(5)(C), but rapid changes in the values of our assets could disrupt prior efforts to conduct our business to meet the 55% Test and the 80% Test. Our efforts to comply with the 55% Test and the 80% Test could require us to acquire or dispose of certain assets at unfavorable prices and limit our ability to pursue certain investment opportunities. 

In 2011, the SEC issued a &#8220;concept release&#8221; soliciting public comment on a wide range of issues relating to the exemptions set forth in Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the 1940 Act, including what types of assets should be deemed qualifying interests and whether REITs that invest in RMBS should be regulated in a manner similar to investment companies. Although we believe that we are properly relying on Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the 1940 Act to exempt us from regulation under the 1940 Act, any modifications to the 1940 Act exemption rules or interpretations may require us to change our business and operations in order for us to continue to rely on such exemption. We will continue to monitor our compliance with the Section 3(c)(5)(C) exemptions. 

Mortgage Industry Regulation 

Although we do not originate or service residential mortgage loans, we must comply with various federal and state laws, rules and regulations as a result of owning residential mortgage loans and MSR. These rules generally focus on consumer protection and include, among others, rules promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Modernization Act of 1999, or the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. We are also required to maintain qualifications and licenses in certain states in order to own certain of our assets. These requirements can and do change as statutes and regulations are enacted, promulgated or amended, and the recent trend among federal and state lawmakers and regulators has been toward increasing laws, regulations and investigative proceedings in relation to the mortgage industry generally. 

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act imposes additional obligations on us to safeguard the information we maintain on mortgage loan borrowers, requires that we provide mortgage borrowers with notices describing how we collect, use and share their personal information, and allows mortgage borrowers to &#8220;opt-out&#8221; of sharing certain information with third parties and affiliates. In addition, certain states have passed a variety of laws to further protect borrower information, including laws that regulate the use and storage of personally identifiable information, require notifications to borrowers if the security of their personal information is breached, or require us to encrypt personal information when it is transmitted electronically. These federal and state laws require ongoing review and changes to our operations, increased compliance costs, and affect our ability to use and share information with third parties. 

The Dodd-Frank Act significantly changed the regulation of financial institutions and the financial services industry, including the mortgage industry. The Dodd-Frank Act tasked many agencies with issuing a variety of new regulations, including rules related to mortgage origination, mortgage servicing, securitization transactions and derivatives. 

&#32;The Dodd-Frank Act created a new regulator, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or the CFPB, which is responsible for regulating the offering and provision of financial products and services for personal, family and household purposes. The CFPB has broad rulemaking authority with respect to many of the federal consumer protection laws applicable to the mortgage industry. In addition to its rulemaking authority, the CFPB has supervision, examination and enforcement authority over consumer financial products and services by certain non-depository institutions, including our company. 

The CFPB has issued a series of final rules as part of ongoing efforts to affect reforms and create uniform standards for the mortgage lending and servicing industries. These rules include requirements addressing how lenders must evaluate a consumer&#8217;s ability to repay a mortgage loan, what specific communications must be made to consumers at various stages in the mortgage lending and servicing processes, how consumer account records must be maintained and how servicers must respond to written borrower requests, complaints and notices of errors. The rules also provide specific guidance relating to servicing delinquent loans, undertaking loss mitigation efforts and commencing foreclosure proceedings. These rules have led to and will likely continue to lead to increased costs to originate and service loans across the mortgage industry, and given their complexity, it is anticipated the originators, servicers and other mortgage industry participants will be exposed to greater regulatory scrutiny from federal and state regulators and increased litigation and complaints from both consumers and government officials. We expect the CFPB will continue to interpret, modify and expand the rules, regulations and guidance related to mortgage lending and servicing industries and we will continue to evaluate these actions in order to understand the impact on our business and the industry, generally. 

Because a significant number of rules and regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act relating to the origination and servicing of residential mortgage loans are recently effective or have not yet taken effect, the long term effect on the mortgage industry, including the availability of credit, the ability to execute securitization transactions and the investing environment for our target assets, remains uncertain. We have implemented and will continue to implement new policies and procedures in order to ensure ongoing compliance with the laws, rules and regulations applicable to our business. We have incurred and expect to incur ongoing operational costs to comply with existing and future rules and regulations. We continue to evaluate all aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act applicable to our business. 

Corporate Governance 

We strive to maintain an ethical workplace in which the highest standards of professional conduct are practiced. 

&#8226; 

Our board of directors is composed of a majority of independent directors. Our Audit, Compensation, Nominating and Corporate Governance and Risk Oversight Committees are composed exclusively of independent directors. 

&#8226; 

In order to foster the highest standards of ethics and conduct in all of our business relationships, we have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and Corporate Governance Guidelines, which cover a wide range of business practices and procedures that apply to all of our directors, officers and personnel. In addition, we have implemented Whistleblowing Procedures for Accounting and Auditing Matters that set forth procedures by which personnel may raise, on a confidential basis, concerns regarding any questionable or unethical accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters with our Audit Committee. 

&#8226; 

We have an insider trading policy that prohibits our directors, officers and personnel from buying or selling our securities on the basis of material nonpublic information and prohibits communicating material nonpublic information about us to others. In addition, we have policies that prohibit our directors, officers and personnel from buying or selling the securities of other issuers on the basis of material nonpublic information that we may possess from time to time. 

&#8226; 

We have a formal internal audit function to further the effective functioning of our internal controls and procedures. Our internal audit plan, which is approved annually by our Audit Committee, is based on a formal risk assessment and is intended to provide management and our Audit Committee with an effective tool to identify and address areas of financial or operational concerns and to ensure that appropriate controls and procedures are in place. We have implemented Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, or the SOX Act, which requires an evaluation of internal control over financial reporting in association with our financial statements as of December 31, 2015 . (See Item 9A, &#8220;Controls and Procedures&#8221; included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.) 

Competition 

Our net income depends, in large part, on our ability to acquire assets at favorable spreads over our borrowing costs. In acquiring our target assets, we compete with other REITs, specialty finance companies, savings and loan associations, banks, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, mutual funds, institutional investors, investment banking firms, financial institutions, governmental agencies, mortgage loan servicers, asset management firms and other entities. Some of these entities may not be subject to the same regulatory constraints that we are ( i.e. , REIT compliance or maintaining an exemption under the 1940 Act). Many of our competitors are significantly larger than us, have access to greater capital and other resources and may have other advantages over us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish different counterparty relationships than us. Further, we may from time to time face competition from government agencies in connection with initiatives designed to stimulate the U.S. economy or the mortgage market, including for example competition for RMBS assets from the Federal Reserve as a result of its prior quantitative easing programs and competition from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in purchasing and securitizing mortgage loans. Market conditions may from time to time attract more competitors for certain of our target assets, which will not only affect the supply of assets but may also increase the competition for sources of financing for these assets. An increase in the competition for sources of funding could adversely affect the availability and cost of financing, and thereby adversely affect our financial results. 

Other Historical Information 

In connection with our merger with Capitol, warrants to purchase 33,249,000 shares of Two Harbors common stock were issued, of which 7,000,000 were issued to the founding stockholders of Capitol and the remainder were sold to the public. Under the terms of the warrant agreement, as subsequently amended, the warrants had an exercise price of $11.00 per share, which was lowered to $10.25 per share pursuant to the terms of the warrant agreement as a result of the special dividend of Silver Bay common stock in the first quarter of 2013. The number of shares of common stock issuable for each warrant share exercised was also increased to 1.0727 shares as a result of this dividend. The warrants expired in accordance with their terms at 5:00 pm EST on November 7, 2013. Of the 33,249,000 warrants originally issued, 3,580,279 warrants expired unexercised. No warrants were outstanding during the years ended &#32; December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 .
