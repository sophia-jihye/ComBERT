 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Overview 

QNB was incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania on June 4, 1984. QNB is registered with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 and conducts its business through its wholly-owned subsidiary, QNB Bank (the &#8220;Bank&#8221;). 

&#160; 

Prior to December 28, 2007, the Bank was a national banking association organized in 1877 as The Quakertown National Bank, was chartered under the National Banking Act and was subject to Federal and state laws applicable to national banks. Effective December 28, 2007, the Bank became a Pennsylvania chartered commercial bank and changed its name to QNB Bank. The Bank, whose principal office is located in Quakertown, Bucks County, Pennsylvania operated eleven full-service community banking offices in Bucks, Montgomery and Lehigh counties in southeastern Pennsylvania as of December 31, 2015. 

&#160; 

The Bank is engaged in the general commercial banking business and provides a full range of banking services to its customers. These banking services consist of, among other things, attracting deposits and using these funds in making commercial loans, residential mortgage loans, consumer loans, and purchasing investment securities. These deposits are in the form of time, demand and savings accounts. Time deposits include certificates of deposit and individual retirement accounts. The Bank&#8217;s demand and savings accounts include money market accounts, interest-bearing demand accounts (including a higher yielding checking account), club accounts, traditional statement savings accounts, and a higher yielding online savings account. 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015, QNB had total assets of $1,020,936,000, total loans of $615,270,000, total deposits of $889,786,000 and total shareholders&#8217; equity of $90,443,000. For the year ended December 31, 2015, QNB reported net income of $8,233,000 compared to net income for the year ended December 31, 2014 of $8,998,000 and December 31, 2013 of $8,392,000. 

&#160; 

At February 26, 2016, the Bank had 166 full-time employees and 20 part-time employees. The Bank&#8217;s employees have a customer-oriented philosophy emphasizing personal service and flexible solutions which together make achieving our customers&#8217; goals possible. They maintain close contact with both the residents and local business people in the communities in which they serve, responding to changes in market conditions and customer requests in a timely manner.

&#160;

Competition and Market Area 

The banking business is highly competitive, and the profitability of QNB depends principally upon the Bank&#8217;s ability to compete in its market area. QNB faces intense competition within its market, both in making loans and attracting deposits. Bucks, Lehigh, and Montgomery counties have a high concentration of financial institutions, including large national and regional banks, community banks, savings institutions and credit unions. Some of QNB&#8217;s competitors offer products and services that QNB currently does not offer, such as traditional trust services and full-service insurance. 

&#160; 

In addition, as a result of consolidation in the banking industry, some of QNB&#8217;s competitors may enjoy advantages such as greater financial resources, a wider geographic presence, more favorable pricing alternatives and lower origination and operating costs. However, QNB has been able to compete effectively with other financial institutions by emphasizing the establishment of long-term relationships and customer loyalty. A strong focus on small-business solutions, providing fast local decision-making on loans, exceptional personal customer service and technology solutions, including internet- and mobile-banking, electronic bill pay and remote deposit capture, also enable QNB to compete successfully. 

&#160; 

Competition for loans and deposits comes principally from commercial banks, savings institutions, credit unions and non-bank financial service providers. Factors in successfully competing for deposits include providing excellent customer service, convenient locations and hours of operation, attractive rates, low fees, and alternative delivery systems. One such delivery system is remote deposit capture for those commercial customers that are not conveniently located near one of our branches, or mobile banking for retail customers. Successful loan origination tends to depend not only on interest rate and terms of the loan but on being responsive and flexible to the customers&#8217; needs. While many competitors within the Bank&#8217;s primary market have substantially higher legal lending limits, QNB often has the ability, through loan participations, to meet the larger lending needs of its customers. 

&#160; 

QNB&#8217;s success is dependent to a significant degree on economic conditions in southeastern Pennsylvania, especially Bucks, Lehigh and Montgomery counties, which it defines as its primary market. The banking industry is affected by general economic conditions, including the effects of recession, unemployment, declining real estate values, inflation, trends in the national and global economies, and other factors beyond QNB&#8217;s control. 

&#160; 

Monetary Policy and Economic Conditions 

The business of financial institutions is affected not only by general economic conditions, but also by the policies of various governmental regulatory agencies, including the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board regulates money, credit conditions and interest rates to influence general economic conditions primarily through open market operations in U.S. government securities, changes in the discount rate on bank borrowings and changes in the reserve requirements against depository institutions&#8217; deposits. These policies and regulations significantly affect the overall growth and distribution of loans, investments and deposits, as well as the interest rates charged on loans and the interest rates paid on deposits. 

&#160; 

The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board have had a significant effect on the operating results of financial institutions in the past and are expected to continue to have significant effects in the future. In view of the changing conditions in the economy and the financial markets in addition to the activities of monetary and fiscal authorities, the prediction of future changes in interest rates, credit availability or deposit levels is very challenging. 

&#160; 

Supervision and Regulation 

Banks and bank holding companies operate in a highly regulated environment and are regularly examined by Federal and state regulatory authorities. Federal statutes that apply to QNB and its subsidiary include the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (&#8220;BHCA&#8221;), the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (&#8220;FDIA&#8221;), as those statutes have been significantly amended by recent laws such as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (&#8220;GLBA&#8221;), and others. In general, these statutes regulate the corporate governance of the Bank and eligible business activities of QNB, and impose certain restrictions and limitations on such important matters as mergers and acquisitions, intercompany transactions, loans and dividends, and capital adequacy, among others. Other corporate governance requirements are imposed on QNB by Federal securities and other laws, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, described later. 

&#160; 

The Company is under the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission and of state securities commissions for matters relating to the offering and sale of its securities. In addition, the Company is subject to the Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s rules and regulations relating to periodic reporting, proxy solicitation and insider trading. 

&#160; 

Set forth below is a brief summary of some of the significant regulatory concepts and recent laws that affect QNB and the Bank. To the extent that the following information describes statutory or regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by references to the particular statutory or regulatory provisions themselves. Proposals to change banking laws and regulations are frequently introduced in Congress, the state legislatures, and before the various bank regulatory agencies. QNB cannot determine the likelihood of passage or timing of any such proposals or legislation or the impact they may have on QNB and its subsidiary. A change in law, regulations or regulatory policy may have a material effect on QNB and its subsidiary.

&#160;

Bank Holding Company Regulation 

QNB is registered as a bank holding company and is subject to the regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &#8220;Federal Reserve&#8221;) under the BHCA. In addition, QNB Corp., as a Pennsylvania business corporation, is subject to the provisions of Section 115 of the Pennsylvania Banking Code of 1965 and the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law of 1988, as amended. 

&#160; 

Bank holding companies are required to file periodic reports with, and are subject to examination by, the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve&#8217;s regulations require a bank holding company to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks. As a result, the Federal Reserve, pursuant to its &#8220;source of strength&#8221; regulations, may require QNB to commit its resources to provide adequate capital funds to the Bank during periods of financial distress or adversity. 

&#160; 

Federal Reserve approval may be required before QNB may begin to engage in any non-banking activity and before any non-banking business may be acquired by QNB. 

&#160; 

Regulatory Restrictions on Dividends 

Dividend payments made by the Bank to the Company are subject to the Pennsylvania Banking Code, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, and the regulations of the FDIC. Under the Banking Code, no dividends may be paid except from &#8220;accumulated net earnings&#8221; (generally retained earnings). The Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC have formal and informal policies which provide that insured banks and bank holding companies should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings, with some exceptions. Under the FDIA, the Bank is prohibited from paying any dividends, making other distributions or paying any management fees if, after such payment, it would fail to satisfy its minimum capital requirements. See also &#8220;Supervision and Regulation &#8211; Bank Regulation&#8221;. 

&#160; 

In addition to the dividend restrictions described above, the banking regulators have the authority to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by the Bank if, in the banking regulator&#8217;s opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the Bank. 

&#160; 

Under Pennsylvania law, QNB may not pay a dividend, if, after giving effect thereto, it would be unable to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business and, after giving effect to the dividend, the total assets of QNB would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed, if QNB were to be dissolved at the time of distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of shareholders whose rights are superior to those receiving the dividend. 

&#160; 

It is also the policy of the Federal Reserve that a bank holding company generally only pay dividends on common stock out of net income available to common shareholders over the past year and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with a bank holding company&#8217;s capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition. In the current financial and economic environment, the Federal Reserve has indicated that bank holding companies should carefully review their dividend policy and has discouraged dividend pay-out ratios at the 100% level unless both asset quality and capital are very strong. A bank holding company also should not maintain a dividend level that places undue pressure on the capital of such institution&#8217;s subsidiaries, or that may undermine the bank holding company&#8217;s ability to serve as a source of strength for such subsidiaries. 

&#160; 

In July 2013, the Federal bank regulatory agencies adopted revisions to the agencies&#8217; capital adequacy guidelines and prompt corrective action rules, which were designed to enhance such requirements and implement the revised standards of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, commonly referred to as Basel III. The final rules generally implemented higher minimum capital requirements, added a new common equity Tier 1 capital requirement, and established criteria that instruments must meet to be considered common equity Tier 1 capital, additional Tier 1 capital or Tier 2 capital. The new minimum capital to risk-adjusted assets requirements are a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5% (6.5% to be considered &#8220;well capitalized&#8221;) and a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, increased from 4.0% (and increased from 6.0% to 8.0% to be considered &#8220;well capitalized&#8221;); the total capital ratio remains at 8.0% under the new rules (10.0% to be considered &#8220;well capitalized&#8221;). Under the new rules, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions (including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers), a banking organization must hold a capital conservation buffer comprised of common equity Tier 1 capital above its minimum risk-based capital requirements in an amount greater than 2.5% of total risk-weighted assets. The new minimum capital requirements are effective on January 1, 2015. The capital contribution buffer requirements phase in over a three-year period beginning January 1, 2016. 

&#160; 

Under these policies and subject to the restrictions applicable to the Bank, to remain &#8220;well-capitalized,&#8221; the Bank had approximately $14,998,000 available for payment of dividends to the Company at December 31, 2015. 

&#160; 

Capital Adequacy 

Bank holding companies are required to comply with the Federal Reserve&#8217;s risk-based capital guidelines. The required minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets (including certain off-balance sheet activities, such as standby letters of credit) is 8%. At least half of total capital must be Tier 1 capital. Tier 1 capital consists principally of common shareholders&#8217; equity, plus retained earnings, less certain intangible assets. The remainder of total capital may consist of the allowance for loan losses, which is considered Tier 2 capital. At December 31, 2015, QNB&#8217;s Tier 1 capital and total capital (Tier 1 and Tier 2 combined) and common equity Tier 1 equity ratios were 11.60% and 12.58%, and 11.60%, respectively. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Bank and thrift holding companies with assets of less than $15 billion as of December 31, 2009, such as the Company, will be permitted to include trust preferred securities that were issued before May 19, 2010, as Tier 1 capital; however, trust preferred securities issued by a bank or thrift holding company (other than those with assets of less than $500 million) after May 19, 2010, will no longer count as Tier 1 capital. Trust preferred securities still will be entitled to be treated as Tier 2 capital. 

&#160; 

In addition to the risk-based capital guidelines, the Federal Reserve requires a bank holding company to maintain a minimum leverage ratio. This requires a minimum level of Tier 1 capital (as determined under the risk-based capital rules) to average total consolidated assets of 4% for those bank holding companies that have the highest regulatory examination ratings and are not contemplating or experiencing significant growth or expansion. The Federal Reserve expects all other bank holding companies to maintain a ratio of at least 1% to 2% above the stated minimum. At December 31, 2015, QNB&#8217;s leverage ratio was 8.87%. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the prompt corrective action provisions of the FDIA, the Federal banking agencies have specified, by regulation, the levels at which an insured institution is considered well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized. Under these regulations, an institution is considered well capitalized if it satisfies each of the following requirements: 

&#160; &#8226; 

Total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or more, 

&#160; &#8226; 

Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8% or more, 

&#160; &#8226; 

Common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.5% or more, 

&#160; &#8226; 

Leverage ratio of 5% or more, and 

&#160; &#8226; 

Not subject to any order or written directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015, the Bank qualified as well capitalized under these regulatory standards. See Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included at Item 8 of this Report for additional information. 

&#160; 

Bank Regulation 

As a Pennsylvania chartered, insured commercial bank, the Bank is subject to extensive regulation and examination by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities (the Department) and by the FDIC, which insures its deposits to the maximum extent permitted by law. 

&#160; 

The Federal and state laws and regulations applicable to banks regulate, among other things, the scope of their business, their investments, the reserves required to be kept against deposits, the timing of the availability of deposited funds, the nature and amount of collateral for certain loans, the activities of a bank with respect to mergers and consolidations, and the establishment of branches. The laws and regulations governing the Bank generally have been promulgated to protect depositors and not for the purpose of protecting QNB&#8217;s shareholders. This regulatory structure also gives the Federal and state banking agencies extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. Any change in such regulation, whether by the Department, the FDIC or the United States Congress, could have a material impact on the Company, the Bank and their operations. 

&#160; 

As a subsidiary bank of a bank holding company, the Bank is subject to certain restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve Act on extensions of credit to QNB, on investments in the stock or other securities of QNB, and on taking such stock or securities as collateral for loans. 

&#160; 

FDIC Insurance Assessments 

The Bank&#8217;s deposits are insured to the applicable limits as determined by the FDIC, which is currently $250,000 per depositor. 

&#160; 

The FDIC has adopted a risk-based premium system that provides for quarterly assessments (billed in arrears) based on an insured institution&#8217;s ranking in one of four risk categories based on their examination ratings and capital ratios. Well-capitalized institutions with the CAMELS ratings of 1 or 2 are grouped in Risk Category I. 

&#160; 

Beginning with the second quarter of 2011, as mandated by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;), the assessment base that the FDIC uses to calculate assessment premiums is a bank&#8217;s average assets minus average tangible equity. As the asset base of the banking industry is larger than the deposit base, the range of assessment rates will be from a low of 2.5 basis points to a high of 45 basis points, per $100 of assets. 

&#160; 

The FDIC is required under the Dodd-Frank Act to establish assessment rates that will allow the Deposit Insurance Fund to achieve a reserve ratio of 1.35% of Insurance Fund insured deposits by September 2020. In addition, the FDIC has established a &#8220;designated reserve ratio&#8221; of 2.0%, a target ratio that, until it is achieved, will not likely result in the FDIC reducing assessment rates. In attempting to achieve the mandated 1.35% ratio, the FDIC is required to implement assessment formulas that charge banks over $10 billion in asset size more than banks under that size. Those new formulas began in the second quarter of 2011, but did not affect the Bank. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC is authorized to make reimbursements from the Insurance Fund to banks if the reserve ratio exceeds 1.50%, but the FDIC has adopted the &#8220;designated reserve ratio&#8221; of 2.0% and has announced that any reimbursements from the fund are indefinitely suspended. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Bank recorded $579,000, $620,000 and $651,000, respectively, in FDIC deposit insurance premium expense. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

In addition, all insured institutions of the FDIC are required to pay assessments to fund interest payments on Financing Corporation (FICO) bonds. The Financing Corporation was created by Congress to issue bonds to finance the resolution of failed thrift institutions. Prior to 1997, only thrift institutions were subject to assessments to raise funds to pay the FICO bonds; however, beginning in 2000, commercial banks and thrifts are subject to the same assessment for FICO bonds. The FDIC has the authority to set the Financing Corporation assessment rate every quarter. The expense for 2015, 2014 and 2013 recorded by QNB was $52,000 $66,000 and $54,000, respectively. These assessments will continue until the Financing Corporation bonds mature from 2017 through 2019. 

&#160; 

Federal Home Loan Bank System 

The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh (FHLB), which is one of 11 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. Each Federal Home Loan Bank serves as a reserve or central bank for members within its assigned region. It is funded primarily from funds deposited by member institutions and proceeds from the sale of consolidated obligations of the Federal Home Loan Bank System. It makes loans to members (i.e. advances) in accordance with policies and procedures established by the board of directors of the Federal Home Loan Bank. At December 31, 2015, the Bank had no overnight FHLB advances outstanding. 

&#160; 

The Bank is required to purchase and maintain stock in the FHLB as a condition of membership in an amount equal to 0.10% of its assets. In addition, each member is required to purchase and maintain activity-based stock of 4% of outstanding advances from the FHLB. At December 31, 2015, the Bank had $496,000 in stock of the FHLB. 

&#160; 

Community Reinvestment Act 

Under the Community Reinvestment Act (&#8220;CRA&#8221;), as amended, the FDIC is required to assess all financial institutions that it regulates to determine whether these institutions are meeting the credit needs of the communities that they serve. The act focuses specifically on low and moderate income neighborhoods. 

&#160; 

An institution&#8217;s record is considered during the evaluation of any application made by such institutions for, among other things: 

&#160; &#8226; 

Approval of a branch or other deposit facility; 

&#160; &#8226; 

An office relocation or a merger; and 

&#160; &#8226; 

Any acquisition of bank shares. 

&#160; 

The CRA, as amended, also requires that the regulatory agency make publicly available the evaluation of the Bank&#8217;s record of meeting the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. This evaluation includes a descriptive rating of either outstanding, satisfactory, needs to improve, or substantial noncompliance, and a statement describing the basis for the rating. The Bank&#8217;s most recent CRA rating was &#8220;Satisfactory&#8221;. 

&#160; 

USA Patriot Act 

The USA Patriot Act strengthens the anti-money laundering provisions of the Bank Secrecy Act. The Act requires financial institutions to establish certain procedures to be able to identify and verify the identity of its customers. Specifically the Bank must have procedures in place to: 

&#160; &#8226; 

Verify the identity of persons applying to open an account; 

&#160; &#8226; 

Ensure adequate maintenance of the records used to verify a person&#8217;s identity; and 

&#160; &#8226; 

Determine whether a person is on any U.S. government agency list of known or suspected terrorists or a terrorist organization. 

&#160; 

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act is intended to bolster public confidence in the nation&#8217;s capital markets by imposing new duties and penalties for non-compliance on public companies and their executives, directors, auditors, attorneys and securities analysts. Some of the more significant aspects of the Act include: 

&#160; &#8226; 

Corporate Responsibility for Financial Reports - requires Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) and Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) to certify certain matters relating to a company&#8217;s financial records and accounting and internal controls. 

&#160; &#8226; 

Management Assessment of Internal Controls - requires auditors to certify the company&#8217;s underlying controls and processes that are used to compile the financial results for companies that are accelerated filers. 

&#160; &#8226; 

Real-time Issuer Disclosures - requires that companies provide real-time disclosures of any events that may affect its stock price or financial performance, generally within a 48-hour period. 

&#160; &#8226; 

Criminal Penalties for Altering Documents - provides severe penalties for &#8220;whoever knowingly alters, destroys, mutilates&#8221; any record or document with intent to impede an investigation. Penalties include monetary fines and prison time. 

&#160; 

The Act also imposes requirements for corporate governance, auditor independence, accounting standards, audit committee member independence and increased authority, executive compensation, insider loans and whistleblower protection. As a result of the Act, QNB adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics applicable to its CEO, CFO and Controller, which meets the requirements of the Act, to supplement its long-standing Code of Ethics, which applies to all directors and employees. 

&#160; 

QNB&#8217;s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics can be found on the Bank&#8217;s website at www.qnbbank.com.

&#160; 

Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act) 

The Dodd-Frank Act was enacted on July 21, 2010. This law made significant changes to the bank regulatory structure and affects the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. 

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Act required various Federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new rules and regulations, and to prepare various studies and reports for Congress. The Federal agencies were given significant discretion in drafting such rules and regulations, and are still modifying many of the provisions. Consequently, many of the details and much of the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act may not be known for some time. 

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Act created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (&#8220;CFPB&#8221;) with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The CFPB has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions, including the authority to prohibit &#8220;unfair, deceptive or abusive&#8221; acts and practices. The CFPB has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than $10 billion in assets. Banks and savings institutions with $10 billion or less in assets such as the Bank will continue to be examined for compliance with the consumer laws by their primary bank regulators. The Dodd-Frank Act also weakened the Federal preemption rules that had been applicable for national banks and Federal savings associations, and gave state attorneys general the ability to enforce Federal consumer protection laws. 

&#160; 

As mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act, in December 2013, the OCC, FRB, FDIC, and SEC issued a final rule implementing certain prohibitions and restrictions on the ability of a banking entity and non-bank financial company supervised by the FRB to engage in proprietary trading and have certain interests in, or relationships with, a hedge fund or private equity fund (the so-called "Volcker Rule"). The final rules also require regulated entities to establish an internal compliance program that is consistent with the extent to which it engages in activities covered by the Volcker Rule, which must include making regular reports about those activities to regulators. Although the final rules provide some compliance and reporting exceptions based on size, the fundamental prohibitions of the Volcker Rule apply to banking entities of any size, including the Company. The final rules were effective April 1, 2014, with an extended effective date of July 2015. Under the final rules implementing the Volcker Rule, financial institutions are prohibited from owning certain covered funds. The Company has reviewed its securities holdings and does not believe that any qualify as impermissible holdings. If future regulatory interpretation requires us to divest of any such investments, it could cause us to recognize unexpected losses on the dispositions. 

&#160; 

Many of the provisions of Dodd-Frank do not apply to the Bank, as it does not engage in many of the specific activities sought to be regulated by Dodd-Frank. Many of the provisions, however, such as the increased capital requirements that began in 2015 and the changes to FDIC insurance premiums already implemented, affected all banking entities. In addition, the financial crisis of 2008 and the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act in response to that crisis has resulted in an era of increased regulatory oversight over all financial entities. The ultimate changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may impact the profitability of our business activities, require changes to certain of our business practices, impose upon us more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage ratio requirements or otherwise adversely affect our business. These changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes in order to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements. 

&#160; 

Possible Future Legislation 

Congress is often considering some financial industry legislation, and the Federal banking agencies routinely propose new regulations. The Company cannot predict the future effect any new legislation, or new rules adopted by Federal or state banking agencies, will have on the business of the Company and its subsidiaries. Given that the financial industry remains under stress and severe scrutiny, and given that the U.S. economy has not yet fully recovered to pre-crisis levels of activity, the Company expects that there will be significant legislation and regulatory actions that may materially affect the banking industry for the foreseeable future. 

&#160;
