 Item 1. 

Business 

Overview 

Evercore is one of the leading independent investment banking advisory firms in the world based on the dollar volume of announced worldwide merger and acquisition ("M&#38;A") transactions on which we have advised since 2000. When we use the term independent investment banking advisory firm, we mean an investment banking firm that directly, or through its affiliates, does not engage in commercial banking or significant proprietary trading activities. We were founded on the belief that there is an opportunity within the investment banking industry for a firm free of the potential conflicts of interest created within large, multi-product capital intensive financial institutions. We believe that maintaining standards of excellence and integrity in our core businesses demands a spirit of cooperation and hands-on participation more commonly found in smaller organizations. Since our inception, we have set out to build&#8212;in the employees we choose and in the projects we undertake&#8212;an organization dedicated to the highest caliber of professionalism and integrity. 

We operate globally through two business segments: 

&#8226; 

Investment Banking; and 

&#8226; 

Investment Management. 

Our Investment Banking segment includes our advisory services, through which we provide advice to clients on significant mergers, acquisitions, divestitures and other strategic corporate transactions, with a particular focus on advising prominent multinational corporations and substantial private equity firms on large, complex transactions. We also provide restructuring advice to companies in financial transition, as well as to creditors, shareholders and potential acquirers. In addition, we provide our clients with capital markets advice relating to both debt and equity securities, we underwrite securities offerings and we raise funds for financial sponsors and advise on secondary transactions for private funds interests. Our Investment Banking segment also includes Evercore ISI services through which we offer equity research and agency-only securities sales and trading for institutional investors. 

Our Investment Management segment focuses on Institutional Asset Management, through which we manage financial assets for sophisticated institutional investors and provide independent fiduciary services to corporate employee benefit plans; Wealth Management, through which we provide wealth management services for high net-worth individuals; and Private Equity, through which we manage private equity funds. Each of these businesses is led by senior investment professionals with extensive experience in their respective fields. 

Investment Banking 

At December 31, 2015 , our Investment Banking segment had 79 Advisory Senior Managing Directors with expertise and client relationships in a wide variety of industry sectors and broad geographic reach, as well as 88 senior research and distribution professionals in Evercore ISI. 

In 2015 , our Investment Banking segment generated $1.134 billion , or 92% &#32;of our revenues, excluding Other Revenue, net, ($821.4 million, or 89%, in 2014 and $666.8 million, or 87%, in 2013) and earned advisory fees from 484 &#32;client transactions. 

Advisory 

We provide confidential, strategic and tactical advice to both public and private companies, with a particular focus on large, multinational corporations, as well as for select institutional investors and government institutions. By virtue of their prominence, size and sophistication, many of our clients are more likely to require expertise relating to larger and more complex situations. We are advising or have advised on numerous noteworthy transactions during the past three years, including:

Our approach is to work as a trusted senior advisor to top corporate officers and boards of directors, helping them devise strategies for enhancing shareholder value: 

&#8226; 

Objective Advice with a Long-Term Perspective . We seek to recommend shareholder value enhancement strategies or other financial strategies that we would pursue ourselves were we acting in management&#8217;s capacity. This approach often includes advising our clients against pursuing transactions that we believe do not meet that standard. 

&#8226; 

Transaction Excellence . Since the beginning of 2000, we have advised on over $2.0 trillion of announced transactions, including acquisitions, sale processes, mergers of equals, special committee advisory assignments, recapitalizations and restructurings. 

&#8226; 

Senior Level Attention and Experience . The Senior Managing Directors in our advisory business participate in all facets of client interaction, from the initial evaluation phase to the final stage of executing our recommendations. 

We advise clients in a number of different situations across many industries and geographies, each of which may require various services: 

&#8226; 

Mergers and Acquisitions . When we advise companies about the potential acquisition of another company or certain assets, our services include evaluating potential acquisition targets, providing valuation analyses, evaluating and proposing financial and strategic alternatives and rendering, if appropriate, fairness opinions. We also may advise as to the timing, structure, financing and pricing of a proposed acquisition and assist in negotiating and closing the acquisition. 

&#8226; 

Divestitures and Sale Transactions . When we advise clients that are contemplating the sale of certain businesses, assets or their entire company, our services include evaluating and recommending financial and strategic alternatives with respect to a sale, advising on valuation issues and the appropriate sales process for the situation, assisting in 

preparing an offering memorandum or other appropriate sales materials and rendering, if appropriate, fairness opinions. We also identify and contact selected qualified acquirers and assist in negotiating and closing the sale. 

&#8226; 

Special Committee and Fairness Opinion Assignments . We are well known for our independence, quality and thoroughness and devoting senior-level attention throughout the project lifecycle. We believe our objectivity, integrity and discretion allow us to provide an unbiased perspective. 

&#8226; 

Restructuring . We provide financial advice and investment banking services to companies in financial transition, as well as to creditors, shareholders and potential acquirers. Our services may include reviewing and analyzing the business, financial condition and prospects of the company or providing advice on strategic transactions, capital raising or restructurings. We also may provide advisory services to companies that have sought or are planning to seek protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or other similar processes in non-U.S. jurisdictions. 

&#8226; 

Capital Markets . We serve as an objective advisor to corporations and financial sponsors on a broad array of financing issues. We have developed an expertise in assisting clients with respect to the entire spectrum of capital structure decisions. In addition, we act as an underwriter in public offerings and private placements of debt and equity securities in the U.S. and internationally. 

&#8226; 

Private Funds . We advise fund sponsors in the U.S. and internationally on all aspects of the fundraising process and have expanded our platform to include advising on secondary transactions for private funds interests. 

We strive to earn repeat business from our clients. However, we operate in a highly competitive environment in which there are no long-term contracted sources of revenue. Each revenue-generating engagement is separately negotiated and awarded. To develop new client relationships and to develop new engagements from historical client relationships, we maintain an active dialogue with a large number of clients and potential clients, as well as with their financial and legal advisors, on an ongoing basis. We have gained new clients each year through our business development initiatives, through recruiting additional senior professionals who bring with them client relationships and through referrals from directors, attorneys and other third parties with whom we have relationships. 

Equities 

Evercore ISI's leading analysts and distribution organization provides fundamental, macroeconomic and policy research and transaction execution excellence to the largest and most significant institutional and sovereign investors globally. 

&#8226; 

Equity Research . &#160; Our research analysts perform research to help our clients understand the dynamics that drive the industries and companies under coverage. We seek to differentiate ourselves through originality of perspective, depth of insight and ability to uncover industry trends. Our research analysts cover major industry developments, publish research on industry sectors, provide fundamental, company-specific coverage and identify and evaluate investment opportunities in publicly-traded companies. 

&#8226; 

Institutional Sales and Trading . Our professionals provide equity and listed option securities sales and trading services to institutional investors and seek to develop strong relationships with the portfolio managers and traders they serve by working closely with our equity research professionals. 

Investment Management 

Our Investment Management segment includes Institutional Asset Management, in the United States through Evercore Trust Company, N.A. ("ETC"), Atalanta Sosnoff Capital, LLC ("Atalanta Sosnoff") and ABS Investment Management, LLC ("ABS") and in Mexico through Evercore Casa de Bolsa, S.A. de C.V. ("ECB"); Wealth Management, through Evercore Wealth Management ("EWM") and G5 Holdings S.A. ("G5 &#448; Evercore"); personal trust services through Evercore Trust Company of Delaware, established in 2016; and Private Equity. Our Investment Management business principally manages and invests capital on behalf of third parties, including a broad range of institutional investors such as corporate and public pension funds, endowments, foundations, insurance companies, family offices and high net-worth individuals. Our Investment Management business is led by highly-experienced Portfolio and Client Relationship Managers. 

In 2015 , our Investment Management segment generated revenue of $95.1 million &#32;or 8% &#32;of our revenues, excluding Other Revenue, net, ($98.8 million, or 11%, in 2014 and $95.8 million, or 13%, in 2013). As of December 31, 2015 , we had $8.2 billion &#32;of assets under management ("AUM"), excluding any AUM from our non-consolidated affiliates, of which $1.7 billion &#32;was attributable to Institutional Asset Management, $6.2 billion &#32;was attributable to Wealth Management and $0.3 billion &#32;was attributable to Private Equity clients. 

Institutional Asset Management 

Within our Institutional Asset Management business, ETC provides specialized investment management, independent fiduciary and trustee services and ECB primarily manages Mexican fixed income products and offers fiduciary and trust services. Atalanta Sosnoff manages large-capitalization U.S. equity and balanced products and ABS is an institutionally focused hedge fund-of-funds manager. Atalanta Sosnoff and ABS are each investments reported on the equity method of accounting. 

Wealth Management 

Wealth Management provides services through EWM and G5 &#448; Evercore and personal trust services through Evercore Trust Company of Delaware, established in 2016. EWM targets clients with more than $5 million in investable assets and offers services such as investment policy creation, asset allocation, customized investment management, manager selection, performance reporting and financial planning. 

Private Equity 

Private Equity manages value-oriented, middle-market private equity funds in Mexico. The Company previously managed funds in the U.S. While we do not intend to raise Evercore-sponsored successor funds in the United States or Europe, we maintain a strategic alliance to pursue private equity investment opportunities with Trilantic Capital Partners ("Trilantic"). 

In connection with the issuance of certain limited partnership interests in Trilantic, the Company became a limited partner of Trilantic and is entitled to receive 10% of the aggregate amount of carried interest in respect to all of the portfolio investments made by Trilantic IV, up to $15.0 million. The Company and its affiliates are passive investors and do not participate in the management of any Trilantic-sponsored funds. Trilantic also agreed to pay an annual fee to the Company equal to $2.0 million per year for a period of five years, ending in 2014, as consideration for services to be performed by the Company. In addition, as part of the strategic alliance, the Company agreed to commit $5.0 million of the total capital commitments of Trilantic Capital Partners V L.P. ("Trilantic V"). 

Our Strategies for Growth 

We intend to continue to grow and diversify our businesses, and to further enhance our profile and competitive position, through the following strategies: 

&#8226; 

Add Highly Qualified Investment Banking Professionals with Industry and Product Expertise . We hired 10 new Senior Managing Directors in 2015, expanding our capabilities in the U.S. and Europe and increasing our presence in Technology, Healthcare, Energy, and Power and Utilities. We intend to continue to recruit high-caliber advisory, capital markets advisory, funds placement, research and distribution professionals to add depth in industry sectors and products and services in areas that we believe we already have strength, and to extend our reach to sectors or new business lines we have identified as particularly attractive. On occasion these additions result from the acquisition of boutique independent advisory firms with leading professionals in a market or sector. 

&#8226; 

Achieve Organic Growth and Improved Profitability in Investment Management . We are focused on managing our current Investment Management business towards growth and improved profitability. We also continue to selectively evaluate opportunities to expand Wealth Management. 

&#8226; 

Expand In New Geographic Markets. We are expanding in new geographic markets where we believe the business environment will be receptive to the strengths of our Investment Banking business model or where we believe our clients have or may develop a significant presence. Our expansion in Germany, Spain and Singapore, as well as our advisory affiliates and alliances in Brazil, Japan, China, South Korea, India and Australia, represent important steps in this strategy. We are actively seeking to strengthen, expand and deepen these alliances. We may hire groups of talented professionals or pursue additional strategic acquisitions or alliances with highly-regarded regional or local firms whose cultures and operating principles are similar to ours. 

Results by Segment and Geographic Location 

See Note 22 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our segment results and the geographic areas from which we derive our revenues. 

People 

As of December 31, 2015 , we employed approximately 1,400 people worldwide. Our senior professionals play a significant role in driving growth and are measured by their productivity either through revenue per Advisory Senior Managing 

Director or other metrics including asset growth for Portfolio and Client Relationship Managers. None of our employees are subject to any collective bargaining agreements, and we believe we have good relations with our employees. 

As a leading independent investment banking firm, our core asset is our professional staff, including their intellectual capital and their dedication to providing the highest quality services to our clients. Prior to joining Evercore, many of our Advisory Senior Managing Directors, Senior Research and Sales and Trading Professionals and Portfolio and Client Relationship Managers held senior level positions with other leading corporations, financial services firms or investment firms. 

Competition 

The financial services industry is intensely competitive, and we expect it to remain so. Our competitors are other investment banking, financial advisory and investment management firms. We compete both globally and on a regional, product or niche basis. We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including transaction execution skills, investment performance, quality of equity research, our range of products and services, innovation, reputation and price. 

Evercore is predominantly an independent investment banking advisory firm, and its competitors can be categorized into three main groups: (1) large universal banks and bulge bracket firms such as Bank of America, Barclays, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and UBS, (2) independent advisory firms such as Lazard and Rothschild and (3) boutiques, such as Centerview, Greenhill, Moelis, Perella Weinberg and PJT Partners, among others. We believe, and our clients have informed us, that firms which also engage in acquisition financing, significant proprietary trading in clients&#8217; securities and the management of large private equity funds that often compete with clients can cause such firms to develop interests that may be in conflict with the interests of advisory clients. Since Evercore is able to avoid potential conflicts associated with these types of activities, we believe that Evercore is better able to develop more trusted and long-term relationships with its clients than those of its competitors which provide such services. In addition, we have a larger global presence and deeper sector expertise than many of the boutiques. Evercore ISI's business is also subject to competition from investment banks and other large and small financial institutions who offer similar services. 

We believe that we face a range of competitors in our Investment Management business, with numerous other firms providing competitive services in each of our sectors. In Institutional Asset Management, each of Atalanta Sosnoff, ABS, ECB and ETC face substantial competition from a large number of asset management and trust companies, many of which are larger, more established firms with greater brand name recognition and more extensive client networks and product offerings. Wealth Management competes with domestic and global private banks, regional broker-dealers, independent broker-dealers, registered investment advisors, commercial banks, trust companies and other financial services firms offering wealth management services to clients, many of which have substantially greater resources and offer a broader range of services. In Private Equity, our competition includes private equity funds of all sizes. 

Competition is also intense for the attraction and retention of qualified employees. Our ability to continue to compete effectively in our businesses will depend upon our ability to attract new employees and retain and motivate our existing employees. 

Regulation 

United States 

Our business, as well as the financial services industry generally, is subject to extensive regulation in the United States and elsewhere. As a matter of public policy, regulatory bodies in the United States and the rest of the world are charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and with protecting the interests of customers participating in those markets. In the United States, the SEC is the federal agency responsible for the administration of the federal securities laws. Evercore Group L.L.C. ("EGL"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours through which we conduct our investment banking business, is registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA"), and is registered as a broker-dealer in various states and the District of Columbia. EGL is subject to regulation and oversight by the SEC. FINRA, a self-regulatory organization that is subject to oversight by the SEC, adopts and enforces rules governing the conduct, and examines the activities, of its member firms, including EGL. The SEC, FINRA, and regulators in various non-U.S. jurisdictions impose both conduct-based and disclosure-based requirements with respect to research reports and research analysts. State securities regulators also have regulatory or oversight authority over EGL. On December 31, 2015, the operations of International Strategy &#38; Investment Group L.L.C. were transferred to EGL. The Private Funds Group is impacted by various state and local regulations that restrict or prohibit the use of placement agents in connection with 

investments by public pension funds, including regulations in New York, Illinois, Ohio, California and New Mexico. Similar measures are being considered or have been implemented in other jurisdictions. 

Broker-dealers are subject to regulations that cover all aspects of the securities business, including sales methods, trade practices, use and safekeeping of customers&#8217; funds and securities, capital structure, record-keeping, the financing of customers&#8217; purchases and the conduct and qualifications of directors, officers and employees. In particular, as a registered broker-dealer and member of a self-regulatory organization, we are subject to the SEC&#8217;s uniform net capital rule, Rule 15c3-1. Rule 15c3-1 specifies the minimum level of net capital a broker-dealer must maintain and also requires that a significant part of a broker-dealer&#8217;s assets be kept in relatively liquid form. The SEC and various self-regulatory organizations impose rules that require notification when net capital falls below certain predefined criteria, limit the ratio of subordinated debt to equity in the regulatory capital composition of a broker-dealer and constrain the ability of a broker-dealer to expand its business under certain circumstances. Additionally, the SEC&#8217;s uniform net capital rule imposes certain requirements that may have the effect of prohibiting a broker-dealer from distributing or withdrawing capital and requiring prior notice to the SEC for certain withdrawals of capital. EGL is also subject to the SEC's Market Access Rule, Rule 15c3-5. The Market Access Rule requires EGL to have controls and procedures in place to limit financial exposure caused by having direct market access. Our broker-dealer subsidiaries are also subject to regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the "Patriot Act"), which impose obligations regarding the prevention and detection of money-laundering activities, including the establishment of customer due diligence and other compliance policies and procedures. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in monetary, regulatory and, in certain cases, criminal penalties. 

We are also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits offering, promising, giving, or authorizing others to give anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to a non-U.S. government official in order to influence official action or otherwise gain an unfair business advantage, such as to obtain or retain business. 

Three of our affiliates, EWM, ABS and Atalanta Sosnoff, are registered as investment advisors with the SEC. Registered investment advisors are subject to the requirements and regulations of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Such requirements relate to, among other things, fiduciary duties to clients, maintaining an effective compliance program, solicitation agreements, conflicts of interest, recordkeeping and reporting requirements, disclosure requirements, limitations on agency cross and principal transactions between an advisor and advisory clients, state and local political contributions, as well as general anti-fraud prohibitions. EWM is also an investment advisor to a mutual fund, which subjects EWM to additional regulations under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act"). ETC, which is limited to fiduciary activities, is regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC"), is a member bank of the Federal Reserve System and is subject to the Patriot Act and to the state laws in the jurisdictions in which it operates. Evercore Trust Company of Delaware ("ETCDE"), established in 2016, is a limited purpose trust company regulated by the Office of the Delaware State Bank Commissioner. ETCDE is subject to the rules and regulations applicable to limited purpose trust companies operating in Delaware. 

Mexico 

ECB is authorized by the Mexican Ministry of Finance to act as a broker-dealer and financial advisor in accordance with the Mexican Securities Market Law. ECB is subject to regulation and oversight by the Mexican Ministry of Finance and the Mexican National Banking and Securities Commission, including the maintenance of minimum capital requirements. In addition, the Mexican Broker Dealer Association, a self-regulatory organization that is subject to oversight by the Mexican National Banking and Securities Commission, adopts and enforces rules governing the conduct, and examines the activities of, its member broker-dealers, including ECB. ECB has been authorized by the Mexican National Banking and Securities Commission to act as a trustee and to operate in the equity markets. 

United Kingdom 

Authorization by the Financial Conduct Authority ("FCA") . The FCA is responsible for regulating Evercore Partners International LLP ("Evercore UK") and International Strategy &#38; Investment (UK) Limited ("ISI UK"), the London vehicle of the recently acquired ISI business. The Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 ("FSMA") is the basis for the UK&#8217;s financial services regulatory regime. FSMA is supported by secondary legislation and other rules made under FSMA, including the FCA Handbook of Rules and Guidance. A key FSMA provision is section 19, which contains a "general prohibition" against any person carrying on a "regulated activity" (or purporting to do so) in the UK unless he is an authorized or exempt person. It is a criminal offense to breach this general prohibition and certain agreements made in breach may not be enforceable. The "regulated activities" are set out in the FSMA (Regulated Activities) Order 2001 (as amended). Evercore UK is authorized to carry out regulated activities including: advising on investments; arranging (bringing about) deals in investments and making arrangements with a view to transactions in investments. ISI UK is also authorized to carry out these activities and, additionally, 

is authorized to carry out the regulated activity of dealing in investments as agent. As UK authorized persons, Evercore UK and ISI UK are subject to the FCA&#8217;s high level principles for businesses, conduct of business obligations and organizational requirements. The FCA has extensive powers to supervise and intervene in the affairs of the firms. It can take a range of disciplinary enforcement actions, including public censure, restitution, fines or sanctions and the award of compensation. 

FSMA also has a civil penalty regime for market abuse, supplemented by the FCA's Code of Market Conduct, which exists independently of a separate criminal regime for insider dealing. The civil regime implements the Market Abuse Directive ("MAD") in the UK. MAD is being replaced by a new Markets Abuse Regulation ("MAR"), which will expand and develop the existing EU market abuse regime. MAR will apply from July 3, 2016. 

Regulatory Capital . Regulatory capital requirements form an integral part of the FCA&#8217;s prudential supervision of FCA authorized firms. The regulatory capital rules oblige firms to hold a certain amount of capital at all times (taking into account the particular risks to which the firm may be exposed given its business activities), thereby helping to ensure that firms can meet their liabilities as they fall due and safeguarding their (and their counterparties&#8217;) financial stability. The FCA also expects firms to take a proactive approach to monitoring and managing risks, consistent with its high level requirement for firms to have adequate financial resources. However, as a so-called "exempt-CAD firm", Evercore UK is subject only to limited minimum capital requirements. ISI UK is a so-called "BIPRU investment firm". As a result, it is potentially subject to a greater minimum regulatory capital requirement, currently based on its annual fixed expenditure (its "fixed overhead requirement"). The FCA may impose a higher capital requirement than the minimum requirement on BIPRU investment firms. 

Anti-Money Laundering, Counter-Terrorist Financing and Anti-Bribery . The Money Laundering Regulations 2007 came into force on December 15, 2007 and implement the Third EU Money Laundering Directive ("MLD 3"). The MLD 3 harmonizes standards across the EU with higher-level, risk-based requirements and require relevant firms to have procedures in place to prevent money laundering and to take a risk-based approach to focus the efforts where they are most needed. This approach includes client due diligence, monitoring, staff training and awareness. Failure to maintain the necessary procedures is a criminal offense. The Fourth EU Money Laundering Directive (&#8220;MLD 4&#8221;), which entered into force on June 25, 2015 amends and replaces MLD 3. MLD 4 is designed to reinforce the efficacy of EU law in countering money laundering and terrorist financing and to ensure that the EU framework is aligned with the International Standards on Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism and Proliferation adopted by the Financial Action Task Force's anti-money in 2012. Member states are required to bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with MLD 4 by June 26, 2017 although the Commission of the European Union has called on member states to agree to bring forward the date for effective transposition and application of MLD 4 to the fourth quarter of 2016. The Commission has also announced that it intends to publish a legislative proposal with amendments to MLD 4 by the second quarter of 2016. 

The Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and the Terrorism Act 2000 also contain a number of offenses in relation to money laundering and terrorist financing, respectively. Evercore UK, ISI UK (and potentially other Evercore entities with a &#8216;close connection&#8217; to the UK) are also subject to the UK Bribery Act 2010 which came into force on July 1, 2011. It provides for criminal penalties for bribery of, or receipt of a bribe from, public officials, corporations and individuals, as well as for the failure of an organization to prevent a person with whom it is associated from providing bribes for the organization&#8217;s benefit. 

Regulatory Framework in the European Union . Both Evercore UK and ISI UK have obtained the appropriate European investment services passport rights to provide cross-border services into a number of other members of the European Economic Area ("EEA"). Evercore UK has also obtained a passport to provide specific investment services from a Spanish branch. These "passports" derive from the pan-European regime established by the EU Markets in Financial Instruments Directive ("MiFID"), which regulates the provision of investment services and activities throughout the EEA. MiFID provides investment firms which are authorized in any one EEA member state the right to provide investment services on a cross-border basis, or through the establishment of a branch to clients located in other EEA member states (known as "host member states") on the basis of their home member state authorization without the need for separate authorization by the competent authorities in the relevant host member state. This practice is known as "passporting". 

MiFID has been recast and replaced with a new directive ("MiFID 2") and a new Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation ("MiFIR"). Among the measures introduced by MiFID 2 and MiFIR are enhanced investor protection and conduct of business rules. One aspect of the enhanced conduct of business rules is stricter restrictions on investment firms making or receiving so-called "inducements" including dealing (or broker) commissions. MiFID 2 and MiFIR also introduce a harmonized regime for access by non-European firms to the EU investment services market. This could impact the ability of Evercore entities outside of Europe to provide investment services within Europe. Both MiFID 2 and MiFIR entered into force on July 2, 2014 and must generally be applied by member states by January 3, 2017 (although this application date is expected to be postponed by at least one year). 

Hong Kong 

In Hong Kong, the Securities and Futures Commission ("SFC") regulates our subsidiary, Evercore Asia Limited ("Evercore Asia"). The compliance requirements of the SFC include, among other things, net capital requirements and stockholders&#8217; equity requirements. The SFC regulates the activities of the officers, directors, employees and other persons affiliated with Evercore Asia, and require the registration of such persons. 

Singapore 

In Singapore, corporate finance advisory activities are regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore ("MAS") and subject to licensing requirements. Evercore Asia (Singapore) Pte. Ltd. maintains a Capital Market Services license issued by the MAS for dealing in securities and advising on corporate finance matters. 

General 

Certain of our businesses are subject to compliance with laws and regulations of U.S. federal and state governments, non-U.S. governments, their respective agencies and/or various self-regulatory organizations or exchanges relating to, among other things, the privacy of client information, and any failure to comply with these regulations could expose us to liability and/or reputational damage. Additional legislation, changes in rules promulgated by financial authorities and self-regulatory organizations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules, either in the United States or elsewhere, may directly affect our mode of operation and profitability. 

The U.S. and non-U.S. government agencies and self-regulatory organizations, as well as state securities commissions in the United States and Mexican Financial Authorities, are empowered to conduct periodic examinations and initiate administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fine, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders or the suspension or expulsion of a regulated entity or its directors, officers or employees.
