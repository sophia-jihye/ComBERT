Our Current Business 

&#160;

We are a development stage company incorporated for the purposes of building family waterparks in a state-of-the-art designed aquatic center in several locations throughout the Hawaiian Islands, with a vision to expand to other U.S. prime visitor destinations. Appealing to both local families and visitors alike, we will provide people with a park that includes water rides, pools, including a wave-machine surf pool, a lazy river, zipline, retail store, bar and restaurant.

&#160;

We hope to be able to deliver some of the longest and most exciting rides in the industry. We will create a sustainable and green design (following LEED guidelines), using solar power wherever possible; utilizing natural water supplies and the unique topography and native plants of the Hawaiian Islands to create a one-of-a-kind water park. During the holiday season from November 1 to January 31, the waterpark will also feature a winter-themed area to focus on the holiday celebrations.

Emerging Growth Company 

&#160;

We are an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. We shall continue to be deemed an emerging growth company until the earliest of:

&#160;

1. The last day of the fiscal year of the issuer during which it had total annual gross revenues of $1,000,000,000 (as such amount is indexed for inflation every 5 years by the Commission to reflect the change in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, setting the threshold to the nearest 1,000,000) or more; &#160;

&#160;

2. The last day of the fiscal year of the issuer following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common equity securities of the issuer pursuant to an effective IPO registration statement; &#160;

&#160;

3. The date on which such issuer has, during the previous 3-year period, issued more than $1,000,000,000 in non- convertible debt; or &#160;

&#160;

4. The date on which such issuer is deemed to be a 'large accelerated filer', as defined in section 240.12b-2 of title 46, Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor thereto. 

&#160;

As an emerging growth company, we are exempt from Section 404(b) of Sarbanes Oxley. Section 404(a) requires issuers to publish information in their annual reports concerning the scope and adequacy of the internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting. This statement shall also assess the effectiveness of such internal controls and procedures. Section 404(b) requires that the registered accounting firm shall, in the same report, attest to and report on the assessment and the effectiveness of the internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting.

&#160;

As an emerging growth company, we are also exempt from Section 14A (a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which require the shareholder approval of executive compensation and golden parachutes. These exemptions are also available to us as a Smaller Reporting Company.

&#160;

We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of the Jobs Act, that allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.

&#160;

Principal Products, Services and Their Markets 

&#160;

We will provide a Hawaiian-themed water park for visitors and local residents, starting in the Hawaiian islands on Kauai and Maui, and expanding to Seattle, WA, Portland, OR, San Francisco, CA, Los Angeles, CA and San Diego, CA. Additional services will include retail sales, bars and restaurants, and hosting events. Waterpark features will include pool areas, rides, a surfing machine, family entertainment, a fast food and beverage outlet, a full-service restaurant, and retail store. In November 2014, a feasibility study determining market demand and financial feasibility for Kauai and Maui outdoor waterparks was completed. It was recommended that a larger park than originally planned be built to accommodate the local population, as well as visitors to the islands. Because the park location is on an island and cannot sustain operations with only local business, a larger park will appeal to visitors, but will also cost more to build, manage and maintain.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

There are three competitors located in Hawai&#8217;i that provide the same services we propose to provide. Wet&#8216;n Wild, a well-known waterpark center, is located on the island of Oahu and has been established on the island since 1999. Two hotels (Grand Wailea Hotel on Maui and Hilton Waikoloa Village on the Big Island) offer similar water park features such as water slides, free-form pools and lazy rivers. In addition to well-known, established competitors, the high cost of building and operating amusement parks, including utilities, employee pay and benefits, taxes, insurance, marketing expenses, administrative expenses, food, beverage, clothing for sale and ongoing maintenance is also a high barrier to entry in this industry.

Certificate of inspection is attached to rides after each inspection. (http://labor.hawaii.gov/hiosh/boilers-elevators-amusement-rides).
