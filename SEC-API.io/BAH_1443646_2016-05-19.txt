Business 

Overview 

Booz Allen Hamilton is a leading provider of management and technology, consulting, and engineering services to the U.S. and international governments, major corporations, and not-for-profit organizations. A steadfast organization in a constantly evolving market, we remain focused on the long term with investments in capabilities, markets, and talent to ensure our ability to provide clients with solutions to their ever changing challenges. Our people are problem solvers whose ideas are inspired by the missions of our clients and the communities in which we live and work. This is our heritage, and it is as true today as when the company was founded in 1914. 

A collaborative culture is an integral part of our unique operating model, which encourages our people to bring a diversity of the best talents to every client engagement as we help solve their most challenging problems. Building on our legacy of innovative client service and guided by our comprehensive strategy - Vision 2020 - we are positioning for our next century by blending deep expertise in management consulting with advanced technical capabilities to deliver end-to-end solutions. By investing in markets, capabilities, and talent and building new business models, including ventures, partnerships, and product offerings, we believe we are creating sustainable quality growth for the company. 

Our ability to deliver value to our clients has always been, and continues to be, a product of the character and expertise of our people. Our talent base of approximately 22,600 &#32;employees deliver value and results to our clients by combining core consulting skills and domain expertise with functional expertise in areas such as engineering and science, systems delivery, cyber, and analytics, all fostered by a culture of innovation that extends to all reaches of the company. 

Through our dedication to our clients' missions, and a commitment to evolving our business to address client needs, we have longstanding and deep relationships with our clients -- some more than 75 years. We support critical missions for a diverse base of federal government clients, including nearly all of the U.S. government's cabinet-level departments, and federal contract vehicles, as well as increasingly for top-tier commercial and international clients. We support these clients by addressing complex and pressing challenges such as combating global terrorism, improving cyber capabilities, transforming the healthcare system, improving efficiency and managing change within the government. Our U.S. commercial clients are primarily in the financial services, healthcare and life sciences, energy, high-tech manufacturing, retail, and automotive industries. Our international clients are primarily in the Middle East, along with a new and growing presence in Southeast Asia. 

&#32;History and Corporate Structure 

We were founded in 1914 by Edwin Booz, one of the pioneers of management consulting. In 1940, we began serving the U.S. government by advising the Secretary of the Navy in preparation for World War II. As the needs of our clients have grown more complex, we have expanded beyond our management consulting foundation to develop deep expertise in the fields of engineering and science, systems delivery, cyber, and analytics. 

We are organized and operate as a corporation. Our use of the term &#8220;partnership&#8221; reflects our collaborative culture, and our use of the term &#8220;partner&#8221; refers to our Chief Executive Officer and our Senior and Executive Vice Presidents. The use of the terms &#8220;partnership&#8221; and &#8220;partner&#8221; is not meant to create any implication that we operate our company as, or have any intention to create a legal entity that is, a partnership. 

Booz Allen Holding was incorporated in Delaware in May 2008 to serve as the top-level holding company for the consolidated Booz Allen Hamilton U.S. government consulting business. On July 31, 2008, Booz Allen Hamilton completed the separation of its U.S. government consulting business from its legacy commercial and international consulting business, the spin off of the commercial and international business, and the sale of 100% of its outstanding common stock to Booz Allen Holding, which was majority owned by The Carlyle Group and certain of its affiliated investment funds, or Carlyle. Our company is a corporation that is the successor to the U.S. government consulting business of Booz Allen Hamilton following the separation. The aforementioned transactions are referred to in this Annual Report as the acquisition. 

Our Institution and Operating Model 

We operate as a single profit/loss center with a single bonus pool for Partners, Vice Presidents, Principals, and Senior Associates. Our operating model also encourages and enables continuous investment in the right markets, capabilities, and talent to position the company for further growth by anticipating what government and commercial clients will need next. Through our unique operating model, which is designed to encourage collaboration across the company, and our partnership-style culture, we bring a mix of the best talent to every client engagement. As a result, we are able to go to market as a whole firm rather than as a collection of individual competing business units or profit centers. This commitment to teamwork is deeply ingrained in our company and our partnership-style culture is critical to maintaining this feature of our operating model. 

Across all markets, we address our clients&#8217; complex and evolving needs by deploying teams of staff with a combination of deep mission understanding, market-leading functional capabilities, consulting talent, and true technical and engineering expertise. Our multifaceted client-facing teams, which are fundamental to our differentiated value proposition, better position us to create market-relevant growth strategies and plan for and meet current, future, and prospective market needs, and help us identify and deliver against diverse client needs in a more agile manner. Our significant win rates during fiscal year 2016 on new and re-competed contracts of 62% and 88%, respectively, demonstrate the strength of this approach.

Our Long - Term Growth Strategy 

Vision 2020 is a comprehensive strategy to transform Booz Allen and create sustainable quality growth for the company. Fiscal year 2016 was the third year of implementing the strategy, but its design reaches back to before the government market began to contract in 2011-2012. We anticipated the market downturn and set in place a strategy that would allow us to emerge in a strong position vis-&#224;-vis our competitors. Under Vision 2020, we are: 

&#8226; 

Increasing our capacity to serve as an essential partner to clients through a combination of deep domain understanding, market-leading consulting expertise, and broader technical capabilities; 

&#8226; 

Investing heavily in advanced technical capabilities, including engineering, systems delivery, cyber, and analytics; 

&#8226; 

Pursuing an innovation agenda that has produced new solutions, new business partners and alliances, and a reinvigorated culture of innovation inside the company; 

&#8226; 

Expanding into the commercial and international markets; and 

&#8226; 

Building distinctive business and people models to support growth. 

The success of our strategy can be seen in recent contract wins, strong performance in the commercial and international markets, and Booz Allen&#8217;s return to revenue growth in fiscal year 2016. We have won highly technical, mission-critical work across our federal government business because we bring differentiated offerings that meet our clients&#8217; toughest challenges. For example, we are helping to identify and mitigate global threats, protecting critical networks and infrastructure against cyber-attacks, creating systems to collect and distribute health records and insurance data, enhancing real-time battle information for warfighters, and ensuring the effective operation of the nation&#8217;s tax collection process. We have experienced growth in our U.S. commercial market and in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, have established a new presence in Singapore, and have executed against our capability focused acquisition strategy, most recently via the acquisition of the software services unit of the Charleston, SC technology firm SPARC, LLC in November 2015 to enhance our agile software development capabilities. 

As we enter fiscal year 2017, we are focused on further operationalizing our strategy by deploying our functional and innovation service offerings more broadly and deeply across our client base and building scale in well-defined growth areas. 

Our Clients 

Through our commitment to client success, we have fostered strong client relationships with a diverse client base of government, commercial, and international clients. We believe that the U.S. government is the world's largest consumer of management and technology consulting services. The U.S. government's budget for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 was close to $3.9 trillion, excluding authorizations from Overseas Contingency Operations and supplemental funding for the Department of Defense. Of this amount, approximately $1.1 trillion was for discretionary budget authority, including $623 billion for the Department of Defense and Intelligence Community and $563 billion for civil agencies. Based on data from the Federal Procurement Data System, approximately $438 billion of the U.S. government's fiscal year 2015 discretionary outlays were non-intelligence agency funding-related products and services procured from private contractors. We estimate that $112 billion of the spending directed towards private contractors in U.S. government fiscal year 2015 was for management, technology, and engineering services, with $63.3 billion spent by the Department of Defense and $49.4 billion spent by civil agencies. The agencies of the U.S. Intelligence Community that we serve represent an additional market. These numbers also exclude a large addressable market for our services and capabilities in the commercial and international markets where we have a modest but growing footprint. 

We have strong and longstanding relationships with a diverse group of clients at all levels of the U.S. government. During fiscal 2016 , we derived 97% &#32;of our revenue from services under more than 5,100 contracts and task orders. The revenue was generated from contracts where the end client was an agency or department of the U.S. government, including contracts where Booz Allen performed in either a prime or subcontract position, and regardless of the geographic location in which the work was performed. The single largest entity that we served in fiscal 2016 &#32;was the U.S. Army, which represented approximately 15% of our revenue in that period. We derived 90% &#32;of our revenue in fiscal 2016 &#32;from engagements for which we acted as the prime contractor.

Defense Clients 

Our reputation and track record in serving the U.S. military and defense agencies spans more than 75 years, starting with the U.S. Navy in WWII, and over that time we have provided a broad range of capabilities to our defense clients. Revenue generated from defense clients was $2.6 billion, or approximately 48.3% of our revenue in fiscal 2016 &#32;as compared to $2.6 billion, or approximately 49.6% of our revenue in fiscal 2015 . Our defense work spans a full spectrum of services and solutions, providing strategy and technology expertise in systems engineering; personnel and mission readiness; integration and interoperability; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; and cyber security, among others. Our key defense clients include the Army, Navy/Marine Corps, Air Force, and Joint Combatant Commands. Revenue generated from defense clients also includes foreign military sales to non U.S. government clients. 

Foreign military sales to non U.S. government clients has been realigned from global commercial revenue to defense revenue in fiscal 2016. Fiscal 2015 revenue for both global commercial and defense has been revised to reflect the new alignment. 

Intelligence Clients 

We have provided the government agencies and organizations that carry out national security and intelligence activities for the U.S. government with a wide range of services and capabilities for over 30 years. This critical business area requires specialized expertise and high-level security clearances. Revenue generated from intelligence clients was $1.3 billion, or approximately 23.4% of our revenue in fiscal 2016 &#32;as compared to $1.3 billion, or approximately 24.9% of our revenue in fiscal 2015 . Our intelligence work covers a wide range of areas including, among others: strategic planning and business operations; intelligence analysis and training; system delivery and engineering; integration and acquisition; organizational change and strategy; counterintelligence and human intelligence expertise; Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance planning and operations; and simulation and gaming based training. Our major intelligence clients include: 

&#8226; 

U.S. Intelligence Agencies, such as the National Security Agency, National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, and National Reconnaissance Office; and 

&#8226; 

Military Intelligence Agencies, such as the Defense Intelligence Agency, Service Intelligence Centers, and Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance units. 

Civil Clients 

We provide support to the wide-ranging missions of our U.S. government civilian agency clients. Revenue generated from civilian clients in the U.S. government was $1.4 billion, or approximately 26.0% of our revenue in fiscal 2016 &#32;as compared to $1.2 billion, or approximately 23.6% of our revenue in fiscal 2015 . Our civil work includes a full spectrum of capabilities, services, and solutions in engineering and science, systems delivery, cyber, and analytics across the breadth of civil agency offices. Our civil government clients include Health and Human Services, Veterans Affairs, Homeland Security, Treasury, Justice, Energy, Transportation, Labor, National Science Foundation, Agriculture, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), General Services Administration, Environmental Protection Agency, 

Commerce, Interior, State, Office of Personnel Management, and work performed outside of the U.S. for the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). 

&#32;Work performed outside of the U.S. for USAID has been realigned from global commercial to civil revenue in fiscal 2016. Fiscal 2015 revenue for both global commercial and civil has been revised to reflect the new alignment. 

Global Commercial Clients 

Our revenue generated with commercial and international clients, which includes work for private sector clients inside and outside of the U.S. and foreign government entities, was $122.2 million, or approximately 2.3% of our revenue in fiscal 2016 &#32;as compared to $97.6 million, or approximately 1.8% of our revenue in fiscal 2015 . Our global commercial work encompasses a broad range of areas including, among others, data analytics, regulatory compliance, IT infrastructure, cyber defense diagnostics, mission assurance and risk management, technology, strategy transformation, and program management. Our commercial and international clients include: 

&#8226; 

Commercial clients, such as large commercial and investment banks, utilities, oil and gas companies, major retailers, auto manufacturers, major pharmaceutical manufacturers, and healthcare providers. 

&#8226; 

International clients, such as non-U.S. governments and commercial entities in the Middle East North Africa (MENA) region, and select Asian markets. 

Foreign military sales to non U.S. government clients and work performed outside of the U.S. for USAID have been realigned from global commercial revenue to defense revenue and civil revenue, respectively in fiscal 2016. Fiscal 2015 revenue for global commercial, defense, and civil have been revised to reflect the new alignment. 

Contracts 

Booz Allen's approach has long been to ensure that we have prime or subcontractor positions on a wide range of contracts that allow clients maximum opportunity to access our services. Our diverse contract base provides stability to our business. This diversity is seen in the fact that over 76% &#32;of our revenue for fiscal 2016 was derived from over 3,300 &#32;active task orders under indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contract vehicles. Our top ID/IQ contract vehicle represented approximately 4.5% &#32;of our revenue in our fiscal year 2016. Our largest task order under an ID/IQ contract vehicle accounted for approximately 2.4% &#32;of our revenue in our fiscal year 2016. Our largest definite contract represented approximately 2.8% &#32;of our revenue in our fiscal year 2016. 

There are two predominant contracting methods by which the U.S. government procures services: definite contracts and indefinite contract vehicles. Each of these is described below: 

&#8226; 

Definite contracts call for the performance of specified services or the delivery of specified products. The U.S. government procures services and solutions through single award, definite contracts that specify the scope of services that will be delivered and identify the contractor that will provide the specified services. When an agency recognizes a need for services or products, it develops an acquisition plan, which details the means by which it will procure those services or products. During the acquisition process, the agency may release a request for information to determine if qualified bidders exist, a draft request for a proposal to allow the industry to comment on the scope of work and acquisition strategy, and finally a formal request for a proposal. Following the evaluation of submitted proposals, the agency will award the contract to the winning bidder. 

&#8226; 

Indefinite contract vehicles provide for the issuance by the client of orders for services or products under the terms of the contract. Indefinite contracts are formally known as ID/IQ contracts and are often referred to as contract vehicles or ordering contracts. ID/IQ contracts may be awarded to one contractor (single award) or several contractors (multiple award). Under a multiple award ID/IQ contract, there is no guarantee of work as contract holders must compete for individual work orders. ID/IQ contracts will often include pre-established labor categories and rates, and the ordering process is streamlined (usually taking less than a month from recognition of a need to an established order with a contractor). ID/IQ contracts often have multi-year terms and unfunded ceiling amounts, thereby enabling but not committing the U.S. government to purchase substantial amounts of products and services from one or more contractors in a streamlined procurement process. 

Listed below are our top definite contracts for fiscal 2016 &#32;and 2015 and revenue recognized under these contracts in fiscal 2016 &#32;and 2015. Classified contracts that cannot be named are noted generically in the table with consistent names in both fiscal years for comparability purposes. &#160; &#160;

(1) While the contract end date is 7/8/2015, there are several task orders that extend beyond the contract end date with the longest duration task order end date on 9/30/2016. 

Listed below for each specified revenue band is the number of, revenue derived from, and average duration of our task orders as of March 31, 2016 . The table includes revenue earned during fiscal 2016 &#32;under all task orders that were active during fiscal 2016 under these ID/IQ contracts and the number of active task orders on which this revenue was earned. Average duration reflected in the table below is calculated based on the inception date of the task order, which may be prior to the beginning of fiscal 2016 , and the completion date which may have been prior or subsequent to March 31, 2016 . As a result, the actual average remaining duration for task orders included in this table may be less than the average duration shown in the table, and task orders included in the table may have been complete on March 31, 2016 . &#160;

Backlog 

We define backlog to include the following three components: 

&#8226; 

Funded Backlog. &#32;Funded backlog represents the revenue value of orders for services under existing contracts for which funding is appropriated or otherwise authorized less revenue previously recognized on these contracts. 

&#8226; 

Unfunded Backlog. &#32;Unfunded backlog represents the revenue value of orders for services under existing contracts for which funding has not been appropriated or otherwise authorized. 

&#8226; 

Priced Options. &#32;Priced contract options represent 100% of the revenue value of all future contract option periods under existing contracts that may be exercised at our clients&#8217; option and for which funding has not been appropriated or otherwise authorized. 

Backlog does not include any task orders under ID/IQ contracts, including GWACs and GSA schedules, except to the extent that task orders have been awarded to us under those contracts. 

The following table summarizes the value of our contract backlog as of the respective dates presented: &#160;

Amount as of March 31, 2015 reflects a reduction by management to the revenue value of orders for services under one then existing single award ID/IQ contract the Company had for several years, based on an established pattern of funding under this contract by the U.S. government. 

We may never realize all of the revenue that is included in our total backlog, and there is a higher degree of risk in this regard with respect to unfunded backlog and priced options. See &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations &#8212; Sources of Revenue &#8212; Contract Backlog&#8221; for additional disclosure regarding our backlog. See also &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8212; Risks Related to Our Business &#8212; We may not realize the full value of our backlog, which may result in lower than expected revenue.&#8221; 

Competition 

The government services market is highly fragmented and competition within the government professional services industry has intensified due to market pressure. In addition to professional service companies like ours that focus principally on the provision of services to the U.S. government, other companies active in our markets include large defense contractors; diversified consulting, technology, and outsourcing service providers; and small businesses. Changing government policies and market dynamics also are helping to reshape the competitive landscape. Some large prime contractors are beginning to divest their professional services business units due to the U.S. government&#8217;s increased sensitivity to organizational conflicts of interest and these divested companies will be free to compete with us without their former organizational conflicts of interest constraints. The formal adoption of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, or FAR, organizational conflicts of interest rules, or additional more restrictive rules by U.S. government agencies could cause further such divestitures which could further increase competition in our markets. At the other end of the spectrum, small businesses are growing in the government services industry due in large part to a push by both the Obama and Bush administrations to bolster the economy by helping small business owners. Finally, due to the foregoing factors and the drive in our markets to quickly build competencies in growth areas and achieve economies of scale, we believe that consolidation activity among market participants will increase. 

In the course of doing business, we compete and collaborate with companies of all types and sizes. We strive to maintain positive and productive relationships with these organizations. Some of them hire us as a subcontractor, and we hire some of them to work with us as our subcontractors. Our major competitors include: (i) contractors focused principally on the provision of services to the U.S. government (ii) large defense contractors that provide both products and services to the U.S. government, and (iii) diversified service providers. We compete on the basis of our technical expertise and client knowledge, our ability to successfully recruit appropriately skilled and experienced talent, our ability to deliver cost-effective multi-faceted services in a timely manner, our reputation and relationship with our clients, our past performance, security clearances, and the size and scale of our company. In addition, in order to maintain our competitive position, we routinely review our operating structure, capabilities, and strategy to determine whether we are effectively meeting the needs of existing clients, effectively responding to developments in our markets, and successfully building a platform intended to provide the foundation for the future growth of our business. 

Patents and Proprietary Information 

Our management and technology consulting services and related products are not generally dependent upon patent protection. We claim a proprietary interest in certain of our service offerings and related products, methodologies, and know-how. We have a few patents but we do not consider our business to be materially dependent on the protection of such patents. Additionally, we have a number of trade secrets that contribute to our success and competitive position, and we endeavor to protect this proprietary information. While protecting trade secrets and proprietary information is important, we are not materially dependent on any specific trade secret or group of trade secrets. Other than licenses to commercially available third-party software, we have no licenses to intellectual property that are significant to our business. 

We rely upon a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual arrangements, as well as copyright, trademark, patent, and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary information. We also enter into proprietary information and intellectual property agreements with employees, which require them to disclose any inventions created during employment, to convey such rights to inventions to us, and to restrict any disclosure of proprietary information. 

Our most important trademark is the &#8220;Booz Allen Hamilton&#8221; mark, registered in the United States and certain foreign countries. Generally, registered trademarks have perpetual life, provided that they are renewed on a timely basis and continue to be used properly as trademarks. We have four registered trademarks related to our name and logo with the earliest renewal in March 2020. 

For our work under U.S. government funded contracts and subcontracts, the U.S. government obtains certain rights to data, software, and related information developed under such contracts or subcontracts. These rights generally allow the U.S. government to disclose such data, software, and related information to third parties, which third parties may include our competitors in some instances. In the case of our work as a subcontractor, our prime contractor may also have certain rights to data, information, and products we develop under the subcontract. 

Booz Allen Hamilton &#174; , the Booz Allen Cyber Solutions Network &#174; , the Booz Allen Hamilton logo, and other trademarks or service marks of Booz Allen Hamilton Inc. appearing in this Annual Report are property of Booz Allen Hamilton Inc. Trade names, trademarks, and service marks of other companies appearing in this Annual Report are the property of their respective owners. 

Regulation 

As a contractor to the U.S. government, as well as state and local governments, we are heavily regulated in most fields in which we operate. We deal with numerous U.S. government agencies and entities, and when working with these and other entities, we must comply with and are affected by unique laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of public government contracts. Some significant laws and regulations that affect us include: 

&#8226; 

FAR, and agency regulations supplemental to the FAR, which regulate the formation, administration, and performance of U.S. government contracts. For example, FAR 52.203-13 requires contractors to establish a Code of Business Ethics and Conduct, implement a comprehensive internal control system, and report to the government when the contractor has credible evidence that a principal, employee, agent, or subcontractor, in connection with a government contract, has violated certain federal criminal laws, violated the civil False Claims Act, or has received a significant overpayment; 

&#8226; 

the False Claims Act and False Statements Act, which impose civil and criminal liability for presenting false or fraudulent claims for payments or reimbursement, and making false statements to the U.S. government, respectively; 

&#8226; 

the Truth in Negotiations Act, which requires certification and disclosure of cost and pricing data in connection with the negotiation of a contract, modification, or task order; 

&#8226; 

the Procurement Integrity Act, which regulates access to competitor bid and proposal information and certain internal government procurement sensitive information, and our ability to provide compensation to certain former government procurement officials; 

&#8226; 

laws and regulations restricting the ability of a contractor to provide gifts or gratuities to employees of the U.S. government; 

&#8226; 

post-government employment laws and regulations, which restrict the ability of a contractor to recruit and hire current employees of the U.S. government and deploy former employees of the U.S. government; 

&#8226; 

laws, regulations, and executive orders restricting the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes or determined to be &#8220;controlled unclassified information&#8221; or &#8220;for official use only&#8221; and the export of certain products, services, and technical data, including requirements regarding any applicable licensing of our employees involved in such work; 

&#8226; 

laws, regulations, and executive orders regulating the handling, use, and dissemination of personally identifiable information in the course of performing a U.S. government contract; 

&#8226; 

laws, regulations, and executive orders governing organizational conflicts of interest that may restrict our ability to compete for certain U.S. government contracts because of the work that we currently perform for the U.S. government or may require that we take measures such as firewalling off certain employees or restricting their future work activities due to the current work that they perform under a U.S. government contract; 

&#8226; 

laws, regulations and executive orders that impose requirements on us to ensure compliance with requirements and protect the government from risk related to our supply chain; 

&#8226; 

laws, regulations and mandatory contract provisions providing protections to employees or subcontractors seeking to report alleged fraud, waste, and abuse related to a government contract; 

&#8226; 

the Contractor Business Systems rule, which authorizes Department of Defense agencies to withhold a portion of our payments if we are determined to have a significant deficiency in our accounting, cost estimating, purchasing, earned value management, material management and accounting, and/or property management system; and 

&#8226; 

the Cost Accounting Standards and Cost Principles, which impose accounting requirements that govern our right to reimbursement under certain cost-based U.S. government contracts and require consistency of accounting practices over time. 

Given the magnitude of our revenue derived from contracts with the Department of Defense, the Defense Contract Audit Agency, or DCAA, is our cognizant government audit agency. The DCAA audits the adequacy of our internal control systems and policies including, among other areas, compensation. As a result of its audits, the DCAA may determine that a portion of our employee compensation is unallowable. See &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8212; Risk Related to Our Industry &#8212; Our contracts, performance, and administrative processes and systems are subject to audits, reviews, investigations, and cost adjustments by the U.S. government, which could reduce our revenue, disrupt our business, or 

otherwise materially adversely affect our results of operations.&#8221; We are also subject to audit by Inspectors General of other U.S. government agencies. 

The U.S. government may revise its procurement practices or adopt new contract rules and regulations at any time. In order to help ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, all of our employees are required to attend ethics training at least annually, as well as other compliance training relevant to their position. Internationally, we are subject to special U.S. government laws and regulations (such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act), local government regulations and procurement policies and practices, including regulations relating to import-export control, investments, exchange controls, and repatriation of earnings, as well as varying currency, political, and economic risks. 

U.S. government contracts are, by their terms, subject to termination by the U.S. government either for its convenience or default by the contractor. In addition, U.S. government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of Congressional appropriations. Congress usually appropriates funds for a given program on a September 30 fiscal year basis, even though contract performance may take many years. As is common in the industry, our company is subject to business risks, including changes in governmental appropriations, national defense policies, service modernization plans, and availability of funds. Any of these factors could materially adversely affect our company&#8217;s business with the U.S. government in the future. 

The U.S. government has a broad range of actions that it can instigate in order to enforce its procurement law and policies. These include proposing a contractor, certain of its operations or individual employees for debarment or suspending or debarring a contractor, certain of its operations or individual employees from future government business. In addition to criminal, civil and administrative actions by the U.S. government, under the False Claims Act, an individual alleging fraud related to payments under a U.S. government contract or program may file a qui tam lawsuit on behalf of the government against us; if successful in obtaining a judgment or settlement, the individual filing the suit may receive up to 30 percent of the amount recovered by the government. 

See &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8212; Risks Related to Our Business &#8212; We are required to comply with numerous laws and regulations, some of which are highly complex, and our failure to comply could result in fines or civil or criminal penalties or suspension or debarment by the U.S. government that could result in our inability to continue to work on or receive U.S. government contracts, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.&#8221;
