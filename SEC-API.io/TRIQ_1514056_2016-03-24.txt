 Item 1. Description of Business. 

&#160; 

Organization 

&#160; 

We were incorporated in the State of California as a for-profit company on September 10, 2009 and established a fiscal year end of December 31. On September 15, 2009, our incorporator adopted our bylaws and appointed our sole director. We were formed to develop, produce and distribute low-budget, independent feature films and exploit other entertainment opportunities, which may include the licensing and selling of intellectual properties. 

&#160; 

On September 15, 2009, we issued 15,000,000 shares of our common stock, valued at $0.0001 per share, to our 5 founders, which includes 250,000 common shares to our president, Michael F. Matondi, III and 1,000,000 common shares to our chief executive officer and sole director, Gary L. Blum, in exchange for organizational services incurred since our incorporation at a price of $0.0001 per share and valued at $25 and $100, respectively. We also issued 13,750,000 common shares to 3 other founders for services rendered at a price of $0.0001 per share valued at $1,375. From September 27, 2009 to April 18, 2010, we sold and issued 1,485,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $0.10 per share for $148,500 to 25 individuals. We estimate our 2016 monthly burn rate to be approximately $800 per month, which will consist of miscellaneous office expenses, rent, and professional fees. We believe that our present capital is insufficient to cover our monthly burn rate for the next 12 months; however, our majority shareholder has orally agreed to continue to provide us with working capital to fund our overhead. We believe that we will require approximately $10,000 to $100,000 in either cash or our common stock to accomplish our business goals. To the extent we are able to use our common stock to accomplish these goals, we will in order to minimize related party advances. To the extent we are unable to accomplish our goals with the issuance of common stock for services and products, then we intend to raise additional capital from investors through the sale of our common stock or rely on related party advances. Our principal business, executive and registered statutory office is located at 201 Santa Monica Blvd., Suite 300, Santa Monica, CA 90401and our telephone number is (310) 576-4758, fax (310) 388-5899 and email contact is submissions@thunderclapinc.com.

&#160; 

Business 

&#160; 

We were formed to develop and produce low-budget, feature length motion pictures and other entertainment related projects. We also have had discussions with various producers and writers to acquire scripts and the rights to projects. To date, we have not been able to secure any rights although we continue to evaluate various opportunities and continue to have discussions with various entertainment parties. We have had limited operations and have limited financial resources. While we have not yet begun any entertainment projects, we have held discussions with numerous film and television producers to participate in and/or acquire some of their projects. Our auditors indicated in their report on our financial statements (the &#8220;Report&#8221;) that &#8220;the Company&#8217;s lack of business operations and continuing losses raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.&#8221; Our operations to date have been devoted primarily to start-up and development activities as well as research on various film projects. We have also had discussions with various parties regarding the development of reality-based television shows and web-based content series. In 2016, we plan to increase our efforts to joint venture with other low budget producers on the development and production of commercial, feature-length, low-budget motion pictures having budgets of up to $2 million dollars. We also intend to continue our efforts to acquire completed films by issuing stock for their acquisition and intend to continue to devote some of our efforts to film distribution based on relationships we have been able to develop in 2014 and 2015. We plan to continue to utilize our website to solicit projects from writers, directors, producers and agents. We anticipate promoting any film properties received through our website by assembling a business plan for presentation to prospective investors and financiers, consisting of the screenplay, a budget, shooting schedule, production board and identification of recognizable actor(s) or director(s) for the film. We also intend to continue discussions with various film distributors to determine what our best options are for the distribution of a completed project. We plan to offer grants of our stock or options to acquire our stock in order to secure screenplays, treatments, actors&#8217; participation and directors&#8217; participation in our films. A treatment is a written sketch outlining the plot, characters, and action for a screenplay but not including certain elements of a finished screenplay, such as camera directions and dialogue. There can be no assurance that writers, actors and/or directors, in exchange for their participation in a film, will ever consider our stock in exchange for their screenplays or services. Any such grants of stock may involve substantial dilution to our existing shareholders. See &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; 

&#160; 

We currently do not have sufficient capital to independently finance our own film projects. We intend to rely on outside sources of financing for all film production activities. Our ability to achieve and maintain profitability and positive cash flow is dependent upon our ability to produce commercially successful motion picture films. In order to succeed, we must develop or acquire screenplays appropriate for production and distribution. We intend to rely on our Chairman&#8217;s and President&#8217;s access to and relationships with creative talent, including writers, actors and directors to find suitable existing screenplays. We also intend to market our website to the film industry to solicit screenplays for our consideration and intend to increase our presence on various social media websites to promote our Company and any potential projects that we are able to secure the rights for production and/or distribution. There can be no guarantee or assurance that our Chairman or President and/or our website will enable us to attract and produce commercially viable screenplays into films that will result in future profits to us. 

&#160; 

We plan to profit from this business activity by exclusively owning various rights, titles, and interest in and to, any screenplay and any film derived from it and also capitalizing on other marketing opportunities associated with these properties including, but not limited to, the publishing and promotion of associated music, the incorporation of original songs on sound tracks for subsequent use in promotion, sound track albums, story-telling records and the licensing of merchandising rights. Motion picture revenue is derived from the worldwide licensing of a film to several distinct markets, each having its own distribution network and potential for profit. The selection of the distributor for each of our feature films will depend upon a number of factors. Our most basic criterion is whether the distributor has the ability to secure bookings for the exhibition of the film on satisfactory terms or whether we, if we assume distribution efforts, are able to secure bookings. We will consider whether, when and in what amount the distributor will make advances to us. We will also consider the amount and manner of computing distribution fees and the extent to which the distributor will guarantee certain print, advertising and promotional expenditures. 

&#160; 

No assurance can be given that our films, if produced, will be distributed and, if distributed, will return the investment or make a profit. To achieve the goal of producing profitable low-budget, feature films, we plan to be selective in our choice of screenplays that we decide to produce, exercise a high degree of control over the cost of production, and work with potential distributors on a viable and cost-effective distribution and marketing plan for our films. 

&#160; 

The production of feature films does not require the ownership of expensive equipment. We believe that all the necessary equipment needed to engage in every aspect of the film production process can be rented or borrowed for the period in which it is needed. We believe that many production companies follow this operating procedure and we plan to rent or borrow the needed equipment in our anticipated film productions. 

&#160; 

Since September 10, 2009 (our inception) to December 31, 2015, we have not generated any revenues and have a net loss of $(213,475). We anticipate generating revenues within the first twelve months after we have secured separate financing for our first film or entertainment project. We believe that we have insufficient working capital to continue our operations for the next 12 months without the need to seek additional financing, based on loans from our majority shareholder and his oral agreement to continue to fund our overhead. In the event our shareholder is unwilling or unable to advance us funds, we will not have sufficient working capital. We currently have two officers and a sole director. These individuals allocate time and personal resources to us on a part-time basis and our chief executive officer devotes approximately 10 hours per week to us. One of our shareholders, who is neither an officer or director and who owns less than 10% of our common stock, has advanced $12,000 as an interest-free demand loan and has orally agreed to defer payment until we are financially able to repay it. Our majority shareholder has advanced us $42,848 as an interest-free demand loan and has orally agreed to defer payment until we are able to repay it. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

We intend to be very selective when choosing literary properties to develop. They must have a rating of PG, PG-13 or R, and should be within the genres of suspense, horror, action drama or comedy action. We intend to select screenplays that will not require a lot of main characters or minor characters. We intend to select scripts that will not require more than 50 extras throughout the entire production or more than 20 extras in any single scene. We anticipate that the stories will take place between 25-35 different locations but we intend to limit production to no more than 5-10 physical locations. We do not intend to consider any scripts that will require more than two special effects scenes, location scenes involving talent, staff or crew travel or per diems, futuristic or period sets, props or wardrobe. 

&#160; 

At this time, we cannot provide any assurance that we will ever be able to produce a high quality action film in the future. 

&#160; 

Financing Strategy 

&#160; 

We will not be able to produce a feature film on our own without additional outside financing in order to produce a film. Primary responsibility for the overall planning, financing and production of each motion picture will rest with our management. For each motion picture we plan to employ an independent film director who will be responsible for, or involved with, many of the creative elements, such as direction, photography, and editing. All decisions will be subject to budgetary restrictions and our business control, although we will permit an independent director to retain reasonable artistic control of the project, consistent with its completion within strict budget guidelines and the commercial requirements of the picture. We cannot provide any guarantee that we will be able to ever employ a competent independent film director in the future to manage our anticipated films. We intend to assemble a film package, which we define as a script, budget, a business plan that outlines a plan for producing the film and identifies a producer. 

&#160; 

Whenever possible we will attempt to make arrangements with providers of goods and services to defer payment until a later stage in the production and financing cycle. Once a film package has been assembled, there are various methods of obtaining the funds needed to complete the production of a motion picture. Examples of financing alternatives include the assignment of our rights in a film to a joint venture or a co-producer. Alternatively, we may form a limited liability company or partnership where we will be the managing member or the general partner. We may also obtain favorable pre-release sales or pre-licensing commitments from various end-users such as independent domestic distributors, foreign distributors, cable networks, and video distributors. These various techniques, which are commonly used in the industry, can be combined to finance a project without a major studio financial commitment. We may, at management&#8217;s discretion, sell shares of our capital stock or exchange shares for services, to finance the production of films. 

&#160; 

By virtue of using Canada as our primary shooting location, we may be able to obtain financial support from the Canadian federal and provincial governments. By filming in Canada, we expect to be able to borrow against tax credits obtained through Canadian federal and provincial production services tax credits. These tax credits will enable to us to recover 27% to 33% of eligible labor costs, or approximately 13.5% to 16.5% of our total production budget. Canadian banks commonly allow producers to borrow against such tax credits in producing motion pictures. We may also be able to access foreign government financing through international co-productions with treaty countries and are looking at opportunities with some of the production companies that we have had discussions with in shooting in various states with favorable tax credits such as Michigan, Louisiana and Mississippi. 

&#160; 

We may use any one or a combination of these or other techniques to finance our films. We anticipate that any financing method will permit us to maintain control over the production. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully arrange for such additional financing and to the extent we are unsuccessful, our production activities may be adversely affected. 

&#160; 

Distribution Arrangements 

&#160; 

Effective distribution is critical to the economic success of a feature film, particularly when made by an independent production company. We have not as yet negotiated any distribution agreements. 

&#160; 

We intend to release our films in the United States through existing distribution companies, primarily independent distributors. We will retain the right for ourselves to market the films on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis throughout the rest of the world and to market television and other uses separately. In many instances, depending upon the nature of distribution terms available, it may be advantageous or necessary for us to license all, or substantially all, distribution rights through one major distributor. We also intend to pursue distribution arrangements ourselves by contacting foreign sales agents to assist us. 

&#160; 

To the extent that we may engage in foreign distribution of our films, we will be subject to all of the additional risks of doing business abroad including, but not limited to, government censorship, currency fluctuations, exchange controls, greater risk of &#8220;piracy&#8221; copying, and licensing or qualification fees. 

&#160; 

It is not possible to predict, with certainty, the nature of the distribution arrangements, if any, that we may secure for our motion pictures. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The motion picture industry is intensely competitive. Competition comes from companies within the same business and companies in other entertainment media that create alternative forms of entertainment. The industry is currently evolving in such a way that certain multinational multimedia firms will be able to dominate this space because of their control over key film, magazine, and television content, as well as key network and cable outlets. These organizations have numerous competitive advantages, such as the ability to acquire financing for their projects and to make favorable arrangements for the distribution of completed films. All of our competitors will likely be organizations of substantially larger size and capacity, with far greater financial and personnel resources and longer operating histories, and may be better able to acquire properties, personnel and financing, and enter into more favorable distribution agreements. Our success will depend on public taste, which is both unpredictable and susceptible to rapid change. 

&#160; 

As an independent film production company, we most likely will not have the backing of a major studio for production and distribution support. Consequently, we may not be able to complete a motion picture. 

&#160; 

In order to be competitive, we intend to create independent motion pictures that may appeal to a wide range of public taste both in the United States and abroad. Moreover, by producing our films in Canada we believe that we will be able to significantly reduce production costs, and thereby offer our films to distributors at competitive pricing. Investors must be aware that at this time we have not produced any film and may not ever be successful in doing so in the future. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property Rights 

&#160; 

Rights to motion pictures are granted legal protection under the copyright laws of the United States and most foreign countries, including Canada. These laws provide substantial civil and criminal penalties for unauthorized duplication and exhibition of motion pictures. Motion pictures, musical works, sound recordings, artwork, and still photography are separately subject to copyright under most copyright laws. We plan to take appropriate and reasonable measures to secure, protect, and maintain copyright protection for all of our pictures under the laws of the applicable jurisdictions. Motion picture piracy is an industry-wide problem. The motion picture industry trade association provides a piracy hotline and investigates all piracy reports. The results of such investigations may warrant legal action, by the owner of the rights, and, depending on the scope of the piracy, investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and/or the Royal Canadian Mounted Police with the possibility of criminal prosecution. 

&#160; 

Under the copyright laws of Canada and the United States, copyright in a motion picture is automatically secured when the work is created and &#8220;fixed&#8221; in a copy. We intend to register our films for copyright with both the Canadian Copyright Office and the United States Copyright Office. Both offices will register claims to copyright and issue certificates of registration but neither will &#8220;grant&#8221; or &#8220;issue&#8221; copyrights. Only the expression (camera work, dialogue, sounds, etc.) fixed in a motion picture can be protected under copyright. Copyright in both Canada and the United States does not cover the idea or concept behind the work or any characters portrayed in the work. Registration with the appropriate office establishes a public record of the copyright claim. 

&#160; 

Ordinarily, a number of individuals contribute authorship to a motion picture, including the writer, director, producer, camera operator, editor, and others. Under the laws of both the United States, and Canada, these individuals are not always considered the &#8220;authors,&#8221; however, because a motion picture is frequently a &#8220;work made for hire.&#8221; In the case of a work made for hire, the employer, not the individuals who actually created the work, is considered the author for copyright purposes. We intend all of our films to be works made for hire in which we will be the authors and thereby own the copyright to our films. 

&#160; 

Canada&#8217;s copyright law is distinguished from that of the United States by recognizing the moral rights of authors. Moral rights refer to the rights of authors to have their names associated with their work, and the right to not have their work distorted, mutilated or otherwise modified, or used in association with a product, service, cause or institution in a way that is prejudicial to their honor or reputation. Moral rights cannot be sold or transferred, but they can be waived. We intend that all individuals who contribute to the creation of any of our motion pictures will be required to waive any such moral rights that they may have in the motion picture. 

&#160; 

For copyright purposes, publication of a motion picture takes place when one or more copies are distributed to the public by sale, rental, lease or lending, or when an offering is made to distribute copies to a group of persons (wholesalers, retailers, broadcasters, motion picture distributors, and the like) for purposes of further distribution or public performance. A work that is created (fixed in tangible form for the first time) on or after January 1, 1978, is automatically protected from the moment of its creation and is ordinarily given a term enduring for the author&#8217;s life plus an additional 70 years after the author&#8217;s death. For works made for hire, the duration of copyright will be 95 years from publication or 120 years from creation, whichever is shorter. 

&#160; 

Although we plan to copyright all of our film properties and projects, there is no practical protection from films being copied by others without payment to us, especially overseas. We may lose an indeterminate amount of revenue as a result of motion picture piracy. Being a small company, with limited resources, it will be difficult, if not impossible, to pursue our various remedies. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Motion picture piracy is an international as well as a domestic problem. It is extensive in many parts of the world. In addition to the Motion Picture Association of America, the Motion Picture Export Association, the American Film Marketing Association, and the American Film Export Association monitor the progress and efforts made by various countries to limit or prevent piracy. In the past, these various trade associations have enacted voluntary embargoes of motion picture exports to certain countries in order to pressure the governments of those countries to become more aggressive in preventing motion picture piracy. The United States government has publicly considered trade sanctions against specific countries that do not prevent copyright infringement of American motion pictures. There can be no assurance that voluntary industry embargoes or United States government trade sanctions will be enacted. If enacted, such actions may impact the revenue that we realize from the international exploitation of our motion pictures. If not enacted or if other measures are not taken, the motion picture industry, including us, may lose an indeterminate amount of revenue as a result of motion picture piracy. 

&#160; 

Censorship 

&#160; 

An industry trade association, the Motion Picture Association of America, assigns ratings for age group suitability for domestic theatrical distribution of motion pictures under the auspices of its Code and Rating Administration. The film distributor generally submits its film to the Code and Rating Administration for a rating. We plan to follow the practice of submitting our motion pictures for ratings. 

&#160; 

Television networks and stations in the United States as well as some foreign governments may impose additional restrictions on the content of a motion picture that may wholly or partially restrict exhibition on television or in a particular territory. 

&#160; 

Theatrical distribution of motion pictures, in a number of states and certain jurisdictions, is subject to provisions of trade practice laws passed in those jurisdictions. These laws generally seek to eliminate the practice known as &#8220;blind bidding&#8221; and prohibit the licensing of films unless theater owners are invited to attend screenings of the film first. In certain instances, these laws also prohibit payment of advances and guarantees to film distributors by exhibitors. 

&#160; 

There can be no assurance that current and future restrictions on the content of our films may not limit or affect our ability to exhibit our pictures in certain jurisdictions and media. 

&#160; 

Labor Laws 

&#160; 

We are aware that the cost of producing and distributing filmed entertainment has increased substantially in recent years. This is due, among other things, to the increasing demands of creative talent as well as industry-wide collective bargaining agreements. Many of the screenplay writers, performers, directors and technical personnel in the entertainment industry who will be involved in our productions are members of guilds or unions that bargain collectively on an industry-wide basis. We have found that actions by these guilds or unions can result in increased costs of production and can occasionally disrupt production operations. If such actions impede our ability to operate or produce a motion picture, it may substantially harm our ability to earn revenue and result in our business to fail. 

&#160; 

We will use non-unionized talent whenever possible to reduce our costs of production. Notwithstanding, many individuals associated with our productions, including actors, writers and directors, will be members of guilds or unions, that bargain collectively with producers on an industry-wide basis from time to time. Our operations will be dependent upon our compliance with the provisions of collective bargaining agreements governing relationships with these guilds and unions. Strikes or other work stoppages by members of these unions could delay or disrupt our activities. The extent to which the existence of collective bargaining agreements may affect us in the future is not currently determinable. 

&#160; 

Status Of Any Publicly Announced New Products And Services 

&#160; 

We currently have no new publicly announced products or services. 

&#160; 

Our Website 

&#160; 

Our website is located at www.thunderclapinc.com and provides a description of our company along with our contact information including our address, telephone number and e-mail address. 

&#160; 

Dependence On Customers 

&#160; 

The production of films is diverse so we will never be dependent on one source for our scripts or production needs. 

&#160; 

Trademarks And Patents 

&#160; 

We do not have any registered trademarks or patents; however, we may file for trademark protection in the future should our sole director deem it necessary. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Need For Any Government Approval Of Principal Products Or Services 

&#160; 

We are also subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations generally applied to businesses, such as payroll taxes on the state and federal levels. We believe that we are in conformity with all applicable laws in California and the United States. 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

We have not spent any money on research and development activities. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

At the present time, we do not have any employees other than our officers and sole director. Our chief executive officer and sole director devotes time as needed to our business and expects to devote 10 hours per week in 2016. 

&#160; 

Legal Proceedings 

&#160; 

We are not involved in any legal proceedings nor are we aware of any pending or threatened litigation against us. None of our officers or director is a party to any legal proceeding or litigation. None of our officers or director has been convicted of a felony or misdemeanor relating to securities or performance in corporate office. 

&#160;
