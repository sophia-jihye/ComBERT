 Item 1. Business Overview 

Navient is the nation&#146;s leading loan management, servicing and asset recovery company, committed to helping customers navigate the path to financial success. Servicing more than $300 billion in education loans, Navient supports the educational and economic achievements of more than 12 million customers. A growing number of public and private sector clients rely on Navient for proven solutions to meet their financial goals. Navient began trading on NASDAQ as an independent company on May 1, 2014. Our website is navient.com. Information contained or referenced on our website is not incorporated by reference into and does not form a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Navient holds the largest portfolio of education loans insured or guaranteed under the Federal Family Education Loan Program (&#147;FFELP&#148;), as well as the largest portfolio of Private Education Loans. FFELP Loans are insured or guaranteed by state or not-for-profit agencies based on guaranty agreements among the United States Department of Education (&#147;ED&#148;) and these agencies. Private Education Loans are education loans to students or their families that bear the full credit risk of the customer and any cosigner. Private Education Loans are made primarily to bridge the gap between the cost of higher education and the amount funded through financial aid, federal loans or students&#146; and families&#146; resources. 

Navient services its own portfolio of education loans, as well as education loans owned by banks, credit unions, other financial institutions, non-profit education lenders and ED. Navient is one of four Title IV Additional Servicers (&#147;TIVAS&#148;) to ED under its Direct Student Loan Program (&#147;DSLP&#148;). Navient also provides asset recovery services on its own portfolio (consisting of both education loans and other asset classes), and on behalf of guaranty agencies, higher education institutions, and federal, state, court and municipal clients. In addition, we provide business processing services on behalf of municipalities, public authorities and hospitals. 

As of December 31, 2015, Navient&#146;s principal assets consisted of: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; $96.5 billion in FFELP Loans, with a net interest margin of 0.84 percent for the year ended December 31, 2015 on a &#147;Core Earnings&#148; basis and a weighted average life of 7.2 years; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; $26.4 billion in Private Education Loans, with a net interest margin of 3.67 percent for the year ended December 31, 2015 on a &#147;Core Earnings&#148; basis and a weighted average life of 7.0 years; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; a leading education loan servicing platform that services loans for more than 12 million DSLP Loan, FFELP Loan and Private Education Loan customers (including cosigners), including 6.3 million customer accounts serviced under Navient&#146;s contract with ED; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; a leading asset recovery and business processing platform where we currently provide services for over 1,000 public and private sector clients. 

Strengths and Opportunities 

Navient possesses a number of competitive advantages that distinguish it from its competitors, including: 

Large, high quality asset base generating significant and predictable cash flows. At December 31, 2015, Navient&#146;s $122.9 billion education loan portfolio is 74 percent funded to term and is expected to produce consistent and predictable cash flows over the remaining life of the portfolio. Navient&#146;s $96.5 billion portfolio of FFELP Loans bears a maximum 3 percent loss exposure due to the federal guaranty. Navient&#146;s $26.4 billion 

&#160; 

portfolio of Private Education Loans bears the full credit risk of the borrower and any cosigner. Navient expects that cash flows from its FFELP Loan and Private Education Loan portfolios will significantly exceed future debt service obligations. 

Efficient and large scale operating platforms. Navient is the largest servicer of education loans, servicing over $300 billion in education loans for more than 12 million customers. Navient&#146;s inventory of contingent asset recovery receivables is $20.2 billion as of December 31, 2015 and provides services to over 1,000 public and private sector clients. Navient has demonstrated scalable infrastructure with capacity to add volume at a low cost. Navient&#146;s premier market share and tested infrastructure make it well-positioned to expand its businesses to additional clients and asset types. 

Superior performance. Navient has demonstrated superior default prevention performance and industry leading asset recovery services. The combined portfolio of federal loans serviced by Navient experienced a Cohort Default Rate (&#147;CDR&#148;) of 8 percent, which is 38 percent lower than their peers, as calculated from the most recent CDR released by ED in September 2015. We are consistently a top performer in our asset recovery business and deliver superior service to our public and private sector clients. 

Commitment to compliance and customer centricity. Navient fosters a robust compliance culture driven by a &#147;customer first&#148; approach. We invest in rigorous training programs, internal and external auditing, escalated service tracking and analysis, and customer research to enhance our compliance and customer service. 

Strong capital return. As a result of our significant cash flow and capital generation, Navient expects to return excess capital to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases. In December 2014, Navient&#146;s board of directors authorized $1 billion to be utilized in a new common share repurchase program effective January 1, 2015, and in December 2015, our board authorized an additional $700 million for common share repurchases. Navient increased its quarterly dividend amount from $0.15 per share to $0.16 per share effective for its first-quarter 2015 dividends. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we paid $240 million in dividends on shares of our common stock and repurchased $945 million of shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2015, the remaining common share repurchase authority was $755 million. 

Meaningful growth opportunities. Navient will pursue opportunistic acquisitions of FFELP and Private Education Loan portfolios. During the year ended December 31, 2015, Navient acquired $3.7 billion of education loans. Navient will also pursue additional third-party servicing, asset recovery and business processing contracts. In February 2015, Navient completed the acquisition of Gila LLC (commonly known as Municipal Services Bureau, or MSB), an asset recovery and business processing firm. The firm provides receivables management services and account processing solutions for state governments, agencies, court systems and municipalities. In October 2015, Navient completed the acquisition of Xtend Healthcare, a health care revenue cycle management company. The firm provides health insurance claims billing and account resolution, as well as patient billing and customer service. The acquisition leverages Navient&#146;s asset recovery and business processing capabilities into the health care payments sector. Navient intends to leverage its large-scale operating platforms, superior default prevention and asset recovery performance, operating efficiency and regulatory compliance and risk management infrastructure in growing these businesses and in pursuing other growth opportunities. 

Navient&#146;s Approach to Helping Education Loan Borrowers Achieve Success 

Navient services loans for more than 12 million DSLP Loan, FFELP Loan and Private Education Loan customers, including 6.3 million customers whose accounts are serviced under Navient&#146;s contract with ED. We help our customers navigate the path to financial success through proactive outreach and emphasis on identifying the payment plan that best fits their individual budgets and financial goals. 

We understand managing repayment of education loans is critical for students to achieve their educational goals, recognize their full earning potential and develop a strong credit profile. 

&#160; 

In our experience, customer success means making steady progress toward repayment, instead of falling behind on or putting off payments. This experience has taught us that the transition from school to full repayment requires customer contact and counseling. For many customers, education loans are their first borrowing experience. For new graduates, salaries grow over time, typically making payments easier to handle as their career progresses. It is also not uncommon for some borrowers to seek payment deferments if they return to school or encounter temporary interruptions in earnings. 

To help customers manage these realities, Navient makes customer success and default prevention top priorities. We customize our outreach using data-driven approaches that draw from our more than 40 years of experience in helping customers successfully manage their loans. As a result, our customers experience higher rates of repayment success as evidenced by lower delinquencies and defaults. 

We have been a partner in ED&#146;s campaign to inform federal education loan customers about various income-driven repayment (&#147;IDR&#148;) plans, and have played a leadership role in helping customers understand their options so they can make an informed choice. We promote awareness of federal repayment plan options through more than 170 million communications annually, including mail, email, phone calls, videos, and text messages. At the end of 2015, nearly one in five federal borrowers and more than one-third of dollar volume serviced by Navient (excluding Parent PLUS loans that are not eligible for IDR) were enrolled in an IDR plan. 

We also find that customers who have fallen behind benefit from our outreach and assistance. In fact, nine times out of ten when we can reach federal loan customers who have missed payments, we can identify a solution to help them avoid default. 

For those who need it, Navient launched its highly successful private loan modification program in 2009. As of December 31, 2015, $2.5 billion of our Private Education Loans were enrolled in the interest rate reduction component of our modification program, helping customers have a more affordable monthly payment while making progress in repaying the principal loan balance. Approximately 80 percent of enrolled borrowers successfully complete the program. 

As of December 31, 2015, Navient&#146;s total delinquency rates were at the lowest year-ending levels for both FFELP and Private Education Loans since 2005. 

In 2015, we made additional and substantial investments designed to help our customers, drawing from a variety of inputs including customer surveys, analysis of customer inquiries and complaint data, regulator commentary, and website activity. For example, we launched a new customer website making it easier for customers to manage their loans. In addition, beginning in 2015, customers who need to renew their income-driven repayment plans have access to the services of a specially trained group of service representatives to assist them. We also established customer and employee research panels to gather real-time feedback to inform enhancements underway. 

Our Office of the Customer Advocate, established in 1997, offers escalated assistance to customers who need it. We are committed to working with customers and appreciate customer comments, which, combined with our own customer communication channels, help us improve the ways we assist our customers. 

Navient takes seriously its commitment to serve military customers and has developed what it believes is a best-in-class system to assist them. Navient was the first student loan servicer to launch a dedicated military benefits customer service team, and was also the first student loan servicer to launch a dedicated military benefits website, Navient.com/military, and a toll-free number dedicated to military customers. Navient&#146;s military benefits team offers a single point of contact for all calls from service members and their families to help them access the benefits designed for them, including interest rate benefits, deferment and other options. 

We also continue to offer free resources to help customers and the general public build knowledge on personal finance topics. In 2015, for example, we released the top habits of successful student loan 

&#160; 

borrowers and added online resources to encourage financial literacy including such topics as military financial education, income-driven repayment plans, and budgeting. We also launched a signature national research study, &#147;Money Under 35,&#148; to study and promote financial wellness among Americans ages 22 to 35. 

Business Segments 

We have three primary reportable business segments: FFELP Loans, Private Education Loans and Business Services. A fourth segment &#151; Other &#151; primarily consists of financial results of our holding company, including activities related to repurchases of debt, our corporate liquidity portfolio, unallocated overhead and regulatory-related costs. Each of these business segments are discussed below. 

FFELP Loans Segment 

In the FFELP Loans segment, we acquire and finance FFELP Loans. Even though FFELP Loans are no longer originated due to changes in federal law that took effect in 2010, we continue to pursue acquisitions of FFELP Loan portfolios that leverage our servicing scale and generate incremental earnings and cash flow. In this segment, we primarily earn net interest income on the FFELP Loan portfolio (after provision for loan losses). This segment is expected to generate significant amounts of earnings and cash flow as the portfolio amortizes. 

We are currently the largest holder of FFELP Loans. Navient&#146;s portfolio of FFELP Loans as of December 31, 2015 was $96.5 billion and we anticipate that this FFELP Loan portfolio will have an amortization period in excess of 20 years and a 7-year remaining weighted average life. Navient&#146;s goal is to maximize and optimize the timing of the cash flows generated by its FFELP Loan portfolio. Navient also seeks to acquire FFELP Loan portfolios from third parties to add net interest income and servicing revenue. During the year ended December 31, 2015, Navient acquired $3.7 billion of FFELP Loans. FFELP Loans are insured or guaranteed by state or not-for-profit agencies and are also protected by contractual rights to recovery from the United States pursuant to guaranty agreements among ED and these agencies. These guaranty agreements generally cover at least 97 percent of a FFELP Loan&#146;s principal and accrued interest for loans disbursed. For more discussion of the FFELP and related credit support mechanisms, see Appendix A &#147;Description of Federal Family Education Loan Program.&#148; 

As a result of the long-term funding used in the FFELP Loan portfolio and the insurance and guarantees provided on these loans, the portfolio generates consistent and predictable cash flows and the capital we choose to allocate to the segment is modest. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 78 percent of the FFELP Loans held by Navient were funded to term with non-recourse, long-term securitization debt. 

The Higher Education Act of 1965 (&#147;HEA&#148;) continues to regulate every aspect of FFELP Loans, including ongoing communications with borrowers and default aversion requirements. Failure to service FFELP Loans properly could jeopardize the insurance, guarantees and federal support on these loans. The insurance and guarantees on Navient&#146;s existing FFELP Loans were not affected by the termination of FFELP originations. 

Private Education Loans Segment 

In this segment, we acquire, finance and service our Private Education Loans. Even though we no longer originate Private Education Loans, we continue to pursue acquisitions of Private Education Loan portfolios that leverage our servicing scale and generate incremental earnings and cash flow. In this segment, we primarily earn net interest income on the Private Education Loan portfolio (after provision for loan losses). This segment is expected to generate significant amounts of earnings and cash flow as the portfolio amortizes. 

We are currently the largest holder of Private Education Loans. Navient&#146;s portfolio of Private Education Loans as of December 31, 2015 was $26.4 billion and we anticipate that this Private Education Loan portfolio will have an amortization period in excess of 20 years and a 7-year remaining weighted average life. Navient&#146;s goal is to maximize and optimize the timing of the cash flows generated by its Private Education Loan portfolio. 

&#160; 

Navient also seeks to acquire Private Education Loan portfolios from third parties to add net interest income. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 62 percent of the Private Education Loans held by Navient were funded to term with non-recourse, long-term securitization debt. 

Unlike FFELP Loans, the holder of a Private Education Loan bears the full credit risk of the borrower and any cosigner. Navient believes the credit risk of the Private Education Loans it owns is well managed through the rigorous underwriting practices and risk-based pricing utilized when the loans were originated, the continued high levels of qualified cosigners and our internal servicing and risk mitigation practices, as well as our careful use of forbearance and loan modification programs. Navient believes that the existence of these elements and the use of these practices when taken together reduces the risk of payment interruptions and defaults on its Private Education Loan portfolio. In the second quarter of 2015, we changed our assumptions related to estimated recoveries and as a result, the portion of the loan amount charged off at default increased from 73 percent to 79 percent. This change resulted in a $330 million reduction to the balance of the receivable for partially charged-off loans. Excluding this amount, on a &#147;Core Earnings&#148; basis the 2015 charge-off rate for Private Education Loans as a percentage of loans in repayment was 2.6 percent. 

Business Services Segment 

Our Business Services segment generates revenue from servicing, asset recovery and business processing activities. Within this segment, we primarily generate revenue from servicing our FFELP Loan portfolio as well as servicing education loans for Guarantors of FFELP Loans and other institutions, including ED. We provide asset recovery services for loans and receivables on behalf of Guarantors of FFELP Loans, higher education institutions and federal, state, court and municipal clients. In addition, we provide business processing services on behalf of municipalities, public authorities and hospitals. 

In February 2015, Navient completed the acquisition of Gila LLC, an asset recovery and business processing firm. The firm provides receivables management services and account processing solutions for state governments, agencies, court systems and municipalities. In October 2015, Navient completed the acquisition of Xtend Healthcare, a health care revenue cycle management company. The firm provides health insurance claims billing and account resolution, as well as patient billing and customer service. The acquisitions of Gila LLC and Xtend Healthcare expanded Navient&#146;s capabilities into new geographies and sectors. 

We provide asset recovery and business processing services for over 1,000 clients, working with a broad spectrum of asset classes. This market is highly fragmented and provides attractive organic growth opportunities. As of December 31, 2015, Navient had an outstanding inventory of asset recovery receivables of approximately $20.2 billion, of which $9.9 billion was attributable to asset classes unrelated to education loans, an increase of $7.0 billion from December 31, 2014. Non-federal education loan related asset recovery revenues increased from $49 million in 2014 to $118 million in 2015. 

Federal Education Loan Related Revenues 

In 2015, federal education loan (FFELP and ED) related revenues in the business services segment accounted for 87 percent of total Business Services segment revenues compared with 94 percent in 2014. Total Business Services segment revenues were $1.02 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, down from $1.06 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014. 

Navient is currently the largest servicer and collector of loans made under the FFELP program, and the majority of our income has been derived, directly or indirectly, from our portfolio of FFELP Loans and the servicing and asset recovery we have provided for Guarantors and third-party owners of FFELP Loans. In 2010, Congress passed legislation ending the origination of education loans under FFELP. The terms and conditions of 

&#160; 

existing FFELP Loans were not affected by this legislation. We anticipate that the revenue we earn from providing servicing and asset recovery services on FFELP Loans will decline over time. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Servicing revenues from the FFELP Loans we own represent intercompany charges to the FFELP Loans segment at rates paid to us by the securitization trusts which own the loans. These fees are contractually the first payment priority of the trusts after the payment of the trustee fees and exceed the actual cost of servicing the loans. Intercompany loan servicing revenues declined to $427 million in 2015 from $456 million in 2014. Intercompany loan servicing revenues will continue to decline as our FFELP Loan portfolio amortizes. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; In 2015, we earned account maintenance fees on FFELP Loans serviced for Guarantors of $33 million, down from $36 million in 2014. These fees will continue to decline as the underlying FFELP Loan portfolio serviced for Guarantors amortizes. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; As of December 31, 2015, we provide asset recovery (default aversion, post-default collections and claims processing) to 11 of the 29 Guarantor agencies that serve as intermediaries between the U.S. federal government and FFELP lenders and are responsible for paying the claims made on defaulted loans. In 2015, asset recovery revenue from Guarantor clients totaled $209 million, compared to $275 million the prior year. As FFELP Loans are no longer originated, these revenues will decline over time unless we add additional Guarantor clients. The rate at which these revenues will decrease has also been affected by the Bipartisan Budget Act (the &#147;Budget Act&#148;) enacted on December 26, 2013 and effective on July 1, 2014, which reduced the amount to be paid to Guarantor agencies for assisting customers to rehabilitate their defaulted FFELP Loans under Section 428F of the HEA. This aspect of the Budget Act reduced our revenue by approximately $79 million in 2015 compared to 2014. 

Since 2009 when we were selected through a competitive bidding process, Navient has been one of four TIVAS that provides customer service for federal loans owned by ED. This contract has been extended through 2019. Under the terms of the contract extension, the allocation of new borrower volume is determined twice each year based on the relative performance of the servicers of five metrics: borrowers in current repayment status (30 percent), borrowers more than 90 but less than 271 days delinquent (15 percent), borrowers 271 days or more up to 360 days delinquent (15 percent), a survey of borrowers (35 percent), and a survey of ED personnel (5 percent). In 2015, other state-based not-for-profit servicers that had previously received a contract through a legislative, no-bid process began to receive a 26 percent allocation of total new borrowers, leaving a 74 percent allocation to the TIVAS. In the last allocation, Navient received 15 percent of new loan volume. In December 2015, Congress passed legislation that requires an allocation system to award new loan volume to all the servicers including both TIVAS and the not-for-profit servicers on the basis of their performance utilizing established common metrics, and on the basis of the capacity of each servicer to process new and existing accounts. ED has previously indicated that the portfolios of the not-for-profit servicers and the TIVAS cannot be compared due to differences in the borrower composition of the portfolios. ED has not yet announced how it will implement the requirement to ensure capacity and common metrics. It is possible that Navient&#146;s market share of new borrowers would decline. Under this servicing contract as of December 31, 2015, we service approximately 6.3 million accounts or $186.0 billion in loans. We earned $139 million of revenue under the contract for the year ended December 31, 2015. We continually strive to help our customers succeed and seek to improve on the performance metrics that determine the allocation of new accounts under the servicing contract with ED. ED has said that it intends to start a rebidding process for these servicing contracts sometime in 2016. 

Other Segment 

Our Other segment primarily consists of activities of our holding company, including the repurchase of debt, our corporate liquidity portfolio, unallocated overhead and regulatory-related costs. We also include results from certain smaller wind-down operations within this segment. 

Employees 

At December 31, 2015, we had approximately 7,300 employees. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. 

&#160; 

Spin-Off of Navient 

On April 30, 2014, the spin-off of Navient from SLM Corporation (the &#147;Spin-Off&#148;) was completed and Navient became an independent, publicly traded company focused on loan management, servicing and asset recovery. The separation was completed through the distribution of 100 percent of the outstanding shares of Navient common stock, on the basis of one share of Navient common stock for each share of SLM Corporation common stock. SLM Corporation continues operation as a separate publicly traded company and includes Sallie Mae Bank. 

Due to the relative significance of Navient to SLM Corporation prior to the Spin-Off, for financial reporting purposes, Navient is treated as the &#147;accounting spinnor&#148; and therefore is the &#147;accounting successor&#148; to SLM Corporation as constituted prior to the Spin-Off, notwithstanding the legal form of the Spin-Off. Since Navient is the accounting successor, the historical financial statements of SLM Corporation prior to the Spin-Off are the historical financial statements of Navient. As a result, the GAAP financial results reported in this Annual Report on Form 10-K include the historical financial results of SLM Corporation prior to the Spin-Off on April 30, 2014 (i.e., such consolidated results include our loan management, servicing and asset recovery business and the consumer banking business associated with Sallie Mae Bank (&#147;SLM BankCo&#148;)) and reflect the deemed distribution of SLM BankCo to SLM Corporation&#146;s stockholders on April 30, 2014. 

The following table shows the condensed balance sheet of SLM BankCo that the financial statements of Navient reflect as a shareholder distribution on April 30, 2014:

&#160; (2) &#160; In addition to the $1,710 million of consumer banking business net assets distributed, we also removed $41 million of goodwill from our balance sheet as required under Accounting Standards Codification (&#147;ASC&#148;) 350, &#147;Intangibles &#150; Goodwill and Other,&#148; in connection with the distribution. This goodwill was allocated to the consumer banking business based on relative fair value. This total of $1,751 million is the amount that appears on our consolidated statement of changes in stockholders&#146; equity in connection with the deemed distribution of the consumer banking business. 

As previously reported, in connection with the Spin-Off, three publicly-traded series of senior unsecured notes listed on NASDAQ and originally issued by SLM Corporation (and its predecessors in interest) became obligations of Navient. These notes are commonly known as (a) Medium Term Notes, Series A, CPI-Linked 

&#160; 

Notes due 2017, (NASDAQ: OSM / CUSIP: 78442P403), (b) Medium Term Notes, Series A, CPI-Linked Notes due 2018 (NASDAQ: ISM / CUSIP: 78442P601), and (c) 6% Senior Notes due December 15, 2043 (NASDAQ: JSM / CUSIP: 78442P304). Navient&#146;s status as the successor to the original issuer of these notes has been previously reported, however, one of the Company&#146;s prior filings with the SEC inadvertently (a) omitted a reference to these notes as listed securities of the Company, and (b) included a reference to two other series of senior unsecured notes issued by the Company that are in fact not listed, commonly known as 5% Senior Notes due October 26, 2020 and 5.875% Senior Notes due October 25, 2024. 

Supervision and Regulation 

The Dodd-Frank Act 

The Dodd-Frank Act was adopted to reform and strengthen regulation and supervision of the U.S. financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act contains comprehensive provisions to govern the practices and oversight of financial institutions (including large non-bank financial institutions) and other participants in the financial markets. It imposed significant regulations, additional requirements and oversight on almost every aspect of the U.S. financial services industry, including increased capital and liquidity requirements, limits on leverage and enhanced supervisory authority. Some of these provisions apply to Navient and its various businesses. 

The Consumer Financial Protection Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (&#147;CFPB&#148;), which has broad authority to write regulations under federal consumer financial protection laws and to directly or indirectly enforce those laws and examine financial institutions for compliance. The CFPB is authorized to impose fines and provide consumer restitution in the event of violations, engage in consumer financial education, track consumer complaints, request data and promote the availability of financial services to underserved consumers and communities. It has authority to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive practices by issuing regulations that define the same or by using its enforcement authority without first issuing regulations. The CFPB has been active in its supervision, examination and enforcement of financial services companies, most notably bringing enforcement actions, imposing fines and mandating large refunds to customers of several large banking institutions, auto financing companies and debt collection companies. 

The Dodd-Frank Act also authorizes state officials to enforce regulations issued by the CFPB and to enforce the Dodd-Frank Act&#146;s general prohibition against unfair, deceptive and abusive practices. 

Regulatory Outlook 

In general, the number and scope of regulatory and enforcement actions in 2015, as well as the amounts of fines and penalties levied against banking institutions, were significant. The types and numbers of class and stockholder derivative actions arising from allegations of violations of consumer protection and regulatory provisions also continued to increase. A number of prominent themes appear to be emerging from these actions: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The number and configuration of regulators bringing actions often adds to the complexity, cost and unpredictability of timing for resolution of particular regulatory issues. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The regulatory compliance and risk control structures of financial institutions subject to enforcement actions are frequently cited, regardless of whether past practices have been changed, and enforcement orders have often included detailed demands for increased compliance, audit and board supervision, as well as the use of third-party consultants or monitors to recommend further changes or monitor remediation efforts. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Issues first identified with respect to one consumer product class or distribution channel are often applied to other product classes or channels. 

&#160; 

Navient is subject to oversight from several regulatory entities. We expect that the regulators overseeing our businesses will continue to be active and that consumer protection regulations, standards, supervision, examination and enforcement practices will continue to evolve in both detail and scope. This evolution may significantly add to Navient&#146;s compliance, servicing and operating costs. We have invested in compliance through multiple steps including realignment of Navient&#146;s compliance management system to a servicing, collections and business services business model rather than a loan originations business model; dedicated compliance resources for certain topics (such as the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (&#147;SCRA&#148;); the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (&#147;TCPA&#148;); unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts and practices (&#147;UDAAP&#148;); and third-party vendor management) to focus on regulator and consumer expectations; formation of business support operations to enhance risk, control and compliance functions in each business area; additional regulatory training for front-line employees to ensure obligations are understood and followed during interactions with customers as well as additional regulatory training for our board of directors to enhance their ability to oversee the Company&#146;s risk framework and compliance as it and the regulatory environment changes; and expanded oversight and analysis of complaint trends to identify and remediate if necessary, areas of potential consumer harm. 

While current operations and compliance processes may or may not satisfy heightened, evolving regulatory standards, they cannot provide assurance that past practices or products will not be the focus of examinations, inquiries or lawsuits. 

As described in Item 7. &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#151; Risk Management,&#148; Navient has implemented a coordinated, formal enterprise risk management system aimed at reducing business and regulatory risks. 

Listed below are some of the most significant recent and pending regulatory changes that have the potential to affect Navient. 

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau . The CFPB has oversight of the private education loan industry as well as education loan servicers. The CFPB has been active in the education loan industry and undertook a number of initiatives in 2013, 2014 and 2015 relative to the private education loan market and education loan servicing, including: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; In February 2013, the CFPB published a notice soliciting information on potential options to offer more affordable repayment options to borrowers having difficulty repaying their private education loans. Based on the more than 28,000 comments received, on May 8, 2013, the CFPB published a report highlighting the ways in which private education loan debt can be a roadblock to financial soundness for consumers. The report analyzes the impact of private education loan burdens on the broader economy, assesses recent actions of policymakers in the education loan market and discusses policy options put forth by the public regarding private education loans. Reports such as these may continue to influence regulatory developments in the education loan market. The report proposes a number of considerations for policymakers and market participants, such as refinancing relief and monthly payments more closely correlated with a borrower&#146;s debt-to-income ratio. Certain of these CFPB recommendations in the report could negatively affect our private education loan portfolio if implemented. For a discussion on Navient&#146;s approach to helping its customers, see &#147;&#151; Navient&#146;s Approach to Helping Education Loan Borrowers Achieve Success&#148; above. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; On December 3, 2013, the CFPB issued a final rule defining larger participants of the education loan servicing market. The rule, which became effective on March 1, 2014, allows the CFPB to federally supervise certain nonbank education loan servicers for the first time. Under the final rule, the CFPB has supervisory authority over any nonbank education loan servicer that services more than one million borrower accounts, including accounts for both private and federal education loans. Our education loan servicing subsidiaries will be subject to this new oversight. The CFPB&#146;s supervision will include gathering reports, conducting examinations for compliance with federal consumer financial laws and taking enforcement actions as appropriate. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; On October 16, 2014, the Student Loan Ombudsman within the CFPB submitted his annual report based on private education loan inquiries and complaints received through the CFPB portal from October 1, 

&#160; 

&#160; 2013 through September 30, 2014. The CFPB does not seek to resolve or substantiate the inquiry or complaint but merely provides a gateway between the consumer and the lender or servicer to attempt to address consumer concerns. The Dodd-Frank Act created the Student Loan Ombudsman within the CFPB to receive and attempt to informally resolve inquiries about private education loans. The Student Loan Ombudsman reports to Congress annually on the trends and issues that he identifies through this process. The report offers analysis, commentary and recommendations to address issues reported by consumers. The report&#146;s key observations included: (1) approximately 41 percent of all private education loan inquiries and complaints received were related to consumers seeking a loan modification or other option to reduce their monthly payment; (2) 57 percent related to consumers having difficulties dealing with their servicer or repaying their loan; and (3) many of the private education loan inquiries mirror the problems experienced by consumers in the mortgage market and that recent changes to mortgage servicing and credit card servicing practices might be applicable to the private education loan market. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; On May 14, 2015, the CFPB issued a Request for Information (&#147;RFI&#148;) about student loan servicing practices. The RFI identified a number of potential systemic problems with student loan servicing, and sought public comment from market participants regarding issues that the CFPB believe were identified through consumer complaints including: (1) delays in payment posting, which can result in increased accrued interest; (2) application of overpayments across all loans, instead of to the loans with the highest interest rates; (3) application of partial payments in a manner that maximizes late fees; (4) failure to correct payment processing or other errors in a timely fashion; (5) lost paperwork submitted to process applications for forbearance or alternative payments plans; and (6) issues related to servicing transfers, including failure to notify borrowers of servicing transfers, interruptions in receiving billing statements and other communications, and imposition of late fees when borrowers send payments to their prior servicers. In addition, the RFI focused on the payment arrangements between lenders and loan servicing companies. The CFPB expressed concern that these contracts create economic incentives for servicers to spend as little time as possible on each account, and to keep borrowers in repayment for as long as possible. Finally, the RFI also sought public comment regarding application of consumer protection regulations in the mortgage and credit card industries to student loan servicing. Based on the perceived similarities between student loan servicing and other consumer loan servicing, the RFI suggested that implementation of regulations designed to protect consumers in the mortgage and credit card markets may be the appropriate response to the purported problems in the student loan servicing market. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; In October 2015, the Student Loan Ombudsman within the CFPB issued its annual report analyzing complaints submitted by consumers with student loans from October 1, 2014 through September 30, 2015. This report highlighted problems experienced by student loan borrowers with older federal student loans made by private lenders. Borrowers continued to submit complaints describing servicing and debt collection practices that create barriers to enroll in alternative repayment plans, including income-driven repayment plans for borrowers with federal loans. The Ombudsman noted that private student loan borrowers report that they encounter servicing problems, including lack of access to timely and accurate information on availability or eligibility criteria to enroll in alternative repayment programs. Complaints from borrowers with federal student loans describe how borrowers attempt to avoid default during a period of financial hardship, but have difficulty finding information about repayment options, including income-driven repayment plans with some borrowers reporting that they did not know they were eligible. The Bureau also received complaints that borrowers who apply for an income-driven repayment plan are held up by paperwork processing delays, receive inconsistent instructions from servicers, or experience difficulty enrolling in these programs. Additionally, the Ombudsman discussed analysis from a voluntary request sent by the Bureau&#146;s Student Loan Ombudsman to certain market participants, asking for data about loans originated under FFELP and held by private investors. The report also recommends compiling regular performance metrics on student loan servicing, including data on delinquencies and defaults as well as data on borrower performance in income-driven repayment plans and that data be compiled and published on a periodic basis to facilitate comparison in performance among student loan servicers. 

&#160; 

Debt Collection Supervision . Consistent with the authority granted to it under the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB also maintains supervisory authority over larger consumer debt collectors. On October 24, 2012, the CFPB issued its final debt collection larger participant rule and examination procedures that will allow the agency to federally supervise larger consumer debt collectors. The rule, which became effective January 2, 2013, defines larger participants as third-party debt collectors, debt buyers and collection attorneys with more than $10 million in annual receipts resulting from consumer debt collection. Under the rule, Navient&#146;s collection subsidiaries are considered larger participants and are subject to supervision. The issuance of the CFPB&#146;s rules does not preempt the various and varied levels of state consumer and collection regulations to which the activities of Navient&#146;s subsidiaries are currently subject. Navient also utilizes third-party debt collectors to collect defaulted and charged-off education loans and will continue to be responsible for oversight of their procedures and controls. 

Oversight of Derivatives . The Dodd-Frank Act created a comprehensive new regulatory framework for derivatives transactions, to be implemented by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (&#147;CFTC&#148;) and the SEC. This framework, among other things, subjects certain swap participants to new capital and margin requirements, recordkeeping and business conduct standards and imposes registration and regulation of swap dealers and major swap participants. The scope of potential exemptions continues to be defined through agency rulemakings. Even where Navient qualifies for an exemption, many of its derivatives counterparties are subject to the new capital, margin and business conduct requirements and therefore Navient&#146;s business may be impacted. 

Other Significant Sources of Regulation 

Many aspects of Navient&#146;s businesses are subject to federal and state regulation and administrative oversight. Some of the most significant of these are described below. 

Higher Education Act . Navient is subject to the HEA and its education loan operations are periodically reviewed by ED and Guarantors. As a servicer of federal education loans, Navient is subject to ED regulations regarding financial responsibility and administrative capability that govern all third-party servicers of insured education loans. In connection with its servicing operations on behalf of Guarantor clients, Navient must comply with ED regulations that govern Guarantor activities as well as agreements for reimbursement between ED and our Guarantor clients. 

Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council . As a third-party service provider to financial institutions, Navient is also subject to periodic examination by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (&#147;FFIEC&#148;). FFIEC is a formal interagency body of the U.S. government empowered to prescribe uniform principles, standards, and report forms for the federal examination of financial institutions by the Federal Reserve Banks (the &#147;FRB&#148;), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the &#147;FDIC&#148;), the National Credit Union Administration, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the CFPB and to make recommendations to promote uniformity in the supervision of financial institutions. 

Consumer Protection and Privacy . Navient&#146;s business servicing FFELP Loans, Private Education Loans and DSLP Loans is subject to federal and state consumer protection, privacy and related laws and regulations and is subject to examination by the CFPB. Some of the more significant federal laws and regulations include: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; various laws governing unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the Truth-In-Lending Act and Regulation Z issued by the FRB, which governs disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the Fair Credit Reporting Act and Regulation V issued by the CFPB, which governs the use and provision of information to consumer reporting agencies; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B issued by the CFPB, which prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the SCRA which applies to all debts incurred prior to commencement of active military service (including education loans) and limits the amount of interest, including certain fees or charges that are related to the obligation or liability; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the TCPA, which governs communication methods that may be used to contact customers. 

&#160; 

Navient&#146;s servicing and asset recovery businesses are subject to federal and state consumer protection, privacy and related laws and regulations, including supervision by the CFPB of larger consumer debt collectors as discussed above. Some of the more significant federal statutes are the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and additional provisions of the acts listed above, as well as the HEA and the various laws and regulations that govern government contractors. These activities are also subject to state laws and regulations similar to the federal laws and regulations listed above.
