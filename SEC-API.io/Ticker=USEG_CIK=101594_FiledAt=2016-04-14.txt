Overview 

&#160; 

U.S. Energy Corp. (&#8220;U.S. Energy&#8221;, the &#8220;Company&#8221;, &#8220;we&#8221; or &#8220;us&#8221;), is a Wyoming corporation organized in 1966. We are an independent energy company focused on the acquisition and development of oil and gas producing properties in the continental United States. Our business activities are currently focused in South Texas and the Williston Basin in North Dakota. However, we do not intend to limit our focus to these geographic areas. We continue to focus on increasing production, reserves, revenues and cash flow from operations while managing our level of debt.

&#160;

We have historically explored for and produced oil and gas through a non-operator business model. As a non-operator, we rely on our operating partners to propose, permit, drill, complete and produce oil and gas wells. Before a well is drilled, the operator provides all oil and gas interest owners in the designated well the opportunity to participate in the drilling and completion costs and revenues of the well on a pro-rata basis. Our operating partners also produce, transport, market and account for all oil and gas production. We are currently developing our capability to operate properties, most notably with the appointment of David Veltri as President and Chief Operating Officer in December 2014. Mr. Veltri, who became our Chief Executive Officer in September 2015, has over 30 years of oil and gas operating experience.

&#160;

We believe that additional value can be generated if we have the ability to operate oil and gas properties because operatorship will allow us to control drilling and production timing, capital costs and future planning of operations. We plan to look for opportunities to operate our own wells in the near future through acquisition of new oil and gas properties and/or by consolidating ownership in and around the areas in which we currently participate. We believe the current price climate will make opportunities available for us to acquire and/or develop operated properties, and our objective is to eventually operate the properties which comprise over 50% of our production.

Oil and Gas Operations 

&#160;

We currently participate in oil and gas projects as a non-operating working interest owner through exploration and development agreements with various oil and gas exploration and production companies. Our working interest varies by project and may change over time based on the terms of our leases and operating agreements. These projects may result in numerous wells being drilled over the next three to five years depending on, among other things, commodity prices and the availability of capital resources required to fund the expenditures. We are also actively pursuing potential acquisitions of exploration, development and production-stage oil and gas properties or companies. Key attributes of our oil and gas properties include the following:

&#160;

&#183; Estimated proved reserves of 2,028,168 BOE (80% oil and 20% natural gas) as of December 31, 2015, with a standardized measure value of $17.8 million. &#183; As of March 21, 2016, our oil and gas leases covered 118,188 gross and 11,524 net acres. &#183; 150 gross (21.22 net) producing wells as of December 31, 2015 and as of March 21, 2016. &#183; 860 BOE per day average net production for 2015. &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

PV10 (defined in &#8220;Glossary of Oil and Gas Terms&#8221;) is a non-GAAP measure that is widely used in the oil and gas industry and is considered by institutional investors and professional analysts when comparing companies. However, PV10 data is not an alternative to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, which is calculated under GAAP and includes the effects of income taxes. The following table reconciles the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows to PV-10 as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 2015 &#160; &#160; 2014 &#160; &#160; 2013 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Standardized measure of discounted net cash flows &#160; $ 17,768 &#160; &#160; $ 81,889 &#160; &#160; $ 104,853 &#160; Plus discounted impact of future income tax expense &#160; &#160; - &#160; &#160; &#160; 3,307 &#160; &#160; &#160; 10,230 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; PV-10 &#160; $ 17,768 &#160; &#160; $ 85,196 &#160; &#160; $ 115,083 &#160; &#160;

Additional information about our standardized measure and the changes during each of the last three years is included in Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.

Activities with Operating Partners 

&#160;

The Company holds a geographically and geologically diverse portfolio of oil-weighted prospects in varying stages of exploration and development. Prospect stages range from prospect origination, including geologic and geophysical mapping, to leasing, exploratory drilling and development. The Company engages in the prospect stages either for its own account or with prospective partners to enlarge its oil and gas lease ownership base.

&#160;

Each of the operators of our principal prospects has a substantial technical staff. We believe that these arrangements currently allow us to deliver value to our shareholders without having to build the full staff of geologists, engineers and land personnel required to work on diverse projects involving horizontal drilling in North Dakota and South Texas and conventional exploration in our Gulf Coast prospects. However, consistent with industry practice with smaller independent oil and gas companies, we also utilize specialized consultants with local expertise as needed. We anticipate that as we establish an operational center in an area, we will hire appropriate resources to supply critical aspects of the operations, such as drilling, completions and production.

&#160;

Presented below is a description of key oil and gas projects with our operating partners:

&#160;

Williston Basin, North Dakota (Bakken and Three Forks Formations) 

&#160;

Statoil ASA. On August 24, 2009, we entered into a Drilling Participation Agreement (the &#8220;DPA&#8221;) with a wholly-owned subsidiary of Brigham Exploration Company (&#8220;Brigham&#8221;) to jointly explore for oil and gas in up to 19,200 gross acres in a portion of Brigham&#8217;s Rough Rider prospect in Williams and McKenzie Counties, North Dakota. Brigham was subsequently acquired by Statoil ASA. As part of the program we have participated in 26 wells and have proven up additional drilling locations depending on the successful development of the Three Forks Formation. These properties currently operated by Statoil comprise approximately 33% of the PV-10 related to our oil and gas reserves. Currently development has stopped due to the commodity price drop and high costs. We expect to develop the remaining acreage in the future when economics allow an acceptable return on capital.

&#160;

The leases in the units are a combination of fee and state leases and all are held by production. In some areas, the rights may be depth limited to the Bakken and the upper part of the Three Fork formations under the terms of the leases obtained by Brigham from third parties, while other leases may have rights to all depths. Working interests earned vary according to Brigham&#8217;s interest.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Zavanna, LLC. In December 2010, we signed two agreements with Zavanna LLC and other parties whereby we acquired 35% of Zavanna&#8217;s working interests in oil and gas leases covering approximately 6,050 net acres in McKenzie County, North Dakota. The total net acres subject to the agreement has increased to 6,500 as a result of subsequent acquisitions from third parties. These properties currently comprise approximately 27% of our oil and gas reserves. The acquired acreage is in two prospects &#8211; the Yellowstone Prospect and the SE HR Prospect. We expect this program will ultimately result in 27 gross 1,280-acre spacing units with the potential for 108 gross Bakken and 108 gross Three Forks wells, based on an assumed four wells per formation in each spacing unit.

&#160;

Effective December 2011, we sold an undivided 75% of our undeveloped acreage in the SE HR Prospect and the Yellowstone Prospect to GeoResources, Inc. and Yuma Exploration and Production Company, Inc. Under the terms of the agreement, we retained the remaining 25% interest in the undeveloped acreage and our original working interest in 10 completed wells in the SE HR and Yellowstone prospects. Our working interest in the remaining locations will be approximately 8.75% and net revenue interests in new wells after the sale are expected to be in the range of 6.7% to 7.0%, proportionately reduced depending on Zavanna&#8217;s actual working interest percentages. These properties operated by Zavanna currently comprise approximately 25% of the PV-10 related to our oil and gas reserves.

&#160;

Texas and Louisiana (Gulf Coast) 

&#160;

Contango Oil and Gas Company (Eagle Ford Shale) . In February 2011, we entered into a participation agreement with Crimson Exploration Inc. (&#8220;Crimson&#8221;) to acquire a 30% working interest in an oil prospect and associated leases located in Zavala County, Texas (the &#8220;Leona River prospect&#8221;). Crimson was subsequently acquired by Contango Oil and Gas Company (&#8220;Contango&#8221;). Under the terms of the agreement, we earned a 30% working interest (22.5% net revenue interest) in approximately 4,675 gross contiguous acres (1,402 net mineral acres) through a combination of a cash payment and commitment well carry. All future drilling and leasing will be on a heads up basis with no carry by us. The prospect is an Eagle Ford shale oil window target in Zavala County, Texas. Two wells were drilled by Crimson to a total depth of approximately 12,500 feet (approximately 6,000 feet vertical and 6,500 feet horizontal) at the Leona River prospect. These producing wells hold the remaining development acreage.

&#160;

In June 2011, we entered into a second participation agreement with Crimson to acquire an interest in an Eagle Ford oil prospect and associated leases located in Zavala and Dimmit Counties, Texas (the &#8220;Booth Tortuga prospect&#8221;). Under the terms of this second agreement with Crimson, we have acquired 30% of Crimson&#8217;s working interest (approximately 22.5% net revenue interest) in approximately 7,186 gross acres (2,156 net).

&#160;

Contango is currently the operator of the Leona River and Booth Tortuga prospects. All of the leases are currently held by production and comprise approximately 20% of the PV-10 related to our oil and gas reserves. Currently, our total acreage in the Leona River prospect and the Booth Tortuga prospect is approximately 11,861 gross acres (3,558 net). Based upon expected 120-acre spacing units, there is the potential for up to 98 gross and 30 net Eagle Ford drilling locations. Looking forward, we continue to seek additional leasing opportunities in the Eagle Ford oil window jointly with Crimson.

&#160;

PetroQuest Energy, Inc. We have an interest in three natural gas and oil producing wells with PetroQuest Energy, Inc. (&#8220;PetroQuest&#8221;) in Coastal Louisiana, with working interests of 11.9% (8.3% net revenue interest), 50.0% (36.0% net revenue interest) and 17.0% (12.75% net revenue interest). Two wells are currently shut-in. During January 2016, sole producing well averaged daily production of 838 MMCFD. Petro-Quest operates the wells. These properties operated by PetroQuest currently comprise approximately 7% of the PV-10 related to our oil and gas reserves.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Forward Plan 

&#160;

In 2016 and beyond, we intend to seek additional opportunities in the oil and gas sector, including but not limited to further acquisition of assets, participation with current and new industry partners in their exploration and development projects, acquisition of operating companies, and the purchase and exploration of new acreage positions.

&#160;

Mining Activities 

&#160;

As discussed in Note 6 to the audited financial statement included in Item 8 of this report and Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Item 7 of this report, in February 2016 we disposed of our Mt. Emmons Project located near Crested Butte, Colorado rather than continuing our long-term development strategy. Accordingly, our mining assets and operations have been treated as discontinued operations as of December 31, 2015 and for all prior periods presented in our financial statements.
