 Item 1. Business. 

&#160;

Thunder Energies Corporation f/k/a Thunder Fusion Corporation and CCJ Acquisition Corp. ("we", "us", "our", ("TEC" or the "Company") was incorporated in the State of Florida on April 21, 2011. Since inception, which was April 21, 2011, the Company has been engaged in organizational efforts and obtaining initial financing. The Company was formed as a vehicle to pursue a business combination and had made no efforts to identify a possible business combination. The business purpose of the Company had been to seek the acquisition of or merger with, and existing company. The Company selected December 31 as its fiscal year end. 

&#160;

As of July 1, 2013, the Company, based on proposed business activities, was a "blank check" company. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") defines those companies as "any development stage company that is issuing a penny stock, within the meaning of Section 3 (a)(51) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and that has no specific business plan or purpose, or has indicated that its business plan is to merge with an unidentified company or companies." Under SEC Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, the Company also qualified as a "shell company," because it had no or nominal assets (other than cash) and no or nominal operations. Many states have enacted statutes, rules and regulations limiting the sale of securities of "blank check" companies in their respective jurisdictions. 

&#160;

The Company was organized as a vehicle to investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire a target company or business seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation. As of July 31, 2013, the Company had not entered into any definitive agreement with any party, nor had there been any specific discussions with any potential business combination candidate regarding business opportunities for the Company. Subsequent to our year-end we were subject to a change in control which has resulted in the new majority shareholder and our board of director members causing assets to be assigned to the Company. 

&#160;

On July 25, 2013, Dr. Ruggero M. Santilli acquired from Company's existing shareholders, a control block of stock in the Company consisting of two million nine hundred forty thousand (2,940,000) shares of restricted common stock of the Company, in a private equity transaction. As a result of this acquisition, Dr. Ruggero M. Santilli owned 98% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company. 

&#160;

On August 10, 2013, the Company entered into an Asset Assignment Agreement (the "IBR Assignment Agreement") with Institute For Basic Research, Inc., a Florida corporation ("IBR") that also is beneficially controlled by our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Ruggero M. Santilli. Pursuant to the IBR Assignment Agreement, IBR irrevocably assigned to the Company all rights, title, ownership and interests in all of IBR's internet website domain name assets, owned and hereinafter acquired by IBR including, but not limited to, all physical and intangible assets and intellectual property related to the assets. 

&#160;

On August 11, 2013, Thunder Energies Corporation (the "Company") entered into an Asset Assignment Agreement (the "Assignment Agreement") with HyFuels, Inc., a Florida corporation ("HyFuels") beneficially controlled by our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Ruggero M. Santilli. Pursuant to the Assignment Agreement, HyFuels irrevocably assigned to the Company all physical assets, intangible assets, accounts receivable, intellectual property, accounting software, billing software, client lists, client prospects, trade secrets, proprietary property, the intellectual and physical property known as intermediate nuclear fusion without radiation, the physical property consisting of seven (7) Hadronic reactors, all copyrights, patents, patent applications, patent assignments, trademarks and anything having commercial or exchange value and the like. 

&#160;

Consideration for the assignment agreements consisted ofone million (1,000,000) shares of our common stock that were issued to Dr. Ruggero M. Santilli, as designee for IBR and HyFuels. Company management determined the amount of consideration based upon ASC 845-10-S99 pertaining to transfer of non-monetary assets. According to ASC 845-10-S99, transfers of non-monetary assets to a company by its promoters or shareholders in exchange for stock prior to or at the time of the entity's initial public offering should be recorded at the transferors' historical cost basis determined under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. As such, the cost basis carried on the books and records of HyFuels and IBR was minimal or essentially zero. Therefore, the accounting principles in ASC 845-10-S99 were followed and the Company recorded the intellectual and physical properties at its historical cost basis, which was at the historical cost basis of a nominal amount. In connection with the aforementioned assignment agreements, 1,000,000 shares of our common stock were transferred in exchange for the assets. The transfer was valued at one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), the value of the shares issued at par ($0.001) in exchange for the assets. This amount was determined by the Company to be de-minimus to the value received in the exchange and approximates the basis of those assets. 

&#160;

&#160; &#160;

The Company has recorded the property and intangibles (7 reactors, intellectual property rights to develop the technology, and website) as an intangible asset. The valuation of the properties will be the par value of the stock received in exchange for the rights and assets. The Company's filings will include a disclosure in the MD&#38;A section and notes to the financial statement under the heading "Non-Monetary Transaction". Management believes that the $1,000.00 valuation is reflective of the salvage value of the physical property, at a minimum. Our Company purchased internet website domain name assets owned by IBR and the intellectual and physical property known as intermediate nuclear fusion without radiation, the physical property consisting of seven (7) Hadronic reactors, all copyrights, patents, patent applications, patent assignments, trademarks and anything having commercial or exchange value owned by HyFuels as related to the reactors. None of the assets purchased had ever generated revenue for IBR or HyFuels. Although the Asset Assignment Agreements were more comprehensive in their description of "assets", the aforementioned items were the only assets assigned to the Company. 

&#160;

Our Company purchased internet website domain name assets owned by IBR and the intellectual and physical property known as intermediate nuclear fusion without radiation, the physical property consisting of seven (7) Hadronic reactors, all copyrights, patents, patent applications, patent assignments, trademarks and anything having commercial or exchange value owned by HyFuels as related to the reactors. None of the assets purchased had ever generated revenue for IBR or HyFuels. Although the Asset Assignment Agreements were more comprehensive in their description of "assets", the aforementioned items were the only assets assigned to the Company. 

&#160;

A further description of the assignors, IBR and HyFuels, follows. IBR is a Florida Corporation whose only business operations are the publication of an internet blog relating to scientific and academic matters. IBR does not generate revenue and has no expenses. Furthermore, IBR has never maintained a checking account. This status has been consistent over the last several years. Our Chief Executive Officer and Director, Dr. Ruggero M. Santilli is president and a director for IBR. IBR does not have any ownership interest in any of our securities. 

&#160;

HyFuels is a Florida corporation that utilized research and development funds to create the seven Hadronic reactors, but otherwise has no business operations since its inception. Its sole purpose is to serve as a patent holding company. Our Chief Executive Officer and Director, Dr. Ruggero M. Santilli is president and a director for HyFuels. HyFuels also does not have any ownership interest in any of our securities. 

&#160;

Neither IBR nor HyFuels has made any effort to commercialize the assets for purposes of generating revenue. Both IBR and HyFuels continue to exist as Florida corporations separate and distinct from the Company. Though they are deemed "related" entities through a common officer and director with our Company, they remain otherwise "unaffiliated" with our Company. 

&#160;

IBR maintains its principal place of business at 90 East Winds Court, Palm Harbor, Florida 34689. HyFuels maintains its principal place of business at 35246 US Highway 19 North, #215, Palm Harbor, Florida 34684. There is no continuity of facilities with the Company. 

&#160;

Neither IBR nor HyFuels had an employee base, a distribution system, a sales force, a customer base, production techniques or trade names associated with the assets. Their ownership rights may arguably be referred to as operating rights but there were essentially no operations associated with the assets. 

&#160;

The only activities of the assignors involved the creation of the Internet website domain names and the creation of the seven Hadronic reactors and associated patents pending. These assets did not generate revenue prior to the assignment, so there is essentially no financial data to report regarding "revenue producing activity previously associated with the acquired assets". Furthermore, there is no "sufficient continuity of operations with our Company so that disclosure of prior financial information regarding IBR or HyFuels is material to an understanding of future operations regarding our Company.

Description of Business, Principal Products, Services 

&#160;

The business of Thunder Energies Corporation ("TEC") is focused on the development of a new clean combustion of fossil fuels (oil, diesel, coal, etc.) with controlled minimal contaminants in the exhaust. Our business objective is achieved via new forms of processing fossil fuels, new additives to the combustion and the assistance of a high voltage electric discharges (patents pending) that burn combustible contaminants in fossil fuel exhaust while providing added on clean energy. The expected principal product, depending on funding, is a new type of furnace for the clean combustion of fossil fuel available in any desired size for any type of energy application, from home heating to large plants for the clean production of electricity. The expected services are to be rendered by providing technical assistance to the market consisting of existing fossil fuel electric power plants for their decrease of pollutants in the exhaust and their verification of EPA regulations on the release of contaminants in the atmosphere. A prototype new furnace is expected to be available within one year following the availability of the necessary funds. As we are a development stage company, we have not yet generated any revenue from the assets that were recently assigned to and acquired by the Company, including the Hadronic reactors. The Hadronic reactors have been utilized to test and confirm the technology for ultimate inclusion in the new furnaces. Thunder Energies Corp. is a developer of new technologies that are being brought to market by three divisions: 1) Division of Optical Instruments (TEC-DOI); 2) Division of Nuclear Instruments (TEC-DNI); and 3) Division of Fuel Combustion (TEC--DFC). All intellectual properties, including patents, patent applications, domain names, copyrights, know how, etc., are exclusively and irrevocably owned by Thunder Energies Corp. without any royalty payments. Out of the three divisions, TEC-DOE has initiated production and sale of pairs of Galileo and Santilli telescopes with 70 mm, 100 mm, and 150 mm. The remaining two divisions are expecting funding for their commercialization. 

&#160;

Distribution Methods Of The Products and Services 

&#160;

For this first division TEC-DOE we have initiated advertisement via direct e-mail and public news releases. Initially, we anticipate marketing via large advertisements on the internet, such as via PRWeb and PRNewswire Releases. For the other two divisions we expect to market through contacts that we are able to generate, and via direct contacts of potential buyers of TEC new fossil fuel furnaces or TEC services for the improvement of existing fossil fuel burning plants. 

&#160;

Status of Any Publicly Announced New Product Or Service 

&#160;

In regard to the sale of telescopes, we have made several news releases and radio interviews. In addition we have presented all TEC technologies to investors' conferences. For the other two divisions TEC-DNE and TEC-DFC the company contemplates no advertisement until the availability of production equipment. We have, however, published scientific papers on the new sciences underlying the Combustion and Nuclear Divisions. 

&#160;

Competitive Business Conditions And The Smaller Reporting Company's Competitive Position In The Industry And Methods Of Competition 

&#160;

There are no known competitors for the new telescopes with concave lenses produced and sold by TEC-DOE. There exist many types of furnaces for the combustion of fossil fuels but they are all based on conventional combustion of fossil fuels and then the removal of contaminants in the exhaust. By contrast, the main function of TEC furnaces is that of improving the combustion with consequential reduction of contaminants in the exhaust while increasing the energy output for the same fossil fuel. There is no known competition for the detection of fissionable material via a thermal neutron source under development by TEC-DNE. &#160;

&#160; 6 

&#160; 

&#160; Sources And Availability Of Raw Materials And The Names Of Principal Suppliers 

&#160;

The company has selected qualified manufacturers for the telescopes of TEC-DOE. All components for the new telescope are readily available on the open market. Suppliers are available for the other two technologies and will be selected following completion of their development. The raw material needed by the TEC furnaces is given by conventional fossil fuels all available in the U.S.A. by a large number of suppliers. 

&#160;

Dependence On One Or A Few Customers 

&#160;

There are many potential customers for the pair of telescopes produced by the. TEC-DOE division. Our marketing analysis has identified the potential customers in all individuals and associations interested in sky watching. For the other two technologies, we have not yet performed market analysis. 

&#160;

Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, Franchises, Concessions, Royalty Agreements Or Labor Contracts, Including Duration 

&#160;

A first patent application is pending, while additional patent applications are expected depending on funding. Trademarks are expected to be applied for depending on funding. No franchisee or license is expected during the first three years of operation. Labor contracts for employees are planned for implementation following legal assistance and decisions by our Board of Directors. 

&#160;

Need For Any Government Approval Of Principal Products Or Services 

&#160;

No governmental approval or permits are necessary for the telescopes. No governmental approval or permits is expected for the development of the new furnaces for the clean combustion of fossil fuels. Following their availability, the TEC furnaces will be subject to and must comply with applicable EPA requirements for permitted levels of contaminants in the exhaust. In regard to the neutron source we need to further analyze the requirements 

&#160;

Effect Of Existing Or Probable Governmental Regulations On The Business 

&#160;

There are no governmental regulations affecting the sale of the telescope technology. Due to its novel conception, a principal objective of TEC furnaces is that of surpassing current EPA requirements for the contaminants in the combustion exhaust released in the atmosphere. We expect that the neutron source technology will be government regulated and we are in the process of analyzing and assessing the impact of such regulations on the business. &#160;

Estimate Of The Amount Of Money Spent During Each Of The Last Two Fiscal Years On Research And Development 

&#160;

There have been no funds expended by the Company on research and development in the last two fiscal years. All funding for the development of our products to date has been derived from related entities, IBR and HyFuels, which are beneficially controlled by our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Ruggero M. Santilli. 

&#160;

Costs and Effects Of Compliance With Environmental Laws 

&#160;

There are no environmental laws affecting the sale of pairs of telescopes as we simply assemble telescopes, cameras and proprietary concave lenses. We are unable to estimate the costs and effects of compliance with environmental laws prior to completion of a TEC prototype furnace. 

&#160;

Number Of Total Employees And Number Of Full-Time Employees 

&#160;

At this time, the Company has two full time employees and five persons working part time in various functions. 

&#160; 

Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company 

&#160;

We qualify as an emerging growth company as that term is used in the JOBS Act. An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other burdens that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include: 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

A requirement to have only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related MD&#38;A;

&#160;

&#183; 

Exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of the emerging growth company's internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;

&#160;

&#183; 

Reduced disclosure about the emerging growth company's executive compensation arrangements; and

&#160;

&#183; 

No non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements.

&#160;

We have already taken advantage of these reduced reporting burdens in this Form 10-K, which are also available to us as a smaller reporting company as defined under Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). 

&#160;

&#160; 8 

&#160; &#160;

In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We are choosing to utilize the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of the JOBS Act. This election allows our Company to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. 

&#160;

We could remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a "large accelerated filer" as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period. 

&#160;

We are a reporting company and file all reports required under sections 13 and 15d of the Exchange Act. 

&#160;
