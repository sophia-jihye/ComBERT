 ITEM 1. Business 

The Company 

Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc. (&#8220;the Company&#8221;), a Delaware corporation, provides clients with advertising opportunities through billboards, street furniture displays, transit displays and other out-of-home advertising displays, such as wallscapes and spectaculars, which we own or operate in key markets worldwide. Our business consists of two reportable operating segments: Americas and International. As of December 31, 2015, we owned or operated more than 650,000 advertising displays worldwide. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we generated consolidated revenue of approximately $2.8 billion, with $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion from our Americas and International segments, respectively. 

&#160; 

Our History 

We were incorporated in August 1995 under the name &#8220;Eller Media Company.&#8221; In 1997, Clear Channel Communications, Inc., now iHeartCommunications, Inc. (&#8220;iHeartCommunications&#8221;), our parent company, entered the outdoor advertising industry with its acquisition of Eller Media Company. We changed our name to Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc. in August 2005. 

&#160; 

On November 11, 2005, we became a publicly traded company through an initial public offering, or IPO, in which we sold 10%, or 35.0 million shares, of our Class A common stock. Prior to our IPO, we were an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of iHeartCommunications. As of December 31, 2015, iHeartCommunications, through its subsidiaries, owned all of our outstanding shares of Class B common stock and 10,726,917 shares of our Class A common stock, collectively representing approximately 90% of the outstanding shares of our common stock and approximately 99% of the total voting power of our common stock. 

&#160; 

Prior to or at the time of our IPO, we entered into agreements with iHeartCommunications that govern the relationship between iHeartCommunications and us and provide for, among other things, the provision of services by iHeartCommunications to us and the allocation of employee benefit, tax and other liabilities and obligations attributable to our operations. These agreements include the Master Agreement, Corporate Services Agreement, Employee Matters Agreement, Tax Matters Agreement and Trademark License Agreement. All of the agreements relating to our ongoing relationship with iHeartCommunications were made in the context of a parent-subsidiary relationship and the terms of these agreements may be more or less favorable to us than if they had been negotiated with unaffiliated third parties. 

&#160; 

iHeartCommunications has the right to terminate these agreements in various circumstances. As of the date of the filing of this report, no notice of termination of any of these agreements has been received from iHeartCommunications. 

&#160; 

As long as iHeartCommunications continues to own shares of our common stock representing more than 50% of the total voting power of our common stock, it will have the ability to direct the election of all members of our Board of Directors and, therefore, to exercise a controlling influence over our business and affairs, including any determinations with respect to mergers or other business combinations, our acquisition or disposition of assets, our incurrence of indebtedness, our issuance of any additional common stock or other equity securities, our repurchase or redemption of common stock or any preferred stock, if applicable, and our payment of dividends in certain situations. Similarly, iHeartCommunications will have the power to determine the outcome of matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, including the power to prevent an acquisition or any other change in control, and to take other actions that might be favorable to iHeartCommunications. 

&#160; 

On July 30, 2008, iHeartCommunications completed its merger with a subsidiary of CC Media Holdings, Inc., now iHeartMedia, Inc. (&#8220;iHeartMedia&#8221;), a company formed by a group of private equity funds sponsored by Bain Capital Partners, LLC and Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P. iHeartCommunications is now owned indirectly by iHeartMedia. 

&#160; 

Our corporate headquarters are in San Antonio, Texas and we have executive offices in New York, New York. Our headquarters are located at 200 East Basse Road, Suite 100, San Antonio, Texas 78209 (telephone: 210-822-2828). 

&#160; 

Our Business Segments 

We have two reportable business segments, Americas outdoor advertising (&#8220;Americas&#8221;) and International outdoor advertising (&#8220;International&#8221;) , which represented 48% and 52% of our 2015 revenue, respectively. 

&#160; 

We are a leading global outdoor advertising company providing clients with advertising opportunities through billboards, street furniture displays, transit displays and other out-of-home advertising displays. Through our extensive display inventory, we have the ability to deliver innovative, effective marketing campaigns for advertisers and marketing, creative and strategic partners in 

&#160; 

communities across the Americas and internationally. 

&#160; 

We focus on building the leadership position of our diverse global assets and maximizing our financial performance while serving our local communities. We intend to continue to execute upon our long-standing outdoor advertising strategies, while closely managing expenses and focusing on achieving operating efficiencies throughout our businesses. Part of our long-term strategy is to pursue the technology of digital displays, including flat screens, LCDs and LEDs, as additions to traditional methods of displaying our clients&#8217; advertisements. We are currently installing these technologies in certain markets, both domestically and internationally. 

&#160; 

For more information about our revenue, gross profit and assets by segment and our revenue and long-lived assets by geographic area, see Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements located in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

&#160; 

Americas Outdoor Advertising 

We are one of the largest outdoor advertising companies in North America (based on revenues), which includes the United States, Canada and Latin America. Approximately 90% of our revenue in our Americas segment was derived from the United States in each of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. As of December 31, 2015, we owned or operated approximately 107,000 display structures in our Americas segment with operations in 44 of the 50 largest markets in the United States, including all of the 20 largest markets. 

&#160; 

In the first quarter of 2016, Americas outdoor sold nine non-strategic outdoor markets including Cleveland and Columbus, Ohio, Des Moines, Iowa, Ft. Smith, Arkansas, Memphis, Tennessee, Portland, Oregon, Reno, Nevada, Seattle, Washington and Wichita, Kansas for approximately $602 million in cash and certain advertising assets in Florida. 

&#160; 

Our Americas assets consist of traditional and digital billboards, street furniture and transit displays, airport displays, and wallscapes and other spectaculars , which we own or operate under lease management agreements . Our Americas business is focused on metropolitan areas with dense populations. 

&#160; 

Strategy 

We seek to capitalize on our Americas network and diversified product mix to maximize revenue. In addition, by sharing best practices among our business segments, we believe we can quickly and effectively replicate our successes in our other markets. Our strategy focuses on pursuing the technology of digital displays, as well as leveraging our diversified product mix and long-standing presence in many of our existing markets, which provides us with the ability to launch new products and test new initiatives in a reliable and cost-effective manner. 

&#160; 

Promote Outdoor Media Spending. &#160; Given the attractive industry fundamentals of outdoor media and our depth and breadth of relationships with both local and national advertisers, we believe we can drive outdoor advertising's share of total media spending by using our dedicated national sales team to highlight the value of outdoor advertising relative to other media. Outdoor advertising only represented 4% of total dollars spent on advertising in the United States in 2015. We have made and continue to make significant investments in research tools that enable our clients to better understand how our displays can successfully reach their target audiences and promote their advertising campaigns. Also, we are working closely with clients, advertising agencies and other diversified media companies to develop more sophisticated systems that will provide improved audience metrics for outdoor advertising. 

&#160; 

Continue to Deploy Digital Displays. &#160; Our long-term strategy for our outdoor advertising businesses includes pursuing the technology of digital displays, including flat screens, LCDs and LEDs, as additions to traditional methods of displaying our clients&#8217; advertisements. Digital outdoor advertising provides significant advantages over traditional outdoor media. Our electronic displays are linked through centralized computer systems to instantaneously and simultaneously change advertising copy on a large number of displays, allowing us to sell more advertising opportunities to advertisers. The ability to change copy by time of day and quickly change messaging based on advertisers&#8217; needs creates additional flexibility for our customers. Although digital displays require more capital to construct compared to traditional bulletins, the advantages of digital allow us to penetrate new accounts and categories of advertisers, as well as serve a broader set of needs for existing advertisers. Digital displays allow for high-frequency, 24-hour advertising changes in high-traffic locations and allow us to offer our clients optimal flexibility, distribution, circulation and visibility. We expect this trend to continue as we increase our quantity of digital inventory. As of December 31, 2015, we had deployed more than 1,200 digital billboards in 37 markets in the United States. 

&#160; 

Sources of Revenue 

Americas generated 48%, 46% and 47% of our revenue in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Americas revenue is derived from the sale of advertising copy placed on our traditional and digital displays. Our display inventory consists primarily of billboards, 

&#160; 

street furniture displays and transit displays. The margins on our billboard contracts, including those related to digital billboards, tend to be higher than those on contracts for other displays, due to their greater size, impact and location along major roadways that are highly trafficked. Billboards comprise approximately two-thirds of our display revenues. The following table shows the approximate percentage of revenue derived from each category for our Americas inventory:

&#160; 

Our Americas segment generates revenues from local and national sales. Our advertising rates are based on a number of different factors including location, competition, size of display, illumination, market and gross ratings points. Gross ratings points are the total number of impressions delivered, expressed as a percentage of a market population, of a display or group of displays. The number of impressions delivered by a display is measured by the number of people passing the site during a defined period of time. For all of our billboards in the United States, we use independent, third-party auditing companies to verify the number of impressions delivered by a display. 

&#160; 

While location, price and availability of displays are important competitive factors, we believe that providing quality customer service and establishing strong client relationships are also critical components of sales. In addition, we have long-standing relationships with a diversified group of advertising brands and agencies that allow us to diversify client accounts and establish continuing revenue streams. 

&#160; 

Billboards 

Our billboard inventory primarily includes bulletins and posters. 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Bulletins. &#160; Bulletins vary in size, with the most common size being 14 feet high by 48 feet wide. Digital bulletins display static messages that resemble standard printed bulletins when viewed, but also allow advertisers to change messages throughout the course of a day, and may display advertisements for multiple customers. Our electronic displays are linked through centralized computer systems to instantaneously and simultaneously change advertising copy as needed. Because of their greater size, impact, high-frequency and 24-hour advertising changes, we typically receive our highest rates for digital bulletins. Almost all of the advertising copy displayed on traditional bulletins is computer printed on vinyl and transported to the bulletin where it is secured to the display surface. Bulletins generally are located along major expressways, primary commuting routes and main intersections that are highly visible and heavily trafficked. Our clients may contract for individual bulletins or a network of bulletins, meaning the clients&#8217; advertisements are rotated among bulletins to increase the reach of the campaign. Our client contracts for bulletins, either traditional or digital, generally have terms ranging from four weeks to one year. 

&#183; &#160; Posters. &#160; Traditional posters are approximately 11 feet high by 23 feet wide, and the traditional junior posters are approximately 5 feet high by 11 feet wide. Digital posters are available in addition to the traditional poster-size and junior poster-size. Similar to digital bulletins, digital posters display static messages that resemble standard printed posters when viewed, and are linked through centralized computer systems to instantaneously and simultaneously change messages throughout the course of a day. Advertising copy for traditional posters is digitally printed on a single piece of polyethylene material that is then transported and secured to the poster surfaces. Advertising copy for traditional junior posters is printed using silk screen, lithographic or digital process to transfer the designs onto paper that is then transported and secured to the poster surfaces. Posters generally are located in commercial areas on primary and secondary routes near point-of-purchase locations, facilitating advertising campaigns with greater demographic targeting than those displayed on bulletins. Our poster rates typically are less than our bulletin rates, and our client contracts for posters generally have terms ranging from four weeks to one year. Premiere displays, which consist of premiere panels and squares, are innovative hybrids between bulletins and posters that we developed to provide our clients with an 

&#160; 

alternative for their targeted marketing campaigns. The premiere displays use one or more poster panels, but with vinyl advertising stretched over the panels similar to bulletins. Our intent is to combine the creative impact of bulletins with the additional reach and frequency of posters. 

&#160; 

Street Furniture Displays 

Our street furniture displays include advertising surfaces on bus shelters, information kiosks, freestanding units and other public structures, are available in both traditional and digital formats, and are primarily located in major metropolitan areas and along major commuting routes. Generally, we are responsible for the construction and maintenance of street furniture structures. Contracts for the right to place our street furniture displays in the public domain and sell advertising space on them are awarded by municipal and transit authorities in competitive bidding processes governed by local law. Generally, these contracts have terms ranging from 10 to 20 years. As compensation for the right to sell advertising space on our street furniture structures, we pay the municipality or transit authority a fee or revenue share that is either a fixed amount or a percentage of the revenue derived from the street furniture displays. Typically, these revenue sharing arrangements include payments by us of minimum guaranteed amounts. Client contracts for street furniture displays typically have terms ranging from four weeks to one year, and are typically for network packages of multiple street furniture displays. 

&#160; 

Transit Displays 

Our transit displays are advertising surfaces on various types of vehicles or within transit systems, including on the interior and exterior sides of buses, trains, trams, and within the common areas of rail stations and airports, and are available in both traditional and digital formats. Similar to street furniture, contracts for the right to place our displays on such vehicles or within such transit systems and to sell advertising space on them generally are awarded by public transit authorities in competitive bidding processes or are negotiated with private transit operators. Generally, these contracts have terms ranging from five to ten years. Our client contracts for transit displays generally have terms ranging from four weeks to one year. 

&#160; 

Other Displays 

The balance of our display inventory consists of spectaculars and wallscapes. Spectaculars are customized display structures that often incorporate video, multidimensional lettering and figures, mechanical devices and moving parts and other embellishments to create special effects. The majority of our spectaculars are located in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Times Square in New York City and the Gardiner Expressway in Toronto. Client contracts for spectaculars typically have terms of one year or longer. A wallscape is a display that drapes over or is suspended from the sides of buildings or other structures. Generally, wallscapes are located in high-profile areas where other types of outdoor advertising displays are limited or unavailable. Clients typically contract for individual wallscapes for extended terms. 

&#160; 

Advertising Inventory and Markets 

As of December 31, 2015, we owned or operated approximately 107,000 display structures in our Americas segment with operations in 44 of the 50 largest markets in the United States, including all of the 20 largest markets. Therefore, no one property is material to our overall operations. We believe that our properties are in good condition and suitable for our operations. 

&#160; 

In the first quarter of 2016, we sold our business in nine non-strategic markets. 

&#160; 

Our displays are located on owned land, leased land or land for which we have acquired permanent easements. The majority of the advertising structures on which our displays are mounted require permits. Permits are granted for the right to operate an advertising structure as long as the structure is used in compliance with the laws and regulations of the applicable jurisdiction. 

&#160; 

Production 

In a majority of our markets, our local production staff performs the full range of activities required to create and install advertising copy. Production work includes creating the advertising copy design and layout, coordinating its printing and installing the copy on displays. We provide creative services to smaller advertisers and to advertisers not represented by advertising agencies. National advertisers often use preprinted designs that require only installation. Our creative and production personnel typically develop new designs or adopt copy from other media for use on our inventory. Our creative staff also can assist in the development of marketing presentations, demonstrations and strategies to attract new clients. 

&#160; 

Construction and Operation 

We typically own the physical structures on which our clients&#8217; advertising copy is displayed. We build some of the structures at our billboard fabrication business in Illinois and erect them on sites we either lease or own or for which we have acquired 

&#160; 

permanent easements. The site lease terms generally range from one to 20 years. In addition to the site lease, we must obtain a permit to build the sign. Permits are typically issued in perpetuity by the state or local government and typically are transferable or renewable for a minimal, or no, fee. Traditional bulletin and poster advertising copy is either printed with computer generated graphics on a single sheet of vinyl or placed on lithographed or silk-screened paper sheets supplied by the advertiser. These advertisements are then transported to the site and in the case of vinyl, wrapped around the face of the site, and in the case of paper, pasted and applied like wallpaper to the site. The operational process also includes conducting visual inspections of the inventory for display defects and taking the necessary corrective action within a reasonable period of time. 

&#160; 

Client Categories 

In 2015, the top five client categories in our Americas segment were retail, business services, media, healthcare and medical, and banking and financial services. 

&#160; 

Competition 

The outdoor advertising industry in the Americas is fragmented, consisting of several large companies involved in outdoor advertising, such as OUTFRONT Media Inc. and Lamar Advertising Company, as well as numerous smaller and local companies operating a limited number of displays in a single market or a few local markets. We also compete with other advertising media in our respective markets, including broadcast and cable television, radio, print media, direct mail, online and other forms of advertisement. Outdoor advertising companies compete primarily based on ability to reach consumers, which is driven by location of the display. 

&#160; 

International Outdoor Advertising 

Our International segment includes our operations in Europe, Asia and Australia, with approximately 34%, 35% and 35% of our revenue in this segment derived from France and the United Kingdom for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. As of December 31, 2015, we owned or operated more than 540,000 displays across 22 countries. 

&#160; 

Our International assets consist of street furniture and transit displays, billboards, mall displays, SmartBike programs, wallscapes and other spectaculars, which we own or operate under lease agreements. Our International business is focused on densely populated metropolitan areas. 

&#160; 

Strategy 

Similar to our Americas business, we believe our International business has attractive industry fundamentals, including the ability to reach a broad audience and drive foot traffic to the point-of-sale, making outdoor a cost-effective medium for advertisers as measured by cost per thousand persons reached compared to other traditional media. Our International business focuses on the following strategies: 

&#160; 

Promote Overall Outdoor Media Spending. Our strategy is to promote growth in outdoor advertising&#8217;s share of total media spending by demonstrating the strength of our medium. As part of this effort, we are focusing on developing and implementing improved outdoor audience delivery measurement systems to provide advertisers with tools to plan their campaigns and determine how effectively their message is reaching the desired audience. 

&#160; 

Differentiate on Sales and Marketing . Over the past five years, we have spent time and resources building commercial capabilities through a company wide sales force effectiveness program and an upgrade in our sales and marketing talent. These capabilities allow us to build and nurture relationships with our clients and their agencies as well as to offer packages and products that meet our clients&#8217; advertising needs. Going forward, particular areas of focus include pricing, packaging and programmatic selling. 

&#160; 

Capitalize on Product and Geographic Opportunities. &#160; We are also focused on growing our relevance to our advertising customers by continuously optimizing our display portfolio and targeting investments in promising market segments. We have continued to innovate and introduce new products in our markets based on local demand. Our street furniture business generates the largest portion of our revenue and that is where we plan to focus much of our investment. We plan to continue to evaluate municipal contracts that may come up for bid and will make prudent investments where we believe we can generate attractive returns. 

&#160; 

Continue to Deploy Digital Display Networks. &#160; Our digital outdoor displays are a dynamic medium, which enables our customers to engage in real-time, tactical, topical and flexible advertising. We will continue our focused and dedicated digital strategy and remain committed to the development of digital out-of-home communication solutions. Through our digital brand, Clear Channel Play, we are able to offer networks of digital displays in multiple formats and multiple environments including bus shelters, billboards, airports, transit, malls and flagship locations. Part of our long-term strategy is to pursue the diversification of our product offering by introducing novel technologies, such as beacons, small cells, wayfinding stations and provision of wifi in our street furniture network, 

&#160; 

as additions to traditional methods of displaying our clients&#8217; advertisements. We are currently installing these technologies in some of our various markets. We seek to achieve greater consumer engagement and flexibility by delivering powerful, flexible and interactive campaigns that open up new possibilities for advertisers to engage with their target audiences. We had more than 6,600 digital displays in 19 countries across Europe, Asia and Australia as of December 31, 2015. 

&#160; 

Sources of Revenue 

Our International segment generated 52%, 54% and 53% of our revenue in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Our International display inventory consists primarily of street furniture displays, billboards, transit displays and other out-of-home advertising displays. The following table shows the approximate percentage of revenue derived from each inventory category of our International segment:

&#160; 

&#160; 

Our International segment generates the majority of its revenue from the sale of advertising space on street furniture displays, billboards, retail displays and transit displays. Similar to our Americas business, advertising rates generally are based on the gross ratings points of a display or group of displays. In some of the countries where we have operations, the number of impressions delivered by a display is weighted to account for such factors as illumination, proximity to other displays and the speed and viewing angle of approaching traffic. 

&#160; 

While location, price and availability of displays are important competitive factors, we believe that providing quality customer service and establishing strong client relationships are also critical components of sales. Our entrepreneurial culture allows local management to operate their markets as separate profit centers, encouraging customer cultivation and service. 

&#160; 

Street Furniture Displays 

Our International street furniture displays, available in traditional and digital formats, are substantially similar to their Americas street furniture counterparts, and include bus shelters, freestanding units, various types of kiosks, benches and other public structures. Internationally, contracts with municipal and transit authorities for the right to place our street furniture in the public domain and sell advertising on such street furniture typically provide for terms ranging from two to 15 years. The major difference between our International and Americas street furniture businesses is in the nature of the municipal contracts. In our International outdoor business, these contracts typically require us to provide the municipality with a broader range of metropolitan amenities such as bus shelters with or without advertising panels, information kiosks and public wastebaskets, as well as space for the municipality to display maps or other public information. In exchange for providing such metropolitan amenities and display space, we are authorized to sell advertising space on certain sections of the structures we erect in the public domain. Our International street furniture is typically sold to clients as network packages of multiple street furniture displays, with contract terms ranging from one to two weeks. Client contracts are also available for longer terms. 

&#160; 

Billboards 

The sizes of our International billboards are not standardized. The billboards vary in both format and size across our networks, with the majority of our International billboards being similar in size to our posters used in our Americas business. 

&#160; 

Our billboard inventory is primarily comprised of premium billboards and classic billboards and is available in traditional and digital formats. 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Premium . Digital premium billboards typically display static messages that resemble standard printed billboards when viewed, but also allow advertisers to change messages throughout the course of a day, and may display advertisements for multiple customers. Our electronic displays are linked through centralized computer systems to instantaneously and simultaneously change advertising copy as needed. Because of their greater size, impact, high frequency and 24-hour advertising changes, digital premium billboards typically deliver our highest rates. Almost all of the advertising copy displayed on traditional premium billboards is digitally-printed and transported to the billboard where it is secured to the display surface. Premium billboards generally are located along major expressways, primary commuting routes and main intersections that are highly visible and heavily trafficked. Our clients may contract for individual billboards or a network of billboards. 

&#183; &#160; Classic . Digital and traditional classic billboards are available in a variety of formats across our markets. Similar to digital premium billboards, classic digital billboards typically display static messages that resemble standard printed posters when viewed, and are linked through centralized computer systems to instantaneously and simultaneously change messages throughout the course of a day. Advertising copy for traditional classic billboards is digitally printed then transported and secured to the poster surfaces. Classic billboards generally are located in commercial areas on primary and secondary routes near point-of-purchase locations, facilitating advertising campaigns with greater demographic targeting than those displayed on premium billboards. Classic billboards typically deliver lower rates than our premium billboards. Our intent is to combine the creative impact of premium billboards with the additional reach and frequency of classic billboards. 

Our billboards are primarily sold to clients as network packages with contract terms typically ranging from one to two weeks. Long-term client contracts are also available and typically have terms of up to one year. We lease the majority of our billboard sites from private landowners, usually for one to ten years. 

&#160; 

Retail Displays 

Our retail displays are mainly standalone advertising structures in or in close proximity to retail outlets such as malls and supermarkets. The right to place our displays in these locations and to sell advertising space on them generally is awarded by retail outlet operators such as large retailers or mall operators either through private tenders or bilateral negotiations. Upfront investment and ongoing maintenance costs vary across contracts. Contracts with mall operators and retailers have terms ranging from three to ten years. Our client contracts for retail displays, either traditional or digital, generally have terms ranging from one week to two weeks. 

&#160; 

Transit Displays 

Our International transit display contracts are substantially similar to their Americas transit display counterparts. They are advertising surfaces on various types of vehicles or within transit systems, including on the interior and exterior sides of buses, trains, trams and within the common areas of rail stations and airports, and are available in both traditional and digital formats. Similar to street furniture, contracts for the right to place our displays on such vehicles or within such transit systems and to sell advertising space on them generally are awarded by public transit authorities in competitive bidding processes or are negotiated with private transit operators. Our transit display contracts often require us to make only a minimal initial investment and few ongoing maintenance expenditures. Contracts with public transit authorities or private transit operators typically have terms ranging from two to five years. Our client contracts for transit displays, either traditional or digital, generally have terms ranging from one week to one year, or longer. 

&#160; 

Other International Displays and Services 

The balance of our revenue from our International segment consists primarily of advertising revenue from mall displays, other small displays and non-advertising revenue from sales of street furniture equipment, cleaning and maintenance services, and production and creative services revenue. Our International inventory includes other small displays that are counted as separate displays since they form a substantial part of our network and International outdoor advertising revenue. We also have a SmartBike bicycle rental program which provides bicycles for rent to the general public in several municipalities. In exchange for operating these bike rental programs, we generally derive revenue from advertising rights to the bikes, bike stations, additional street furniture displays and/or a share of rental income from the local municipalities. In several of our International markets, we sell equipment or provide cleaning and maintenance services as part of street furniture contracts with municipalities. 

&#160; 

Advertising Inventory and Markets 

As of December 31, 2015, we owned or operated more than 540,000 displays in our International segment, with operations across 22 countries. Our International display count includes display faces, which may include multiple faces on a single structure, as well as small, individual displays. As a result, our International display count is not comparable to our Americas display count, which 

&#160; 

includes only unique displays. No one property is material to our overall operations. We believe that our properties are in good condition and suitable for our operations. 

&#160; 

Production 

The majority of our International clients are advertisers targeting national audiences whose business generally is placed with us through advertising agencies. These agencies often provide our International clients creative services to design and produce both the advertising copy and the physical printed advertisement. Traditional advertising copy, both paper and vinyl, is shipped to centralized warehouses operated by us. The copy is then sorted and delivered to sites where it is installed on our displays. 

&#160; 

Construction and Operation 

The International manufacturing process largely consists of two elements: the manufacture and installation of advertising structures and the weekly preparation of advertising posters for distribution throughout our networks. Generally, we outsource the manufacturing of advertising structures to third parties and regularly seek competitive bids. We use a wide range of suppliers, located in each of our markets. The design of street furniture structures (such as bus shelters, bicycle racks and kiosks) is typically done in conjunction with a third party design or architectural firm. These street furniture designs then form the basis of a competitive bidding process to select a manufacturer. Our street furniture sites are posted by our own employees or subcontractors who also clean and maintain the sites. The decision to use our own employees or subcontractors is made on a market-by-market basis taking into consideration the mix of products in the market and local labor costs. 

&#160; 

Client Categories 

In 2015, the top five client categories in our International segment, based on International revenue derived from these categories, were retail, food and food products, entertainment, telecommunications and automotive, accessories and equipment. 

&#160; 

Competition 

The international outdoor advertising industry is competitive, consisting of several large companies involved in outdoor advertising, such as JCDecaux SA and ExterionMedia (UK) Limited, as well as numerous smaller and local companies operating a limited number of displays in a single market or a few local markets. We also compete with other advertising media in our respective markets, including broadcast and cable television, radio, print media, direct mail, online, mobile and other forms of advertisement. Outdoor companies compete primarily based on ability to reach consumers, which is driven by location of the display. 

&#160; 

Our business requires us to obtain and renew contracts with municipalities and other governmental entities, which frequently require us to participate in competitive bidding processes at each renewal. Many of these contracts typically have terms ranging from two to 15 years and have revenue share, capital expenditure requirements and/or fixed payment components. Competitive bidding processes are complex and sometimes lengthy. Substantial costs may be incurred in connection with preparing bids for such processes. Our competitors, individually or through relationships with third parties, may be able to provide municipalities with different or greater capabilities or prices or benefits than we can provide. In the past we have not, and most likely in the future will not, be awarded all of the contracts on which we bid. There can be no assurance that we will win any particular bid, or that we will be able to replace any revenues lost upon expiration or completion of a contract. Our inability to renew existing contracts can also result in significant expenses from the removal of our displays. Furthermore, if and when we do obtain a contract, we are generally required to incur significant start-up expenses. The costs of bidding on contracts and the start-up costs associated with new contracts we may obtain may significantly reduce our cash flow and liquidity. The success of our business also depends generally on our ability to obtain and renew contracts with private landlords. 

&#160; 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 1,700 domestic employees and approximately 4,300 international employees, of which approximately 5,300 were in direct operations and 700 were in administrative or corporate related activities. Approximately 100 of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements in their respective countries. We are a party to numerous collective bargaining agreements, none of which represent a significant number of employees. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good.

Regulation of our Business 

The outdoor advertising industry in the United States is subject to governmental regulation at the federal, state and local levels. These regulations may include, among others, restrictions on the construction, repair, maintenance, lighting, upgrading, height, size, spacing and location and permitting of and, in some instances, content of advertising copy being displayed on outdoor advertising structures. In addition, international regulations have a significant impact on the outdoor advertising industry. International regulation of the outdoor advertising industry can vary by municipality, region and country, but generally limits the size, placement, nature and density of out-of-home displays. Other regulations may limit the subject matter and language of out-of-home displays. 

&#160; 

From time to time, legislation has been introduced in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions attempting to impose taxes on revenue from outdoor advertising or for the right to use outdoor advertising assets. Several jurisdictions have imposed such taxes as a percentage of our outdoor advertising revenue generated in that jurisdiction. In addition, some jurisdictions have taxed our personal property and leasehold interests in advertising locations using various valuation methodologies. We expect U.S. and foreign jurisdictions to continue to try to impose such taxes as a way of increasing revenue. In recent years, outdoor advertising also has become the subject of targeted taxes and fees. These laws may affect prevailing competitive conditions in our markets in a variety of ways. Such laws may reduce our expansion opportunities or may increase or reduce competitive pressure from other members of the outdoor advertising industry. No assurance can be given that existing or future laws or regulations, and the enforcement thereof, will not materially and adversely affect the outdoor advertising industry. However, we contest laws and regulations that we believe unlawfully restrict our constitutional or other legal rights and may adversely impact the growth of our outdoor advertising business. 

&#160; 

In the United States, federal law, principally the Highway Beautification Act (&#8220;HBA&#8221;), regulates outdoor advertising on Federal-Aid Primary, Interstate and National Highway Systems roads within the United States (&#8220;controlled roads&#8221;). The HBA regulates the size and placement of billboards, requires the development of state standards, mandates a state&#8217;s compliance program, promotes the expeditious removal of illegal signs and requires just compensation for takings. 

&#160; 

To satisfy the HBA&#8217;s requirements, all states have passed billboard control statutes and regulations that regulate, among other things, construction, repair, maintenance, lighting, height, size, spacing and the placement and permitting of outdoor advertising structures. We are not aware of any state that has passed control statutes and regulations less restrictive than the prevailing federal requirements on the federal highway system, including the requirement that an owner remove any non-grandfathered, non-compliant signs along the controlled roads, at the owner&#8217;s expense and without compensation. Local governments generally also include billboard control as part of their zoning laws and building codes regulating those items described above and include similar provisions regarding the removal of non-grandfathered structures that do not comply with certain of the local requirements. Some local governments have initiated code enforcement and permit reviews of billboards within their jurisdiction. In some instances we have had to remove billboards as a result of such reviews. 

&#160; 

As part of their billboard control laws, state and local governments regulate the construction of new signs. Some jurisdictions prohibit new construction, some jurisdictions allow new construction only to replace or relocate existing structures and some jurisdictions allow new construction subject to the various restrictions discussed above. In certain jurisdictions, restrictive regulations also limit our ability to relocate, rebuild, repair, maintain, upgrade, modify or replace existing legal non-conforming billboards. 

&#160; 

U.S. federal law neither requires nor prohibits the removal of existing lawful billboards, but it does mandate the payment of compensation if a state or political subdivision compels the removal of a lawful billboard along the controlled roads. In the past, state governments have purchased and removed existing lawful billboards for beautification purposes using federal funding for transportation enhancement programs, and these jurisdictions may continue to do so in the future. From time to time, state and local government authorities use the power of eminent domain and amortization to remove billboards. Amortization is the required removal of legal non-conforming billboards (billboards which conformed with applicable laws and regulations when built, but which do not conform to current laws and regulations) or the commercial advertising placed on such billboards after a period of years. Pursuant to this concept, the governmental body asserts that just compensation is earned by continued operation of the billboard over that period of time. Although amortization is prohibited along all controlled roads, amortization has been upheld along non-controlled roads in limited instances where permitted by state and local law. Thus far, we have been able to obtain satisfactory compensation for, or relocation of, our billboards purchased or removed as a result of these types of governmental action, although there is no assurance that this will continue to be the case in the future. 

&#160; 

We have introduced and intend to expand the deployment of digital billboards that display static digital advertising copy from various advertisers that change up to several times per minute. We have encountered some existing regulations in the U.S. and across some international jurisdictions that restrict or prohibit these types of digital displays. However, since digital technology for changing static copy has only recently been developed and introduced into the market on a large scale, and is in the process of being introduced more broadly in our international markets, existing regulations that currently do not apply to digital technology by their terms could be 

&#160; 

revised to impose greater restrictions. These regulations, or actions by third parties, may impose greater restrictions on digital billboards due to alleged concerns over aesthetics or driver safety.
