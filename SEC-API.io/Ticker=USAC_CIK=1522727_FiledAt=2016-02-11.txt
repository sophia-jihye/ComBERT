&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

We are a growth- oriented D elaware limited partnership and we believe that we are one of the largest independent providers of compression services in the U.S. in terms of total compression fleet horsepower. We have been providing compression services since 1998 and completed our initial public offering in January 2013 . As of December 31, 2015 , we had 1,712,196 horsepower in our fleet and 15 , 4 00 horsepower on order for expected delivery during 2016. We provide compression services to our customers primarily in connection with infrastructure applications , including both allowing for the processing and transportation of natural gas through the domestic pipeline system and enhancing crude oil production through artific ial lift processes. As such, our compression services play a critical role in the production , processing and transportation of both natural gas and crude oil. 

&#160; 

We provide compression services in a number of shale plays throughout the U.S., including the Utica, Marcellus, Permian Basin, Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, Mississippi Lime, Granite Wash, Woodford, Barnett, Haynesville, Niobrara and Fayetteville shales. The demand for our services is driven by the domestic production of natural gas and crude oil; as such, we have focused our activities in areas with attractive natural gas and crude oil production growth, which are generally found in these shale and unconventional resource plays. According to recent studies promulgated by the Energy Information Agency (&#8220;EIA&#8221;), the production and transportation volumes in these shale plays are expected to increase over the long term due to the comparatively attractive economic returns versus returns achieved in many conventional basins. Furthermore, the changes in production volumes and pressures of shale plays over time require a wider range of compression services than in conventional basins. We believe the flexibility of our compression units positions us well to meet these changing operating conditions. While our business focuses largely on compression services serving infrastructure installations, including centralized natural gas gathering systems and processing facilities, which utilize large horsepower compression units, typically in shale plays, we also provide compression services in more mature &#160; conventional basins, including gas lift applications &#160; on crude oil wells targeted by horizontal drilling techniques. Gas lift and other artificial lift technologies are critical to the enhancement of production of oil from horizontal wells operating in tight shale plays. Gas lift is a process by which natural gas is injected into the production tubing of an existing producing well, thus reducing the hydrostatic pressure and allowing the oil to flow at a higher rate. 

&#160; 

We operate a modern fleet of compression units, with an average age of approximately four years. We acquire our compression units from third-party fabricators who build the units to our specifications, utilizing specific original equipment manufacturers and assembling the units in a manner that provides us the ability to meet certain operating condition thresholds. Our standard new-build compression units are generally configured for multiple compression stages allowing us to operate our units across a broad range of operating conditions. The design flexibility of our units, particularly in midstream applications, allows us to enter into longer-term contracts and reduces the redeployment risk of our horsepower in the field. Our modern and standardized fleet, decentralized field level operating structure and technical proficiency in predictive and preventive maintenance and overhaul operations have enabled us to achieve average service run times consistently at or above the levels required by our customers. 

&#160; 

As part of our services, we engineer, design, operate, service and repair our compression units and maintain related support inventory and equipment. The compression units in our modern fleet are designed to be easily adaptable to fit our customers&#8217; changing compression requirements. Focusing on the needs of our customers and providing them with 

&#160;

reliable and flexible compression services in geographic areas of attractive growth helps us to generate stable cash flows for our unitholders. 

&#160; 

We provide compression services to our cust omers under fixed-fee contracts with initial contract terms between six months and five years , depending on the application and location of the compression unit . We typically continue to provide compression services at a specific location beyond the initial contract term , either through contract renewal or on a month-to-month or longer basis. We primarily enter into take-or-pay contracts whereby our customers are required to pay our monthly fee even during periods of limited or disrupted throughput, which enhances the stability and predictability of our cash flows. We are not directly exposed to commodity price risk because we do not take title to the natural gas or crude oil involved in our services and because the natural gas used as fuel by our compression units is supplied by our customers without cost to us . 

&#160; 

We provide compression services to major oil companies and independent producers, processors, gatherers and transporters of natural gas and crude oil. Regardless of the application for which our services are provided, our customers rely upon the availability of the equipment used to provide compression services and our expertise to help generate the maximum throughput of product, reduce fuel costs and minimize emissions. While we are currently focused on our existing service areas, our customers have compression demands in other areas of the U.S. in conjunction with their field development projects. We continually consider expansion of our areas of operation in the U.S. based upon the level of customer demand. Our modern, flexible fleet of compression units, which have been designed to be rapidly deployed and redeployed throughout the country, provides us with opportunities to expand into other areas with both new and existing customers. 

&#160; 

Our assets and operations are organized into a single reportable segment and are all located and conducted in the United States. See our consolidated financial statements, and the notes thereto, included elsewhere in this report for financial information on our operations and assets; such information is incorporated herein by reference. 

&#160; 

Business Strategies 

&#160; 

Our principal business objective is to increase the quarterly cash distributions that we pay to our unitholders over time while ensuring the ongoing stability and growth of our business. We expect to achieve this objective by executing on the following strategies: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Capitalize on the increased need for natural gas compression in conventional and unconventional plays. We expect additional demand for compression services to result from the continuing shift of natural gas production to domestic shale plays as well as the declining production pressures of aging conventional basins. The EIA continues to expect overall natural gas production and transportation volumes, and in particular volumes from domestic shale plays, to increase over the long term. Furthermore, the changes in production volumes and pressures of shale plays over time require a wider range and increased level of compression services than in conventional basins. Additionally, while oil prices have decreased substantially, resulting in less new drilling activity, the EIA expects crude oil production in the economically attractive tight oil plays to continue due to the favorable economics of existing wells. As a result, the use of, and thus demand for, artificial lift techniques required in such production continues to be an attractive business for us. Our fleet of modern, flexible compression units is capable of being rapidly deployed and redeployed and designed to operate in multiple compression stages, which will enable us to capitalize on these opportunities both in emerging shale plays and conventional fields. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Continue to execute on attractive organic growth opportunities . From 200 5 &#160; to 201 5 , we grew the horsepower in our fleet of compression units and our compression revenues at a compound annual growth rate of 2 1 % and 26%, respectively , primarily through organic growth. We believe organic growth opportunities will continue to be our most attractive source of near-term growth, although we expect such organic growth will be reduced in 2016 compared to prior periods. We seek to achieve continued organic growth by (i) increasing our business with existing customers, (ii) obtaining new customers in our existing areas of operations and (iii) expanding our operations into new geographic areas. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Partner with customers who have significant compression needs . We actively seek to identify customers with meaningful acreage positions or significant infrastructure development in active and growing areas. We work with these customers to jointly develop long-term and adaptable solutions designed to optimize their lifecycle compression costs. We believe this is important in determining the overall economics of producing, gathering and transporting natural gas and crude oil. Our proactive and collaborative approach positions us to serve as our customers&#8217; compression service provider of choice. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Pursue accretive acquisition opportunities . While our principal growth strategy is to continue to grow organically, we may pursue accretive acquisition opportunities, including the acquisition of complementary businesses, participation in joint ventures or the purchase of compression units from existing or new customers in conjunction with providing compression services to them. We consider opportunities that (i) are in our existing geographic areas of operations or new, high-growth regions, (ii) meet internally established economic thresholds and (iii) may be financed on reasonable terms. For example in 2013, we completed the acquisition of assets and certain liabilities related to S&#38;R Compression, LLC&#8217;s (&#8220;S&#38;R&#8221;) business of providing gas lift compression services to third parties engaged in the exploration, production, gathering, processing, transportation or distribution of oil and gas (the &#8220;S&#38;R Acquisition&#8221;). 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Focus on asset utilization . We seek to actively manage our business in a manner that allows us to continue to achieve high utilization rates at attractive service rates while providing us with the most financial flexibility possible. From time to time, we expect the crude oil and natural gas industry to be impacted by the cyclicality of commodity prices. During downturns in commodity prices, producers and midstream operators may reduce their capital spending, which in turn can hinder the demand for compression services. We have the ability, in response to industry conditions, to drastically and rapidly reduce our capital spending, which allows us to avoid financing organic growth with outside capital and aligns our capital spending with the demand for compression services. By reducing organic growth and avoiding new unit deliveries during downturns, we are able to conserve capital and instead focus on the deployment and re-deployment of our existing asset base. With higher utilization, we are better positioned to continue to generate attractive rates of return on our already-deployed capital . 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Maintain financial flexibility . We intend to maintain financial flexibility to be able to take advantage of growth opportunities. Historically, we have utilized our cash flow from operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and issuances of equity securities to fund capital expenditures to expand our compression services business. This approach has allowed us to significantly grow our fleet and the amount of cash we generate, while maintaining our debt at levels we believe are manageable for our business. We believe the appropriate management of our financial position and the resulting access to capital positions us to take advantage of future growth opportunities as they arise. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Our Operations 

&#160; 

Compression Services 

&#160; 

We provide compression services for a monthly service fee. As part of our services, we engineer, design, operate, service and repair our fleet of compression units and maintain related support inventory and equipment. We have consistently provided average service run times at or above the levels required by our customers. In general, our team of field service technicians services only our compression fleet. In limited circumstances for established customers, we will agree to service third-party owned equipment. We do not own any compression fabrication facilities. 

&#160; 

Our Compression Fleet 

&#160; 

The fleet of compression units that we own and use to provide compression services consists of specially engineered compression units that utilize standardized components, principally engines manufactured by Caterpillar, Inc. and compressor frames and cylinders manufactured by Ariel Corporation. Our units can be rapidly and cost effectively modified for specific customer applications. Approximately 97% of our fleet horsepower a s of December 31, 201 5 was purchased new and the average age of our compression units was approximately four years. Our modern, standardized 

&#160;

compress ion unit fleet is powered primarily by the Caterpillar 3400, 3500 and 3600 engine classes, which range from 401 to 4,7 35 horsepower per unit. These larger horsepower units, which we define as 400 horsepower p er unit or greater, represented 80.4 % of our total fleet horsepower (including compression units on order) as of December 31, 201 5 . In addition, a portion of our fleet consists of smaller horsepower units ranging from 30 horsepower to 390 horsepower that are primarily used in gas lift applications . We believe the young age and overall composition of our compressor fleet results in fewer mechanical fail ures, lower fuel usage , and reduced environmental emissions.

Average horsepower utilization based on revenue generating horsepower and fleet horsepower was 85.1%, 87.3% and 87.3% for each year ended Dec ember 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. 

&#160; 

A growing number of our compression units contain electronic control systems that enable us to monitor the units remotely by satellite or other means to supplement our technicians&#8217; on-site monitoring visits. We intend to continue to selectively add remote monitoring systems to our fleet during 2016 where beneficial from an operating and financial standpoint. All of our compression units are designed to automatically shut down if operating conditions deviate from a pre-determined range. While we retain the care, custody, ongoing maintenance and control of our compression units, we allow our customers, subject to a defined protocol, to start, stop, accelerate and slow down compression units in response to field conditions. 

&#160; 

We adhere to routine, preventive and scheduled maintenance cycles. Each of our compression units is subjected to rigorous sizing and diagnostic analyses, including lubricating oil analysis and engine exhaust emission analysis. We have proprietary field service automation capabilities that allow our service technicians to electronically record and track operating, technical, environmental and commercial information at the discrete unit level. These capabilities allow our field technicians to identify potential problems and act on them before such problems result in down-time. 

&#160; 

Generally, we expect each of our compression units to undergo a major overhaul between service deployment cycles. The timing of these major overhauls depends on multiple factors, including run time and operating conditions. A major overhaul involves the periodic rebuilding of the unit to materially extend its economic useful life or to enhance the unit&#8217;s ability to fulfill broader or more diversified compression applications. Because our compression fleet is comprised of units of varying horsepower that have been placed into service with staggered initial on-line dates, we are able to schedule overhauls in a way to avoid excessive annual maintenance capital expenditures and minimize the revenue impact of down-time. 

&#160; 

We believe that our customers, by outsourcing their compression requirements, can achieve higher compression runtimes, which translates into increased volumes of either natural gas or crude oil production and, therefore, increased revenues. Utilizing our compression services also allows our customers to reduce their operating, maintenance and equipment costs by allowing us to efficiently manage their changing compression needs. In many of our service contracts, we guarantee our customers availability (as described below) ranging from 95% to 98%, depending on field- level requirements. 

&#160; 

General Compression Service Contract Terms 

&#160; 

The following discussion describes the material terms generally common to our compression service contracts. We generally have separate contracts for each distinct location for which we will provide compression services. 

&#160; 

Term and termination . Our contracts typically have an initial term of between six months and five years, depending on the application and location of the compression unit. After the expiration of the applicable term, the contract continues on a month-to-month or longer basis until terminated by us or our customer upon notice as provided for in the applicable contract. As of December 31, 201 5 , approximately 3 9 % of our compression services on a horsepower basis (and 4 3 % on a revenue basis for the year ended December 31, 201 5 ) were provided on a month-to-month basis to customers who continue to utilize our services following expiration of the primary term of their contracts with us. 

&#160; 

Availability . Our contracts often provide a guarantee of specified availability. We define availability as the percentage of time in a given period that our compression services are being provided or are capable of being provided. 

&#160;

Availability is reduced by instances of &#8220;down-time&#8221; that are attributable to anything other than events of force majeure or acts or failures to act by the customer. Down-time under our contracts usually begins when our services stop being provided or when we receive notice from the customer of the problem. Down-time due to scheduled maintenance is also excluded from our availability commitment. Our failure to meet a stated availability guarantee may result in a service fee credit to the customer. As a consequence of our availability guarantee, we are incentivized to perform predictive and preventive maintenance on our fleet as well as promptly respond to a problem to meet our contractual commitments and ensure our customers the compression availability on which their business and our service relationship are based. For service contracts that do not have a stated availability guarantee, we work with those customers to ensure that our compression services meet their operational needs. 

&#160; 

Fees and expenses . Our customers pay a fixed monthly fee for our services. Compression services generally are billed monthly in advance of the service period, except for certain customers, which are billed at the beginning of the service month, and they are generally due 30 days from the date of the invoice. We are not responsible for acts of force majeure, and our customers generally are required to pay our monthly fee even during periods of limited or disrupted throughput. We are generally responsible for the costs and expenses associated with operation and maintenance of our compression equipment, although certain fees and expenses are the responsibility of our customers under the terms of their contracts. For example, all fuel gas is provided by our customers without cost to us, and in many cases customers are required to provide all water and electricity. At the customer&#8217;s option, we can provide fluids necessary to run the unit to the customer for an additional fee. We provide such fluids for a substantial majority of the compression units deployed in gas lift applications. We are also reimbursed by our customers for certain ancillary expenses such as trucking and crane operation, depending on the terms agreed to in the applicable contract, resulting in little to no gross operating margin. 

&#160; 

Service standards and specifications . We commit to provide compression services under service contracts that typically provide that we will supply all compression equipment, tools, parts, field service support and engineering in order to meet our customers&#8217; requirements. Our contracts do not specify the specific compression equipment we will use; instead, in consultation with the customer, we determine what equipment is necessary to perform our contractual commitments. 

&#160; 

Title; Risk of loss . We own all of the compression equipment in our fleet that we use to provide compression services, and we normally bear the risk of loss or damage to our equipment and tools and injury or death to our personnel. 

&#160; 

Insurance . Our contracts typically provide that both we and our customers are required to carry general liability, workers&#8217; compensation, employers&#8217; liability, automobile and excess liability insurance. 

&#160; 

Marketing and Sales 

&#160; 

Our marketing and client service functions are performed on a coordinated basis by our sales team and field technicians. Salespeople and field technicians qualify, analyze and scope new compression applications as well as regularly visit our customers to ensure customer satisfaction, to determine a customer&#8217;s needs related to existing services being provided and to determine the customer&#8217;s future compression service requirements. This ongoing communication allows us to quickly identify and respond to our customers&#8217; compression requirements. We currently focus on geographic areas where we can achieve economies of scale through high-density operations. 

&#160; 

Customers 

&#160; 

Our customers consist of more than 250 companies in the energy industry, including major integrated oil companies, public and private independent exploration and production companies and midstream companies. We did not have revenue from any single customer greater than 10% of total revenue for th e year ended December 31, 2015. Southwestern Energy Corporation and its subsidiaries accounted for 1 1.6 % of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 201 4 . No other customer accounted for greater than 10% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014. Our ten largest customers &#160; accounted for 4 5 % and 4 6 % of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 201 5 and 201 4 , respectively. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Suppliers and Service Providers 

&#160; 

The principal manufacturers of components for our natural gas compression equipment include Caterpillar, Inc., Cummins Inc., and Arrow Engine Company for engines, Air-X-Changers and Air Cooled Exchangers for coolers, and Ariel Corporation, GE Oil &#38; Gas Gemini products and Arrow Engine Company for compressor frames and cylinders. We also rely primarily on four vendors, A G Equipment Company, Alegacy Equipment, LLC, Standard Equipment Corp. and S&#38;R, to package and assemble our compression units. Although we rely primarily on these suppliers, we believe alternative sources for natural gas compression equipment are generally available if needed. However, relying on alternative sources may increase our costs and change the standardized nature of our fleet. We have not experienced any material supply problems to date. Although lead-times for new Caterpillar engines and new Ariel compressor frames have in the past been in excess of one year due to increased demand and supply allocations imposed on equipment packagers and end-users, lead-times for such engines and frames are currently substantially shorter. Please read Part I, Item 1A (&#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to Our Business&#8212;We depend on a limited number of suppliers and are vulnerable to product shortages and price increases, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations&#8221;). 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The compression services business is highly competitive. Some of our competitors have a broader geographic scope, as well as greater financial and other resources than we do. On a regional basis, we experience competition from numerous smaller companies that may be able to more quickly adapt to changes within our industry and changes in economic conditions as a whole, more readily take advantage of available opportunities and adopt more aggressive pricing policies. Additionally, the historical availability of attractive financing terms from financial institutions and equipment manufacturers has made the purchase of individual compression units increasingly affordable to our customers. We believe that we compete effectively on the basis of price, equipment availability, customer service, flexibility in meeting customer needs, quality and reliability of our compressors and related services. &#160; Please read Part I, Item 1A (&#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to Our Business&#8212; We face significant competition that may cause us to lose market share and reduce our cash available for distribution &#8221;) . 

&#160; 

Seasonality 

&#160; 

Our results of operations have not historically reflected any material seasonality, and we do not currently have reason to believe seasonal fluctuations will have a material impact in the foreseeable future. 

&#160; 

Insurance 

&#160; 

We believe that our insurance coverage is customary for the industry and adequate for our business. As is customary in the energy services industry, we review our safety equipment and procedures and carry insurance against most, but not all, risks of our business. Losses and liabilities not covered by insurance would increase our costs. The compression business can be hazardous, involving unforeseen circumstances such as uncontrollable flows of gas or well fluids, fires and explosions or environmental damage. To address the hazards inherent in our business, we maintain insurance coverage that, subject to significant deductibles, includes physical damage coverage, third party general liability insurance, employer&#8217;s liability, environmental and pollution and other coverage, although coverage for environmental and pollution related losses is subject to significant limitations. Under the terms of our standard compression services contract, we are responsible for the maintenance of insurance coverage on our compression equipment. Please read Part I, Item 1A (&#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to Our Business&#8212; We do not insure against all potential losses and could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities &#8221;) . 

&#160; 

Environmental and Safety Regulations 

&#160; 

We are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to protection of human health, safety and the environment. These regulations include compliance obligations for air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharges and solid and hazardous waste disposal, as well as regulations designed for the protection of human health and safety and threatened or 

&#160;

endangered species. Compliance with these environmental laws and regulations may expose us to significant costs and liabilities and cause us to incur significant capital expenditures in our operations. We are often obligated to assist customers in obtaining permits or approvals in our operations from various federal, state and local authorities. Permits and approvals can be denied or delayed, which may cause us to lose potential and current customers, interrupt our operations and limit our growth and revenue. Moreover, failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imposition of remedial obligations and the issuance of injunctions delaying or prohibiting operations. Private parties may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage. While we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with current requirements would not have a material adverse effect on us, there is no assurance that this trend of compliance will continue in the future. In addition, the clear trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions on activities that may adversely affect the environment. Thus, any changes in, or more stringent enforcement of, these laws and regulations that result in more stringent and costly pollution control equipment, waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position. 

&#160; 

We do not believe that compliance with federal, state or local environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations or cash flows. We cannot assure you, however, that future events such as changes in existing laws or enforcement policies, the promulgation of new laws or regulations, or the development or discovery of new facts or conditions or unforeseen incidents will not cause us to incur significant costs. The following is a discussion of material environmental and safety laws that relate to our operations. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all of these environmental laws and regulations. Please read Part I, Item 1A (&#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to Our Business&#8212; We are subject to substantial environmental regulation, and changes in these regulations could increase our costs or liabilities &#8221;) . 

&#160; 

Air emissions . The Clean Air Act (&#8220;CAA&#8221;) and comparable state laws regulate emissions of air pollutants from various industrial sources, including natural gas compressors, and impose certain monitoring and reporting requirements. Such emissions are regulated by air emissions permits, which are applied for and obtained through the various state or federal regulatory agencies. Our standard natural gas compression contract provides that the customer is responsible for obtaining air emissions permits and assuming the environmental risks related to site operations. Increased obligations of operators to reduce air emissions of nitrogen oxides and other pollutants from internal combustion engines in transmission service have been enacted by governmental authorities. For example, in 2010, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;) published new regulations under the CAA to control emissions of hazardous air pollutants from existing stationary reciprocal internal combustion engines, also known as Quad Z regulations. In 2012, the EPA proposed amendments to the final rule in response to several petitions for reconsideration, which were finalized and became effective in 2013. The rule requires us to undertake certain expenditures and activities, including purchasing and installing emissions control equipment on certain compressor engines and generators. 

&#160; 

In 2012, the EPA proposed minor amendments to the CAA regulations applicable to the manufacturers, owners and operators of new, modified and reconstructed stationary reciprocating internal combustion engines, also known as Quad J regulations, in order to conform the final rule to the amendments to the Quad Z regulations discussed above. These amendments were finalized and became effective in 2013. &#160; These modifications do not impose material unbudgeted costs on operations. 

&#160; 

On October 26, 2015, the EPA published the finalized rule strengthening the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (&#8220;NAAQs&#8221;) for ground level ozone. The rule became effective on December 28, 2015. The final rule updates both the primary ozone standard and the secondary standard. Both standards are 8-hour concentration standards of 70 parts per billion (&#8220;ppb&#8221;). In addition, in 2013, the EPA promulgated a final rule revising the annual standard for fine particulate matter, or PM 2.5, by lowering the level from 15 to 12 micrograms per cubic meter. On December 18, 2014, the EPA issued final area designations for the 2012 NAAQs for PM 2.5. Designation of new non-attainment areas for the revised ozone or PM 2.5 NAAQS may result in additional federal and state regulatory actions that may impact our customers&#8217; operations and increase the cost of additions to property, plant, and equipment. 

&#160; 

&#160;

In 2012, the EPA finalized rules that establish new air emission controls for oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing operations. Specifically, the EPA&#8217;s rule package included New Source Performance Standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds (&#8220;VOCs&#8221;) and a separate set of emission standards to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with oil and natural gas production and processing activities. The rules established specific new requirements regarding emissions from compressors and controllers at natural gas processing plants, dehydrators, storage tanks and other production equipment as well as the first federal air standards for natural gas wells that are hydraulically fractured. In addition, the rules established leak detection requirements for natural gas processing plants at 500 ppm. In 2013, the EPA issued a final update to the VOC performance standards for storage tanks used in crude oil and natural gas production and transmission. On July 31, 2015, the E PA finalized amendments to the definition of low-pressure wells and references to tanks connected to one another in the 2012 New Source Performance Standards. On August 18, 2015, the EPA also proposed updates to the New Source Performance Standards and Draft Control Techniques Guidelines in addition to proposing a Source Determination Rule, all of which are intended to cut methane and VOC emissions from the oil and natural gas industry. These rules may require a number of modifications to our operations, including the installation of new equipment to control emissions from our compressors at initial startup. Compliance with such rules may result in significant costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, and could adversely impact our business. 

&#160; 

In addition, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (&#8220;TCEQ&#8221;) has finalized revisions to certain air permit programs that significantly increase the air permitting requirements for new and certain existing oil and gas production and gathering sites for 15 counties in the Barnett Shale production area. The final rule establishes new emissions standards for engines, which could impact the operation of specific categories of engines by requiring the use of alternative engines, compressor packages or the installation of aftermarket emissions control equipment. The rule became effective for the Barnett Shale production area in April 2011, with the lower emissions standards becoming applicable between 2015 and 2030 depending on the type of engine and the permitting requirements. The cost to comply with the revised air permit programs is not expected to be material at this time. &#160; However, the TCEQ has stated it will consider expanding application of the new air permit program statewide. At this point, we cannot predict the cost to comply with such requirements if the geographic scope is expanded. 

&#160; 

A ruling by a panel of administrative law judges in a case before the Pennsylvania Environmental Hearing Board, to which we are not a party, may have implications for the permitting of projects where our customers seek to use our services. In this case, National Fuel Gas Midstream Corporation et al. v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania , a panel of administrative law judges on December 29, 2015, dismissed an appeal from a determination by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection that the operations of two separate companies on parcels of land that were not adjoining and were actually separated by forest land but were in close proximity should be aggregated as a single source under the state air permitting regime. The implications of aggregating different sources into a single source is that the overall emissions increase and may increase enough to trigger a more onerous permitting regime and require more stringent controls. The court determined that this outcome was appropriate because, among other reasons, the two companies were owned by a common parent and had several interlocking officers and directors. But it was unclear whether the common parent in fact exercised control over the two companies&#8217; operations. Unless this ruling is overturned on further appeal, application of this ruling to other permit applications where the parties intend to use our services may lead to a permitting regime that is more burdensome, time-consuming and costly to our customers, who typically obtain permits. Moreover, we may be required to install lower emission engines or additional pollution controls and may not be able to recoup all of the associated costs from our customers. 

&#160; 

There can be no assurance that future requirements compelling the installation of more sophisticated emission control equipment would not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution. 

&#160; 

Climate change . Methane, a primary component of natural gas, and carbon dioxide, a byproduct of the burning of natural gas, are examples of greenhouse gases. In recent years, the U.S. Congress has considered legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. It presently appears unlikely that comprehensive climate legislation will be passed by either house of Congress in the near future, although energy legislation and other initiatives are expected to be proposed that may be relevant to greenhouse gas emissions issues. However, almost half of the states have begun to address greenhouse gas emissions, primarily through the planned development of emission inventories or regional greenhouse 

&#160;

gas cap and trade programs. Depending on the particular program, we could be required to control greenhouse gas emissions or to purchase and surrender allowances for greenhouse gas emissions resulting from our operations. 

&#160; 

Independent of Congress, the EPA is beginning to adopt regulations controlling greenhouse gas emissions under its existing CAA authority. For example, on December 15, 2009, the EPA officially published its findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases endanger human health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the earth&#8217;s atmosphere and other climatic changes. These findings by the EPA allowed the agency to proceed with the adoption and implementation of regulations that restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the CAA. In 2009, the EPA adopted rules regarding regulation of greenhouse emissions from motor vehicles. In addition, on September 22, 2009, the EPA issued a final rule requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States beginning in 2011 for emissions occurring in 2010 from specified large greenhouse gas emission sources. On November 30, 2010, the EPA published a final rule expanding its existing greenhouse gas emissions reporting rule for petroleum and natural gas facilities, including natural gas transmission compression facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of carbon dioxide equivalent per year. The rule, which went into effect on December 30, 2010, requires reporting of greenhouse gas emissions by such regulated facilities to the EPA by September 2012 for emissions during 2011 and annually thereafter. In 2010, the EPA also issued a final rule, known as the &#8220;Tailoring Rule,&#8221; that made certain large stationary sources and modification projects subject to permitting requirements for greenhouse gas emissions under the CAA. 

&#160; 

Both the Tailoring Rule and the EPA&#8217;s endangerment finding were challenged in federal court and were upheld by the D.C. Court of Appeals. In July 2014, the United States Supreme Court invalidated the Tailoring Rule but it refused to consider other issues such as whether greenhouse gases endanger public health. As a result, under federal law, a source is no longer required to meet the PSD and Title V permitting requirements based solely on its greenhouse gas emissions. 

&#160; 

The EPA has also sought to directly regulate methane emissions by proposing regulations to expand on Subpart OOOO of the CAA and target methane emissions from new and modified sources, including hydraulically fractured wells. If the final rule is promulgated along the lines of the proposal, these requirements may add to our costs of doing business and we may not be able to recoup all of these costs from our customers. 

&#160; 

On August 3, 2015, the EPA published standards of performance for greenhouse gas emissions from new power plants. The final rule establishes a performance standard for integrated gasification combined cycled units and utility boilers based on the use of the best system of emission reduction that EPA has determined has been adequately demonstrated for each type of unit. The rule also sets limits for stationary natural gas combustion turbines based on the use of natural gas combined cycle technology. 

&#160; 

Finally, on June 2, 2014, the EPA proposed the Clean Power Plan rule, which is intended to reduce carbon emissions from existing power plants by 32 percent from 2005 levels by 2030. Twenty-nine states and various industry groups have challenged the EPA&#8217;s authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from existing coal-fired power plants under Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act in the United States Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C. (the &#8220;Circuit Court&#8221;). In January 2016, the parties asked the United States Supreme Court to stay the plan while the lawsuit proceeds through the court appeals. On February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court granted a stay of the implementation of the Clean Power Plan before the Circuit Court even issued a decision. By its terms, this stay will remain in effect throughout the pendency of the appeals process including at the Circuit Court and the Supreme Court through any certiorari petition that may be granted. The stay suspends the rule, including the requirement that states must start submitting implementation plans by 2018. It is not yet clear how the either the Circuit Court or the Supreme Court will ultimately rule on the legality of the Clean Power Plan. 

&#160; 

In addition to the EPA, the Bureau of Land Management ( &#8220;BLM&#8221;) also promulgated rules to regulate hydraulic fracturing. The BLM rule establishes new requirements relating to well construction, water management, and chemical disclosure for companies drilling on federal and tribal land. This rule has been challenged in the District of Wyoming. The District Court issued a preliminary ruling enjoining enforcement of the BLM rule and holding that the agency lacked authority to regulate hydraulic fracturing. Environmental groups have appealed this ruling to the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. The case is likely to be heard in 2016. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Although it is not currently possible to predict with specificity how any proposed or future greenhouse gas legislation or regulation will impact our business, any legislation or regulation of greenhouse gas emissions that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions or reduced demand for our services, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

&#160; 

Water discharge . The Clean Water Act (&#8220;CWA&#8221;) and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. The CWA and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit the discharge of dredge and fill material into regulated waters, including jurisdictional wetlands, unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit. The CWA also requires the development and implementation of spill prevention, control and countermeasures, including the construction and maintenance of containment berms and similar structures, if required, to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak at such facilities. In addition, the CWA and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties as well as other enforcement mechanisms for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the CWA and analogous state laws and regulations. Our compression operations do not generate process wastewaters that are discharged to waters of the U.S. In any event, our customers assume responsibility under the majority of our standard natural gas compression contracts for obtaining any discharge permits that may be required under the CWA. 

&#160; 

Safe Drinking Water Act . A significant portion of our customers&#8217; natural gas production is developed from unconventional sources that require hydraulic fracturing as part of the completion process. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into the formation to stimulate gas production. Legislation to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act (&#8220;SDWA&#8221;) to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the definition of &#8220;underground injection&#8221; and require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing, as well as legislative proposals to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process, have been proposed and the U.S. Congress continues to consider legislation to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act. Scrutiny of hydraulic fracturing activities continues in other ways, with the EPA having commenced a multi-year study of the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing, preliminary results of which were released for public comment in June 2015, which stated that EPA had not found evidence of widespread, systemic impacts on drinking water resources from hydraulic fracturing operations. This report has not yet been finalized, and the EPA&#8217;s ultimate conclusions may be impacted by recent comments from the EPA&#8217;s Science Advisory Board regarding the sufficiency of the data underlying some of the EPA&#8217;s conclusions. The EPA also has announced that it believes hydraulic fracturing using fluids containing diesel fuel can be regulated under the SDWA notwithstanding the SDWA&#8217;s general exemption for hydraulic fracturing. Several states have also proposed or adopted legislative or regulatory restrictions on hydraulic fracturing, including prohibitions on the practice. We cannot predict the future of such legislation and what additional, if any, provisions would be included. If additional levels of regulation, restrictions and permits were required through the adoption of new laws and regulations at the federal or state level or the development of new interpretations of those requirements by the agencies that issue the permits, that could lead to delays, increased operating costs and process prohibitions that could reduce demand for our compression services, which would materially adversely affect our revenue and results of operations. 

&#160; 

Solid waste . The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (&#8220;RCRA&#8221;) and comparable state laws control the management and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous waste. These laws and regulations govern the generation, storage, treatment, transfer and disposal of wastes that we generate including, but not limited to, used oil, antifreeze, filters, sludges, paint, solvents and sandblast materials. The EPA and various state agencies have limited the approved methods of disposal for these types of wastes. 

&#160; 

Site remediation . The Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (&#8220;CERCLA&#8221;) and comparable state laws impose strict, joint and several liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These 

&#160;

persons include the owner and operator of a disposal site where a hazardous substance release occurred and any company that transported, disposed of or arranged for the transport or disposal of hazardous substances released at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be liable for the costs of remediating the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources, and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, where contamination may be present, it is not uncommon for the neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury, property damage and recovery of response costs. While we generate materials in the course of our operations that may be regulated as hazardous substances, we have not received notification that we may be potentially responsible for cleanup costs under CERCLA at any site. 

&#160; 

While we do not currently own or lease any material facilities or properties for storage or maintenance of our inactive compression units, we may use third party properties for such storage and possible maintenance and repair activities. In addition, our active compression units typically are installed on properties owned or leased by third party customers and operated by us pursuant to terms set forth in the natural gas compression services contracts executed by those customers. Under most of our natural gas compression services contracts, our customers must contractually indemnify us for certain damages we may suffer as a result of the release into the environment of hazardous and toxic substances. We are not currently responsible for any remedial activities at any properties used by us ; however, there is always the possibility that our future use of those properties may result in spills or releases of petroleum hydrocarbons, wastes or other regulated substances into the environment that may cause us to become subject to remediation costs and liabilities under CERCLA, RCRA or other environmental laws. We cannot provide any assurance that the costs and liabilities associated with the future imposition of such remedial obligations upon us would not have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial position. 

&#160; 

Safety and health . The Occupational Safety and Health Act (&#8220;OSHA&#8221;) and comparable state laws strictly govern the protection of the health and safety of employees. The OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under the Title III of CERCLA and similar state statutes require that we organize and, as necessary, disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations to various federal, state and local agencies, as well as employees. 

&#160;
