 ITEM 1 BUSINESS 

&#160;

Overview 

&#160;

Smoofi, Inc. ("Smoofi," the "Company," "we," or "us.") was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on October 15, 2013, at which time we acquired a business plan for an online marketplace and community and website from Mr. Derek Cahill. Following our formation, we issued 21,750,000 shares of our common stock to Mr. Cahill, in exchange for a business plan along with a website. The cost incurred by Mr. Cahill for the business plan as well as related professional services was approximately $72,500 which is the value placed upon the shares issued to Mr. Cahill. 

&#160;

The Company presently has two business segments: (i) an online marketplace and community platform that is under development and which represents our original business commenced in fiscal 2014, and, (ii) as announced on April 22, 2015, we intend to provide consulting and advisory services to the cannabis industry. Due principally to our financial condition and resultant lack of financial resources as described elsewhere in this Form 10-K, to date neither segment has generated revenue due to the inability (i) to complete the development of and launch the online marketplace and community platform and (ii) to hire employees with the necessary expertise to commence the cannabis industry consulting and advisory services business and/or purchase businesses with appropriate business strategies and expertise, or farmland to cultivate cannabis crops.

&#160;

We are an emerging growth company as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act. Pursuant to Section 107 of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, we may take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards, meaning that we can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have chosen to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies to delay adoption of such standards until such standards are made applicable to private companies. Accordingly, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of public companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.

The Business 

&#160;

Online Market and Community Platform 

&#160;

Smoofi plans to provide an online market and community connecting local resources with local needs. The goal is to provide an online venue for basic services by aggregating these typically low cost services within each local market. This will maximize value for both the person or company requesting the service and for the person or company providing the service. For example, even a "stay at home mom" or "retired baby boomer" could earn an extra $5 to $100 a day by simply dropping off meals for seniors, walking a pet or providing home-based technical support. A service provider, such as a gardener or pet caretaker can now see the exact people requesting service within a specific ZIP Code or address and what day and time they want the service. This allows the gardener or pet caretaker to optimize their work schedule and earn more income by mowing more lawns or walking more pets in the same day which allows the service requestor to receive the service on the exact day and time they want. 

&#160;

&#160; &#160;

Smoofi' technology will be targeted for busy individuals, families and for people who need tasks completed at odd hours of the day. Smoofi works for any type of service from technical services (HDTV to computers), auto services (dents and windshields), home services (meals to pets to babysitting), real-estate services (notaries to gardening), transportation services (packages to people), personal services (exercise to haircuts), and much more. Smoofi also works great for non-profit organizations, institutions, city services and corporate services such as city parades, corporate events, non-profit activities (beach cleanup, meals on wheels, etc.) and others. 

&#160;

After it is launched, Smoofi will work by simply listing one's service on Smoofi.com by location, date, time, price, service type, service ranking and provider history. The first person who can provide that service on that date, at that time and meets the service ranking and history requirements will get the project. No bidding, no waiting a week for an auction to close, no shifting through numerous people to try to determine the best person. Smoofi plans to create an online service community where members track service provider history, including rankings, reliability, on time, etc. and creates an automated service request around this ranking and history. 

&#160;

The platform will also provide an online web space (Web 2.0 features) for each user. This allows the service requestor to track and manage all their services in one place, on one website. For example, keep grocery lists, medication lists, kids and family schedules, pick up places, and more all on their own Smoofi site. The service requestor determine who can see what information or log into his or her account. Smoofi plans to keep a complete audit trail of current and future service requests, costs and allows individuals to make payments to service providers via credit card or directly from the service requestor's bank account. Service providers will then be able to receive credit card payments for services formerly only paid for with cash, and these funds will be automatically transferred into a bank account. 

&#160;

The platform will also allow a service requestor to receive mobile alerts when their service provider (such as a pet walker) arrives at their house and when they leave your house. Smoofi will also keep an audit trail of all services provided, such as every time a meal is dropped off at your grandfather's house or his diabetes medication is delivered or when a pet is picked up and dropped off at the house. 

&#160;

The platform will be a useful tool for both service requestors and service providers. Service providers will benefit by having online access to view service requests in their community by location, date, time and service request type. This will allow service providers to group or aggregate their services and maximize their revenue opportunities. The platform also provides each service provider their own website to track and manage service requests and bids. It will also notify each service provider by email or mobile alert of new service requests within their saved search request and via mobile text messaging let the service requestor know when the service provider arrived and when it completed a service. Smoofi's platform will also allow service providers to accept credit card payments both via Smoofi's and via their own website, eliminating the problem of tracking down payment for services at a later time. 

&#160;

Smoofi's online marketplace and community is designed to solve a number of market problems: 

&#160;

&#160;

1) Matching local resources with local need.

&#160;

&#160;

2) Ability to aggregate small services and small transaction fees for basic services.

&#160;

&#160;

3) Provide funds and job opportunities for people with mixed schedules.

&#160;

&#160;

4) Provide an online community to rank and compare service providers.

&#160;

&#160;

5) Provide service requestors online space to track and manage service requests, receive mobile alerts of completed services, list services by data and time.

&#160;

&#160;

6) Provide service providers online space to track service requests and accept credit card payments.

&#160;

&#160; &#160;

Smoofi GeoCalendar 

&#160;

Smoofi's technology is based both on geographic location services (GIS) and mobile technology. A service requestor or service provider has the ability to list, search, track and manage services by geographic location, day &#38; time and service type. Smoofi calls this technology GeoCalendar. 

&#160;

Smoofi's technology will have all the basic online community features for the family or individual who needs help including a dedicated website for each family or individual to list and track their schedules, medication, transportation requirements, service requests, etc. By listing this information, a demand is created in the market place for these services. Helpers will be able to quickly match their availability via innovative Geographic Information Calendar or (GeoCalender). The site will also connect users via mobile phone, sending text message reminders, alerts, arrival and departure times, grocery lists, etc. (via text message back to the system) and integrated services to rank and track service requests and service providers. 

&#160;

Smoofi's technology will also have all the basic online community features for the service provider, including a detailed online profile (gender, availability, rate, ZIP Code), pictures, videos, and more. But service providers will also have access to an online website to view, track and manage the family or individual they are helping. For example, they could view the family or individual website to see class schedules, grocery list, pet pictures, etc. The service provider could also text back to the website and alert others (such as family members) on arrival time, departure time, confirm medication has been taken, etc. The text will also become part of the individual or family member website creating an online audit trail of the persons care or service, even though the service maybe provided by 1 or even one hundred different service providers throughout the years. 

&#160;

Later versions of Smoofi's technology will also create a push model for Non-Profit Organizations, City Organizations or Athletic Organizations to push requests out to the community for support. Smoofi GeoCalendar will differentiate between paying activities and non-profit activities. But in some cases non-profit or even city events may pay minimum wage for basic services (security, crowd control, parade clean-up, etc.). City organizations and non-profits currently find it hard to find basic resources to help within the community and often end up paying for these services. This later version of Smoofi's technology will also allow people to participate in non-profit events and get the word out about special events in the local community. Services that can be Aggregated and Pushed by Location, Organization, Community, Service Type, or Date and Time. 

&#160;

The following summarizes the various types of services that will be addressed by Smoofi's online market and community:

&#160;

Meal Delivery (seniors / special needs)

Pet Services (dog walking, pet cleaning)

Athletic Organizations / Events

At Home Care

Real Estate Services (loan documents, notary, house management)

&#160; &#160;

Online &#38; Mobile Advertising 

&#160;

Smoofi's technology maximizes web portal utilization to push local advertisements both on the website and on mobile text messages and email alerts. These advertisements will be geared both to the service provider and the service requester and towards the service that is being provided and the ZIP Code they live in. 

&#160;

For example, a service request for someone to wash their dog will result in an online service request on Smoofi's platform. When a service requestor submits the request, they may see an advertisement for dog food. When the service provider logs in and views the requested service, they may see an advertisement for dog shampoo or local pet store. 

&#160;

Also, the service requestor will receive a mobile alert when the service provider arrives up at its house to walk the dog and when they leave. This mobile alert will have a mobile text advertisement such as information on a local pet store. When the service requestor approves payment online, the service provider will receive a mobile alert that the payment is made, the advertisement to service provider may be a local supply shop or additional pet walking requests from the website. 

&#160;

Smoofi's technology will combine online market, community and geographic information services with mobile text messaging, advertising and mobile geographic information services. Even local coupons or coupon codes can be sent to mobile phones and integrated with each service request. Advertisers can also narrow down their advertisement by ZIP Code, service type, or day and time. 

&#160;

Smoofi's target market generally is urban communities where many people have mixed schedules and/or want to earn extra income for weekend or general expenses. For example, many people are involved in multi-tiered marketing programs such as Juice Plus, Pampered Chef, Avon and others. We believe that many people just want extra income to offset personal expenses. In other cases baby boomers are working at Macy's, Crate &#38; Barrel, as kindergarten teachers, pet walkers and many other jobs. This leads us to believe that there's an underlying market and demand for these services. With our intended platform, people will be able to get paid for services they enjoy performing such as those described above. Whatever their interest, there's a way to make additional revenue. 

&#160;

Smoofi "Get &#38; Share" - Viral Marketing 

&#160;

An existing open source technology is "Get &#38; Share." This is how "Get &#38; Share" works: a user can right click on any of our intended services and paste it on social media sites such as YouTube, Facebook, iGoogle or other web community site. This technology will allow users to copy Smoofi service requests and paste them on their most popular site. In doing so, if a service provider clicks on the link and accepts the service request from the Smoofi site, a credit will be provided back to this user. In other words, the user that posts the service, gets paid for generating either a response to the need for the service or an offer to provide the service. We believe this will create a Viral Marketing program for Smoofi and extend users social media accounts allowing them to book and manage basic services both for income or for personal or family use.

&#160; &#160;

Smoofi Payment Engine 

&#160;

Similar to Google Checkout or PayPal, the Smoofi payment engine will allow service providers to accept credit card transactions, either on the Smoofi website, on their own website or via email. Initially Smoofi may utilize Google's Checkout API or PayPal's API to handle financial transactions brining security and name brand to Smoofi's services. Over time we believe there is a great opportunity to create a customized payment transaction engine dedicated to the service industry. 

&#160;

Smoofi Revenue Model 

&#160;

Smoofi has the following revenue models, each will morph into a different revenue model as the site gains traction. 

&#160;

1) Transaction Fees - Smoofi will receive $1 for each transaction from the service requestor upon listing of the available job. Users can pay fees via credit card.

a. Viral Marketing - A $.25 credit will be provided back to those users who place Smoofi "Get &#38; Share" ads on their Facebook pages and/or other community websites when a Service Provider clicks their link and accepts the service terms.

2) Keyword Advertising - using Google Adwords or Yahoo Marketing, Smoofi can provide online advertisements and mobile text message advertisements.

a. Smoofi Advertising Engine - Over time Smoofi will develop its own advertising engine where advertisers can bid on key terms at the ZIP Code level and determine if they want online or mobile text messages or both.

b. We believe the advantage of our advertising engine is that the user will know the exact address and interest of the service requestor which will allow the user to provide targeted ads, such as an advertisement for PetCo to all people requesting dog walks.

3) Credit Card Transactions - using Google Checkout and/or PayPal, Smoofi will be able to generate revenue via credit card transactions.

a. Credit Card Transaction Engine - developing a custom transaction engine with a major bank or partnering with Google Checkout, Smoofi intends to have their own proprietary credit card transaction engine for service providers.

4) Mobile Text Messaging Services - using mobile text messaging (or emails) to notify the user of arrival and departure times of service providers will allow for targeted advertising by service type and ZIP Code.

5) Membership Fees - there will be no membership fees in the first version of Smoofi, but over time service providers may be charged an annual membership fee ($25 to $100) to join Smoofi. The benefits are more business, online and mobile alerts, online and mobile directions, online payment gateway to accept credit card transactions.

Marketing Plan - Initial Launch 

&#160;

Smoofi will leverage two major marketing, branding and PR programs. First, Smoofi will initially focus on launching its platform in only key markets such as California. Secondly, Smoofi will only expand to other markets as technology is proven and tested. In other words, Smoofi will not endeavor to grow too fast until the concept is completely proven out on a small scale. Eventually, Smoofi will use AM Radio advertising to target people in traffic during peak times who have limited time and need basic services completed at specific dates and time and are willing to pay a $1.00 for this service. Smoofi will also leverage Web 2.0 services to create viral marketing programs throughout the web integrating Smoofi services with other major community websites such as Facebook. 

&#160;

Competitive Conditions 

&#160;

There are many online and offline technologies similar to Smoofi's such as Craig's List, Kudzu, eBay Auctions, Penny Saver, and others; however, we do not believe there are any online websites that focus only on the service industry as an eCommerce / classifieds / auction marketplace. Craig's List does not have an eCommerce or credit card system and there is no member feedback or rating system. 

&#160;

Smoofi will target the underlining service industry, setting up a system for online services by ZIP Code where service providers can quickly qualify and identify leads by price, location and service type. Service requestors will be able to quickly list services and find qualified candidates based things such as feedback rating and length of membership. The service requestor will also be able to pay via credit card. We intend Smoofi to be a safe, secure, easy to use, and self-regulating community based on an eBay type rating system. 

&#160;

Market Demand - Demographics 

&#160;

Demographics - A Growing Problem for the Service Industry. We believe the historical trend that sees the older population growing at a faster pace than the total population will continue well into the 21st Century.

Government Regulation and Industry Standards 

&#160;

There are an increasing number of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad pertaining to communications and commerce on the Internet. In addition, a number of legislative and regulatory proposals are under consideration by federal, state, local and foreign governments. Laws or regulations may be adopted with respect to the Internet relating to liability for information retrieved from or transmitted over the Internet, user privacy, taxation and the quality of products and services. Moreover, the application to the Internet of existing laws governing issues such as intellectual property ownership and infringement, pornography, obscenity, libel, gaming, employment and personal privacy is uncertain and developing. Any such legislation or regulation, or the application or interpretation of existing laws, may decrease the growth in the use of the Internet in general, prevent us from delivering our content in different parts of the world and increase our costs of selling products or otherwise operating our business. 

&#160;

Furthermore, legislation regulating online content could limit the growth in use of the Internet generally and decrease the overwhelming acceptance of the Internet as an advertising and e-commerce medium. 

&#160;

Websites typically place identifying data, or cookies, on a user's hard drive without the user's knowledge or consent. We and many other Internet companies will use cookies for a variety of different reasons, including the collection of data derived from the user's Internet activity. Any reduction or limitation in the use of cookies could limit the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts. Most currently available Web browsers allow users to remove cookies at any time or to prevent cookies from being stored on their hard drive. 

&#160;

Some privacy advocates and governmental bodies have suggested limiting or eliminating the use of cookies. In addition, the European Union and many countries within the EU have adopted privacy directives or laws that strictly regulate the collection and use of information regarding Internet users that is identifiable to particular individuals. Privacy legislation has been proposed in the US as well, and the US Federal Trade Commission has taken action against website operators that do not comply with state privacy policies. These and other governmental efforts may limit our ability to target advertising or collect and use information regarding the use of our websites. Fears relating to a lack of privacy could also result in a reduction in the number of our users and subscribers which could harm our business and financial results. 

&#160;

Operations, Consulting and Advisory Services in the Cannabis Industry 

&#160;

As an expansion of our overall business strategy, we have appointed a new Director to expand our platform and services to enter the cannabis industry. We intended to enter into this area by leasing farm land.

&#160;

&#160; &#160;

Governmental Regulations

&#160;

Cannabis is subject to regulation at both the federal and state level, with both hemp and its cousin marijuana being classified as a Schedule 1 controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act ("CSA"), which generally means that Congress has determined that marijuana is a dangerous drug and that the illegal distribution and sale of marijuana is a serious crime. The CSA does not recognize the differences between medical and recreational uses of marijuana and all uses are prohibited. Notwithstanding the federal classification, currently 23 states and the District of Columbia have laws and/or regulations legalizing the use of marijuana in some form or another for legitimate medical purposes. Four of those states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana for recreational use. A number of other states have decriminalized the possession of small amounts of marijuana. 

&#160;

Twenty-seven states have removed some legal barriers to the production of industrial hemp, three of which now license or register farmers to grow hemp under state law. In January of 2015, the Industrial Hemp Farming Act was introduced in the U.S. House and Senate. If passed, all current restrictions on the cultivation of industrial hemp would be removed, along with its classification as a Schedule 1 controlled substance. Industrial hemp is legal to grow in more than 30 countries. The United States is one of the few industrialized nations that does not currently allow the cultivation of hemp. A substantial volume of hemp is imported into the United States each year, primarily from Canada and China, in order to fulfill the growing domestic demand for hemp products. The annual retail sales for hemp products was estimated at $620 million in 2014. 

&#160;

In addition to federal and state legislation, local laws at the county, city and municipality level add further complexity. Despite a state's having adopted legislation legalizing cannabis, such entities within the state seem to have the ability to otherwise restrict cannabis activities, including but not limited to cultivation, retail or consumption through zoning or other means.

&#160;

The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network ("FinCEN") provided guidance in 2014 about how financial institutions, such as banks and brokers or dealers in securities, can provide services to marijuana-related businesses consistent with their Bank Secrecy Act ("BSA") obligations. As a result, access to the U.S. banking system is effectively denied to businesses engaged in many aspects of the cannabis, or more specifically marijuana, industry. The Company does not intend to engage in any such business activities.

&#160;

Competitive Conditions

&#160;

The market for cannabis products and related services is highly fragmented and competitive, with hundreds of public and privately owned companies participating in one or more aspects of hemp or marijuana products, including both those from traditional businesses and emerging marijuana industry companies. As with many other industries, competition is based on price, product or service quality, customer service, brand name and marketing and trade support, and successful new product introductions. Many competitors have or will have significantly greater financial and other resources available to them. Large, well-capitalized pharmaceutical companies may chose enter the cannabis industry, particularly if marijuana and hemp are decriminalized.

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

We have no patents or trademarks.

&#160; &#160;

Seasonality

&#160;

The cultivation of cannabis crops is highly seasonable; accordingly, future revenue that might be derived from this activity will be seasonable. The other activities that we will engage in are not seasonable.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160; 

As of January 8, 2016, we had two employees; Mr. Sean Clarke, serving as our chief executive officer, president and chief financial officer, Mr. John Donahue serving as our chief operating officer, neither of whom presently work for the Company on a full time basis. Mr. Clarke is allowed to devote a limited amount of his time to us as he is not limited or restricted from being involved with us by his current employer. He is under no contractual agreement with us and has not received cash compensation to date. Mr. Clarke has been initially compensated through the issuance of shares of the Company's common stock and will not receive cash compensation until such time as we are able to raise sufficient equity or debt financing or we become profitable. We entered into an engagement agreement with Newport Board Group on April 21, 2015 for a term of 60 days for Mr. Donahue to serve as chief operating officer. A new agreement was signed effective June 21, 2015 which extends Mr. Donahue's services on a month to month basis. The monthly fee under both agreements is $4,000. At September 30, 2015, $9,500 of unpaid fees was accrued. No further payments have been made since that date.

&#160;

In the past, we retained an independent software development firm on an "as needed" basis, and we may in the future use other independent contractors and consultants to assist in many aspects of our business on an "as needed" or per project basis pending adequate financial resources being available or their ability to defer payment for their services.
