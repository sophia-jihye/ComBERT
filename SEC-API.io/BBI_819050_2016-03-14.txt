 ITEM 1. 

BUSINESS

Overview

We research and develop biopharmaceutical products, including those based on our patented DNA delivery technologies, for the prevention and treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases.

We currently have four active, independent or partnered, development programs in the area of infectious disease comprised of:

&#160;

&#183; 

An ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial of ASP0113 for prevention of cytomegalovirus, or CMV, reactivation in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients and an ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial of ASP0113 for prevention of CMV infection in kidney transplant recipients, both in collaboration with Astellas Pharma Inc., or Astellas. Astellas expects enrollment in the Phase 3 clinical trial to be completed during the third quarter of 2016. Enrollment in the Phase 2 trial was completed in May of 2015 and top-line results are expected during the third quarter of 2016; 

&#160;

&#183; 

In June 2015, we announced top-line results from an ongoing randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled Phase 1/2 clinical study of our therapeutic genital herpes vaccine, designed to reduce viral shedding and genital herpes lesions in herpes simplex virus type 2, or HSV-2, infected patients. The trial enrolled patients across seven U.S. sites and evaluated a monovalent (gD) vaccine and a bivalent (gD + UL46) vaccine. Neither the monovalent nor bivalent vaccine met the primary endpoint (reduction of viral shedding from baseline). Patients were also followed for safety for 12 months and efficacy for nine months after their final vaccine dose. During that period we collected additional clinical efficacy data including lesion rate. We anticipate these additional results will be announced in the first quarter of 2016 and that the additional results will enable us to determine the appropriate next steps for this program. 

&#160;

&#183; 

An ongoing Phase 1 program of VL-2397 for invasive fungal infections, including invasive Aspergillus, which are major causes of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients, including transplant recipients; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

A completed preclinical program, with an allowed investigational new drug application, or IND, using our CyMVectin&#8482; prophylactic vaccine formulated with our proprietary Vaxfectin &#174; adjuvant to prevent CMV infection during pregnancy. 

In addition, we have licensed complementary technologies from leading research institutions and biopharmaceutical companies.

Available Information

We were incorporated in Delaware in 1987. Our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, are available free of charge on our website at www.vical.com as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports and amendments are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. We also make available copies of our news releases and other financial information about us on our website.

Our Core Technology

The key discovery leading to our core DNA delivery technology was that muscle tissues can take up polynucleotide genetic material, such as DNA or RNA, directly, without the use of viral components or other delivery vehicles or technologies, and subsequently express the proteins encoded by the genetic material for periods ranging from weeks to more than a year. Our approach typically involves designing and constructing closed loops of DNA called plasmids, or pDNAs. These pDNAs contain a DNA segment encoding the protein of interest, as well as short segments of DNA that control protein expression. Plasmids can be manufactured using uniform methods of fermentation and processing. This could result in faster development and production times than technologies that require development of product-specific manufacturing processes.

Since the initial discovery of our DNA delivery technology, our researchers have improved the design of our plasmids to increase efficiency of gene expression and immunogenicity. We own broad patent rights in the United States and in key foreign markets to certain non-viral polynucleotide delivery technologies. Our patents and patent applications cover, for 

example, specific DNA constructs and formulations of gene-based product candidates, methods for producing pharmaceutical-grade DNA, and s everal families of lipid molecules and their uses in DNA delivery. Benefits of our DNA delivery technologies may include the following, which may enable us to offer novel treatment alternatives for diseases that are currently poorly addressed: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Broad Applicability . Our DNA delivery technologies may be useful in vaccines for infectious diseases, in which the expressed protein induces an immune response, and for therapeutic protein delivery, in which the expressed protein is a therapeutic agent; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Convenience . Our DNA-based biopharmaceutical product candidates are intended to be administered on an outpatient basis; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Safety . Our product candidates contain no infectious components that may cause unwanted immune responses, infections, or malignant and permanent changes in the targeted cells&#8217; genetic makeup; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Repeat Administration . Our product candidates contain no infectious components that may preclude multiple dosing with a single product or use in multiple products; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Ease of Manufacturing . Our product candidates are manufactured using uniform fermentation and purification procedures; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

Cost-Effectiveness . Our DNA delivery technologies may be more cost-effective than other approaches. They may also cause fewer potential side effects, which may reduce per patient treatment costs. 

DNA Technology

Our DNA delivery technology is currently being developed by us and our partners in the area of infectious disease:

Infectious Diseases

DNA vaccines use portions of the genetic code of a pathogen to cause the host to produce proteins of the pathogen that may induce an immune response. Compared with conventional vaccines that use live, weakened, or killed pathogens to produce an immune response, this method potentially offers superior safety and ease of manufacturing, as well as convenient storage and handling characteristics. DNA vaccines have the potential to induce potent T-cell responses against target pathogens as well as trigger production of antibodies. Over the past decade, many scientific publications have documented the effectiveness of DNA vaccines in contributing to immune responses in dozens of species, including fish, nonhuman primates and humans. We believe important steps in the validation of DNA vaccines occurred in 2005 when our licensee Aqua Health received Canadian approval to market its proprietary product, Apex &#174; -IHN, a DNA vaccine to protect farm-raised salmon against infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus, or IHNV, and again in late 2009, when our licensee Merial received approval from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, or USDA, to sell a therapeutic DNA vaccine, ONCEPT &#174; , designed to aid in extending the survival time of dogs with oral melanoma.

Vaccines are generally recognized as the most cost-effective approach for infectious disease healthcare. However, the technical limitations of conventional vaccine approaches have constrained the development of effective vaccines for many diseases. Development of vaccines based on conventional methods requires significant infrastructure in research and manufacturing. In addition, the safety risks associated with certain conventional vaccine approaches may offset their potential benefits. We believe our potential vaccine products may be simpler to manufacture than vaccines made using live viruses or protein subunit approaches, including those involving mammalian, avian or insect cell, or egg-based, culture procedures. In addition, our DNA delivery technologies may accelerate certain aspects of vaccine product development such as nonclinical evaluation and manufacturing.

In the broader vaccine marketplace, it is important to note a changing dynamic. Traditionally, vaccines have been predominantly focused on the pediatric market, intended to protect children from diseases that could cause them serious harm. Today, there is a growing interest in vaccines against diseases that may affect adolescents and adults, which include both sexually transmitted diseases and infections that strike opportunistically, such as during pregnancy or in immunocompromised individuals. We believe our technologies, because of their potential safety and development timeline advantages, could be ideally suited for this new generation of vaccines.

Manufacturing Process Development 

The bacterial fermentation process typically used for DNA vaccines produces a closed loop of DNA, called a plasmid, which must include DNA sequences required in the manufacturing process. Conventional vaccine development and manufacturing methods require prolonged effort after the emergence of a new pathogen for production of even a single dose for testing. Current DNA vaccine development and manufacturing processes allow initial production of vaccines in as little as three months after selection of a gene sequence associated with a pathogen, but quantities are limited by the batch-processing capacity of available manufacturing equipment.

Business Strategy

There are three basic elements to our business strategy:

Develop Products Independently

We currently focus our resources on the independent development of infectious disease vaccines. The selection of targets for our independent development programs is driven by three key criteria: the complexity of the product development program, competition, and commercial opportunities. We intend to retain significant participation in the commercialization of any independently developed proprietary DNA vaccines and therapeutics that receive regulatory approval, although we may choose to enlist the support of partners to accelerate product development and commercialization.

Vaccines are perceived by government and medical communities as an efficient and cost-effective means of healthcare. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, &#8220;Vaccines are among the very best protections we have against infectious diseases.&#8221; In the infectious disease area, we are currently focusing our resources on the development of DNA-based vaccines against CMV and HSV-2. We are also focusing our resources on VL-2397, a therapeutic anti-fungal product candidate we recently in-licensed from Astellas. We believe our technologies may lead to the development of novel preventive or therapeutic products for infectious disease targets. DNA vaccines may help combat diseases for which conventional vaccine methods have been unsuccessful. 

Expand the Applications of Our Technologies through Strategic Collaborations

We collaborate with major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and government agencies, providing us access to complementary technologies or greater resources. These collaborations are intended to provide us with mutually beneficial opportunities to expand or advance our product pipeline and serve significant unmet medical needs. We license our intellectual property to other companies to leverage our technologies for applications that may not be appropriate for our independent product development.

Pursue Contract Manufacturing Opportunities

We selectively pursue contract manufacturing opportunities to leverage our infrastructure and expertise in pDNA manufacturing, to support advancement and application of our technologies by others, and to provide revenues that contribute to our independent research and development efforts.

Product Development 

We, together with our licensees and collaborators, are currently developing a number of DNA-based vaccines and other therapeutics for the prevention or treatment of infectious diseases. The table below summarizes our current independent programs and corporate and government collaborations.

&#8220;Preclinical&#8221; indicates that a specific product candidate in a nonclinical setting has shown functional activity that is relevant to a targeted medical need, and is advancing toward initial human clinical testing. &#8220;Phase 1&#8221; clinical trials are typically conducted with a small number of patients or healthy subjects to evaluate safety, determine a safe dosage range, identify side effects, and, if possible, gain early evidence of effectiveness. &#8220;Phase 2&#8221; clinical trials are conducted with a larger group of patients to evaluate effectiveness of an investigational product for a defined patient population, and to determine common short-term side effects and risks associated with the product candidate. &#8220;Phase 3&#8221; clinical trials involve large scale, multi-center, comparative trials that are conducted with patients afflicted with a target disease to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product labeling.

&#160;

Programs Targeting Infectious Diseases

Herpes Simplex Virus - 2

In December 2013, we initiated a Phase 1/2 trial of our Vaxfectin &#174; -formulated therapeutic vaccine for HSV-2. A total of 165 HSV-2-infected patients were enrolled in the trial. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluated safety, tolerability and efficacy in otherwise healthy HSV-2-infected patients aged 18 to 50 years who have experienced 2 to 9 genital herpes recurrences within the prior year. The trial enrolled subjects at seven U.S. clinical sites. 

This trial tested the effectiveness of two HSV-2 vaccines that we are developing, a monovalent vaccine and a bivalent vaccine, by comparing the viral shedding rate prevaccination (baseline) to the viral shedding rate postvaccination of each subject. Viral shedding was measured by daily self-collected swabs that were sampled for detectable HSV-2 DNA by PCR assay. In addition to this primary efficacy endpoint, this trial also evaluated several secondary outcome measures, including genital lesion rate change from baseline, the HSV viral load (or copy numbers) from baseline, as well as the immunological responses over time from baseline. 

In June 2015, we announced top-line results from the Phase 1/2 trial. Neither the monovalent nor bivalent vaccine met the primary endpoint (reduction of viral shedding from baseline). All patients were also followed for safety for 12 months and efficacy for nine months after their final vaccine dose. During that period we collected additional clinical efficacy data including lesion rate. The bivalent vaccine continued to achieve statistically significant reductions in the clinically meaningful secondary endpoint of genital lesion rate when compared to the pre-vaccination period at the 9-month time point after the patients final dose. Neither the placebo nor the monovalent vaccine groups achieved statistical significance on this endpoint at nine months after vaccination. We are reviewing this data and the T-cell immunogenicity results with our clinical advisory board to determine the best path forward for the program.

About HSV-2 

HSV-2 is a member of the herpes virus family and is the leading cause of recurrent genital herpes worldwide. About 400 million people aged 15-49 years are living with HSV-2 worldwide, and about 20 million are newly infected every year. About one in six adults in the United States are infected with HSV-2. Even higher infection rates are evident in developing countries, with further complications in people also infected with HIV. HSV-2 infections are permanent and result in periodic virus shedding. There is no approved vaccine for HSV-2. Although antiviral regimens have become a standard of care in developed countries, we believe their inconvenience and cumulative cost underscore the need for safe, new approaches to reducing HSV-2 lesions, shedding, and transmission.

CMV Vaccines

CMV is a ubiquitous herpes virus that can cause serious complications in two distinct patient populations: immunocompromised transplant patients and children who were congenitally infected during pregnancy. We are currently developing two CMV vaccines to address the unmet needs in each of these two populations: ASP0113 (TransVax&#8482;; in collaboration with Astellas) and CyMVectin&#8482;. ASP0113 is designed to serve the first patient population by preventing CMV reactivation or infection in transplant recipients. In 2011, we licensed the right to develop and commercialize ASP0113 to Astellas. CyMVectin&#8482; is designed to serve the second, much larger patient population by preventing primary CMV infection during pregnancy and thereby precluding maternal-fetal CMV transmission, congenital CMV infection, and related birth defects. We believe congenital CMV represents a major commercial opportunity and could potentially lead to universal vaccination.

In 2013, our licensee, Astellas initiated two ASP0113 clinical trials including a global Phase 3 registration trial of ASP0113 in approximately 500 HCT recipients. This 1:1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial will enroll CMV seropositive subjects undergoing HCT procedures. Randomization will be stratified by donor-recipient relatedness and donor CMV serostatus. The trial will enroll approximately 500 subjects and the primary endpoint will be a composite of overall mortality and CMV end organ disease. Treatment and follow-up for each subject will continue for one year following enrollment. During the course of the trial, an independent statistician conducted a series of futility analyses based upon viral load. The final of these analyses has now been completed and the trial continues as planned. Enrollment of the Phase 3 trial is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2016, with top-line data expected to be available in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Astellas also initiated a Phase 2 trial of ASP0113 in approximately 140 solid organ transplant recipients. This global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy of ASP0113 compared to placebo as measured by the incidence of CMV viremia in CMV-seronegative subjects receiving a kidney from a CMV-seropositive donor. The study will also evaluate the safety of ASP0113 in this patient population. Follow-up for each subject will continue for one year following enrollment. Enrollment of the Phase 2 trial was completed in May of 2015. Top-line results are expected to be released in the third quarter of 2016.

Prior to licensing ASP0113 to Astellas, we completed a multicenter Phase 2 trial in 94 CMV-seropositive HCT recipients (14 donor-recipient pairs and 80 recipient-only subjects), randomized 1:1 for vaccine or placebo. Subjects enrolled were 18-65 years old and diagnosed with selected leukemias or lymphomas. Enrollment in the trial was completed in November 2008 and a 1-year follow up was completed in November 2009. In 2010, we released 12 month post-transplant data, and showed that significant reductions were achieved for key viral reactivation metrics. The final study results were published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases in January 2012.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and European Medicines Agency has designated ASP0113 as an orphan drug for the prevention of clinically significant CMV viremia, CMV disease and associated complications in at-risk transplant populations. Orphan drug designation provides certain tax benefits for qualifying expenses in the U.S. and can result in extended marketing exclusivity both in the U.S. and Europe.

We initially developed ASP0113 as a pathway to establish a CMV vaccine proof of concept in a relatively small patient population. We d ecided to specifically target patients who were susceptible to CMV reactivation in HCT patients. Therefore we designed a vaccine that would primarily induce a cellular immune response. ASP0113 is a plasmid DNA vaccine that induces both T-cell and antibody responses by expressing two antigens: pp65 and gB. The tegument protein, pp65, is a major antigen recognized by T cells in CMV-infected individuals. The gB protein is a major surface antigen of CMV and a primary target of neutralizing antibodies. The gB pr otein is also a major CMV antigen recognized by both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in CMV-seropositive subjects. Induction of gB-specific T cells following DNA vaccination may provide an additional antiviral mechanism that could act to reduce CMV replication and v iral loads shortly after infection. The vaccine is also formulated with poloxamer CRL1005, which has been shown in nonclinical studies by us and others to enhance gene expression and immune responses. 

CyMVectin&#8482;

CMV is the most common congenital infection in the United States and a leading cause of birth defects. If a woman becomes infected with CMV for the first time during pregnancy, the manifestations of congenital infection can be very severe and there are no treatment options available. CyMVectin&#8482; is designed to prevent CMV infection prior to pregnancy. We believe this may ultimately reduce birth defects caused by CMV.

CyMVectin&#8482; consists of pDNA that encodes the human CMV glycoprotein B, or gB, antigen and pDNA that encodes the human CMV phosphoprotein 65, or pp65, antigen. The product is formulated with our proprietary lipid-based adjuvant Vaxfectin &#174; . Vaxfectin &#174; has been shown in clinical and/or nonclinical studies by us and others to enhance immune responses, particularly antibody responses, to expressed immunogens. A recombinant gB protein-based vaccine, developed by others, has shown some protection against maternal CMV infection in a Phase 2 clinical trial, so we believe a vaccine strategy for CMV prevention can be successful. In addition, prior maternal CMV infection is associated with a reduction of risk of congenital infection. Nonclinical studies performed in rabbit, guinea pig and mouse animal models have demonstrated the ability to induce high titers of gB-specific antibodies in animals receiving the gB plasmid. Rabbit studies of Vaxfectin &#174; -formulated gB pDNA demonstrated an approximately 10-fold enhancement of gB when compared to gB pDNA in phosphate-buffered saline. Similarly, mouse studies also demonstrated this added benefit of Vaxfectin &#174; as an adjuvant. The results of these and prior published studies provide support that immune responses can be induced by pDNA vaccination and that formulation with Vaxfectin &#174; enhances those immune responses. Phosphoprotein 65 is a major CMV tegument protein that is among the most widely recognized CMV antigens by both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in CMV-seropositive subjects. Induction of pp65-specific T cells following vaccination may provide an additional antiviral mechanism that could limit the spread of CMV infection by reducing CMV replication and viral loads. A repeat dose safety study in rabbits with Vaxfectin &#174; -formulated gB and pp65 plasmids supports the conduct of an initial safety study in humans under an allowed IND.

About CMV

CMV infects over 50% of adults in the United States by age 50. Although most healthy people who are infected by CMV after birth are asymptomatic, CMV can affect certain high-risk groups, including immunocompromised individuals and congenitally-infected infants. Significant mortality and morbidity are observed in the immunocompromised populations, especially hematopoietic stem cell transplant, or HCT, and solid organ transplant, or SOT, recipients. In CMV-seropositive HCT recipients, the incidence of CMV reactivation in the first three months following transplantation is 50-70%, and these subjects are at increased risk for CMV end-organ disease. The incidence of CMV disease has been reduced to approximately 5% by the use of preemptive antiviral therapy, but currently available antiviral therapies are associated with drug toxicity, are costly, may lead to drug resistance and provide incomplete efficacy. Late-onset CMV reactivation may also occur after this initial period of heightened susceptibility. Despite current antiviral treatments that reduce the incidence of CMV disease, CMV-seropositive HCT recipients are still at increased risk of overall mortality as well as significant morbidities or mortalities from acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease, as well as other non-CMV infectious diseases.

Currently no vaccine is approved for the prevention of CMV infection. The only approved treatment for CMV in HCT patients is ganciclovir, although other antivirals are used off label, such as valganciclovir, foscarnet, and cidofovir. We believe a vaccine that enables the patient&#8217;s immune system to control CMV infection, thereby reducing the need for antiviral therapy, would be a valuable therapeutic option for HCT recipients. The control of CMV in immunocompromised persons is primarily associated with T-cell mediated immune responses.

CMV-seropositive HCT and SOT recipients represent important populations for the prevention of CMV reactivation and reduction in antiviral therapy. Approximately 50,000 HCTs and 100,000 SOTs are performed annually throughout the world. We believe these populations represent a significant market potential for our ASP0113 vaccine.

CyMVectin&#8482; was designed to prevent CMV infection prior to pregnancy. We believe this may ultimately reduce birth defects caused by CMV. In the United States, congenital infection occurs in about 1 in 150 live-born infants and results in permanent disabilities, including hearing loss, mental retardation and vision loss in approximately 5,000 children per year, and approximately 500 deaths annuall y. Congenital infection can also occur in CMV-seropositive women. Prior maternal CMV infection is associated with a reduction of the frequency and severity of congenital infection. Contact with infected young children is the primary source of infection for pregnant women, especially those exposed to children in daycare environments. 

DNA vaccine induction of CMV-specific antibodies and T-cell responses may prevent or limit CMV infection in women during pregnancy, which could impact congenital CMV transmission and the incidence of newborns suffering from the morbidities or mortality inflicted by CMV infections. We believe that there is a significant market potential for our CyMVectin&#8482; vaccine, as there are more than 30 million CMV seronegative women of childbearing age (10 to 49 years) in the United States.

Antifungal Program

In March 2016, we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial of our novel antifungal candidate, VL-2397. The randomized, double-blind trial will evaluate safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of VL-2397 at single and multiple ascending doses in otherwise healthy volunteers at one U.S. clinical site. We intend to develop VL-2397 as a front-line therapy for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis and as part of a combination regimen for preemptive treatment of fungal infections, which may represent a meaningful commercial opportunity within the global market for systemic antifungals. The FDA recently granted us orphan drug and qualified infectious disease designation for VL-2397 for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis.

VL-2397 represents a potential new class of antifungal compound to address invasive aspergillus infections, which are major causes of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients, including transplant recipients. In preclinical studies to date, it has demonstrated faster fungicidal activity than marketed drugs and activity against azole-resistant fungal pathogens. Current treatment options have limited efficacy, as approximately 50-60% of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients with invasive aspergillosis infections die within 12 weeks. Over the past 30 years, only one new class of antifungal drugs (echinocandins) has been introduced.

Other Infectious Disease Programs 

Ebola

In January 2015, we and AnGes MG announced a collaboration to develop and commercialize an equine polyclonal antibody therapy for patients afflicted with Ebola virus disease. We will develop and provide to AnGes a DNA vaccine encoding the glycoprotein antigen of the 2014 Zaire strain of Ebola virus, formulated with our proprietary Vaxfectin &#174; adjuvant. AnGes received the right to exclusively develop and commercialize the equine polyclonal antibody therapy in Japan and will be responsible for all development costs. We received an upfront payment and are eligible to receive royalties on net sales and a percentage of payments received by AnGes under any sub-licensing agreements.

Government Collaborations

We have developed several vaccines targeting other diseases including dengue, malaria, anthrax, severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, West Nile virus, or WNV, and Ebola. We have performed nonclinical work and completed a Phase 1 clinical trial targeting anthrax. The Naval Medical Research Center, or NMRC, has completed a Phase 1 study of a tetravalent (serotypes 1, 2, 3, and 4) dengue DNA vaccine formulated with Vaxfectin &#174; . The National Institutes of Health, or NIH, has completed Phase 1 clinical trials using our vaccines targeting SARS, WNV and Ebola. Due to the lack of commercial opportunities and government funding, we do not plan on further developing these vaccines at this time.

Adjuvant Development

DNA Vaccines with Vaxfectin &#174; 

Vaxfectin &#174; is our proprietary, cationic lipid formulation optimized to increase the immune response to vaccines. Vaxfectin &#174; formulations have demonstrated safety and adjuvant activity in pDNA vaccine applications in multiple animal models, including nonhuman primates. Studies of Vaxfectin &#174; -formulated pDNA vaccines against CMV and measles have shown enhanced immunogenicity in rodents and nonhuman primates. Vaxfectin &#174; -formulated pDNA vaccines have also been tested in approximately 120 healthy human subjects receiving influenza or dengue vaccines, and collectively, these Phase 1 

trials indicate favorable safety profiles of these vaccines. Further clinical data with Vaxfectin &#174; -formulated HSV-2 vaccines has been gathered during the Ph ase 1/2 trial mentioned above. We believe Vaxfectin &#174; is an important potentiator of both antibody and T-cell mediated immune responses to pDNA vaccines. 

Other Vaxfectin &#174; Applications

In 2013, we entered into a nonexclusive license with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, or BMS, for our patented platform DNA immunization technology and our Vaxfectin &#174; adjuvant for use in the production of antibodies. Under the agreement, BMS is using our technology to generate antibodies with potential therapeutic uses in humans. We also agreed to provide specified quantities of our Vaxfectin &#174; adjuvant to BMS from time to time.

Collaboration and Licensing Agreements

We have entered into various arrangements with corporate, academic, and government collaborators, licensors, licensees, and others. In addition to the agreements summarized below, we conduct ongoing discussions with potential collaborators, licensors and licensees.

Out-licensing

Astellas . In July 2011, we entered into license agreements with Astellas, granting Astellas exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing licenses under certain of the Company&#8217;s intellectual property to develop and commercialize certain products containing plasmids encoding certain forms of gB, and/or pp65, including ASP0113 but excluding CyMVectin&#8482;. Under the agreements, Astellas is responsible for the worldwide development and commercialization of products in the licensed field, at its expense, and has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize at least one licensed product for use in certain immunocompromised patients in the licensed field in the United States and certain other major markets. 

Under the terms of the license agreements, Astellas paid a nonrefundable upfront license fee of $25.0 million in 2011. We received an additional $10.0 million in 2012 upon finalization of the trial design for a Phase 3 registration trial of ASP0113 in HCT recipients. We are also entitled to receive additional cash payments potentially totaling $95.0 million for achievement of certain milestones through commercial launch and to receive double-digit royalties on net sales of products, and we have an option to co-promote ASP0113 in the United States. Under the terms of a supply and services agreement entered into by us and Astellas on the same date, we agreed to perform certain development and regulatory activities, at Astellas&#8217; expense, and to supply licensed products to Astellas, at Astellas&#8217; expense, for use in development and initial commercialization activities in the licensed field. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recognized $1.8 million, $1.6 million and $0.7 million, respectively, in license revenue and $14.7 million, $13.3 million and $5.6 million, respectively, of revenue related to contract services and product delivered.

In August 2012, we amended our license and supply agreements with Astellas to, among other things, (i) extend the time period that we are obligated to supply licensed products for commercial use to Astellas, at Astellas&#8217; expense, (ii) modify the allocation of $95.0 million of milestone payments among certain milestones through commercial launch and (iii) modify the structure of the royalties on net sales from a fixed double-digit royalty to escalating tiered double-digit royalties.

As of December 31, 2015, the aggregate potential milestone payments that we were eligible to receive under each of our out-license agreements with Astellas was equal to approximately $95.0 million. These amounts assume that all remaining milestones associated with the milestone payments are met. Because the milestones are highly contingent and we have limited control over whether the development and regulatory milestones will be achieved, we are not in a position to reasonably estimate how much, if any, of the potential milestone payments will ultimately be received, or when. Many of the milestone events are related to progress in clinical trials which will take several years to achieve.

We are also eligible to receive royalty payments under our out-license agreements based on net sales of any products which incorporate the out-licensed technology. The royalties in our out-license agreements with Astellas are based on percentages of net sales in the double-digit range. Our receipt of any royalty payments under the out-license agreements is contingent upon the licensee successfully developing and commercializing products incorporating the licensed technology, and we have limited control over our licensees&#8217; efforts in this regard. Consequently, we are not in a position to reasonably estimate when or to what extent we will receive any royalty payments under our out-license agreements.

Merial . In 2004, we granted an exclusive license to Merial for use of our core DNA delivery technology in a therapeutic vaccine designed to aid in extending survival time of dogs with oral melanoma. Under the agreement, Merial is responsible for research and development activities. In March 2009, Merial rec eived approval from the USDA to market the DNA vaccine, now called ONCEPT &#174; . Merial pays royalties to us on sales of the vaccine. 

In-licensing

Astellas. In March 2015, we entered into a license agreement with Astellas, granting us exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize our novel antifungal candidate, VL-2397. As consideration for the rights under the license, we issued 861,216 shares of our common stock to Astellas and made an up-front payment of $250,000 in cash. The license agreement provides for potential development, regulatory and sales milestone payments totaling up to $99.0 million, as well as tiered single-digit royalty payments based on net sales of licensed products. The royalty payments are subject to reduction on a country-by-country basis in certain circumstances where there is not exclusivity in the country. We are responsible for the worldwide development, manufacturing and commercialization of licensed products, at our cost, and we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts with respect to such development and commercialization activities. 

The license agreement, unless terminated earlier, will continue until expiration of our royalty obligations with respect to licensed products. Either party may terminate the license agreement earlier if the other party materially breaches the agreement and does not cure the breach within a specified notice period, or upon the other party&#8217;s insolvency. Astellas may terminate the license agreement earlier if we or any of our affiliates or sublicensees oppose or challenge any of the licensed patents. Vical may terminate the license agreement on a country-by-country basis for reasonable scientific, regulatory, commercial, financial, ethical or other reasons.

CytRx . In 2001, we entered into an exclusive agreement with CytRx Corporation, or CytRx, which grants us rights to use or sublicense CytRx&#8217;s poloxamer technology to enhance viral or non-viral delivery of polynucleotides in all nonexcluded preventive and therapeutic human and animal health applications, including CMV. In addition, the agreement permits our use of CytRx&#8217;s technology to enhance the delivery of proteins in prime-boost vaccine applications that involve the use of polynucleotides. As part of the agreement, we made a $3.8 million up-front payment and agreed to make potential future milestone and royalty payments. As of December 31, 2015, we had paid CytRx $5.3 million under the agreement. 

The agreement with CytRx expires upon the expiration of our royalty obligations, unless earlier terminated as set forth in the agreement. Each party may terminate the agreement early upon the bankruptcy or insolvency of, or the material breach of the agreement by, the other party, upon prior written notice to the other party. Subject to certain conditions, we may terminate the agreement early upon prior written notice to CytRx.

City of Hope . In 2003, we licensed from the City of Hope on an exclusive basis various U.S. patents that provide protection for CMV-related polynucleotide based vaccines, including TransVax TM and CyMVectin TM vaccine candidates. The agreement expires upon the last to expire of the patent rights licensed by us under the agreement, unless earlier terminated as set forth in the agreement. The City of Hope may terminate the agreement early, in accordance with notice provisions set forth in the agreement, if we cease to operate, fail to make payments when due or materially breach the agreement. Subject to certain conditions, we may terminate the agreement early at any time upon prior written notice to the City of Hope. We are also obligated to pay a low double-digit percentage of any payments we receive from the sub-license of products that incorporate the licensed technology. As of December 31, 2015, we had paid the City of Hope $5.5 million under the agreement. 

As of December 31, 2015, the aggregate potential milestone payments that we could be obligated to pay under our active in-license agreements with Astellas, City of Hope and CytRx, total approximately $106.1 million. These amounts assume that all remaining milestones associated with the milestone payments are met. Although we believe that some of the milestones contained in the in-license agreements may be achieved, it is highly unlikely that a significant number of them will be achieved. Because the milestones are highly contingent and we have limited control over whether the regulatory milestones will be achieved, we are not in a position to reasonably estimate how much, if any, of the potential milestone payments will ultimately be paid, or when. Additionally, under these in-license agreements, many of the milestone events are related to progress in clinical trials which will take several years to achieve.

Under these in-license agreements, we may also be obligated to pay royalties based on net sales of any products which incorporate the in-licensed technology. These royalties are based on percentages of net sales in the single digit range. We may also be obligated to make payments under our in-license agreements with the City of Hope based on amounts we receive from sub-licensees, if any. Our obligations to pay any royalty payments under our in-license agreements are contingent upon 

the successful development and commercialization of products incorporating the in-licensed technology. Before any products incorp orating the in-licensed technology may be sold, such products must be approved by U.S. or foreign regulatory authorities, which will require a substantial amount of additional research and development. Even if such product candidates are advanced through c linical trials, the results of such trials may not support approval by the FDA or comparable foreign agencies. Consequently, we are not in a position to reasonably estimate when or to what extent we will be obligated to pay any royalties under our in-licen se agreements. 

Contract Manufacturing

In April 2015, we entered into a $4.1 million contract with the IPPOX Foundation to manufacture HIV-antigen plasmid DNA as a component of vaccine regimens to be evaluated in clinical trials for the prevention of HIV infection. IPPOX is a Swiss non-profit foundation that participates in the conduct of HIV vaccine clinical trials under the auspices of the Pox-Protein Public-Private Partnership, or P5, funded by the Bill &#38; Melinda Gates Foundation and the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, or NIAID. These plasmids were shipped and the related revenue of $4.1 million was recognized in December 2015. This contract builds upon our 2010 agreement with IPPOX to manufacture plasmid DNA for HIV vaccine clinical trials.

Intellectual Property

Patents and other proprietary rights are essential to our business. We file patent applications to protect our technologies, inventions, and improvements to our inventions that we consider important to the development of our business. We believe we have a comprehensive patent portfolio in the United States and in key foreign markets. We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position.

Our patents and patent applications cover, for example, specific DNA constructs and formulations of gene-based product candidates, methods for producing pharmaceutical-grade DNA, and several families of lipid molecules and their uses in DNA delivery, as described more fully below:

&#160;

&#183; 

Core DNA Delivery Technology. We either co-owned or had rights to issued U.S. patents covering our core DNA delivery technology, including patents on methods of administering DNA sequences for the purposes of expressing therapeutic proteins or for inducing immune responses and the administration of DNA sequences into blood vessels and the heart. These patents are now expired, but we maintain patents covering specific product applications as described below. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Lipid Technologies . We are the sole assignee of issued U.S. patents covering numerous examples of cationic lipid compounds that are used to facilitate delivery of plasmids to some tissues. Our HSV-2 therapeutic vaccine candidate, our Vaxfectin&#174; adjuvant, as well as our CyMVectin&#8482; prophylactic vaccine candidate are protected in-part by lipid technology and/or lipid compound patents that extend up to March 24, 2020. Patent protection of these key lipids also has been obtained in Europe, Canada and Japan. Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, a U.S. patent term extension for up to 5 years may be available under certain conditions. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Specific DNA Products . We have patents covering specific product applications of our technologies. To date, we have received patents in the United States, Europe, Canada and Japan, relating to codon-optimized polynucleotide-based vaccines against human CMV infection. The patents expire between December 19, 2023, and May 12, 2025. These patents further protect both our ASP0113 therapeutic vaccine candidate for CMV as well as our CyMVectin&#8482; prophylactic vaccine candidate for CMV. Protection for our therapeutic vaccine candidate for HSV-2 is further augmented by issued patents in the U.S. and Japan and other foreign counterparts pending in Australia, Canada, and Europe, all of which will expire on July 20, 2027. These patents are co-owned with the University of Washington. Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, a U.S. patent term extension for up to 5 years may be available under certain conditions. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Antifungal Technology. We have been granted the exclusive right to Astellas patents which claim the composition of matter of, or any method of making or using, VL-2397. All of these issued U.S. patents and foreign counterparts will expire on March 13, 2029. 

As of December 31, 2015, we were the assignee or co-assignee of 52 issued U.S. and foreign patents. We maintain our issued patents by paying maintenance fees to the patent office in each country when due. Where appropriate, we participate in legal proceedings to vigorously defend against the revocation or withdrawal of our patents. The scope and nature of these proceedings generally differ depending on the country in which they are initiated.

As of December 31, 201 5 , we were also prosecuting 6 pending patent applications in the United States and in foreign countries that cover various aspects of our proprietary technologies, not including patent applications for which we are a co-assignee and that are being prosecuted by our partners. 

See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Our patents and proprietary rights may not provide us with any benefit and the patents of others may prevent us from commercializing our products,&#8221; and &#8220;The legal proceedings to obtain and defend patents, and litigation of third-party claims of intellectual property infringement, could require us to spend money and could impair our operations.&#8221;

Commercialization and Manufacturing

Because of the broad potential applications of our technologies, we intend to develop and commercialize products both on our own and through our collaborators and licensees. We intend to develop and commercialize products in well-defined specialty markets, including infectious diseases. Where appropriate, we intend to rely on strategic marketing and distribution alliances.

We believe our plasmids can be produced in commercial quantities through uniform methods of fermentation and processing that are applicable to all plasmids. In addition, our formulations consist of components that are synthesized chemically using traditional, readily scalable organic synthesis procedures.

We produce and supply our own plasmids for all of our research needs and clinical trials and intend to produce sufficient supplies for all foreseeable clinical investigations. Our facility received a California Food and Drug Branch manufacturing facility license and began production in 2004. We also engage in contract manufacturing of plasmid investigational products for selected clients.

Competition

We are aware of several development-stage and established enterprises, including major pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms, which are actively engaged in infectious disease vaccine research and development. These include Sanofi, Novartis, GlaxoSmithKline plc, MedImmune, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of AstraZeneca, Merck and Pfizer Inc., among others. We may also experience competition from companies that have acquired or may acquire technologies from companies, universities and other research institutions. These companies may develop proprietary technologies which may materially and adversely affect our business.

In addition, a number of companies are developing products to address the same diseases that we are targeting. For example, Roche, Sanofi, AiCuris GmbH &#38; Co. KG in conjunction with Merck, Chimerix, Inc., and others have products or development programs for CMV treatment and prevention. GlaxoSmithKline plc, Genocea Biosciences, Inc., Agenus, Inc. and others have products or development programs for HSV-2 treatment. If these or any other companies develop products with efficacy or safety profiles significantly better than our products, we may not be able to commercialize our products, and sales of any of our commercialized products could be harmed.

Some of our competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater product development capabilities and financial, scientific, marketing and human resources than we do. Competitors may develop products earlier, obtain FDA approvals for products more rapidly, or develop products that are more effective than those under development by us. We will seek to expand our technological capabilities to remain competitive, however, research and development by others may render our technologies or products obsolete or noncompetitive, or result in treatments or cures superior to ours.

Our competitive position will be affected by the disease indications addressed by our product candidates and those of our competitors, the timing of market introduction for these products and the stage of development of other technologies to address these disease indications. For us and our competitors, proprietary technologies, the ability to complete clinical trials on a timely basis and with the desired results, and the ability to obtain timely regulatory approvals to market these product candidates are likely to be significant competitive factors. Other important competitive factors will include the efficacy, safety, ease of use, reliability, availability and price of products and the ability to fund operations during the period between technological conception and commercial sales. 

The FDA and other regulatory agencies may expand current requirements for public disclosure of DNA-based product development data, which may harm our competitive position with foreign and U.S. companies developing DNA-based products for similar indications.

Government Regulation 

Any products we develop will require regulatory clearances prior to clinical trials and additional regulatory approvals prior to commercialization. New gene-based products for vaccine or therapeutic applications are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and comparable agencies in other countries. The precise regulatory requirements with which we will have to comply are uncertain at this time due to the novelty of the gene-based products and indications, or uses, that are currently under development. Our potential products will be regulated either as biological products or as drugs. In the United States, drugs are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or the FDC Act. Biological products, in addition to being subject to provisions of the FDC Act, are regulated in the United States under the Public Health Service Act. Both statutes and related regulations govern, among other things, testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, advertising, and other promotional practices.

Obtaining FDA approval is a costly and time-consuming process. Generally, FDA approval requires that preclinical studies be conducted in the laboratory and in animal model systems to gain preliminary information on efficacy and to identify any major safety concerns. The results of these studies are submitted as a part of an IND which the FDA must review and allow before human clinical trials can start. The IND includes a detailed description of the proposed clinical investigations.

A company must submit an IND for each proposed product and must conduct clinical studies to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the product necessary to obtain FDA approval. The FDA receives reports on the progress of each phase of clinical testing and may require the modification, suspension, or termination of clinical trials if an unwarranted risk is presented to patients.

To obtain FDA approval prior to marketing a pharmaceutical product in the United States typically requires several phases of clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the product candidate. Clinical trials are the means by which experimental treatments are tested in humans, and are conducted following preclinical testing. Clinical trials may be conducted within the United States or in foreign countries. If clinical trials are conducted in foreign countries, the products under development as well as the trials are subject to regulations of the FDA and/or its counterparts in the other countries. Upon successful completion of clinical trials, approval to market the treatment for a particular patient population may be requested from the FDA in the United States and/or its counterparts in other countries.

Clinical trials for therapeutic products are normally done in three phases. Phase 1 clinical trials are typically conducted with a small number of patients or healthy subjects to evaluate safety, determine a safe dosage range, identify side effects, and, if possible, gain early evidence of effectiveness. Phase 2 clinical trials are conducted with a larger group of patients to evaluate effectiveness of an investigational product for a defined patient population, and to determine common short-term side effects and risks associated with the drug. Phase 3 clinical trials involve large scale, multi-center, comparative trials that are conducted to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product labeling. In some special cases where the efficacy testing of a product may present a special challenge to testing in humans, such as in the case of a vaccine to protect healthy humans from a life-threatening disease that is not a naturally occurring threat, effectiveness testing may be required in animals.

After completion of clinical trials of a new product, FDA marketing approval must be obtained. If the product is regulated as a biologic, a Biologics License Application, or BLA, is required. If the product is classified as a new drug, a New Drug Application, or NDA is required. The NDA or BLA must include results of product development activities, preclinical studies, and clinical trials in addition to detailed chemistry, manufacturing and control information.

Applications submitted to the FDA are subject to an unpredictable and potentially prolonged approval process. Despite good-faith communication and collaboration between the applicant and the FDA during the development process, the FDA may ultimately decide, upon final review of the data, that the application does not satisfy its criteria for approval or requires additional product development or further preclinical or clinical studies. Even if FDA regulatory clearances are obtained, a marketed product is subject to continual review, and later discovery of previously unknown problems or failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions.

Before marketing clearance for a product can be secured, the facility in which the product is manufactured must be inspected by the FDA and must comply with the FDA&#8217;s current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, regulations. In addition, after marketing clearance is secured, the manufacturing facility must be inspected periodically for cGMP compliance by FDA inspectors, and, if the facility is located in California, by inspectors from the Food and Drug Branch of the California Department of Health Services.

In addition to the FDA requirements, the NIH has established guidelines for research involving human genetic materials, including recombinant DNA molecules. The FDA cooperates in the enforcement of these guidelines, which apply to all recombinant DNA research that is con ducted at facilities supported by the NIH, including proposals to conduct clinical research involving gene therapies. The NIH review of clinical trial proposals and safety information is a public process and often involves review and approval by the Recomb inant DNA Advisory Committee of the NIH. 

Sponsors of clinical trials are required to register, and report results for, all controlled, clinical investigations, other than Phase 1 investigations, of a product subject to FDA regulation. Trial registration may require public disclosure of confidential commercial development data resulting in the loss of competitive secrets, which could be commercially detrimental.

We also are subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations, and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices, the experimental use of animals, and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents, used in connection with our research. The extent of government regulation that might result from any future legislation or administrative action cannot be accurately predicted.

Employees

As of December 31, 2015, we had 69 full-time employees, including 6 with doctorate degrees. Of these full-time employees, 52 were engaged in, or directly supporting, research and development and manufacturing activities, and 17 were in general and administrative positions. A significant number of our management and other employees have prior experience with pharmaceutical and/or biotechnology companies. None of our employees is covered by collective bargaining agreements, and our management considers relations with our employees to be good.
