 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

History and Organization 

For more than a century, Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. ("HII", the "Company", "we", "us", or "our" and, as the context requires, including our predecessor business as a subsidiary of Northrop Grumman Corporation ("Northrop Grumman")) has been designing, building, overhauling, and repairing ships primarily for the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Coast Guard. We are the nation's sole designer, builder, and refueler of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, a builder of amphibious assault and expeditionary warfare ships for the U.S. Navy, the sole builder of National Security Cutters ("NSCs") for the U.S. Coast Guard, one of only two companies currently designing and building nuclear-powered submarines for the U.S. Navy, and one of only two companies that builds the Navy's current fleet of DDG-51 Arleigh Burke -class destroyers. We are the exclusive provider of Refueling and Complex Overhaul ("RCOH") services for nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, a full-service systems provider for the design, engineering, construction, and life cycle support of major programs for surface ships, and a provider of fleet support and maintenance services for the U.S. Navy. 

&#160; 

We conduct most of our business with the U.S. Government, principally the Department of Defense ("DoD"). As prime contractor, principal subcontractor, team member, or partner, we participate in many high-priority U.S. defense technology programs. We operate our shipbuilding business through our Huntington Ingalls Incorporated subsidiary, which is organized into two segments: Ingalls Shipbuilding ("Ingalls"), which includes our non-nuclear ship design, construction, repair, and maintenance businesses; and Newport News Shipbuilding ("Newport News"), which includes all of our nuclear ship design, construction, overhaul, refueling, and repair and maintenance businesses. We also provide a range of services to the energy and oil and gas industries, as well as government customers. 

&#160; 

We became an independent, publicly-owned company on March 31, 2011, when we were spun off from Northrop Grumman. We have owned and operated the legacy Northrop Grumman shipbuilding business since the spin-off. We believe our product capabilities, heavy industrial facilities, and a workforce of approximately 36,000 &#32;employees position us well to continue to support the long-term objectives of the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard. 

Ingalls 

&#160; 

Through our Ingalls segment, we design and construct non-nuclear ships for the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard, including amphibious assault ships, surface combatants, and NSCs. We build amphibious assault ships for the U.S. Navy and have built 28 of the 62 DDG-51 Arleigh Burke -class of Aegis guided missile destroyers in active service. We are also the sole builder of the large multi-mission NSCs for the U.S. Coast Guard. Our Ingalls shipbuilding site is located in Pascagoula, Mississippi. This shipyard offers a collection of manufacturing capabilities that include a 660-ton gantry crane and a Land Based Test Facility. 

In October 2014, we ceased shipbuilding construction operations at our Avondale, Louisiana shipyard ("Avondale") and consolidated that activity at our Pascagoula, Mississippi facility, which we believe enhances our competitive position by decreasing our fixed overhead expenses, improving facility utilization to provide a more cost-efficient construction process, centralizing our shipbuilding learning and increasing the benefits of serial production, and reducing program costs. In March 2015, we sold our Gulfport Composite Center of Excellence (the "Gulfport facility") in Gulfport, Mississippi, to the Mississippi State Port Authority, due to limited demand from the U.S. Navy for composite products provided by our Gulfport facility. 

Amphibious Assault Ships 

&#160; 

We supply the U.S. Navy with amphibious assault and expeditionary warfare ships, which include the U.S. Navy large deck amphibious ships ("LHA") and amphibious transport dock ships ("LPD"). The LHA is a key component of the U.S. Navy-Marine Corps requirement for 11 Expeditionary Strike Groups/Amphibious Readiness Groups, and design, construction, and modernization of LHAs are core to our Ingalls operations. In 2007, we were awarded the construction contract for LHA-6 America , the first in a new class of enhanced amphibious assault ships designed from the keel up to be an aviation optimized Marine assault platform. We delivered LHA-6 America in the second quarter of 2014 and are currently constructing LHA-7 Tripoli , scheduled for delivery in 2018. 

&#160; 

The LPD program is a long-running production program in which we have generated efficiencies through ship-over-ship learning. We are currently constructing two LPD-17 San Antonio -class amphibious transport dock ships, LPD-26 John P. Murtha, &#32;scheduled for delivery in 2016, and LPD-27 Portland, &#32;scheduled for delivery in 2017. We delivered LPD-25 USS Somerset &#32;in 2013 and LPD-23 USS Anchorage &#32;and LPD-24 USS Arlington &#32;in 2012. In December 2015, we were awarded an advance procurement contract for LPD-28 (unnamed). 

Surface Combatants 

&#160; 

We are a design agent for and one of only two companies that constructs the DDG-51 Arleigh Burke -class guided missile destroyers. We have delivered 28 DDG-51 Arleigh Burke -class destroyers to the U.S. Navy. We are currently constructing DDG-113 John Finn &#32;and DDG-114 Ralph Johnson , scheduled for delivery in 2016 and 2017, respectively. In 2013, we were awarded a multi-year contract totaling $3.3 billion for construction of five additional DDG-51 Arleigh Burke -class destroyers as a part of a larger U.S. Navy order for nine DDG-51 &#32;Arleigh Burk e-class destroyers. We began fabrication on DDG-117 Paul Ignatius &#32;in 2014 and DDG-119 Delbert D. Black &#32;in 2015, with deliveries scheduled in 2018 and 2019, respectively. 

In 2008, the U.S. Navy truncated the DDG-1000 Zumwalt -class destroyer program when it restarted the DDG-51 Arleigh Burke -class destroyer production line. Our participation in the DDG-1000 Zumwalt -class program included detailed design and construction of the ships' integrated composite deckhouses and hangars, as well as portions of the ships' aft peripheral vertical launch systems. We completed our participation in this program with the delivery of the composite deckhouse of DDG-1001 Michael Monsoor &#32;in 2014 . 

&#160; 

National Security Cutters 

&#160; 

The U.S. Coast Guard's recapitalization program is designed to replace aging and operationally expensive ships and aircraft used to conduct missions in excess of 50 miles from the shoreline. The flagship of this program is the Legend -class NSC, a multi-mission platform we designed and built. The U.S. Coast Guard ordered the first three NSC vessels from Integrated Coast Guard Systems ("ICGS"), a joint venture between Lockheed Martin and us. Beginning in 2010 with the construction contract for NSC-4 USCGC Hamilton , the NSC contracts have been awarded directly to us. NSC-4 USCGC Hamilton &#32;and NSC-5 USCGC James &#32;were delivered to the U.S. Coast Guard in 2014 and 2015, respectively. NSC-6 Munro and NSC-7 Kimball are currently under construction and are scheduled for delivery in 2016 and 2018, respectively. We were awarded the construction contract for NSC-8 Midgett &#32;in 2015, and it is scheduled for delivery in 2019. 

Newport News 

The capabilities of our Newport News segment extend from our core business of designing and constructing nuclear-powered ships, such as aircraft carriers and submarines, and the refueling and overhaul and the inactivation of such ships, to businesses that are focused on the construction of heavy manufacturing equipment for commercial nuclear power facilities and the operation, management, and cleanup of environmental hazard sites through Department of Energy ("DoE") programs. Our Newport News shipyard is one of the largest shipyards in the United States, located on approximately 550 acres near the mouth of the James River, which adjoins the Chesapeake Bay. The shipyard has two miles of waterfront property and heavy industrial facilities, which include seven graving docks, a floating dry dock, two outfitting berths, five outfitting piers, module outfitting facilities, and various other workshops. Our Newport News shipyard also has a 2,170-foot dry dock serviced by a 1,050-ton gantry crane capable of supporting two aircraft carriers at one time. 

&#160; 

Design, Construction, and Refueling and Complex Overhaul of Aircraft Carriers 

Engineering, design, and construction of U.S. Navy nuclear aircraft carriers are core to Newport News operations. Aircraft carriers are the largest ships in the U.S. Navy's fleet, with a displacement of over 90,000 tons. Newport News has delivered 30 aircraft carriers to the U.S. Navy since 1933, including all ten ships currently in active service. 

&#160; 

We delivered the U.S. Navy's newest carrier and the last of the CVN-68 Nimitz -class, CVN-77 USS George H.W. Bush , in 2009. We have been engaged in design work on the next generation aircraft carrier, the CVN-78 Gerald R. Ford- class, for over ten years. In 2008, we were awarded a $5.1 billion contract for detail design and construction of the first ship of the class, CVN-78 Gerald R. Ford , which is scheduled for delivery in 2016. We also received awards 

in 2009 through 2015 totaling $6.6 billion for construction preparation, detail design, and construction of the second CVN-78 Gerald R. Ford -class aircraft carrier, CVN-79 John F. Kennedy . 

&#160; 

We continue to be the exclusive prime contractor for nuclear aircraft carrier RCOH. Each RCOH takes over three years to complete, and the work accounts for approximately 35% of all maintenance and modernization during an aircraft carrier's 50 year service life. RCOH services include propulsion work (refueling of reactors; propulsion plant modernization; and propulsion plant repairs), restoration of service life (dry docking, tank, and void maintenance; hull, shafting, propellers, and rudders; launch and recovery system; piping repairs; and component refurbishment), and modernization (electrical systems; aviation support systems; warfare; interoperability; and environmental compliance). We provide ongoing maintenance services for the U.S. Navy aircraft carrier fleet through both RCOH and on-site fleet repair work. 

We completed the RCOH for CVN-71 USS Theodore Roosevelt &#32;and redelivered it to the U.S. Navy in 2013. We also received awards totaling $2.6 billion under an execution contract for the RCOH of CVN-72 USS Abraham Lincoln, which is scheduled for redelivery in 2016. We believe our position as the exclusive designer and builder of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, as well as the fact that RCOH work requires a highly trained workforce, is capital-intensive, and has high barriers to entry due to its nuclear component, strongly position us for future RCOH contract awards on the U.S. Navy aircraft carrier fleet. 

&#160; 

Aircraft Carrier Inactivation 

&#160; 

The U.S. Navy awarded us a $745 million contract in 2013 to inactivate CVN-65 USS Enterprise , the world's first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, which was built by us and commissioned in 1961. The CVN-65 USS Enterprise has a scheduled redelivery date in 2017. Aircraft carriers have a lifespan of approximately 50 years, and we believe the ten carriers delivered by us that are currently in active service, as well as those we will deliver in the future, present a significant opportunity for us with respect to their inactivation. We believe that the U.S. Navy will require inactivation of aircraft carriers in the naval fleet as they reach the end of their lifespans, and we intend to be positioned as the best choice for these contract awards. 

Design and Construction of Nuclear-Powered Submarines 

&#160; 

We are one of only two companies in the United States capable of designing and building nuclear-powered submarines for the U.S. Navy. Newport News has delivered 59 &#32;submarines to the U.S. Navy since 1960, comprised of 45 &#32;fast attack and 14 &#32;ballistic missile submarines. Of the 53 nuclear-powered fast attack submarines currently in active service, 26 were delivered by Newport News. Our nuclear submarine program, located at our Newport News shipyard, includes construction, engineering, design, research, and integrated planning. 

In February 1997, we executed a teaming agreement with Electric Boat, a division of General Dynamics Corporation ("General Dynamics"), to build SSN-774 Virginia -class fast attack nuclear submarines cooperatively. Under the present arrangement, we build the stern, habitability and machinery spaces, torpedo room, sail, and bow, while Electric Boat builds the engine room, control room, and pressure hull structure. Work on the reactor plant and the final assembly, test, outfit, and delivery of the submarines alternate between Electric Boat and us. 

The four submarines of the first block and six submarines of the second block of SSN-774 Virginia -class submarines have been delivered. In 2008, the team was awarded a construction contract for the third block of eight SSN-774 Virginia -class submarines. The multi-year contract increased construction from one submarine per year to two submarines per year from 2011 through 2013. The first submarine under this contract was delivered in 2014, the second was delivered in 2015, and the last submarine of the third block is scheduled for delivery in 2019. In 2014, the team was awarded a construction contract for the fourth block of ten SSN-774 Virginia -class submarines, continuing the two submarines per year production rate. The first submarine of the block IV contract is scheduled for delivery in 2019, and the last is scheduled for delivery in 2023. 

Fleet Support: AMSEC and Continental Maritime of San Diego ("CMSD") 

&#160; 

Fleet Support provides comprehensive life cycle services, including depot maintenance, modernization, repairs, logistics and technical support, and planning yard services for naval and commercial vessels through our AMSEC and CMSD subsidiaries. We have ship repair facilities in Newport News, Virginia, and San Diego, California, which are near the U.S. Navy's largest homeports of Norfolk, Virginia, and San Diego, respectively. AMSEC provides naval architecture and marine engineering, ship system assessments, maintenance engineering, and logistics services to the U.S. Navy and commercial maritime industry from 27 locations across the globe. On any given day, over 600 of our AMSEC employees are on board U.S. Navy ships, assessing equipment conditions, modernizing systems, and training sailors. Through CMSD, a Master Ship Repair contractor, we provide ship repair, regular overhaul, and selected restricted availability services (pier side or in customers' dry docks) for the U.S. Navy. We also perform emergent repair for the U.S. Navy on all classes of ships. Beginning in 2014, AMSEC and CMSD were transferred from the Ingalls segment to the Newport News segment. 

SSBN(X) Ohio-Class Replacement Program 

&#160; 

The U.S. Navy's shipbuilding plan for Fiscal Year 2015 states the U.S. Navy's intention to focus on the design and construction of replacement boats for the current aging Ohio -class nuclear ballistic and cruise missile submarines. The U.S. Navy has committed to designing a replacement class for the SSBN Ohio -class nuclear ballistic missile submarines ("SSBN"), which were first introduced into service in 1981. The SSBN Ohio- class includes 14 nuclear ballistic missile submarines and four nuclear cruise missile submarines ("SSGN"). The Ohio &#32;Replacement Program is a $100 billion program that currently anticipates 12 new ballistic missile submarines over a 15-year period at an annual budget of approximately $5 billion to $7 billion. The U.S. Navy has initiated the design process for the new class of submarine, and we have begun design work as a subcontractor to Electric Boat. We believe our experience and specialized workforce position us for a potential role in the construction effort. Congress has delayed the start of the first Ohio &#32;replacement submarine by two years, and construction is now expected to begin in 2021, with procurement of long-lead-time materials in 2017 and delivery in 2030. The first Ohio -class ballistic missile submarine is expected to be retired in 2027, with an additional submarine being retired each year thereafter. By 2030 the Ohio -class ballistic missile submarine fleet is expected to be down to ten. The current fiscal environment and uncertainty in defense budgets may cause additional delay to the start of construction or result in a reduction in the number of ships being procured, but we believe the Ohio &#32;Replacement Program may represent a significant opportunity for us in the future. 

&#160; 

Energy 

&#160; 

Our DoE and commercial nuclear programs leverage our core competencies in nuclear operations, program management, and heavy manufacturing. We selectively partner with experienced industry leaders, and we participate in active joint ventures. Through our subsidiary, Stoller Newport News Nuclear, Inc. ("SN3"), we provide technical, environmental, ecological, waste management, remediation, and consultation services to private sector companies and the DoE. 

Newport News Industrial Corporation ("NNI") provides a range of support services to commercial nuclear power plants. Since it was founded in 1965, NNI has expanded its capabilities, continuing to provide support for nuclear energy facilities, as well as for fossil power plants and other industrial facilities. NNI focuses on fabrication services, construction services, equipment services, technical services, and product sales to its customers, which include both private industry and government entities such as the DoE and the DoD. 

In January 2008, Savannah River Nuclear Solutions, LLC ("SRNS"), our joint venture with Fluor Federal Services, Inc. and Honeywell International Inc., was awarded a five-year $4 billion contract for site management and operations at the DoE's Savannah River Site located 12 miles south of Aiken, South Carolina, which would have expired in 2013. In 2012, the DoE exercised its option to extend the original contract for another three years through 2016. We have a 34% &#32;ownership interest in SRNS. 

Other 

Our Other segment was established in the second quarter of 2014 to account for certain of our non-shipbuilding commercial activities following our acquisition of UniversalPegasus International Holdings, Inc. ("UPI"). UPI has a 50 year history of providing project management, engineering, and construction management for the oil and gas industry. UPI has approximately 600 professionals, with major office locations in Houston, Texas; Calgary, Canada; Aberdeen, Scotland; and San Juan, Trinidad and Tobago. 

Corporate 

Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware on August 4, 2010. Our principal executive offices are located at 4101 Washington Avenue, Newport News, Virginia 23607. Our telephone number is (757) 380-2000, and our home page on the Internet is www.huntingtoningalls.com. References to our website in this report are provided as a convenience and do not constitute, and should not be viewed as, incorporation by reference of the information contained on, or available through, the website. Accordingly, such information should not be considered part of this report. 

Summary Segment Financial Data 

For a more complete understanding of our segment financial information, see Segment Operating Results in Item 7 and Note 9: Segment Information in Item 8. 

Customers 

Our revenues are primarily derived from the U.S. Government. In 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , approximately 89%, 88%, and 94%, respectively, of our revenues were generated from the U.S. Navy, and approximately 7%, 8%, and 6%, respectively, were generated from the U.S. Coast Guard. In 2015 and 2014, we generated approximately 3% and 2% of our revenues from commercial customers, respectively, and 1% and 2% from other government agencies, respectively. 

Intellectual Property 

We develop and incorporate into our vessels new technologies, manufacturing processes, and systems-integration practices. In addition to owning a large portfolio of proprietary intellectual property, we license intellectual property rights to and from others. The U.S. Government holds licenses to our patents developed in the performance of U.S. Government contracts and unlimited license rights in technical data developed under our U.S. Government contracts when such data is developed entirely at government expense. The U.S. Government may use or authorize others to use the technology covered by our patents licensed to the government. While our intellectual property rights are important to our operations, we do not believe that any existing patent, license, or other intellectual property right is of such importance that its loss or termination would have a material impact on our business. 

&#160; 

Seasonality 

No material portion of our business is seasonal. The timing of our revenue recognition is based on several factors, including the timing of contract awards, the incurrence of contract costs, contract cost estimation, and unit deliveries. See Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates, and Judgments - Revenue Recognition in Item 7. 

Backlog 

As of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , our total backlog was approximately $22 billion &#32;and $21 billion , respectively. We expect approximately 29% &#32;of backlog at December 31, 2015 , to be converted into sales in 2016 . 

Total backlog includes both funded backlog (firm orders for which funding is contractually obligated by the customer) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding is not currently contractually obligated by the customer). Unfunded backlog excludes unexercised contract options and unfunded Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity ("IDIQ") orders. For contracts having no stated contract values, backlog includes only the amounts committed by the customer. Backlog is converted into sales as work is performed or deliveries are made. For backlog by segment, see Backlog in Item 7. 

Raw Materials 

&#160; 

The most significant material we use is steel. Other materials used in large quantities include paint, aluminum, pipe, electrical cable, and fittings. All of these materials are currently available in adequate supply. In connection with our U.S. Government contracts, we are required to procure certain materials and component parts from supply sources approved by the U.S. Government. Generally, for long-term contracts, we obtain price quotations for many of our materials requirements from multiple suppliers to ensure competitive pricing. We have not generally been dependent upon any one supply source; however, due to consolidation in the defense industry, we currently have only one supplier for certain component parts. We believe that these single source suppliers, as well as our overall supplier base, are adequate to meet our foreseeable needs. We have mitigated some supply risk by negotiating long-term agreements with certain raw material suppliers. In addition, we have mitigated price risk related to raw material purchases through certain contractual arrangements with customers. 

Research and Development 

To facilitate innovative product development and evolution, we conduct research and development activities as part of our normal business operations. Our research and development activities primarily include Independent Research and Development ("IR&#38;D") related to government programs. We recover a significant portion of our IR&#38;D expenditures through overhead charges to U.S. Government contracts, consistent with U.S. Government regulations. We include IR&#38;D expenses in general and administrative expenses. Company-sponsored IR&#38;D expenses totaled $19 million , $18 million , and $22 million &#32;for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , respectively. 

&#160; 

At our Virginia Advanced Shipbuilding and Carrier Integration Center ("VASCIC"), located in Newport News, Virginia, we conduct on-site warfare systems testing, training, and laboratory research for the next generation of aircraft carriers, submarines, and other ships. VASCIC serves as the focal point for the integration of ship systems and the application of new technologies. It has a classified facility and an integration area that facilitates research and development related to setup and testing of electronics, as well as hull, mechanical, and electrical systems, prior to introducing new equipment on board a ship. It also has modeling and simulation capability allowing for visualization using 3-D displays. We believe VASCIC benefits the U.S. Navy and represents a competitive advantage for us by developing future naval capabilities, reducing total ownership cost, and facilitating technology transfer. 

Governmental Regulation and Supervision 

Our business is affected by a variety of laws and regulations relating to the award, administration, and performance of U.S. Government contracts. See Risks Related to Our Business, in Risk Factors in Item 1A. 

We operate in a heavily regulated environment and are routinely audited and reviewed by the U.S. Government and its agencies, including the U.S. Navy's Supervisor of Shipbuilding, the Defense Contract Audit Agency ("DCAA"), and the Defense Contract Management Agency ("DCMA"). These agencies review our contract performance, cost structures, and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards, as well as the adequacy of, and our compliance with, our internal control systems and policies. Systems subject to audit or review include our accounting systems, purchasing systems, billing systems, property management and control systems, cost estimating systems, earned value management systems, compensation systems, and management information systems. If an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to administrative, civil, or criminal proceedings, which could result in fines, penalties, repayments, or compensatory, treble, or other damages. Certain U.S. Government findings against a contractor can also lead to suspension or debarment from future U.S. Government contracts or the loss of export privileges . In addition, any costs we incur that are determined to be unallowable or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed by a government customer or must be refunded if already reimbursed. 

The U.S. Government has the ability to decrease or withhold contract payments if it determines significant deficiencies exist in one or more business systems subject to its review. The U.S. Government has, in certain instances, withheld payments on contracts upon its assessment that deficiencies exist with one or more of our business systems. When appropriate, we will modify our affected business systems to address the U.S. Government's concerns. 

&#160; 

In addition, the U.S. Government generally has the ability to terminate contracts, in whole or in part, with little to no prior notice, for convenience or for default based on performance. In the event of termination for the government's convenience, contractors are generally protected by provisions that provide for reimbursement of costs already incurred on the contracts and profit on those costs up to the amount authorized under the contract, but not the anticipated profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed. Such a termination could also result in the cancellation of future work on the related program. Termination resulting from our default could expose us to various liabilities, including excess reprocurement costs, and could have a material effect on our ability to compete for future contracts. 

Government contractors must comply with significant regulatory requirements, including those related to procurement. Our contracts with the U.S. Government may result in Requests for Equitable Adjustments ("REAs"), which represent requests for the U.S. Government to make appropriate adjustments to terms of a contract, including pricing, delivery schedule, technical requirements, or other affected terms, due to changes in the original contract requirements and resulting delays and disruption in contract performance for which the U.S. Government is responsible. We prepare, submit, and negotiate REAs in the ordinary course of business, and large REAs are not uncommon at the conclusion of both new construction and RCOH activities. Such REAs are not considered claims under the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, although they may be converted to such claims if good faith negotiations to resolve the REAs are not satisfactory. 

&#160; 

In cases where there are multiple suppliers, contracts for the construction and conversion of U.S. Navy ships and submarines are generally subject to competitive bidding. In evaluating proposed prices, the U.S. Navy sometimes requires that each bidder submit information on pricing, estimated costs of completion, and anticipated profit margins in order to assess cost realism. The U.S. Navy uses this information and other data to determine an estimated cost for each bidder. Under U.S. Government regulations, certain costs, including certain financing costs and marketing expenses, are not allowable contract costs and, therefore, are not recoverable. The U.S. Government also regulates the methods by which all costs, including overhead, are allocated to government contracts. 

&#160; 

Our business, our contracts with various agencies of the U.S. Government, and our subcontracts with other prime contractors are subject to a variety of laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, the Federal Acquisition Regulation ("FAR"), the Truth in Negotiations Act, the Procurement Integrity Act, the False Claims Act, Cost Accounting Standards, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations promulgated under the Arms Export Control Act, the Close the Contractor Fraud Loophole Act, and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. A noncompliance determination by a government agency may result in reductions in the values of contracts, contract modifications or terminations, penalties, fines, repayments, compensatory, treble, or other damages, or suspension or debarment. 

Competition 

In our primary business of designing, building, overhauling, and repairing military ships, we primarily compete with General Dynamics and, to a lesser extent, smaller shipyards, one or more of which could team with a large defense contractor. Intense competition related to programs, resources, and funding, and long operating cycles are key characteristics of both our business and the shipbuilding defense industry in general. It is common industry practice to share work on major programs among a number of companies. A company competing to be a prime contractor may, upon ultimate award of the contract to another party, become a subcontractor for the prime contracting party. It is not uncommon to compete for a contract award with a peer company and, simultaneously, perform as a supplier to or a customer of such competitor on other contracts. The nature of major defense programs, conducted under binding contracts, allows companies that perform well to benefit from a level of program continuity not common in many industries. 

We believe we are well-positioned in the market. Because we are the only company currently capable of building, refueling, and defueling the U.S. Navy's nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, we believe we are in a strong competitive position to be awarded each contract to perform such activities. Even so, the government periodically revisits whether refueling of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers should be performed in private or public facilities. In this regard, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 ("2012 Act") required DoD to develop a core depot level maintenance capability to refuel nuclear aircraft carriers. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 ("2013 Act") modified the 2012 Act by restoring an exception for the nuclear refueling of an aircraft carrier from the definition of core depot level maintenance. The 2013 Act also amended and clarified the exception to cover the concurrent refueling and overhaul of an aircraft carrier, as well as the defueling of an aircraft carrier. 

Similarly, the 2013 Act restored an exclusion for nuclear aircraft carrier programs from the definition of core logistics capabilities that was found in previous law. 

We are currently the only builder of large deck amphibious assault and expeditionary warfare ships for the U.S. Navy, including LHAs and LPDs. We are, however, currently engaged in a competition to build either the next amphibious assault ship ("LHA-8") or six fleet oilers ("T-AO(X)"). We are also the sole builder of NSCs for the U.S. Coast Guard, and are positioned to be awarded future contracts for these types of vessels. We are one of only two companies currently designing and building nuclear-powered submarines for the U.S. Navy, and we are party to a long-term teaming agreement with the other company for the production of such vessels. We are one of only two companies that builds the U.S. Navy's current fleet of DDG-51 Arleigh Burke -class destroyers and are positioned to be awarded future contracts for these types of ships as well. 

Our success in the shipbuilding defense industry depends upon our ability to develop, market, and produce our products and services at a cost consistent with the U.S. Navy's budget, as well as our ability to provide the workforce, technologies, facilities, equipment and financial capacity needed to deliver those products and services with maximum efficiency. 

We compete with a variety of companies in the provision of engineering services in the energy and oil and gas markets. 

Environmental, Health, and Safety 

Our manufacturing operations are subject to and affected by federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. We accrue the estimated costs to complete environmental remediation when we determine it is probable we will incur expenses in the future, in amounts we can reasonably estimate, to address environmental conditions at currently or formerly owned or leased operating facilities, or at sites where we are named a Potentially Responsible Party ("PRP") by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") or similarly designated by another environmental agency. The inherent difficulties in estimating future environmental remediation costs, resulting from uncertainties regarding the extent of required remediation, determination of legally responsible parties, and the status of laws and regulations and their interpretations, can cause our estimated remediation costs to change. 

We assess the potential impact on our financial statements of future environmental remediation costs by estimating, on a site-by-site basis, the range of reasonably possible remediation costs that we could incur, taking into account currently available information at each site, the current state of technology, and our prior experience in remediating contaminated sites. We review our estimates periodically and adjust them to reflect changes in facts, technology, and legal circumstances. We record accruals for environmental remediation costs on an undiscounted basis in the accounting period in which it becomes probable we have incurred a liability and the costs can be reasonably estimated. We would record related insurance recoveries only when we determine that collection is probable, and we do not include any litigation costs related to environmental matters in our environmental remediation accrual. 

We either expense or capitalize environmental expenditures as appropriate. Capitalized expenditures relate to long-lived improvements in current operating facilities. We accrue environmental remediation costs at sites involving multiple parties based upon our expected share of liability, taking into account the financial viability of other jointly liable parties. We may incur remediation costs exceeding our accrued amount if other PRPs do not pay their allocable share of remediation costs, which could have a material effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 

As of December 31, 2015 , our probable future costs for environmental remediation were approximately $2 million , which is accrued in other current liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position. Although information gained as projects progress may materially affect our accrued liability, we do not anticipate that future remediation expenditures will have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 

We may incur environmental costs in the future related to our wind down of shipbuilding at Avondale. These costs are not reasonably estimable at this time due to insufficient information about the nature, timing, and extent of any potential environmental remediation we may be required to perform or the related costs that we may incur. Accordingly, potential environmental costs associated with the wind down of Avondale are not included in our $2 million &#32;accrual for environmental remediation costs or our $287 million &#32;estimate of Avondale asset write-downs and restructuring costs, or otherwise reflected in our consolidated financial statements. We expect that a significant 

portion of any future environmental remediation costs we might incur at Avondale would be recoverable in accordance with government accounting practices under the Federal Acquisition Regulation ("FAR"). 

&#160; 

We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, and historical environmental compliance costs have not been material to our business. We could be affected by new environmental laws or regulations, including any enacted in response to concerns over climate change, other aspects of the environment, or natural resources. We have made the investments we believe are necessary to comply with environmental laws. We expect, however, to incur capital and operating costs in the future to comply with current and future environmental laws and regulations. At this time, we do not believe such costs will have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

With regard to occupational health and safety, the shipbuilding and ship repair industry involves work with hazardous materials and processes and remains one of the most hazardous industry segments. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the shipbuilding and ship repair industry (NAICS 336611) ranks among the highest in several injury metrics. We have experienced one industrial related fatality in the past seven years. We strive to keep our Occupational Safety &#38; Health Administration ("OSHA") compliance programs strong. In 1995, our Newport News shipyard became the first shipyard to be awarded the Star Award from OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program ("OSHA VPP"). To earn this award, we joined efforts with our unions and supported participation in the OSHA VPP, in which all parties assist each other to make our shipyard a safer place to work. Our CMSD facility and SN3's Grand Junction site have also been certified as OSHA VPP Star Sites. 

&#160; 

The U.S. Navy, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and DoE each regulate and control various matters relating to nuclear materials we handle. Subject to certain requirements and limitations, our contracts with the U.S. Navy and DoE generally provide for indemnity by the U.S. Government for losses resulting from our nuclear operations. For our commercial nuclear operations, we rely primarily on insurance carried by nuclear facility operators for risk mitigation, and we maintain limited insurance coverage for losses in excess of the coverage of facility operators. 

Employees 

We have approximately 36,000 employees. We are the largest industrial employer in Virginia and the largest private employer in Mississippi. We employ individuals specializing in 19 crafts and trades, with approximately 4,700 engineers and designers and approximately 2,300 employees with advanced degrees. Our workforce contains many third-, fourth- and fifth-generation employees, and approximately 1,100 employees have 40 or more years of continuous service. Employees in our shipbuilding divisions with more than 40 years of service achieve the honor of &#8220;Master Shipbuilder&#8221;. As of December 31, 2015, there were 802 Master Shipbuilders at Newport News and 289 at Ingalls. We employ more than 5,000 veterans across the enterprise. 

More than 1,400 apprentices are trained by our two shipbuilding units each year in more than 26 crafts and advanced programs. From nuclear pipe welders to senior executives, approximately 4,500 apprentice alumni, 3,000 at Newport News and 1,500 at Ingalls, continue to work with us. 

Approximately 50% of our employees are covered by a total of eight collective bargaining agreements and two DoE site stabilization agreements. Newport News has three collective bargaining agreements covering represented employees, which expire in July 2017, August 2018, and December 2018. Newport News craft workers employed at the Kesselring Site near Saratoga Springs, New York are represented under an indefinite DoE site agreement. Newport News will begin negotiations in early 2016 with the International Association of Machinist and Aerospace Workers ("IAM"), which was recently determined to be the exclusive representative for approximately 200 Newport News radiological control, calibration, and laboratory technicians. Ingalls has five collective bargaining agreements covering represented employees, all of which expire in March 2018. Approximately 35 SN3 craft employees at the Hanford Site near Richland, Washington are represented under an indefinite DoE site stabilization agreement. We believe that our relationship with our employees is satisfactory.
