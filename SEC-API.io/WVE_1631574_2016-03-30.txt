 Item 1. Business . Overview 

We are a preclinical biopharmaceutical company with an innovative and proprietary synthetic chemistry drug development platform that we are using to design, develop and commercialize a broad pipeline of first-in-class or best-in-class nucleic acid therapeutic candidates. Nucleic acid therapeutics have the potential to address diseases that have been difficult to treat with small molecule drugs or biologics. Currently, there are two nucleic acid therapeutics that have received regulatory approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and others are in development. We are initially developing nucleic acid therapeutics that target genetic defects to either reduce the expression of disease-promoting proteins or transform the production of dysfunctional mutant proteins into the production of functional proteins. 

The nucleic acid therapeutics we are developing are stereopure, meaning they are comprised of molecules having atoms uniformly arranged in three-dimensional orientations, which we believe is advantageous for making drugs with consistent pharmacologic properties. The stereopure therapies we are developing differ from the mixture-based nucleic acid therapeutics currently on the market and in development by others. Those therapies are mixtures of many thousands of molecules, each having varying three-dimensional atomic arrangements. Such variations may lead to potentially differing pharmacologic properties, with some constituent molecules producing therapeutic effects and others being less beneficial or even contributing to undesirable side effects. Building upon the innovative work of our scientific founders, Gregory L. Verdine, Ph.D. and Takeshi Wada, Ph.D., our preclinical studies have demonstrated that our stereopure nucleic acid therapeutics may achieve superior drug properties as compared to mixture-based nucleic acid therapeutics. Our platform is designed to enable us to rationally design, optimize and produce stereopure nucleic acid therapeutics. Further, it has the potential to be used to design therapies that utilize any of the major molecular mechanisms employed by nucleic acid therapeutics, including antisense, ribonucleic acid interference, or RNAi, and exon skipping, as described below. 

Our goal is to develop disease-modifying drugs for indications with a high degree of unmet medical need, in both orphan and broad diseases. We are initially focused on designing single-stranded nucleic acid therapeutics that can distribute broadly within the human body, allowing us to target diseases across multiple organ systems and tissues, through both systemic and local administration. 

Our most advanced therapeutic programs are in Huntington&#146;s disease, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, or DMD, and inflammatory bowel disease, or IBD. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; In Huntington&#146;s disease, we have programs targeting two disease-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs, within the huntingtin gene &#150; HTT SNP-1 and HTT SNP-2. SNPs are naturally occurring variations within a given genetic sequence and in certain instances can be used to distinguish between two related copies of a gene where only one is responsible for causing production of a defective protein and causing disease. It has been shown that by targeting HTT SNP-1 and HTT SNP-2, the production of disease-causing proteins associated with Huntington&#146;s disease can be prevented. We have selected a lead product candidate in our HTT SNP-1 program and we expect to select a lead candidate in our HTT SNP-2 program in early 2016. We expect to file investigational new drug applications, or INDs, with the FDA for our candidates targeting HTT SNP-1 and HTT SNP-2 in late 2016. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; In DMD, we have a program targeting Exon 51, a region within the ribonucleic acid, or RNA, transcribed from the dystrophin gene. DMD is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene, including those in Exon 51, that result in dysfunctional Dystrophin protein, and it has been shown that production of functional Dystrophin protein can be restored by targeting Exon 51. We have selected a lead product candidate in our Exon 51 program and expect to file an IND with the FDA for this candidate in early 2017. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; In IBD, we have a program targeting the RNA transcribed from the SMAD7 gene. Overproduction of the SMAD7 protein has been shown to increase gastro-intestinal, or GI, inflammation and exacerbate IBD. It 

&#160;

&#160; has also been demonstrated that by targeting the RNA transcribed from the SMAD7 gene, the overproduction of the SMAD7 protein can be suppressed, thereby decreasing GI inflammation. We expect to select a lead candidate in our SMAD7 program in late 2016. 

We also have late-stage discovery programs in epidermolysis bullosa simplex, or EBS, and in DMD. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; In EBS, we are targeting KRT14 SNP-1 and KRT14 SNP-2. EBS is caused by mutations in the KRT14 gene, which result in the production of defective KRT14 proteins that manifest the symptoms of EBS. KRT14 SNP-1 and KRT14 SNP-2 are disease-associated SNPs within the KRT14 gene, and we have shown in preclinical experiments that by targeting these SNPs selective reduction in the expression of the disease associated gene can be achieved. We expect to identify lead candidates in our KRT14 SNP-1 and KRT14 SNP-2 programs in 2016. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; In DMD, we are also developing therapies targeting Activin Receptor type IIb, or AcRIIb, that can promote skeletal muscle growth. It has been shown that such muscle growth can be promoted by silencing the RNA transcribed from the gene encoding AcRIIb. We believe that targeting AcRIIb could be beneficial in cases where DMD has progressed to a state of advanced muscle damage, where exon-skipping therapies (including the candidates we are developing in our exon-skipping DMD program) may be less effective. We expect to identify a lead candidate in our AcRIIb program in 2016. Furthermore, we believe that, based on our initial selection criteria of novel and fast-follower opportunities, our platform can potentially be used in the near-term to design treatments for approximately 25 other potential target indications, mostly consisting of orphan indications, with an initial focus on orphan neuromuscular and central nervous system disease targets. 

We believe that we have a strong intellectual property position relating to the development and commercialization of our stereopure nucleic acid therapeutics. Our intellectual property portfolio includes filings designed to protect stereopure oligonucleotide compositions generally, as well as filings designed to protect stereopure compositions of oligonucleotides with particular stereochemical patterns (for example, that affect or confer biological activity). Oligonucleotides are chemically modified, short-length strands of RNA or deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA. Our portfolio also includes filings on both methods and reagents that are designed to protect various features of the chemical methodologies that enable production of such stereopure oligonucleotide compositions. Our portfolio also includes filings designed to protect methods of using stereopure oligonucleotide compositions and filings designed to protect particular stereopure oligonucleotide products, such as those having a particular sequence, pattern of nucleoside or backbone modification, or both, pattern of backbone linkages and pattern of backbone chiral centers. A chiral center is an atom that is bonded to a defined set of pendant groups arranged in three-dimensional space in a way that is not superimposable on its mirror image. 

We believe that our technology provides us with a unique position in the therapeutic oligonucleotide marketplace. Due to prior or expected patent expirations and patent invalidations, we believe that a variety of useful and effective oligonucleotide chemistries, such as certain backbone and sugar modifications, that have been developed in the industry will be available to the public prior to when we expect our drugs will be commercialized. Therefore, we believe that we can readily incorporate these chemistries or other chemistries into our stereopure drugs. Moreover, our strategy does not require or rely on a particular chemistry or any particular nucleotide sequence, thus permitting us to navigate the intellectual property landscape in the field while developing our novel and proprietary oligonucleotide drugs. 

Our founders and members of our management team are leaders in the field of nucleic acid therapeutics, including world renowned scientists, leading researchers in the field and executives with a proven track record in drug discovery development and commercialization of innovative therapeutics. 

&#160;

Nucleic Acid Therapeutics 

A majority of traditional therapeutics modalities, such as small molecule drugs and biologics, work by interacting with proteins that contribute to the disease. However, there are thought to be a limited number of &#147;druggable&#148; proteins; it is currently estimated that approximately 80% of human protein targets cannot be addressed by these conventional approaches. In contrast, directing medicines to the ribonucleic acid, or RNA, which is critical to the production of proteins, rather than to the proteins themselves, has the potential to significantly increase the number of druggable targets. 

Nucleic acid therapeutics is a large and innovative class of drugs that can modulate the function of target RNAs to ultimately affect the production of disease-associated proteins. Nucleic acid therapeutics employ a number of different molecular mechanisms to regulate protein production. These mechanisms can be broadly categorized as those that promote degradation of the target RNA, including antisense and RNAi, and those that involve binding to the target RNA and modulating its function by promoting exon skipping and RNA-guided gene editing. 

The nucleic acid therapeutics we are currently developing employ the following techniques: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Antisense , which refers to a technology that utilizes a therapeutic oligonucleotide designed to bind to a specific sequence in a target RNA strand that encodes a disease-associated protein. The resulting two- stranded molecule, or duplex, is then recognized by a cellular enzyme called RNase H, which cleaves, or cuts, the duplex molecule, thereby preventing the disease-associated protein from being made. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; RNA interference , or RNAi, which refers to a technology that utilizes a therapeutic oligonucleotide designed to bind to a specific sequence in a target RNA that encodes a disease-associated protein. This target RNA molecule is then recognized and cleaved by an enzyme known as Argonaut, or Ago2, thereby preventing the disease-associated protein from being made. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Exon skipping , which refers to a technology that utilizes a therapeutic oligonucleotide designed to bind to a particular sequence within a target RNA and direct the cellular machinery to delete, or splice, the defect out of that RNA. Often, the underlying defect in the target RNA is a mutation that includes a &#147;stop&#148; instruction, so that, absent the therapeutic oligonucleotide, a truncated and defective protein is produced. Use of the exon-skipping oligonucleotide permits the cellular machinery to skip over the &#147;stop&#148; instruction and assemble a partially functional protein, thereby mitigating or alleviating the disease that would otherwise result from the genetic mutation. The unique capability of nucleic acid therapeutics to address a wide range of genomic targets across multiple therapeutic areas has the potential to create potentially significant market opportunities to develop drugs to treat a broad spectrum of human diseases, including diseases where no medicines currently exist or for which existing treatments are suboptimal. 

Design of Nucleic Acid Therapeutics 

A large subset of nucleic acid therapeutics are comprised of chemically modified, short-length RNA or deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, strands, commonly known as oligonucleotides. Oligonucleotides are comprised of a sequence of nucleotides&#151;the building blocks of RNA and DNA&#151;that are linked together by a backbone of chemical bonds. 

&#160;

In nucleic acid molecules that have not been modified for therapeutic use, the nucleotides are linked by phosphodiester bonds, as shown below. 

&#160;

Such unmodified nucleic acid molecules are unsuitable for use as therapeutics because they are rapidly degraded by enzymes called nucleases that are widely present in the human body, are rapidly cleared by the kidneys and have poor uptake into targeted cells. The industry has employed chemical modifications of the nucleotides and phosphodiester bonds to improve the stability, biodistribution and cellular uptake of nucleic acid therapeutics. 

Phosphorothioate, or PS, modification was one of the earliest and remains one of the most common backbone modifications used in nucleic acid therapeutics. In PS modification, one of the nonbridging oxygen (O) atoms bonded to a phosphorus (P) atom is replaced with a sulfur (S) atom. PS modification has been shown to improve the stability of oligonucleotides by making them less susceptible to enzymatic degradation. Further, PS bond-containing oligonucleotides increase binding to plasma proteins, which improves biodistribution by preventing rapid renal excretion of these molecules. 

PS modification is accepted as state-of-the-art in the nucleic acid therapeutics field. The two nucleic acid therapeutics that have received regulatory approval, mipomersen and fomiversen, as well as a large majority of nucleic acid therapeutics currently in development (of which there are at least 20 in late-stage development or under regulatory review), employ PS modification. We believe that PS modification will remain a critical component of this class of therapeutics. 

PS Modification Results in Complex Drug Mixtures 

A consequence of using PS modification in oligonucleotide synthesis is that it creates a chiral center at each phosphorus, each of which is designated as either an &#147;Sp&#148; or &#147;Rp&#148; configuration. This chirality creates stereoisomers, which, as shown below, have identical chemical composition but different three-dimensional arrangement of their atoms and consequently different chemical and biological properties. 

&#160;

&#160;

The configuration of each PS modification occurs randomly during conventional nucleic acid synthesis. Because oligonucleotides are comprised of numerous nucleotides and associated PS modifications&#151;with each PS modification having a random chiral configuration&#151;the synthesis process generates an exponentially large number of stereoisomers of the synthesized oligonucleotide. Specifically, each linkage of an additional nucleotide residue doubles the number of stereoisomers of the product, so that a conventional preparation of a PS-containing oligonucleotide is in fact a highly heterogeneous mixtures of 2 N stereoisomers, where N represents the number of PS modifications. For instance, as shown below, a conventional fully PS-modified oligonucleotide (20 nucleotides in length, 19 PS modifications) in fact is a mixture of over 500,000 stereoisomers, each having the same nucleotide sequence but differing in the stereochemistry along their backbones. 

&#160;

Stereoisomers often possess different chemical and pharmacologic properties. For example, certain stereoisomers can drive the therapeutic effects of a drug while others can be less beneficial or can even contribute to undesirable side effects. The greater the variation among a drug&#146;s constituent stereoisomers, the greater the potential to diminish the drug&#146;s efficacy and safety. 

Up until now, it has not been possible to create stereopure PS-modified nucleic acid therapeutics&#151;meaning drugs comprised entirely of the same stereoisomer&#151;because of an inability to specifically control the configuration of each chiral PS linkage during chemical synthesis. Moreover, because of the sheer number of stereoisomers present in a mixture, it would be impractical, if not impossible, to physically isolate the most therapeutically optimal stereoisomer from within a mixture. For these reasons, all of the PS-modified nucleic acid therapeutics currently on the market and in development by others are mixtures of many stereoisomers, which we believe are not optimized for stability, catalytic activity, efficacy or toxicity. 

In small molecule therapeutics, U.S. regulators have long sought to eliminate the risks potentially posed by drug mixtures containing multiple stereoisomers. Since 1992, the FDA has recommended full molecular characterization of stereoisomers within small molecule drug mixtures. Historically, it has not been possible to achieve such characterization of nucleic acid therapeutic drug mixtures, which can contain tens of thousands to millions of distinct pharmacologic entities. Based on our preclinical studies, we believe we have the ability to design and synthesize stereopure PS-modified nucleic acid therapeutics, which in preclinical models have shown superior drug properties compared with mixture-based nucleic acid therapeutics. We believe our drug development platform has the potential to set a new industry standard for the molecular characterization of complex nucleic acid therapeutic drug mixtures. 

Our Solution: Controlling Stereochemistry in Nucleic Acid Therapeutics 

We have developed proprietary technology that, for the first time, enables the development of PS-modified nucleic acid therapeutics in which stereochemistry is precisely controlled. This degree of control enables us to both rationally design and synthesize therapeutically optimized stereopure nucleic acid therapeutics. 

&#160;

We have discovered and expect to continue to identify fundamental relationships between pharmacology and the three-dimensional orientation or arrangement of atoms within an oligonucleotide, including stability, catalytic activity, specificity, safety and immunogenicity, which we believe have the potential to lead to improved efficacy and durability of effect. We have designed and synthesized stereopure PS-modified drugs that, in preclinical studies, have demonstrated superior stability or potency, or both, as compared to their respective parent drug mixtures, which may result in increased durability of effect, as well as specificity and decreased immune activity. Therefore, we expect our stereopure PS-modified drugs to have improved safety profiles and to be dosed at lower concentrations or less frequently, or both, compared with mixture-based nucleic acid therapeutics. We are using these discoveries to guide our drug development activities. 

Advantages of Our Approach 

We believe that our innovative and proprietary synthetic chemistry drug development platform is a significant advance in the development of nucleic acid therapeutics. The advantages of our approach include: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Ability to design drugs rationally with optimized pharmacological properties . Our platform reduces susceptibility to enzymatic degradation and renal clearance and optimizes interactions with proteins that mediate activity as well as those that affect safety and tolerability. Our ability to improve pharmacologic stability and reduce clearance can enhance the biodistribution of single-stranded oligonucleotides to multiple tissues following systemic administration without the need for additional delivery technology. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Broad applicability . Our platform is applicable to multiple RNA-targeting approaches, including antisense, RNAi, exon-skipping, RNA-guided gene editing, microRNA and others, and is compatible with a broad range of chemical modifications and targeting moieties. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Proprietary production of stereopure nucleic acid therapeutics . Our scientific personnel have developed expertise in the techniques required to produce the limited supplies of PS-modified stereopure nucleic acid therapeutics needed for our preclinical activities. We believe we have the intellectual property position and know-how necessary to protect, advance and scale these production processes. Proof of Concept of Our Technology 

We have demonstrated in preclinical models, predictive of human biology, that direct relationships exist between stereochemistry and pharmacology, and that these relationships can be used to rationally design and construct nucleic acid therapeutics. In proof-of-concept studies, we examined diverse sets of oligonucleotides designed and synthesized using our platform, which allowed us to characterize and compare the behavior of various stereoisomers. These preclinical studies have demonstrated that by controlling stereochemistry, we can optimize multiple aspects of pharmacology, including stability, catalytic activity, specificity, safety and immunogenicity, which we believe have the potential to lead to improved efficacy and durability of effect. As with any drug under development, we cannot be certain that our stereopure nucleic acid therapeutics will demonstrate in humans the same favorable pharmacologic properties we have observed in the preclinical studies we have conducted to date. See &#147;Risk Factors&#151;Risks Related to the Discovery, Development and Commercialization of Our Product Candidates&#148; for a discussion of the risks associated with the development of pharmaceuticals, and nucleic acid therapeutics in particular. 

To assess the relationship between stereochemistry and pharmacology, we conducted studies of mipomersen using a diverse set of stereoisomers alongside the parent mixture. We chose to study mipomersen because it is the only systemically administered nucleic acid therapeutic approved for commercialization and because of the public availability of documents from the regulatory bodies that have evaluated mipomersen for marketing approval. Mipomersen, which is marketed by Genzyme Corporation, a Sanofi Company under the brand name KYNAMRO, is approved for the treatment of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and is designed to silence production of apolipoprotein B, or ApoB. While mipomersen received marketing authorization in the United States, concerns about the drug&#146;s tolerability and liver and cardio-vascular safety led the European 

&#160;

Medicines Agency, or the EMA, in 2012 to refuse to grant marketing authorization for mipomersen in the European Union. One of the EMA&#146;s central concerns about mipomersen was that a high proportion of patients stopped taking the drug within two years, mainly due to side effects such as flu-like symptoms, injection site reactions and liver toxicity. The EMA considered these side effects important because mipomersen is intended for long-term treatment in order to maintain its cholesterol-lowering effect. 

Mipomersen is an oligonucleotide that contains 20 nucleotides and 19 PS modifications. The chirality of each PS modification has the effect of doubling the number of stereoisomers at each phosphorus and, therefore, mipomersen is actually a mixture of over 500,000 different stereoisomers (2 19 = 524,288), or a stereomixture. We rationally designed and synthesized individual stereoisomers of mipomersen, each having specific and different stereochemistry, and conducted studies comparing the stereoisomers with the mipomersen stereomixture. 

Stability 

We investigated the relationship between stereochemistry and stability by exposing our panel of individual mipomersen stereoisomers and the mipomersen stereomixture to metabolic enzymes, including nucleases, in homogenate rat liver and rat serum. Each stereoisomer and the mipomersen stereomixture were incubated separately in rat whole-liver homogenate for five days at physiological temperature and the percentage of each full-length stereoisomer and the mipomersen stereomixture remaining was measured daily. 

As shown in the graph below, by day five, less than 15% of the stereomixture remained. In contrast, at day five, over 50% of our stereopure isomers 1 and 2 remained, indicating that these individual stereoisomers have greater stability than the stereomixture. However, the mipomersen stereomixture was more stable than stereoisomers 5, 6 and 7. 

&#160;

Similar results were observed when the stability of the stereomixture and selected stereoisomers were compared in rat serum. 

Catalytic Activity 

We investigated the relationship between stereochemistry and catalytic activity, which, in the case of antisense, is a measure of the efficiency with which the drug can knockdown the target. Efficient catalytic activity is critical for optimized pharmacology of drugs like mipomersen. 

In the body, mipomersen uses a cellular enzyme called RNase H to degrade or knockdown ApoB mRNA. Using in vitro assays of human RNase H, we evaluated the catalytic activity of the same panel of stereoisomers described above compared with the stereomixture. 

&#160;

Stereoisomers or stereomixtures were bound to target ApoB mRNA and incubated with human RNase H to initiate the catalytic reaction. The reaction was stopped at various time-points and the amount of full-length target ApoB mRNA remaining was measured. 

As shown below, stereoisomers and the stereomixture exhibited large differences in their catalytic activity, as demonstrated by their efficiency in reducing the amount of the full-length target remaining over time. Certain stereoisomers, most notably stereoisomer 2, demonstrated catalytic activity at levels far superior to that of the stereomixture. Also, importantly, we identified stereoisomers that exhibited lower efficiency levels, most notably isomer 4. 

&#160;

Based on these and other data, we have established key design principles relating stereochemistry and catalytic efficiency using RNase H-mediated antisense. These principles can be applied across antisense therapeutics and are compatible with a broad range of chemical modifications to the drug molecule. 

We believe that, based on these studies and others we have conducted, it is possible to synthesize stereopure nucleic acid therapies possessing increased stability and catalytic activity for any PS-modified nucleic acid therapeutic independent of nucleotide sequence composition. 

Efficacy 

We assessed whether improved stability and catalytic activity of our stereoiosomers will translate into greater efficacy in an in vivo pharmacological study. We administered our panel of stereoisomers and the stereomixture to transgenic mice that express human ApoB. This validated animal model was included in the preclinical package used for the regulatory approval of mipomersen in the United States. 

Mice were injected twice weekly with 10 milligrams per kilogram of our stereoisomer 2, our stereoisomer 5 or the stereomixture over a four-week period. ApoB protein levels in the mice&#146;s serum were measured on a weekly basis. This treatment protocol and study design replicates the preclinical in vivo pharmacology study for mipomersen included in the regulatory submission for mipomersen. 

As shown in the graph below, during the treatment period (up to day 28), stereoisomers 2 and 5, which as described above demonstrated increased catalytic activity in vitro compared with the stereomixture, also achieved greater reduction in serum ApoB compared with the stereomixture. In the graph below, levels of ApoB in serum are expressed as a percentage of ApoB at baseline, which was 100%. Knockdown of ApoB by the stereomixture decreased dramatically following final dose. This effect was also observed for stereoisomer 5, which had increased catalytic activity compared with the stereomixture but lowered stability. In comparison, 

&#160;

stereoisomer 2, which had superior catalytic activity and stability, demonstrated durable knockdown of serum ApoB for over two weeks after the final dose. 

&#160;

These results demonstrate our ability to rationally design PS-modified nucleic acid therapeutics that, in a preclinical setting, have greater stability and catalytic activity, which we believe have the potential to lead to improved efficacy and durability of effect. 

Specificity 

By controlling stereochemistry, we have discovered that the pattern of cleavage caused by PS-modified antisense, within the target RNA, can be changed, including directing cleavage toward specific sites within the target. This unique capability enables the cleavage of target RNA to be sensitive to small differences between similar targets, where cleavage may be undesirable or potentially unsafe. 

For example, Huntington&#146;s disease is caused by mutations in one allele (which is one of two or more versions of a gene) of the huntingtin gene, resulting in the production of a disease-causing protein, while the other allele encodes a healthy protein. By optimizing stereochemistry, we are able to direct cleavage towards single-nucleotide differences between these alleles and silence the disease-causing huntingtin RNA while leaving the healthy huntingtin RNA intact. 

Stereoisomers or stereomixtures were bound to mutant and healthy huntingtin RNA and incubated with human RNase H to initiate the catalytic reaction. The reaction was stopped at various time-points and the amount of full- length mutant and healthy huntingtin RNA remaining was measured. 

Using these in vitro assays of human RNase H, we observed that the stereomixture (left figure) caused substantial reductions in both the mutant and healthy huntingtin RNA, while the optimized stereoisomers (right figure) preferentially cleaved mutant huntingtin RNA while sparing the healthy huntingtin RNA. 

&#160;

&#160;

We believe our unique ability to change the cleavage pattern of PS-modified nucleic acid therapies with stereochemistry will create opportunities to mitigate unwanted cleavage and also open allele-specific targeting (meaning the preferential interaction of an oligonucleotide with target RNA transcribed from one allele of a given gene) involving causative or associated non-causative genetic variations. 

Through these studies, we have demonstrated an ability to use stereochemistry in the preclinical setting to control cleavage and reduce off-target cleavage. We believe these findings can be applied in the design of nucleic acid therapies that target a range of variation-specific disease targets. 

Immunogenicity 

We investigated the relationship between stereochemistry and immunogenicity, which is the ability of a substance to activate an immune response. Immune activation has been observed with PS modified oligonucleotides in preclinical toxicology studies, and flu-like symptoms and injection-site reactions in clinical studies are believed to be immune mediated. 

Using non-human primate serum we analyzed the activation of the complement system following exposure to our panel of individual stereoisomers and the parent stereomixtures. Each isomer and parent stereomixture were incubated at physiological temperature in non-human primate serum from three individual animals. Samples were removed at the indicated times and complement activation was measured by measuring the increase in the amount of protein C3a. Protein C3a is formed by the cleavage of complement component 3 upon activation of the complement system, and its levels in serum increase in direct proportion to the amount of activation. Such measurements were taken using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, or ELISA, analytical method, a technique used to determine the amount of a specific protein present in a biological sample and which requires an antibody that is specific to the protein of interest, which is linked to an enzyme whose activity can be used to quantify the amount of protein present. 

&#160;

As shown above, equal concentrations of stereoisomers and the stereomixture exhibited differences in the levels of C3a. Gray triangles represent activation using a control solution of water. Certain stereoisomers showed greater than twice the reduction in C3a compared to the stereomixture. We believe that, based on these studies, it is possible to modulate complement activation and potentially reduce immunogenicity of PS-modified oligonucleotides by controlling stereochemistry. 

&#160;

Our Strategy 

We are leveraging our innovative platform to design, develop and commercialize optimized nucleic acid therapeutics that address important unmet medical needs. The key components of our strategy are as follows: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Rapidly advance product candidates . We are initially focused on designing single-stranded nucleic acid therapeutics that can distribute broadly within the human body, allowing us to target diseases across multiple organ systems and tissues, through both systemic and local administration. Our most advanced therapeutic programs are in Huntington&#146;s disease, DMD and IBD. In Huntington&#146;s disease, we have programs targeting HTT SNP-1 and HTT SNP-2; in DMD, we are targeting Exon 51; and in IBD, we are targeting SMAD7. We have selected lead product candidates in our programs targeting HTT SNP-1 and Exon 51, and we expect to select a lead candidate in our HTT SNP-2 program in early 2016 and in our SMAD7 program in late 2016. We expect to file INDs with the FDA for HTT SNP-1 and HTT SNP-2 in late 2016 and Exon 51 in early 2017. We also have late-stage discovery programs in epidermolysis bullosa simplex, in which we are targeting KRT14 SNP-1 and KRT14 SNP-2, and in DMD, in which we are focused on an additional DMD target, AcRIIb. We expect to identify lead candidates for these programs in 2016. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Expand our pipeline in the area of orphan diseases . We intend to continue to expand our pipeline in the area of orphan diseases to provide multiple opportunities for clinical and commercial success and demonstrate the breadth of our abilities across multiple organ systems and tissues and therapeutic modalities. We believe that, based on our initial selection criteria of novel and fast-follower opportunities, our platform can potentially be used in the near-term to design treatments for approximately 25 other target indications, mostly consisting of orphan indications, with an initial focus on orphan neuromuscular and central nervous system disease targets. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Establish opportunistic strategic partnerships . We intend to collaborate selectively and opportunistically with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in the development and commercialization of nucleic acid therapeutics targeting certain orphan and broad indications. We expect to pursue such partnerships primarily when we believe they will significantly accelerate and enhance the clinical and commercial potential of a given development program. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Leverage and expand our intellectual property portfolio . We believe we have a strong intellectual property position relating to the design, development and commercialization of stereopure nucleic acid therapeutics. We intend to file new patent applications and take other steps to leverage, expand and enforce our intellectual property position. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Maintain and extend our leadership in oligonucleotide stereochemistry . We plan to establish a dominant position in the field of oligonucleotide stereochemistry, advancing basic research and pharmacology across multiple therapeutic modalities and target classes. Our Pipeline 

We are developing nucleic acid therapeutics that are capable of targeting diseases in a wide range of organ systems and tissues. Based on our design principles, we have demonstrated in preclinical studies our ability to rapidly design and select lead therapeutic candidates with optimized pharmacological properties. 

Our most advanced therapeutic programs are in Huntington&#146;s disease, DMD and IBD. In Huntington&#146;s disease, we have programs targeting HTT SNP-1 and HTT SNP-2; in DMD, we are targeting Exon 51; and in IBD, we are targeting SMAD7. We have selected lead product candidates in our programs targeting HTT SNP-1 and Exon 51, and we expect to select a lead candidate in our HTT SNP-2 program in early 2016 and in our SMAD7 program in late 2016. See &#147;&#151;Our Initial Therapeutic Candidates&#148; for more information about these targets. 

We also have late-stage discovery programs in epidermolysis bullosa simplex, in which we are targeting KRT14 SNP-1 and KRT14 SNP-2, and in DMD, in which we are focused on an additional DMD target, AcRIIb. We 

&#160;

expect to identify lead candidates for these programs in 2016. See &#147;&#151;Our Late-Stage Discovery Programs&#148; for more information about these targets. 

Our therapeutic programs and late-stage discovery programs are summarized in the table below.

We believe that, based on our initial selection criteria of novel and fast-follower opportunities, our platform can potentially be used in the near-term to design treatments for a number other target indications, mostly consisting of orphan indications. 

Our Initial Therapeutic Candidates 

We are currently focused on developing nucleic acid therapies for Huntington&#146;s disease, Duchenne muscular dystrophy and inflammatory bowel disease. 

Huntington&#146;s Disease 

Background and Market Opportunity 

Huntington&#146;s disease is an orphan hereditary neurodegenerative disease that is fatal and for which there is no cure. Huntington&#146;s disease results from the accumulation of the defective gene product huntingtin, which promotes the degeneration of neurons, and can lead to neuronal cell death, causing motor, cognitive and psychiatric disability. Symptoms typically appear between the ages of 35 and 44 and worsen over the next 10 to 20 years. Many describe the symptoms of Huntington&#146;s disease as having amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, Parkinson&#146;s disease and Alzheimer&#146;s disease simultaneously. Patients experience a gradual reduction in motor function and psychological disturbances. Ultimately, the affected individual succumbs to pneumonia, heart failure or other fatal complications. Life expectancy after symptom onset is approximately 20 years. We estimate that approximately 43,000 people in the United States have Huntington&#146;s disease. 

&#160;

Current Treatments 

Currently, there are no approved treatments that can reverse or slow down the course of Huntington&#146;s disease. Some of the symptoms of Huntington&#146;s disease can be managed with medication and therapies. Antipsychotics and other drugs affecting the dopamine pathways are used for symptom control. Lowering the levels of mutant huntingtin protein has demonstrated therapeutic effects in animal models. Roche and Ionis Pharmaceuticals (formerly Isis Pharmaceuticals) have antisense oligonucleotides to silence the huntingtin gene in Phase 1/2a clinical development, with human trials having commenced in July 2015. 

Our Program 

We are advancing multiple therapeutic candidates targeting single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs, associated with the mutant alleles of huntingtin gene. We have selected a lead candidate in our HTT SNP-1 program and have initiated IND-enabling preclinical studies in that program. We expect to identify a lead candidate in our HTT SNP-2 program in early 2016. . The precise targeting of such alleles by stereochemically controlled, or stereopure, oligonucleotides should allow discrimination and selective silencing of huntingtin alleles associated with manifestations of the disease while leaving functional huntingtin alleles intact. Each SNP has a particular demographic distribution, and defines a subpopulation of patients suited for allele-specific interventions. Approximately 80% of the total patient population is associated with one of the three most common SNPs. Therefore, we are attempting to develop oligonucleotides targeting these three SNPs, as they represent the largest unmet need. 

We intend to advance our first programs into non-human primate studies to establish the safety and distribution of our stereopure antisense oligonucleotides in the central nervous system. Upon the completion of a rigorous toxicology program in non-human primates, we intend to file an IND and conduct early-stage clinical trials to establish the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics and surrogate evidence of therapeutic benefits in patients with manifest Huntington&#146;s disease. Route of administration will be intrathecal, by simple spinal tap or by the insertion of a spinal catheter, depending on the frequency of administration. We expect to dose on a monthly basis or potentially less frequently. Single ascending doses will be rapidly escalated to establish the maximum tolerated dose and guide our selection of doses for potential multiple dose studies. We believe that the recently demonstrated ability to distinguish in preclinical studies the mutant and the wild-type huntingtin protein in the cerebral spinal fluid will enable us to rapidly demonstrate clinical proof-of-concept for target engagement and allele selectivity. 

As shown below, huntingtin targeted stereoisomer 1 (circles) or stereomixture (triangles) drugs were bound to healthy and mutant huntingtin mRNA and incubated with human RNase H (left figure). Catalysis mediated by the stereopure drug increased the degree of knockdown while also discriminating between healthy versus mutant huntingtin , compared with the stereomixture. 

&#160;

&#160;

Using non-human primate serum, we analyzed the activation of the complement system following exposure to a panel of huntingtin targeted stereoisomers and the parent stereomixture. Each isomer and parent stereomixture was incubated at physiological temperature in non-human primate serum from three individual animals. Samples were removed at the indicated times and complement activation was measured by the increase in C3a levels using the ELISA analytical method. As shown above (right figure), certain stereoisomers and the stereomixture demonstrated increased production of C3a, notably stereoisomer 3, however there was no production of C3a following exposure to stereoisomer 1, which showed discrimination between heathy and mutant huntingtin. 

We expect to file INDs for our therapeutic candidates targeting HTT SNP-1 and HTT SNP-2 in late 2016. 

Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy 

Background and Market Opportunity 

DMD is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene on the X chromosome that affects approximately one in 3,500 newborn boys around the world. In skeletal and cardiac muscles, the dystrophin protein is part of a protein complex called the dystrophin-associated protein complex that acts as an anchor, connecting each muscle cell&#146;s structural framework with the lattice of proteins and other molecules outside the cell through the muscle cell membrane. The dystrophin-associated protein complex protects the muscle from injury during contraction and relaxation. DMD patients typically develop muscle weakness in the early years of life and become wheelchair-bound in their early teens. As the disease progresses, DMD patients typically develop respiratory, orthopedic and cardiac complications. Cardiomyopathy and breathing difficulties usually begin by the age of 20 and patients typically die from respiratory failure or lung disorders by age 25. 

Current Treatments 

Currently, there are no approved treatments that can reverse or slow down the progression of DMD. Corticosteroids and physical and respiratory therapy are used in DMD patients to slow the decline in muscle strength and to prolong ambulation and respiratory function. One disease-modifying strategy in DMD is exon skipping. Exon skipping allows for the production of internally deleted, but functional, dystrophin protein instead of a dysfunctional, truncated one. In Europe, conditional market authorization has been granted to PTC Therapeutics&#146; Ataluren (TRANSLARNA) for the treatment of nonsense mutation DMD for ambulatory patients who are 5 years or older. In addition, there is one exon skipping nucleic acid therapeutic candidate currently undergoing regulatory review in the United States, Sarepta Therapeutics&#146;s ETEPLIRSEN. The other exon skipping nucleic acid therapeutic candidate for DMD is BioMarin Pharmaceutical&#146;s DRISAPERSEN, for which the FDA issued a complete response letter in January 2016 indicating that the review cycle was complete and that the application is not ready for approval in its present form. 

Our Program 

We are developing stereochemically optimized oligonucleotides that we believe have superior pharmacology attributes as compared to stereomixtures. Using a variety of preclinical in vitro assays, we have selected our product candidate targeting Exon 51, which affects 13% of the DMD patient population. 

Our product candidate for the treatment of Exon 51 was selected, in part, based on its ability to demonstrate efficient restoration of the production of functionally active dystrophin. Using patient-derived cells, we assessed exon skipping efficiency by measuring Exon 51 skipped RNA following exposure to equal concentrations of stereorandom or stereopure oligonucleotides. As shown below (left figure), certain stereopure oligonucleotides were identified that had increased and decreased exon skipping efficiency compared to stereorandom mixture, 

&#160;

including stereoisomer 3, which possessed a large increase in skipping efficiency compared with the stereorandom mixture. 

&#160;

Using non-human primate serum, we analyzed the activation of the complement system following exposure to exon skipping stereoisomers and the parent stereomixture. Each isomer and parent stereomixture was incubated at physiological temperature in non-human primate serum from three individual animals. Samples were removed at the indicated times and complement activation was measured by measuring the increase in C3a levels using the ELISA analytical method. As shown above (right figure), certain stereoisomers demonstrated increased production of C3a, notably stereoisomer 1. Production of C3a from stereoisomer 3, which showed increased exon skipping efficiency, was lower than production from the mixture. 

We believe that the use of a stereopure compound (in contrast with a stereomixture) will reduce adverse events noted with stereomixtures, such as injection site reactions, renal toxicity and thrombocytopenia. Following the filing of an IND in the United States or a Clinical Trial Authorization in Europe, we intend to conduct early-stage clinical trials to establish safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and efficient exon skipping. The efficiency of exon skipping will be measured by the de novo production of internally deleted, but functional, dystrophin in muscle biopsies as the basis for any improvement of muscle strength, which is an anticipated clinical endpoint of later clinical studies. 

We expect to file an IND for our first therapeutic candidate in DMD in early 2017. 

Inflammatory Bowel Disease 

Background and Market Opportunity 

Inflammatory bowel disease involves chronic inflammation of all or part of the digestive tract, which may be caused by a dysregulated immune response to host bacteria present in the intestine. There are two primary types of IBD: ulcerative colitis, or UC, and Crohn&#146;s disease, or CD. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or the CDC, approximately 1.3 million people in the United States have IBD. Based on data from the CDC, we estimate that approximately 600,000 of these individuals have CD and 700,000 have UC. Patients with IBD are typically diagnosed by the age of 30, and symptoms are highly variable in frequency and intensity. 

CD is a chronic inflammatory disease of the digestive tract that primarily affects the terminal ileum and right colon, but may affect any region of the gastrointestinal tract. CD-related inflammation is segmental and transmural, leading to various degrees of tissue damage. At disease onset, most patients have inflammatory lesions, which become predominantly strictures or penetrating lesions over time. 

UC is a chronic inflammatory disease of the innermost lining of the colon and rectum, together known as the large intestine, in which the lining becomes inflamed and develops tiny open sores, or ulcers, that produce pus 

&#160;

and mucous. The combination of inflammation and ulceration can cause abdominal discomfort and frequent emptying of the colon. UC is believed to be the result of an abnormal response by the body&#146;s immune system, which sends white blood cells into the lining of the large intestine, where they produce chronic inflammation and ulcerations. 

Current Treatments 

The goal of current treatments for IBD is to reduce inflammation that triggers signs and symptoms, which may lead to symptom relief, long-term remission and a reduced risk of complications. Mucosal healing can be promoted with the use of immunosuppressive drugs and anti&#150;tumor necrosis factor &#097; , or TNF- &#097; , antibodies; however, more than one third of patients do not have a response to these therapies. The efficacy of these therapies may also diminish over time, and they can increase a patient&#146;s risk of opportunistic infections and cancer. While UC can be cured by colectomy, currently there is no known cure for CD. 

Recently reported clinical results related to the use of a first-generation, stereorandom antisense oligonucleotide (MONGERSEN) targeting SMAD7, a protein of the SMAD family involved in the signal transduction pathway of TGF-B and its receptors, which is present in abundant concentration in inflamed intestinal tissues, have been encouraging. In a 160-patient, Phase 2 trial, MONGERSEN induced pronounced and sustained relief of the inflammation and related symptoms of CD. Celgene Corporation is currently developing MONGERSEN, for the treatment of terminal ileitis, the most frequent form of CD. Idera Pharmaceuticals is currently conducting a Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers for a Toll-Like Receptor antagonist (IMO-9200), which an oligonucleotide-based therapy. Idera Pharmaceuticals intends to initiate further development of IMO-9200 in a selected autoimmune disease indication in the future. 

Our Program 

We are developing stereochemically optimized antisense oligonucleotides against SMAD7, which should result in superior activity and durability over stereomixtures. Our initial goal is to design different stereochemistries optimized for antisense, translational blockade or immune modulating in vitro activity and select our lead therapeutic candidate based on its performance on an efficacy model of IBD. We also plan to collaborate with a third-party contract manufacturing organization to produce oral, gastro-resistant, solid formulations (tablets or capsules) that are able to deliver the stereopure oligonucleotides at the desired site of gastrointestinal inflammation, which we refer to as encapsulated oligonucleotides. Our selected lead therapeutic candidate would undergo the customary Chemistry and Manufacturing Controls, or CMC, and toxicology programs in preparation for the filing of an IND. Following our filing of an IND, we would expect to conduct clinical trials leveraging the availability of endoscopic and mucosal healing endpoints as early evidences of therapeutic potential, and as short-term surrogates for the clinical endpoints we would expect to use in late-stage and registration studies. 

We expect to select a lead candidate for our SMAD7 program in late 2016. 

Our Late-Stage Discovery Programs 

Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy 

Our Program 

In addition to our previously described program relating to the development of exon skipping nucleic acid therapeutic candidates for the treatment of DMD, we are investigating other novel approaches to treat DMD, especially in the advanced stages of the disease. Restoration of dystrophin using exon skipping approaches alone may be less effective in situations where disease has progressed to a state of advanced muscle damage. To promote skeletal muscle growth, we are investigating antisense-mediated myostatin pathway inhibitors at the ligand and receptor level, by targeting AcRIIb. We will investigate these inhibitors alone and in combination with our exon skipping therapeutic candidates. We expect to identify a lead candidate in our AcRIIb program in 2016. 

&#160;

Epidermolysis Bullosa Simplex 

Background and Market Opportunity 

Epidermolysis bullosa simplex is an autosomal dominant genetic condition that causes the skin to become very fragile and blister easily. Blisters and areas of skin loss occur in response to minor injury or friction, such as rubbing or scratching. The signs and symptoms of this condition vary widely among affected individuals. Blistering primarily affects the hands and feet in mild cases, and the blisters usually heal without leaving scars. Severe cases of this condition involve widespread blistering that can lead to infections, dehydration, and other medical problems. Severe cases may be life-threatening in infancy. Researchers have identified four major types of epidermolysis bullosa simplex. Although the types differ in severity, their features overlap significantly, and they are caused by mutations in the same genes. We estimate that approximately 6,300 people in the United States have epidermolysis bullosa simplex. 

Current Treatments 

Epidermolysis bullosa simplex has no known cure, though mild forms may improve with age. Treatment focuses on addressing the symptoms, such as infection and itching, and preventing pain and wounds. Severe forms may cause serious complications and can be fatal. 

Our Program 

We are investigating allele-selective antisense oligonucleotides against SNPs widely associated with causative mutations in KRT14 gene, which produces the Keratin 14 protein. In particular, we are targeting KRT14 SNP-1 and KRT14 SNP-2. We and our collaborators have identified single SNPs in KRT14 that provide coverage for approximately 46% of the EBS population. In EBS preclinical models, it has been shown that allele-specific reduction in expression of the mutant keratin genes can prevent the skin-blistering phenotype. Due to the absence of appropriate transgenic SNP models, we are advancing topical formulation development efforts with our collaborators alongside in vitro optimization of allele-specific targeting agents. Additionally, we are working with leading clinicians and translational scientists in the United Kingdom to establish well-controlled experimental medicine studies in patients with EBS. 

We expect to identify lead candidates in our KRT14 SNP-1 and KRT14 SNP-2 programs in 2016. We expect investigator-sponsored studies of our therapeutic candidates for EBS to be initiated in 2017. 

Licensing Arrangements and Research Collaborations 

Our business strategy is to develop and commercialize a broad pipeline of nucleic acid therapies. As part of this strategy, we have entered into, and expect to enter into additional, license and research collaboration agreements as a means of advancing our own investigational nucleic acid therapeutic programs and leveraging our synthetic chemistry drug development platform to optimize the therapies being developed by our partners. 

Our Technology Licenses 

Max-Planck-Innovation GmbH 

In June 2015, we entered into an agreement with Max-Planck-Innovation GmbH, or MI, pursuant to which we obtained a co-exclusive royalty-bearing, worldwide license, with the right to sublicense, to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize products in all fields of use under certain patent rights owned by Max-Planck- Gesellschaft, or MPG, and patent rights owned by University of Massachusetts Medical School, or UMMS, which has been granted to us by MI, a wholly-owned subsidiary of MPG, acting as MPG&#146;s technology transfer agency and UMMS&#146;s authorized licensing agency for such patents. MPG and MI are collectively referred to herein as Max-Planck. 

&#160;

Our patent rights under this license are to patent filings that relate to certain sequence and structural features of single-stranded RNA molecules that mediate target-specific RNA interference, and include both filings that are owned by Max Planck and arose from research conducted by Thomas Tuschl, Ph.D. and his colleagues at the Max- Planck-Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, and also an issued U.S. patent owned by the University of Massachusetts, or UMASS, that prevailed in an interference with one of the Max-Planck filings and was subsequently included, through a separate agreement between Max-Planck and UMASS, within the portfolio that Max-Planck is authorized to license. The Max-Planck licensed patent portfolio includes issued U.S. and Canadian patents, and pending U.S. and European patent applications, each of which has a projected 20-year term that extends into 2023. We intend to develop and commercialize diagnostic and therapeutic products based on our patent rights under this license, although currently we do not rely on the patent rights under this license for any of our drug candidates under development in our therapeutic or discovery programs. Max-Planck retains the right to practice the intellectual property licensed under the agreement for non-commercial purposes. 

Our license is one of two maximum allowable co-exclusive licenses for these patents, the other of which is currently held by Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (formerly Isis Pharmaceuticals), or Ionis. If either we or Ionis terminates its respective co-exclusive portion of the license, Max-Planck is obligated to grant the other party an exclusive license on substantially the same terms and conditions previously applicable to the terminated co-exclusive licensee. 

Under certain conditions, we are permitted to sublicense our rights under the license. The license requires that we use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize products under the agreement, whether solely or through our affiliates and sublicensees. In order to secure the license, we made an upfront payment of less than $0.1 million to Max-Planck. Additionally, starting on the first anniversary of the agreement, we will be required to pay annual license maintenance fees of less than $0.1 million to Max-Planck which will be credited against any royalties payable for the applicable calendar year. We will be required to make payments based upon regulatory milestones, including the initiation of clinical trials, and product approval milestones totaling up to $1.6 million for each licensed product reaching such clinical stage, provided that such milestone payments will only be payable once per target irrespective of the number of licensed products targeting such target to achieve such milestones. In addition to milestone payments, we will be required to pay royalties of a percentage of cumulative annual net sales of a licensed product commercialized by us, our affiliates and sublicensees. The percentage is in the low single digits. The royalties payable to Max-Planck are subject to reduction for any third party payments required to be made, with a minimum floor in the low single digits. If we grant a sublicense of our rights under this license, we will be obligated to pay Max-Planck a percentage of specified sublicensing consideration received from such sublicensee attributable to the sublicense granted under the licensed patents, ranging from the mid-single digits to the low thirties depending on the stage of development at the time the sublicense is executed. 

We may unilaterally terminate the license agreement upon 90 days&#146; prior written notice and payment of all accrued amounts owing to Max-Planck. Max-Planck may terminate the agreement upon 30 days&#146; prior written notice if we challenge the validity of its patents, upon 30 days&#146; prior written notice if we undergo a change of control and cannot demonstrate that we will maintain a development and commercialization program that is substantially similar or greater in scope than the program prior to the change of control event, or in the event of our material breach which remains uncured after 60 days of receiving written notice of such breach (or 45 days in the case of nonpayment). Absent early termination, the agreement will automatically terminate upon the later of the expiration or abandonment of all issued patents and filed patent applications with the patent rights covered by the agreement or April 28, 2019. 

Our Research Collaborations 

University of Oxford; Professor Matthew Wood&#146;s Laboratory 

In April 2015, we entered into a translational research collaboration agreement with The Chancellor, Masters, and Scholars of the University of Oxford, or Oxford. Research under this collaboration is being conducted by 

&#160;

Dr. Matthew J.A. Wood, Professor of Neuroscience at the University of Oxford and Co-Director of the Oxford Centre for Neuromuscular Science. Dr. Wood&#146;s research is in the field of degenerative disorders of the nervous system and muscle. His laboratory&#146;s main focus is the investigation of novel therapeutic approaches utilizing short nucleic acids to target messenger RNA, or mRNA. His current work is investigating the potential of single-stranded antisense oligonucleotides for the modification of mRNA splicing, for example in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. In addition, his investigation includes the potential of double-stranded RNA for gene silencing, or RNAi, for the silencing of target genes and mutant alleles both in muscle and in the nervous system. 

Our research collaboration with Oxford involves characterizing our proprietary isomers in order to improve the pharmacology of oligonucleotides for the treatment of DMD. Under the agreement, both parties are obligated to use reasonable endeavors to carry out the research project in accordance with the agreed upon research plan. Under the agreement, we have agreed to pay Oxford up to $0.4 million to conduct specified research services for our benefit during an initial 18-month term, which may be extended by the parties. 

We will own the results of the research conducted under the collaboration, including any potential intellectual property inventions, and we may, at our own expense, elect to register and maintain any protection for the intellectual property included in or arising or derived from the results of the research, including patent applications, without payment of any additional compensation to Oxford. The agreement does not affect the respective ownership rights of any background information, intellectual property, technology, design or know-how owned by the parties that are not results of the research conducted under the collaboration. Oxford retains the right to use the results of the research for purposes of Oxfords&#146; own internal academic teaching and other scholarly uses undertaken solely for education and academic research. 

Either we or Oxford may terminate the research collaboration in the event of the other party&#146;s breach of the agreement if such breach is capable of cure but remains uncured after 60 days of receiving written notice of such breach, or upon the occurrence of certain bankruptcy events. 

The Children&#146;s Hospital of Philadelphia; Dr. Beverly Davidson&#146;s Laboratory 

In April 2015, we entered into a master sponsored research agreement with The Children&#146;s Hospital of Philadelphia, or CHOP, which employs Dr. Beverly Davidson, who is the principal investigator under the first research project under the agreement. Dr. Davidson is the director of the Center for Cellular and Molecular Therapeutics at CHOP, a Professor at the University of Pennsylvania and a scientific co-founder of and advisor to Spark Therapeutics, Inc. Dr. Davidson and her laboratory team have succeeded in reversing neurological deficits in small and large animal models of disease, and are working to advance this approach to treating human diseases such as Huntington&#146;s disease. In these studies, she has delivered forms of RNA to the brains of animals to silence the activity of disease- associated genes. Our agreement requires that all research for this first project be conducted in Dr. Davidson&#146;s laboratory at CHOP. 

Our research collaboration with CHOP involves characterization of our proprietary isomers for the treatment of Huntington&#146;s disease. Under the agreement, for this first research project we have agreed to pay CHOP up to approximately $0.2 million to conduct specified research activities, on a project-by-project basis, for our benefit. Additional research projects may be agreed upon by CHOP and the company under the agreement. The term of the research collaboration will end during a term that ends on the later of the five-year anniversary or the date that the last research project is completed. 

Each party shall be the sole owner of any intellectual property resulting from the research collaboration that is created solely by on or behalf of such party pursuant to the performance of research activities under the agreement. Similarly, the parties shall be joint owners of intellectual property created jointly under the agreement. Prior to us exercising an option to license any such intellectual property (as described below), CHOP is responsible for preparing, prosecuting and maintaining all patents related to CHOP intellectual property and joint intellectual property and we are responsible for reimbursing CHOP for the costs associated with the 

&#160;

protection of such intellectual property that we request CHOP to protect. In addition, we have a first and exclusive option to negotiate for a revenue-bearing license, exclusive or non-exclusive at our election, under all of CHOP&#146;s interest in and to the CHOP intellectual property and the joint intellectual property resulting from each research project performed under the agreement, provided that we pay all costs for the preparation, filing, prosecution and maintenance of patents or other intellectual property protection in the case of an exclusive license or our pro rata costs in the case of a non-exclusive license. Each such option expires 90 days after CHOP&#146;s disclosure of the intellectual property to us. If we elect to exercise an option for a license, then we have six months to negotiate and enter into such license with CHOP. Furthermore, if certain background or enabling intellectual property is held by CHOP that would be necessary for us to obtain rights to develop and exploit the CHOP or joint intellectual property that we elect to license, then such license rights to such blocking intellectual property will be added to our license for the applicable option exercise. 

We may terminate the agreement at any time upon 30 days&#146; prior written notice to CHOP. In addition, we may terminate the agreement with immediate effect if CHOP is unable to perform the requested research, materially breaches the agreement and fails to cure such breach within 30 days after receiving written notice of such breach, if performance of the agreement would violate the law or upon the occurrence of certain CHOP bankruptcy events. 

CHOP may terminate the agreement if we materially breach the agreement and do not cure such breach within 30 days after receiving written notice of such breach from CHOP. 

University of Dundee 

In September 2015, we entered into a research collaboration agreement with the University of Dundee, or Dundee. Our research collaboration with Dundee involves characterizing our proprietary isomers in order to improve the pharmacology of oligonucleotides for the treatment of EBS. Under the agreement, both parties are obligated to use reasonable endeavors to carry out the research project in accordance with the agreed upon research plan. Under the agreement, we have agreed to pay Dundee up to $0.3 million to conduct specified research services for our benefit during an initial two-year term, which may be extended by the parties. 

We will own the results of the research conducted under the collaboration, including any potential intellectual property inventions, and we may, at our own expense, elect to register and maintain any protection for the intellectual property included in or arising or derived from the results of the research, including patent applications, without payment of any additional compensation to Dundee. The agreement does not affect the respective ownership rights of any background information, intellectual property, technology, design or know-how owned by the parties that are not results of the research conducted under the collaboration. Dundee retains the right to use the results of the research for purposes of Dundee&#146;s own internal academic teaching and other scholarly uses undertaken solely for education and academic research. 

Either we or Dundee may terminate the research collaboration in the event of the other party&#146;s breach of the agreement, if such breach is capable of cure, but remains uncured after 60 days of receiving written notice of such breach, or upon the occurrence of certain bankruptcy events. 

Manufacturing 

To date, we have manufactured only limited supplies of drug substance for use in IND-enabling toxicology studies in animals at our own facility and have contracted with several third-party contract manufacturing organizations for the supply of drug substance and finished product to meet our testing needs for preclinical toxicology and clinical testing. We may continue to rely on third-party contract manufacturing organizations for the supply of drug substance and certain drug product for our product candidates for the foreseeable future. In the future, we may also develop our own capabilities to manufacture drug substance for human clinical use. Commercial quantities of any drugs that we may seek to develop will have to be manufactured in facilities, and 

&#160;

by processes, that comply with FDA requirements and other federal, state and local regulations, as well as comparable foreign regulations. 

We believe we have sufficient manufacturing capacity through our third-party contract manufacturers and our internal GLP manufacturing facility to meet our current research, clinical and early-stage commercial needs. We believe that the supply capacity we have established externally, together with the internal capacity we developed to support preclinical trials, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated needs for the next several years. We monitor the capacity availability for the manufacture of drug substance and drug product and believe that our supply agreements with our contract manufactures and the lead times for new supply agreements would allow us to access additional capacity to meet our currently anticipated needs. We also believe that our products can be manufactured at a scale and with production and procurement efficiencies that will result in commercially competitive costs. 

Research and Development 

Since commencing operations, we have dedicated a significant portion of our resources to research and development activities, including our therapeutic programs. We incurred research and development expenses of $9.1 million, $2.4 million and $1.9 million during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 

We anticipate that a significant portion of our operating expenses will continue to be related to research and development as we continue to advance our therapeutic programs. 

Intellectual Property 

We own or have rights to worldwide patent filings that protect our proprietary technologies for manufacturing stereochemically pure oligonucleotide compositions, and also protect compositions themselves, as well as methods of using them, including in the treatment of diseases. Our portfolio currently includes at least four issued U.S. patents, at least 11 issued foreign patents and pending applications in at least 18 jurisdictions. 

Synthetic Methodologies 

Our patent portfolio includes multiple families that protect synthetic methodologies and/or key reagents for generating stereochemically pure oligonucleotide compositions. Certain synthetic methodologies are covered by families licensed from the University of Tokyo which include two issued Japanese patents and have terms that extend into 2022-2025. 

Additional synthetic methodologies are protected by families that we own, including one with issued patents in Japan, Russia and Singapore and pending applications in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, India, Japan, Russia, Singapore, South Korea and the U.S. that has a 20-year expiration date in December 2029 and one with pending applications in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Europe, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea and the United States that has a 20-year expiration date in July 2033. 

Certain modification methods and reagents are protected by families that we own, which have pending applications and/or issued patents in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Europe, India, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea and/or the United States, and have 20-year expiration dates in July 2030 and July 2032, respectively. 

We also own or co-own (with either the University of Tokyo or Shin Nippon Biomedical Laboratories, Ltd.) certain filings that are particularly directed to methods and reagents for synthesizing RNA oligonucleotides. These include issued patents in the United States and Japan, and pending applications in China, Europe, Hong Kong, Japan and/or the United States; their 20-year expiration dates fall in 2030 and 2031. 

&#160;

Stereochemically Pure Oligonucleotide Compositions 

Certain of our patent filings protect stereochemically pure compositions, particularly of therapeutically relevant oligonucleotides. Some such filings are directed to compositions whose oligonucleotides are characterized by particular patterns of chemical modifications (including bases, sugars and/or internucleotidic linkages) and/or of internucleotidic linkage stereochemistry. Specific compositions designed for use in the treatment of particular diseases (e.g., Huntington&#146;s disease, etc.), were also described. One such family that we own is pending in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Europe, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Russia, Singapore, South Africa and South Korea, and has a 20-year term extending into July 2033; another, also owned by us, is pending in the International Phase (i.e., the PCT), and has a 20-year term extending into January 2035. This latter family includes data demonstrating key valuable attributes of particular stereochemically pure oligonucleotide compositions that act as antisense agents. 

We also own various patent families that relate to stereochemically pure oligonucleotide adjuvant compositions. These include pending filings in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Japan, India, Israel, Mexico, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, the United Arab Emirates, the United States, and in the International Phase, and have 20- year terms extending into 2033-2035. 

Filings that protect compositions are also directed to methods of using such compositions, for example in the treatment of particular diseases. 

Future Filings 

We maintain a thoughtful and ambitious program for developing and protecting additional intellectual property, including new synthetic methodologies and reagents. We also intend to prepare and submit patent filings specifically directed to protecting individual product candidates and their uses as we finalize leads and collect relevant data, which is expected to include comparison data confirming novel and/or beneficial attributes of our product candidates. 

Singapore Intellectual Property Law 

Section 34 of the Singapore Patents Act provides that a person residing in Singapore is required to obtain written authorization from the Singapore Registrar of Patents before filing an application for a patent for an invention outside of Singapore. A violation of Section 34 is criminal offense punishable by a fine not exceeding S$5,000, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years, or both. If the Registrar does not issue any direction prohibiting or restricting the publication or communication of information contained in the patent application within two months after the request for authorization is filed, the applicant may file a patent application for that invention in another jurisdiction. If a person unintentionally violates Section 34, the Registrar may grant relief upon payment of a fine not exceeding S$2,000. 

Competition 

The pharmaceutical marketplace is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our expertise in nucleic acid therapeutics, scientific knowledge and intellectual property estate provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Not only must we compete with other companies that are focused on nucleic acid therapeutics, but any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. 

Many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and 

&#160;

marketing approved products than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. 

Huntington&#146;s Disease 

There are no approved treatments available to slow the progression of Huntington&#146;s disease. We believe, based on publicly available information, that (i) Ionis Pharmaceuticals and Roche (Phase 1/2) and Sangamo Biosciences (preclinical) are developing therapies that directly target the huntingtin RNA and (ii) a number of other companies are developing drugs to treat symptoms associated with Huntington&#146;s disease, including Auspex Pharmaceuticals and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (which have submitted a New Drug Application, or NDA, to the FDA), Prana Biotechnology (Phase 2), Siena Biotech (Phase 2), Raptor Pharmaceuticals (Phase 2), Omeros Corporation (Phase 2), Pfizer (Phase 2) and Ipsen (Phase 2), among others. 

Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy 

There are no therapies approved for the treatment of DMD in the United States. We believe, based on publicly available information, that (i) PTC Therapeutics, BioMarin Pharmaceuticals and Sarepta Therapeutics are each developing exon skipping nucleic acid therapies to specifically target the disease-associated exons of the dystrophin RNA and all have submitted an NDA to the FDA and (ii) a number of other companies, including Summit Therapeutics (Phase 2), are developing drugs that can alter the progression of the disease in patients. For PTC Therapeutics, conditional market authorization has been granted in Europe for Ataluren (TRANSLARNA) for the treatment of nonsense mutation DMD for ambulatory patients who are 5 years or older. However, in the United States in February 2016, PTC received a refuse to file letter from the FDA for Ataluren indicating that the new drug application was not sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review by the FDA. BioMarin Pharmaceutical&#146;s DRISAPERSEN is an exon skipping nucleic acid therapeutic candidate for DMD for which the FDA issued a complete response letter in January 2016 indicating that the review cycle was complete and that the new drug application is not ready for approval in its present form. Sarepta Therapeutics&#146;s ETEPLIRSEN is an exon skipping nucleic acid therapeutic candidate currently undergoing FDA regulatory review in the United States. 

Inflammatory Bowel Disease 

There are a limited number of drugs available for the treatment of IBD (either UC or CD) including mesalazine, azathioprine, budesonide and vedoluzimab. We believe based on publicly available information that (i) Celgene is developing a nucleic acid therapy to target CD (Phase 2) and (ii) other companies either are developing or have approval to sell drugs to treat the symptoms of IBD, including Johnson &#38; Johnson, Receptos, Pfizer, Eisai, Mylan, Novartis, Takeda and Valeant Pharmaceuticals, among others. 

Government Regulation 

FDA Approval Process 

In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA&#146;s refusal to approve pending applications, a 

&#160;

clinical hold, warning letters, recall or seizure of products, partial or total suspension of production, withdrawal of the product from the market, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. 

FDA approval is required before any new drug, such as a new chemical entity, or a new dosage form, new use or new route of administration of a previously approved product, can be marketed in the United States. The process required by the FDA before a new drug product may be marketed in the United States generally involves: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; completion of preclinical laboratory and animal testing and formulation studies in compliance with applicable FDA good laboratory practice regulations and other requirements, or GLPs; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; submission to the FDA of an IND for human clinical testing which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin in the United States; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each site where a clinical trial will be performed before the trial may be initiated at that site; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCPs, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed product candidate for each intended use; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the facility or facilities at which the product is manufactured to assess compliance with cGMPs; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; submission to the FDA of a new product application, or NDA which must be accepted for filing by the FDA; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; payment of user fees, if applicable; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; FDA review and approval of the NDA. The preclinical and clinical testing and review process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, manufacturing and control procedures and stability, as well as animal studies to assess the toxicity and other safety characteristics of the product. The results of preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and a proposed clinical trial protocol and other information, are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, our submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Even if the IND becomes effective and the trial proceeds without initial FDA objection, the FDA may stop the trial at a later time if it has concerns, such as if unacceptable safety risks arise. 

Further, an independent IRB at each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and informed consent information for subjects before the trial commences at that site and it must monitor the trial until completed. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trials are not being conducted in accordance with GCPs, and an IRB may also suspend a clinical trial at its site for similar reasons. 

Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Sponsors of clinical trials generally must register and report, at the NIH-maintained website clinicaltrials.gov, 

&#160;

key parameters of a clinical trial. For purposes of an NDA submission, human clinical trials are typically conducted in the following sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Phase 1. The product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients and tested for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Phase 2. The product is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted indications and to determine dose tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more extensive clinical trials. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Phase 3. These are commonly referred to as pivotal studies. When Phase 2 evaluations demonstrate that a dose range of the product appears to be effective and has an acceptable safety profile, trials are undertaken in large patient populations to further evaluate dosage, to obtain additional evidence of clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at multiple, geographically-dispersed clinical trial sites, to establish the overall risk-benefit relationship of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Phase 4. In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of an NDA for a product candidate on the sponsor&#146;s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the product&#146;s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval. Such post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 studies. The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA. NDAs must also contain extensive information relating to the product&#146;s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacturing and controls and proposed labeling, among other things. 

For some products, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, which could include measures imposed by the FDA such as prescribing restrictions, requirements for post-marketing studies or certain restrictions on distribution and use. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved NDA are also subject to annual product and establishment user fees. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency&#146;s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information and is subject to payment of additional user fees. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. 

Once the submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA agrees to specific performance goals for NDA review time through a two-tiered classification system, Standard Review and Priority Review. Standard Review NDAs have a goal of being completed within a ten-month timeframe from FDA filing of the application. A Priority Review designation is given to products that offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. The goal for completing a Priority Review is six months from filing. 

The review process may be extended by the FDA to consider certain information or obtain clarification regarding information already provided in the submission. The FDA may refer applications for novel products or products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 

Before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP. 

&#160;

After the FDA evaluates the NDA and, in some cases, the related manufacturing facilities, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, to indicate that the review cycle for an application is complete and that the application is not ready for approval. CRLs generally outline the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when the deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA&#146;s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. 

The FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems are identified after the product reaches the market. In addition, the FDA may require post-approval testing, including Phase 4 studies, and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products which have been commercialized, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. Products may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label, and, even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product or impose other conditions, including labeling or distribution restrictions or other risk- management mechanisms, such as a Black Box Warning, which highlights a specific warning (typically life- threatening), or a REMS program. Further, if there are any modifications to the product, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, a company may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new or supplemental NDA, which may require the company to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials. 

Post-Approval Requirements 

Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to product listing, recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. 

In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and some state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMPs. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements on the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. 

Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. &#160;

The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. While physicians may generally prescribe for off label uses, manufacturers may only promote for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off label uses may be subject to significant liability, both at the federal and state levels. 

The FDA has authority to require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, from manufacturers to ensure that the benefits of a drug or biological product outweigh its risks. In determining whether a REMS is necessary, FDA may consider the size of the population likely to use the drug, the seriousness of the disease or condition to be treated, the expected benefit of the drug, the duration of treatment, the seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the drug is a new molecular entity. If the FDA determines a REMS is necessary, the drug sponsor must agree to the REMS plan at the time of approval. A REMS may be required to include various elements, such as a medication guide or patient package insert, a communication plan to educate health care providers of the drug&#146;s risks, limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, or other measures that the FDA deems necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. In addition, the REMS must include a timetable to assess the strategy at 18 months, three years, and seven years after the strategy&#146;s approval. The FDA may also impose a REMS requirement on a drug already on the market if the FDA determines, based on new safety information, that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the drug&#146;s benefits outweigh its risks. 

Orphan Drug Designation 

Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition which is defined as one affecting fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or more than 200,000 individuals where there is no reasonable expectation that the product development cost will be recovered from product sales in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA and does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the drug and its potential orphan use will be disclosed publicly by the FDA; the posting will also indicate whether a drug is no longer designated as an orphan drug. More than one product candidate may receive an orphan drug designation for the same indication. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 

If an orphan drug-designated product subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it was designed, the product will be entitled to seven years of product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years. If a competitor obtains approval of the same drug, as defined by the FDA, or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor&#146;s product for the same indication or disease, the competitor&#146;s exclusivity could block the approval of our product candidate in the designated orphan indication for seven years. 

Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 

Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our therapeutic candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product&#146;s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND, and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for extension must be made prior to expiration of 

&#160;

the patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we intend to apply for restorations of patent term for some of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond their current expiration date, depending on the expected length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the submission of the relevant NDA. 

Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an approved NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. 

Other Healthcare Laws 

Although we currently do not have any products on the market, we may be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and other countries in which we conduct our business. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security and physician sunshine laws and regulations, many of which may become more applicable to us if our product candidates are approved and we begin commercialization. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. 

Healthcare Reform 

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA, has had, and is expected to continue to have, a significant impact on the healthcare industry in the United States. PPACA was designed to expand coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. With regard to pharmaceutical products, among other things, PPACA expanded and increased industry rebates for drugs covered under Medicaid programs and made changes to the coverage requirements under the Medicare prescription drug benefit. We continue to evaluate the effect that PPACA has on our business. In the coming years, additional legislative and regulatory changes could be made to governmental health programs that could significantly impact pharmaceutical companies and the success of our product candidates. PPACA, as well as other federal, state and foreign healthcare reform measures that have been and may be adopted in the future, could harm our future revenues. 

Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing, and Reimbursement 

Sales of our products, when and if approved for marketing, will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state, and foreign government health care 

&#160;

programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products, drugs and services. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Limited third-party reimbursement for our product candidates or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover our product candidates could reduce physician usage of our products once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. 

Manufacturing Requirements 

We and our third-party manufacturers must comply with applicable cGMP requirements. The cGMP requirements include requirements relating to, among other things, organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports, and returned or salvaged products. The manufacturing facilities for our products must meet cGMP requirements to the satisfaction of the FDA pursuant to a pre-approval inspection before we can use them to manufacture our products. We and our third-party manufacturers are also subject to periodic unannounced inspections of facilities by the FDA and other authorities, including procedures and operations used in the testing and manufacture of our products to assess our compliance with applicable regulations. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subjects a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, including, among other things, warning letters, voluntary corrective action, the seizure of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations and civil and criminal penalties. 

Other Regulatory Requirements 

We are also subject to various laws and regulations regarding laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in connection with our research. In each of these areas, as above, the FDA has broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including, among other things, the ability to levy fines and civil penalties, suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize or recall products, and withdraw approvals, any one or more of which could have an adverse effect on our ability to operate our business and generate revenues. Compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations is expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research, development and production efforts, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we employed 41 full-time employees. A significant number of our management and professional employees have had prior experience with pharmaceutical, biotechnology or medical product companies. Management considers relations with our employees to be good.
