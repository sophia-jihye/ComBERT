Business 

OVERVIEW 

We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing first-in-class drugs that target micro RNAs to treat a broad range of diseases. We were formed in 2007 when Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.(formerly Isis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) contributed significant intellectual property, know-how and financial and human capital to pursue the development of drugs targeting micro RNAs pursuant to a license and collaboration agreement. We have established strategic alliances with AstraZeneca AB and Sanofi to discover, develop and commercialize micro RNA therapeutics. 

micro RNAs are naturally occurring ribonucleic acid, or RNA, molecules that play a critical role in regulating key biological pathways. Scientific research has shown that the improper balance, or dysregulation, of micro RNAs is directly linked to many diseases. To date, approximately 500 micro RNAs have been identified in humans, each of which is believed to interact with a specific set of genes that control key aspects of cell biology. Since most diseases are multi-factorial and involve multiple 

Table of Contents 

targets in a pathway, the ability to modulate gene networks by targeting a single micro RNA provides a new therapeutic approach for treating complex diseases. 

RNA plays an essential role in the process used by cells to encode and translate genetic information from DNA to proteins. RNA is comprised of subunits called nucleotides and is synthesized from a DNA template by a process known as transcription. Transcription generates different types of RNA, including messenger RNAs that carry the information for proteins in the sequence of their nucleotides. In contrast, micro RNAs are RNAs that do not code for proteins but rather are responsible for regulating gene expression by affecting the translation of target messenger RNAs. By interacting with many messenger RNAs, a single micro RNA can regulate several genes that are instrumental for the normal function of a biological pathway. 

We believe that micro RNA therapeutics have the potential to become a new and major class of drugs with broad therapeutic application for the following reasons: 

&#8226; 

micro RNAs, until recently, have not been a focus of pharmaceutical research; 

&#8226; 

micro RNAs play a critical role in regulating biological pathways by controlling the translation of many target genes; 

&#8226; 

micro RNA therapeutics target entire disease pathways which may result in more effective treatment of complex multi-factorial diseases; and 

&#8226; 

micro RNA therapeutics may be synergistic with other therapies because of their different mechanism of action. 

We believe we have assembled the leading position in the micro RNA field, including expertise in micro RNA biology and oligonucleotide chemistry, a broad intellectual property estate, relationships with key opinion leaders and a disciplined drug discovery and development process. We refer to these assets as our micro RNA product platform. We are using our micro RNA product platform to develop chemically modified, single-stranded oligonucleotides that we call anti-miRs to modulate micro RNAs and return diseased cells to their healthy state. We believe micro RNAs may be transformative in the field of drug discovery and that anti-miRs may become a new and major class of drugs with broad therapeutic application, much like small molecules, biologics and monoclonal antibodies. In addition to our micro RNA product platform, we have established Regulus micro Markers SM , a division focused on identifying micro RNAs as biomarkers of human disease to support our therapeutic pipeline, collaborators and strategic partners. Regulus micro Markers SM utilizes a clinically-validated, highly reproducible technology platform to identify micro RNAs as potential biomarkers for disease and we control key intellectual property and know-how related to the division. We believe that micro RNA biomarkers may be used to select optimal patient segments in clinical trials and to monitor disease progression or relapse. We believe these micro RNA biomarkers can be applied toward drugs that we develop and drugs developed by other companies with which we partner or collaborate. We have completed a research collaboration with Biogen focused on the discovery of micro RNAs as biomarkers for multiple sclerosis and have also completed research for another leading, commercial-stage pharmaceutical company to explore micro RNAs as biomarkers for specific patient populations. We also maintain several academic research collaborations focused on the identification of micro RNAs as biomarkers in multiple disease areas. 

&#8216;Clinical Map Initiative&#8217; Goals 

To advance our micro RNA therapeutics pipeline and biomarkers platform over the next several years, we have outlined specific goals under our &#8216;Clinical Map Initiative&#8217; strategy. We are developing RG-101, a GalNAc-conjugated anti-miR targeting miR-122, a host factor for the hepatitis C virus, or HCV, infection. In addition, we are developing RG-012, an anti-miR targeting micro RNA-21 for the treatment of Alport syndrome, a life-threatening kidney disease driven by genetic mutations with no approved therapy. We are also advancing several programs toward clinical development in areas such as oncology and fibrosis, both independently and with our strategic alliance partners AstraZeneca and Sanofi. Under our strategic alliance with AstraZeneca, AstraZeneca recently commenced clinical development of RG-125, a GalNAc-conjugated anti-miR targeting micro RNA-103/107 for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, in patients with type 2 diabetes/pre-diabetes. 

RG-101: In August 2015, we initiated a Phase II study investigating RG-101 designed to evaluate a shortened, four-week treatment regimen containing a subcutaneous administration of 2 mg/kg of RG-101 at Day 1 and Day 29, in combination with oral direct-acting antiviral agents Harvoni&#174;, Olysio&#174;, and Daklinza&#174; for 28 days. In February, 2016, we announced interim results from the clinical study. Thirty-eight patients had been evaluated through 8 weeks of follow up. Ninety-seven percent of those patients (37/38) had HCV RNA viral load measurements below the limit of quantification. For those patients through 12 weeks of follow-up, 100% remained below the limit of quantification (14/14). To date, RG-101 has been generally well tolerated with the majority of adverse events considered mild or moderate (headache and fatigue most commonly reported, each at approximately 11%), two SAEs reported during the follow-up period, and with no study discontinuations. The primary endpoint analysis (12 week follow up) for all 79 patients in the study are anticipated to be reported in second quarter of 2016. To expand the potential development of RG-101, in November 2015 we entered into a clinical trial collaboration and

formulation agreement with GSK LLC. In the first quarter of 2016, we plan to initiate a Phase II study evaluating the potential to achieve sustained viral responses post treatment with a single subcutaneous administration of RG-101 in combination with daily oral administrations of GSK2878175, a non-nucleoside NS5B polymerase inhibitor, for up to 12 weeks in treatment-na&#239;ve patients chronically infected with HCV genotypes 1 and 3. Concurrently, GSK will work on developing a long-acting parenteral formulation for injection (&#8220;LAP&#8221;) of GSK2878175 which could improve patient compliance through reduced dosing intervals and potentially extend opportunities for HCV therapeutic intervention. This LAP formulation of GSK2878175 may be used in potential additional clinical trials together with RG-101 following completion of the planned Phase II study. Neither we nor GSK has any further obligations or commitments beyond the contemplated study under the clinical trial collaboration agreement. 

RG-012: In June 2015, we initiated a Phase I study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of subcutaneous dosing of RG-012 in healthy volunteers and the study is now complete. Forty healthy volunteer subjects were enrolled in this first-in-human, single ascending dose study. RG-012 was well-tolerated and there were no serious adverse events reported. We also continue to enroll Alport syndrome patients in our global ATHENA natural history of disease study, which is designed to characterize the natural decline of renal function (as measured by established renal markers) in Alport syndrome patients over time. We believe the data from the ATHENA study will provide the clinical basis for the design of a Phase II proof-of-concept study to monitor the therapeutic effect of RG-012 on the decline in renal function in patients with Alport syndrome. We plan to initiate a Phase II proof-of-concept study evaluating the efficacy of RG-012 in Alport syndrome patients during 2016. 

RG-125: AstraZeneca initiated a Phase I study evaluating RG-125 in humans in December 2015, earning Regulus a $10.0 million milestone from the collaboration. AstraZeneca is responsible for all future development for RG-125. 

Our micro RNA product platform 

We are the leading company in the field of micro RNA therapeutics and are uniquely positioned to leverage oligonucleotide technologies that have been proven in clinical trials by us and our founding companies, Alnylam and Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (formerly Isis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.). Central to achieving our goals is the know-how that we have accumulated in oligonucleotide design and how the specific chemistries behave in the clinical setting. 

We view the following as providing a competitive advantage for our micro RNA product platform: 

&#8226; 

a mature platform selectively producing multiple development candidates advancing to the clinic; 

&#8226; 

scientific advisors who are pioneers in the micro RNA field; 

&#8226; 

exclusive access to proven RNA therapeutic technologies through our founding companies, such as GalNac conjugation and the corresponding manufacturing rights licensed to us from Alnylam, which we are utilizing to enhance delivery of RG-101, our wholly-owned GalNAc-conjugated anti-miR targeting micro RNA-122, to hepatocytes to more effectively treat HCV. 

&#8226; 

a leading micro RNA intellectual property estate with access to approximately 850 patents and patent applications relating to RNA technologies, including patent and patent applications relating to chemical modification of oligonucleotides that are useful for &#32;micro RNA therapeutics, and over 200 patents and patent applications covering compositions and therapeutic uses related to micro RNA and micro RNA drug products; 

&#8226; 

development expertise and financial resources provided by our strategic alliances; and 

&#8226; 

numerous academic collaborations that help us identify new micro RNA targets and support our early stage discovery efforts. 

The disciplined approach we take for the discovery and development of micro RNA therapeutics is as important as the assets assembled to execute our plans and is based on the following four steps: 

Step 1 - Evaluation of microRNA therapeutic opportunities 

The initiation of our micro RNA discovery and development efforts is based on rigorous scientific and business criteria, including: 

&#8226; 

existence of significant scientific evidence to support the role of a specific micro RNA in a disease; 

&#8226; 

availability of predictive preclinical disease models to test our micro RNA development candidates; 

&#8226; 

ability to effectively deliver anti-miRs to the diseased cells or tissues; and 

&#8226; 

existence of a reasonable unmet medical need and commercial opportunity. 

Step 2 - Identification of microRNA targets 

Table of Contents 

We identify micro RNA targets through bioinformatic analysis of public and proprietary micro RNA expression profiling data sets from samples of diseased human tissues. The analysis of such data sets can immediately highlight a potential role for specific micro RNAs in the disease being studied. Further investigation of animal models that are predictive of human diseases in which those same micro RNAs are also dysregulated provides additional data to support a new program. We have applied this strategy successfully in our existing programs and we believe that this approach will continue to help us identify clinically relevant micro RNA targets. 

Step 3 - Validation of microRNA targets 

Our validation strategy is based on two distinct steps. First, using genetic tools, we determine whether up-regulation, or overproduction, of the micro RNA in healthy animals can create the specific disease state and inhibition of the micro RNA can lead to a therapeutic benefit. Second, using animal models predictive of human diseases, we determine whether pharmacological modulation of the up-regulated micro RNA target with our anti-miRs can also lead to a therapeutic benefit. This validation process enables us to prioritize micro RNA targets that appear to be key drivers of disease and not simply correlating markers. 

Step 4 - Optimization of microRNA development candidates 

We have developed a proprietary process that allows us to rapidly generate an optimized development candidate. Unlike traditional drug classes, such as small molecules, in which thousands of compounds must be screened to identify prospective leads, the fact that anti-miRs are mirror images of their target micro RNAs allows for a more efficient rational design process. The optimization process incorporates our extensive knowledge base around oligonucleotide chemistry and anti-miR design to efficiently synthesize a starting pool of rationally designed anti-miRs to be evaluated in a series of proven assays and models. We also enhance our anti-miRs for distribution to the tissues where the specific micro RNA target is causing disease. 

Regulus micro Markers SM &#160; 

In January 2014, we established Regulus micro Markers SM , a division focused on identifying micro RNAs as biomarkers of human disease, which is designed to support our therapeutic pipeline, collaborators and strategic partners. Through our micro RNA target identification and validation efforts we have developed proprietary technologies for micro RNA profiling and analysis of human clinical samples such as tissue. More recently, micro RNAs have been detected in bodily fluids such as blood, and emerging data generated by us and others have demonstrated that micro RNA signatures in blood can mimic the expression profile observed in disease tissues. 

The identification of dysregulated micro RNAs from various human tissues and blood helps us identify and validate potential micro RNA targets for therapeutic development. Equally important, such micro RNAs may become biomarkers that can be used to select optimal patient segments for our clinical trials and the clinical trials of our strategic alliance partners and collaborators. 

Our initial development candidates 

We are developing single-stranded oligonucleotides, which are chemically synthesized chains of nucleotides that are mirror images of specific target micro RNAs. We incorporate proprietary chemical modifications to enhance drug properties such as potency, stability and tissue distribution. We refer to these chemically modified oligonucleotides as anti-miRs. Each anti-miR is designed to bind with and inhibit a specific micro RNA target that is up-regulated in a cell and that is involved in the disease state. In binding to the micro RNA, anti-miRs correct the dysregulation and return diseased cells to their healthy state. We have demonstrated the therapeutic benefit of inhibiting micro RNA-122 in humans with RG-101 in HCV patients. In addition to these human proof-of-concept results, we have demonstrated therapeutic benefits of our anti-miRs in over 20 different preclinical models of human diseases. 

We have identified and validated several micro RNA targets across a number of disease categories and are working independently and with our strategic alliance partners to optimize anti-miR development candidates. We intend to pursue a balanced approach between product candidates that we develop ourselves and those that we develop with partners. We intend to focus our own resources on proprietary product opportunities in therapeutic areas where development and commercialization activities are appropriate for our size and financial resources, which we anticipate will include oncology indications and orphan diseases. In therapeutic areas where costs are more significant, development timelines are longer or markets are too large for our capabilities, we may seek to secure partners with requisite expertise and resources.

&#160; 

&#32;*Sanofi will have the exclusive option, exercisable after proof-of-concept, to take over further development and commercialization of these programs. At this stage, Regulus will have the option to co-promote any micro RNA therapeutic product in the United States. 

Our strategy 

We are the leading biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of first-in-class drugs based on our proprietary micro RNA product platform. The key elements of our strategy are to (i) build a meaningful clinical portfolio by advancing our current clinical programs and rapidly advancing our preclinical programs into clinical development; (ii)focus our resources on developing drugs for oncology indications or orphan diseases where the development and commercialization activities are appropriate for our size and financial resources; (iii) selectively form strategic alliances to augment our expertise and accelerate development and commercialization; (iv) develop micro RNA biomarkers to support our therapeutic product candidates; and (v) maintain our scientific and intellectual leadership in the micro RNA field. 

Our strategy has been validated to date by the following strategic alliances and collaborations with large pharmaceutical companies: 

&#8226; 

In April 2008, we formed a strategic alliance with GSK to discover and develop micro RNA therapeutics for immuno-inflammatory diseases. In February 2010, we and GSK expanded the alliance to include potential micro RNA therapeutics for the treatment of HCV. In June 2013, we amended our agreement with GSK and agreed that RG-101 was fully-owned by us and that miR-122 would remain a collaboration target under the agreement. Effective January 2015, this strategic alliance was terminated. 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

In June 2010, we formed a strategic alliance with Sanofi to discover and develop micro RNA therapeutics for fibrotic diseases. In July 2012, we expanded the alliance to include potential micro RNA therapeutics in oncology. The original research term for this strategic alliance expired in June 2013, upon which we and Sanofi entered into an option agreement pursuant to which we granted Sanofi an exclusive right to negotiate the co-development and commercialization of certain of our unencumbered micro RNA programs, for which Sanofi paid us an upfront option fee of $2.5 million. In addition, Sanofi granted us an exclusive option to negotiate the co-development and commercialization of miR-21. In February 2014, we and Sanofi extended our strategic alliance and Sanofi concurrently made a $10.0 million investment in our common stock. Under the terms of our extended alliance, Sanofi will have opt-in rights to our RG-012 clinical fibrosis program targeting miR-21 for the treatment of Alport Syndrome, our preclinical program targeting miR-21 for oncology indications, and our preclinical programs targeting miR-221/222 for oncology indications, each of which is to be led by us. If Sanofi chooses to exercise its option on any of these programs, Sanofi will reimburse us for a significant portion of our preclinical and clinical development costs and will also pay us an option exercise fee for any such program, provided that $1.25 million of the $2.5 million upfront option fee paid to us by Sanofi in connection with the June 2013 option agreement will be creditable against such option exercise fee. In addition, we will be eligible to receive clinical and regulatory milestone payments under these programs and potentially commercial milestone payments. We also continue to be eligible to receive royalties on micro RNA therapeutic products commercialized by Sanofi or will have the right to co-promote these products. For additional information, see Note 5 to our financial statements under Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report.

&#8226; 

In August 2012, we formed a strategic alliance with AstraZeneca to discover and develop micro RNA therapeutics for cardiovascular diseases, metabolic diseases and oncology. In March 2015, we and AstraZeneca nominated RG-125, a GalNAc-conjugated anti-miR 103/107 oligonucleotide that has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance in animal models as a clinical development candidate in NASH in patients with type 2 diabetes/pre-diabetes and we earned a $2.5 million milestone. In December 2015, AstraZeneca commenced the first-in-human dosing of RG-125 (AZD4076) in healthy volunteers and we earned an additional $10.0 million milestone. AstraZeneca is responsible for further development of RG-125 under our collaboration. Pursuant to this alliance, we previously investigated targeting micro RNA- 33, or miR-33 for the treatment of atherosclerosis and micro RNA-19, or miR-19 in oncology. We and AstraZeneca agreed to terminate these programs as collaboration targets. In addition, AstraZeneca has the right to substitute a new target for miR-33 and miR-19. If products for all three targets are successfully developed and commercialized through pre-agreed sales targets, we could receive additional milestone payments of up to $485.5 million and would be entitled to receive royalties based on a percentage of net sales of those products. For additional information, see Note 5 to our financial statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report. 

&#8226; 

In August 2012, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Biogen to evaluate the potential use of micro RNA signatures as a biomarker for human patients with multiple sclerosis, or MS. In August 2014, we and Biogen entered into a new collaboration and license agreement to collaborate on micro RNA biomarkers for MS and simultaneously terminated the August 2012 collaboration and license agreement. We have completed the research under this collaboration and earned $3.7 million in payments. Following achievement of the final milestone, which was earned by analyzing the treatment effects of a Biogen relapsing MS drug on circulating micro RNA profiles identified by Regulus micro Markers SM , the scope of the research to be performed under the current collaboration agreement has concluded. 

Under these strategic alliances, we are eligible to receive approximately $900.0 million in aggregate milestone payments upon successful commercialization of micro RNA therapeutics and royalties on net sales for the programs contemplated by our agreements. These payments include up to $107.8 million upon achievement of preclinical and investigational new drug, or IND, milestones, up to $128.0 million upon achievement of clinical development milestones, up to $180.0 million upon achievement of regulatory milestones and up to $490.0 million upon achievement of commercialization milestones. 

Our Intellectual Property and Technology Licenses 

Intellectual property 

We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patents intended to cover our products and compositions, their methods of use and any other inventions that are important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. Our objective is to continue to expand our intellectual property estate through our multiple layer approach in order to protect our micro RNA therapeutics and to maintain our leading position in the micro RNA therapeutics field. 

We believe that we have a leading intellectual property position and substantial know-how relating to the development and commercialization of micro RNA therapeutics, composed of: 

&#8226; 

over 250 patents and patent applications that we own or have in-licensed from academic institutions and third parties including our founding companies, Alnylam and Ionis, related to micro RNA and micro RNA drug products; and 

&#8226; 

numerous patents and patent applications exclusively licensed from our founding companies, Alnylam and Ionis, related to RNA technologies, including patent and patent applications relating to chemical modification of oligonucleotides that are useful for micro RNA therapeutics, including chemical modifications incorporated into our clinical candidates. 

We have exclusively licensed patent rights from Julius-Maximilians-Universit&#228;t W&#252;rzburg and Bayerische Patent Allianz GmBH, which we collectively refer to herein as the University of W&#252;rzburg, which rights encompass the use of anti-miR therapeutics targeting miR-21 for the treatment of fibrosis, including kidney, liver, lung and cardiac fibrosis. In collaboration with us, investigators at the University of W&#252;rzburg demonstrated that targeting miR-21 in a disease model resulted in beneficial phenotypic effects, including the inhibition of the development of fibrosis. The W&#252;rzburg-licensed patent portfolio includes more than 20 U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications. Based on a typical patent term ending 20 years from the date of filing of the application, patents within this portfolio that have issued or may yet issue would have a statutory expiration date in 2029.

We have an exclusive license from Stanford University, or Stanford, to patent rights concerning the use of anti-miR therapeutics targeting miR-122 for the treatment of HCV infection. This patent portfolio is based upon research conducted by Peter Sarnow, Ph.D. and colleagues at Stanford, demonstrating that miR-122 is required for HCV replication in mammalian cells. The Stanford-licensed portfolio includes more than 12 U.S and foreign patents and patent applications. Based on a typical patent term ending 20 years from the date of filing of the application, patents within this portfolio that have issued or may yet issue would have a statutory expiration date in 2025. 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;We have an exclusive license from ETH Z&#252;rich to patent rights related to the use of anti-miR therapeutics targeting miR-103/107 for the treatment of metabolic disorders, including type 2 diabetes. In collaboration with us, Dr. Markus Stoffel and colleagues demonstrated that inhibition of miR-103/107 in disease models of diabetes and obesity resulted in beneficial phenotypic effects, including improved insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis. The ETH Zurich-licensed portfolio includes more than 10 U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications. Based on a typical patent term ending 20 years from the date of filing of the application, patents within this portfolio that have issued or may yet issue would have a statutory expiration date in 2030. 

Our portfolio of exclusively and jointly owned patent and patent applications is currently composed of over 150 U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications with claims to compositions-of-matter or methods related to our micro RNA drug products and micro RNA product platform. We jointly own approximately ten of the patents and pending applications including patents claiming methods for treating liver cancer, including hepatocellular carcinoma, or HCC, using anti-miRs targeting miR-21 and a patent claiming methods for treating liver cancer, including HCC, using a lipid-formulated miR-34a mimic. Based on the patents and patents that may issue from pending applications within our portfolio, patent protection for our micro RNA drug products and their methods of use is currently expected to expire between 2024 and 2035. 

Our founding companies, Alnylam and Ionis, each own or otherwise have rights to numerous patents and patent applications concerning oligonucleotide technologies and a substantial number of these patents and applications have been exclusively licensed to us for use in the micro RNA field. The technologies covered in these patents and applications include various chemical modifications that are applicable to micro RNA therapeutics. Due to patent expiration and strategic patent portfolio decisions, the total number licensed to Regulus will fluctuate from year to year. Among the licensed patents or patent applications, those covering key chemical modifications for use in micro RNA drug products are currently expected to expire in 2023, 2027 and 2029. 

We have a co-exclusive license to the patent portfolio owned by Max-Planck-Gesellschaft, or MPG, which has been granted to us by Max-Planck-Innovation GmbH, or MI, a wholly-owned subsidiary of MPG acting as MPG&#8217;s technology transfer agency. MPG and MI are collectively referred to herein as Max-Planck. This patent portfolio is based on the pioneering micro RNA research conducted by Thomas Tuschl, Ph.D. and colleagues at the Max-Planck Institute of Biophysical Chemistry, which led to the discovery of over 100 human micro RNA sequences, including micro RNAs that are the focus of several of our programs. The patent rights encompass the micro RNA gene sequences as well as the antisense sequences that are complementary to the micro RNAs and thus cover both micro RNA mimic and anti-miR products. Our license is co-exclusive with our founding companies, Alnylam and Ionis, for the exploitation of the Max-Planck patent rights for therapeutic uses. In addition, we also have a co-exclusive license to develop and commercialize diagnostics based upon the Max-Planck patent rights contained in these applications. The Max-Planck licensed patent portfolio, referred to herein as the Tuschl 3 patents, includes at least 25 U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications. Based on a typical patent term ending 20 years from the date of filing of the application, patents within this portfolio that have issued or may yet issue would have a statutory expiration date in 2022. 

The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing the non-provisional application. In the United States, a patent&#8217;s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or U.S. PTO, in granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier-filed patent. 

The term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration of a U.S. patent as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. When possible, depending upon the length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of a new drug application, or NDA, we expect to apply for patent term extensions for patents covering our micro RNA product candidates and their methods of use.

In some circumstances we rely, and may continue to rely, on trade secrets to protect our technology. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. 

Our Technology Licenses 

Max-Planck 

Therapeutic license 

Prior to 2011, our access to the Tuschl 3 patents was derived from agreements between Max-Planck and our founding companies, Alnylam and Ionis, for exclusive use in micro RNA therapeutics. In April 2011, we entered into a direct, co-exclusive license with Max-Planck. The license provides to us, Alnylam and Ionis, co-exclusively, access to the Tuschl 3 patents for therapeutic use. Max-Planck retains the right to practice the intellectual property licensed under the agreement for non-commercial purposes. 

Under the terms of the license, we are permitted to sublicense our rights outright or as part of an alliance. The license requires that we use commercially reasonable diligence in developing and commercializing a product. In order to secure the license, we made an upfront payment of $400,000 to Max-Planck. We will be required to make payments based upon the initiation of clinical trials and/or product approval milestones totaling up to $1.6 million for each licensed product reaching such clinical stage. We made a $50,000 payment in 2014 related to the initiation of the Phase I clinical trial for RG-101. In 2015, we made a $50,000 payment related to the initiation of the Phase I study of RG-012 and a $150,000 payment related to initiation of the Phase II clinical trial for RG-101. In addition to milestone payments, we will be required to pay royalties of a percentage of cumulative annual net sales of a licensed product commercialized by us or one of our strategic alliance partners. The percentage is in the low single digits, with the exact percentage depending upon whether the licensed product incorporates intellectual property covered by a Tuschl 3 patent that is still a pending application or, alternatively, an issued patent, and also upon the volume of annual sales. The royalties payable to Max-Planck are subject to reduction for any third party payments required to be made, with a minimum floor in the low single digits. 

Based on a typical patent term ending 20 years from the date of filing of the application, the longest lived patent rights licensed to us under the agreement have a statutory expiration date of September 2022. 

Diagnostic license 

In June 2009, we entered into a co-exclusive license with Max-Planck for use of the Tuschl 3 patents for diagnostic purposes. Under the terms of the license, we made an initial payment to Max-Planck of &#8364;175,000 . In addition, we made annual maintenance payments to Max-Planck of &#8364;30,000 in each of 2013, 2014 and 2015, and will continue to make annual maintenance payments in this amount during the term of the agreement. In addition to maintenance payments, we will be required to pay royalties of a percentage of net sales of licensed products. The percentage is in the mid-single digits in the event we market the product and at the low end of the 10 to 20% range in the event we sell the product through a distributor. The royalties payable to Max-Planck are reduced by the royalties payable to third parties but only if aggregate royalties payable to Max-Planck and third parties exceed a percentage in the mid-10 to 20% range. 

We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize products under the agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, Max-Planck is permitted to provide up to three additional co-exclusive licenses to its diagnostic patent rights. Based on a typical patent term ending 20 years from the date of filing of the application, the longest lived patent rights licensed to us under the agreement are currently expected to expire in September 2022. 

Max-Planck retains the right to practice the intellectual property licensed under the agreement for non-commercial purposes. 

University of W&#252;rzburg 

In May 2010, we exclusively licensed patent rights from the University of W&#252;rzburg, which encompass the use of anti-miR therapeutics targeting miR-21 for the treatment of fibrosis, including kidney, liver, lung and cardiac fibrosis. 

The University of W&#252;rzburg has reserved the right to use the licensed intellectual property for academic and non-commercial purposes. We have the right to grant sublicenses to third parties under the agreement provided such sublicense is for the purpose of developing or commercializing a product. We must obtain the University of W&#252;rzburg&#8217;s written consent to any such sublicense, which may not be unreasonably withheld. We must use commercially reasonable diligence in our efforts to 

Table of Contents 

develop, manufacture and commercialize a licensed product. We have assumed certain development milestone obligations and must report on our progress in achieving these milestones on an annual basis. 

As a license issuance fee, we paid the University of W&#252;rzburg &#8364;300,000. In addition, upon commercialization of a product, we will pay to the University of W&#252;rzburg a percentage of net sales as a royalty. This royalty is in the low single digits and is reduced upon expiration of all patent claims covering the product. We also paid the University of W&#252;rzburg a partnership bonus of &#8364;200,000 upon entering into our strategic alliance agreement with Sanofi. Under the agreement, beginning January 1, 2020 and ending on the date we receive NDA approval for a licensed product, we will accrue a minimum royalty obligation of &#8364;150,000 per year, which will become payable upon approval of an NDA for a licensed product. After approval of an NDA for a licensed product, we will be required to pay the University of W&#252;rzburg an annual minimum royalty, which increases in the five years following approval up to a maximum of &#8364;3.0 million per year. The minimum royalties are creditable against actual royalties due and payable for the same calendar year. 

In addition, we will be required to pay the University of W&#252;rzburg milestone payments of up to an aggregate of &#8364;1.8 million, based upon achievement of specified clinical and regulatory events. In 2014, we paid the University of W&#252;rzburg &#8364;100,000 related to the initiation of IND-enabling studies for RG-012 and in 2015 we made a &#8364;200,000 payment related to the initiation of the Phase I study of RG-012. In the event we initiate a Phase II clinical trial for another indication with the same licensed product, we will be required to pay 50% of the milestone payments applicable to such milestone events. These milestone events are also tied to the due dates set forth in the commercialization plan but may be extended by delays caused by scientific challenges, regulatory requirements or other circumstances outside of our control. We must request an extension in writing explaining the cause for the delay and proposing new due dates. The University of W&#252;rzburg may accept the revised dates or reject them, in which case an arbitrator will set the revised dates. 

Based on a typical patent term ending 20 years from the date of filing of the application, the last to expire patent licensed to us under the agreement is currently expected to expire in February 2029. 

Stanford University 

In August 2005, Alnylam and Ionis entered into a co-exclusive license agreement with Stanford, relating to its patent applications claiming the use of anti-miR therapeutics targeting miR-122 to reduce the replication of HCV. Upon our formation, we received access to the Stanford technology as an affiliate of Alnylam and Ionis. In July 2009, Ionis assigned its rights and obligations under the license agreement to us. In December 2014, Alnylam assigned its rights and obligations under the license agreement to us. 

Under the license agreement, we are permitted to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize therapeutics for the treatment and prevention of HCV and related conditions. Diagnostics and reagents are specifically excluded from the license. In addition, the license provides a non-exclusive right to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize therapeutics for all conditions or diseases other than HCV. Stanford retained the right, on behalf of itself and all other non-profit academic institutions, to practice the licensed patents for non-profit purposes. 

We are permitted to sublicense our rights under the agreement in connection with a bona fide partnership seeking to research and/or develop products under a jointly prepared research plan and which also includes a license to our intellectual property or in association with providing services to a sublicensee. In the event we receive an upfront payment in connection with a sublicense, we are obligated to pay to Stanford a one-time fixed payment amount, which amount will vary depending upon the size of upfront payment we receive. We must also make an annual license maintenance payment during the term of the agreement. The maintenance payments are creditable against royalty payments made in the same year. We will be required to pay milestones for an exclusively licensed product which will be payable upon achievement of specified regulatory and clinical milestones in an aggregate amount of up to $400,000. In 2014, we made a $50,000 payment to Stanford related to the initiation of the Phase I clinical trial for RG-101. Milestones for a non-exclusively licensed product will be payable upon achievement of the same milestones in an aggregate amount of up to $300,000 for the first such product and up to $200,000 for the second such product. Upon commercialization of a product, we will be required to pay to Stanford a percentage of net sales as a royalty. This percentage is in the low single digits. The payment will be reduced by other payments we are required to make to third parties until a minimum royalty has been reached. 

The agreement requires that we use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, manufacture and commercialize a licensed product and we have agreed to meet certain development and commercialization milestones. 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;Based on a typical patent term ending 20 years from the date of filing of the application, the last to expire patent licensed to us under the agreement is currently expected to expire in May 2025.

ETH Z&#252;rich 

In May 2010, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with ETH Z&#252;rich, relating to its patent applications claiming the use of anti-miR therapeutics targeting miR-103/107 for the treatment of metabolic disorders, including type 2 diabetes. 

ETH Z&#252;rich has retained the right to use the licensed intellectual property for academic and non-commercial purposes. We have the right to grant sublicenses to third parties under the agreement provided the terms of the sublicense agreement include obligations equivalent to those of our license agreement with ETH Z&#252;rich. 

As a license issuance fee, we paid ETH Z&#252;rich CHF 20,000. We must make annual license maintenance payments during the term of the agreement. Patent prosecution costs paid by us are creditable against maintenance payments due the same calendar year, and maintenance payments are creditable against royalty payments made in the same year. We will be required to pay ETH Z&#252;rich milestone payments of up to an aggregate of CHF 1.7 million, based on achievement of specified clinical and regulatory events. As of December 31, 2015, we have CHF 100,000 recorded as an accrued payable as a result of AstraZeneca's first patient dosing in a first-in-human Phase I clinical study of RG-125. Upon commercialization of a product, we will be required to pay ETH Z&#252;rich a percentage of net sales as a royalty. This percentage is in the low single digits. The payment will be reduced by other payments we are required to make to third parties until a minimum royalty has been reached. 

The agreement requires that we use diligent and reasonable efforts to develop and commercially exploit a licensed product. 

Based on a typical patent term ending 20 years from the date of filing of the application, the last to expire patent licensed to us under the agreement is currently expected to expire in May 2030. 

Alnylam/Ionis 

In September 2007, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Alnylam and Ionis, which we subsequently amended, restated and superseded in January 2009, and further amended in June 2010, October 2011 and August 2013. Under the agreement, we acquired an exclusive, royalty-bearing, worldwide license, with rights to sublicense, to patent rights owned or licensed by Alnylam and Ionis to develop, manufacture and commercialize products covered by the licensed patent rights for use in micro RNA compounds which are micro RNA antagonists and micro RNA therapeutics containing these compounds. In addition, we have certain rights to miR-mimics. Under the agreement, we granted to both Alnylam and Ionis a license to practice our intellectual property developed by us to the extent that it is useful specifically to Alnylam&#8217;s RNAi programs or Ionis&#8217; single-stranded oligonucleotide programs, but not including micro RNA compounds or therapeutics that are the subject of our exclusive licenses from Alnylam and Ionis. 

We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize licensed products under the agreement. We are required to notify Alnylam and Ionis when a program reaches development stage (defined as initiation of good laboratory practices, or GLP, toxicology studies) and whether or not we intend to pursue the program. Under the agreement, both Alnylam and Ionis have an option to assume the development and commercialization of product candidates in a program that we do not pursue. If neither Alnylam nor Ionis exercises this option, we are required to use our best efforts to finalize a term sheet with a third party with respect to such program. In the event we are unable to complete a transaction with a third party, both Alnylam and Ionis have a second opt-in option. 

If an election is made by either Alnylam or Ionis (but not both) to opt-in, such party will pay us a one-time fixed payment, the amount of which will depend on whether the first or the second opt-in option was exercised, with a higher amount due if the first opt-in option was exercised. Clinical and regulatory milestones are also payable to us in the event the opt-in election is exercised. Such milestones total $64.0 million in the aggregate if the election is made during the first opt-in period or $15.7 million in the aggregate if the election is made at the second opt-in period. Tiered royalties are payable to us as a percentage of net sales on all products commercialized by the opt-in party. These royalties range from the low to middle single digits depending upon the volume of sales. The opt-in party is also entitled to sublicense the development program to a third party. In such a case, we are also entitled to receive a percentage of the sublicense income received by the opt-in party. The percentage payable depends upon the point at which the opt-in party sublicenses the program and ranges from the low end of the 10 to 20% range to the high end of the 40 to 50% range. The opt-in party is only required to pay the higher of the clinical and regulatory milestones or the sublicense income received in any calendar quarter. The opt-in party is also responsible for all third party payments due under other agreements as a result of the development. In the event both Alnylam and Ionis elect to opt-in during either opt-in period, the parties have agreed to work together to amend the development plan to continue development of the project, including funding of such project and assignment of roles and responsibilities. 

Table of Contents 

In the event we or one of our strategic alliance partners continues with the development of a program, each of Alnylam and Ionis are entitled to royalties as a percentage of net sales. For products that we independently commercialize, these royalties will be in the low single digits. For products commercialized by a third-party collaborator, the royalties will be either the same percentage of net sales as described above or, if the sublicense does not provide a specified level of royalties to us or upon our election, a percentage of the sublicense income received by us from the strategic alliance partner and a modified royalty. The modified royalty would be based upon the lower of the single digit percentage discussed above or one third of the royalty received by us after payments made by us to third parties for development, manufacture and commercialization activities under other agreements. In addition, if we sublicense rights to a collaborator, we will be required to pay to each of Alnylam and Ionis a percentage of our sublicense income in the mid-single digits. We are also responsible for payments due to third parties under other agreements as a result of our development activities, including payments owed by Alnylam and/or Ionis under their agreements. 

Under the October 2011 amendment, Alnylam and Ionis granted us the right to research micro RNA mimics under the licensed intellectual property of Alnylam and Ionis. In the event we develop a miR-mimic, we must first obtain approval from Alnylam and/or Ionis, as applicable, and such approval is subject to the consent of applicable third parties, if any. No additional consideration will be owed by us to Alnylam or Ionis for granting approval. We have the right to sublicense our research rights. We granted to both Alnylam and Ionis a fully paid up, worldwide and exclusive license to any intellectual property developed by us and useful to their research programs and which are not micro RNA antagonists or approved miR-mimics. 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;In August 2013, we entered into an amendment to the Amended and Restated License and Collaboration Agreement with Ionis and Alnylam dated January 1, 2009, as amended in June 2010 and October 2011 (as amended, the &#8220;Amendment&#8221;). Under the terms of the Amendment, the parties agreed to our use of certain Alnylam-controlled intellectual property concerning the use and manufacture of GalNAc conjugates (&#8220;GalNAc Process Technology&#8221;) on a non-exclusive basis. We will generally not be permitted to sublicense or otherwise transfer the GalNAc Process Technology and other Alnylam licensed intellectual property rights relating to GalNAc conjugate technology without the prior written consent of Alnylam, subject to certain limited exceptions for sublicenses to third party collaboration partners. There were no financial terms related to this Amendment. Amounts included in our operating expenses as a result of costs incurred from services provided under the Agreement or out-of-pocket expenses were zero for the years ended December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 &#32;and $0.6 million &#32;for the year ended December 31, 2013 . 

In February 2015, we entered into a letter agreement with Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("Alnylam") pursuant to which we and Alnylam agreed to the financial terms for certain technology acquired by Alnylam within the licensed patent rights under our Amended and Restated License and Collaboration Agreement (the &#8220;Additional Patent Rights&#8221;) with Alnylam and Ionis. In addition to any royalties payable by us to Alnylam pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated License and Collaboration Agreement, we agreed to pay Alnylam an additional low single-digit royalty on net sales of certain products utilizing the Additional Patent Rights, with the exact royalty percentage payable being dependent on the total amount of net sales during the calendar year. We also agreed to pay Alnylam milestone payments on certain products utilizing the additional patent rights of up to $33.0 million &#32;per product upon the achievement of certain regulatory milestone events. There was no activity under this agreement for the year ended December 31, 2015 . 

The agreement expires on the earlier of the cessation of development of the potential royalty-bearing products prior to the commercial sale of any such products anywhere in the world or following the first commercial sale of such products, the expiration of royalty obligations determined on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis. 

Manufacturing 

We contract with third parties to manufacture our compounds and intend to continue to do so in the future. We do not own or operate, nor do we expect to own or operate, facilities for product manufacturing, storage and distribution, or testing. We have personnel with extensive technical, manufacturing, analytical and quality experience and strong project management discipline to oversee contract manufacturing and testing activities, and to compile manufacturing and quality information for our regulatory submissions. 

Manufacturing is subject to extensive regulations that impose various procedural and documentation requirements, which govern record keeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control and quality assurance, among others. Our systems and contractors are required to be in compliance with these regulations, and this is assessed regularly through monitoring of performance and a formal audit program.

Research and Development Expenses 

In 2015, 2014 and 2013, research and development expenses were $56.4 million , $41.0 million &#32;and $29.9 million , respectively. 

Competition 

The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by intense and rapidly changing competition to develop new technologies and proprietary products. While we believe that our intellectual property estate and scientific expertise in the micro RNA field provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including larger and better-funded pharmaceutical companies. Not only must we compete with other companies that are focused on micro RNA therapeutics, but any products that we may commercialize will have to compete with existing and new therapies that may become available in the future. In addition, we expect that for each disease category for which we develop and apply our micro RNA therapeutics, there are other biotechnology companies that will compete against us by applying marketed products and development programs using technology other than micro RNA therapeutics. The key competitive factors that will affect the success of any of our development candidates, if commercialized, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors relative to such competing technologies. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors have products which are better in one or more of these categories. 

Government Regulation and Product Approval 

Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. Any product candidate that we develop must be approved by the FDA before it may be legally marketed in the United States and by the appropriate foreign regulatory agency before it may be legally marketed in foreign countries. 

U.S. drug development process 

In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, debarment, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 

&#8226; 

completion of nonclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to good laboratory practices, or GLP, or other applicable regulations; 

&#8226; 

submission to the FDA of an application for an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 

&#8226; 

performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA&#8217;s regulations commonly referred to as current good clinical practices, or GCPs, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use; 

&#8226; 

submission to the FDA of an NDA for a new drug; 

&#8226; 

satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug is produced to assess compliance with the FDA&#8217;s current good manufacturing practice standards, or cGMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug&#8217;s identity, strength, quality and purity; 

&#8226; 

potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and 

&#8226; 

FDA review and approval of the NDA. 

The lengthy process of seeking required approvals and the continuing need for compliance with applicable statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources and approvals are inherently uncertain.

Before testing any compounds with potential therapeutic value in humans, the drug candidate enters the preclinical study stage. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the drug candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLP. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA imposes a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a drug candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such trial. 

Clinical trials involve the administration of the drug candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor&#8217;s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA&#8217;s regulations comprising the good clinical practices requirements. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and provide oversight for the clinical trial until completed. 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 

&#8226; 

Phase 1. The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing may be conducted in patients. 

&#8226; 

Phase 2. The drug is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule. 

&#8226; 

Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of an NDA. 

Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. 

Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events or any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human subjects. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB&#8217;s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 

Concurrently with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.

U.S. review and approval processes 

The results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. 

In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. 

The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted to determine if they are substantially complete before it accepts them for filing. If the FDA determines that an NDA is incomplete or is found to be non-navigable, the filing may be refused and must be re-submitted for consideration. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA has 10 months from filing in which to complete its initial review of a standard NDA and respond to the applicant, and six months from filing for a priority NDA. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months or longer if the FDA requests or the NDA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission before the PDUFA goal date. 

After the NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product&#8217;s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug or biological products or drug or biological products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the drug approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the NDA without a REMS, if required. 

Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect the sponsor and one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND study requirements. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. 

The NDA review and approval process is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical data or other data and information. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. The FDA will issue a complete response letter if the agency decides not to approve the NDA. The complete response letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either submit new information, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. 

If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, which are designed to further assess a drug safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.

Orphan drug designation 

Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug or biological product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. For example, our RG-012 drug candidate to treat Alport syndrome has received orphan designation in both the United States and Europe. After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 

If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug or biological product as defined by the FDA or if our drug candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor&#8217;s product for the same indication or disease. If a drug or biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. Orphan drug status has similar but not identical benefits in the European Union. 

Expedited development and review programs 

The FDA has several regulatory pathways for expedited development and/or review of products intended to treat serious conditions. These pathways are Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy Designation, accelerated approval, and priority review. These programs do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Products may meet the standards for consideration under one or more of these pathways. 

The Fast Track program is intended to expedite development or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biological products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biological products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. In addition to more frequent meetings with the FDA to discuss the drug&#8217;s development plan and ensure collection of appropriate data needed to support drug approval, the FDA will consider for review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis as sections are completed, based on an agreed schedule, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA. 

&#32;In addition, the FDA has recently established a Breakthrough Therapy designation as part of the FDA Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA, Section 902), which became law in 2012. Breakthrough Therapy designation is a process designed to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition and where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on or more clinically significant endpoint(s). A drug that receives Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA is eligible for all Fast Track designation features, plus intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program beginning as early as Phase 1 and organizational commitment involving senior managers. 

&#32;Products may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug or biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biological product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. Accelerated Approval can be granted with restrictions to the marketing and distribution of the product, and the FDA can withdraw marketing approval if the required post-marketing studies fail to show a clinical benefit or if the Sponsor fails to conduct required post-marketing studies.

Any product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biological product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. 

Post-approval requirements 

Any drug products for which we or our strategic alliance partners receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, promoting drugs for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the drug&#8217;s approved labeling (known as &#8220;off-label use&#8221;), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. Failure to comply with FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, enforcement letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses. 

We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of any products that we may commercialize. Our strategic alliance partners may also utilize third parties for some or all of a product we are developing with such strategic alliance partner. Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the FDA&#8217;s cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved NDA, including withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval. 

The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, risk minimization action plans and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. 

U.S. patent term restoration and marketing exclusivity 

Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our drug candidates, some of our United States patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product&#8217;s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may intend to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA. 

Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain applications of other companies seeking to reference another company&#8217;s NDA. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of 

Table of Contents 

the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued &#8220;Written Request&#8221; for such a trial. 

U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 

The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits certain individuals and entities, including us, from promising, paying, offering to pay, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, directly or indirectly, to obtain or retain business or an improper advantage. The U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, have increased their enforcement efforts with respect to the FCPA. Violations of the FCPA may result in large civil and criminal penalties and could result in an adverse effect on a company&#8217;s reputation, operations, and financial condition. A company may also face collateral consequences such as debarment and the loss of export privileges. 

Federal and state healthcare laws and regulations 

In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal healthcare laws and regulations have been applied to restrict certain business practices in the biopharmaceutical industry in recent years. These laws include the following: 

The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for the purchase, lease, or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally financed healthcare programs. The term &#8220;remuneration&#8221; has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payment, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for statutory exemptions or safe harbor protection. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Several courts have interpreted the statute&#8217;s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated. The reach of the Anti-Kickback Statute was also broadened by the Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively the PPACA, which, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Pursuant to the statutory amendment, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the PPACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act (discussed below) or the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes penalties against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. 

Federal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies&#8217; marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses. 

Many states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and civil False Claims Act, which state laws apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply 

Table of Contents 

regardless of the payor. Also, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. 

Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute&#8217;s safe harbors, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Such a challenge could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, impose on certain types of individuals and entities certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA&#8217;s security standards directly applicable to &#8220;business associates&#8221;-independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney&#8217;s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. 

Further, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, enacted as part of the PPACA, requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children&#8217;s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals. Applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations must also report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by the physicians and their immediate family members. 

Other state laws and regulations may also apply, such as those that: require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry&#8217;s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government; and/or state laws that require manufacturers to report information related to transfers of value to healthcare providers or marketing expenditures. 

If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws or regulations described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including criminal and significant civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion of products from reimbursement under government programs, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our product candidates are ultimately sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals. 

In the United States and foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future results of operations. In particular, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the United States federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs. 

For example, the PPACA includes measures to significantly change the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions of the PPACA of greatest importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry are the following: 

&#8226; 

an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs, that began in 2011; 

&#8226; 

an increase in the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for branded and generic drugs, respectively; 

&#8226; 

a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts to negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer&#8217;s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; 

Table of Contents 

&#8226; 

an extension of manufacturers&#8217; Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations; 

&#8226; 

an expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the Federal Poverty Level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers&#8217; Medicaid rebate liability; 

&#8226; 

an expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program; 

&#8226; 

new requirements created by the Physician Payments Sunshine Act to report certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, as defined in the PPACA and as further described above; 

&#8226; 

a requirement to annually report drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians; 

&#8226; 

an expansion of health care fraud and abuse laws, including the False Claims Act and the Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers, and enhanced penalties for noncompliance; 

&#8226; 

a licensure framework for follow-on biologic products; 

&#8226; 

a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; 

&#8226; 

creation of the Independent Payment Advisory Board, which has authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program that could result in reduced payments for prescription drugs and those recommendations could have the effect of law even if Congress does not act on the recommendations; and 

&#8226; 

establishment of a Center for Medicare Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. 

Many of the details regarding the implementation of the PPACA are yet to be determined, and at this time, it remains unclear the full effect that the PPACA would have on our business. On June 28, 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the PPACA, excepting certain provisions that would have required each state to expand its Medicaid programs or risk losing all of the state&#8217;s Medicaid funding. In addition, under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, Congress temporarily suspended and/or delayed implementation of certain taxes authorized under the PPACA. At this time, it remains unclear whether there will be any further changes made to the PPACA, whether in part or in its entirety. Some states have indicated that they intend to not implement certain sections of the PPACA, and some members of the U.S. Congress are still working to repeal the PPACA. We cannot predict whether these challenges will continue or other proposals will be made or adopted, or what impact these efforts may have on us. 

Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing, and Reimbursement 

Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we or our collaborators receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such drug products. 

In the United States, third-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, government authorities, private managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical drug products and medical services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. Moreover, the process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a drug product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the drug product. A payor&#8217;s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor&#8217;s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. 

The marketability of any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we or our collaborators receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.

Europe / rest of world government regulation 

In addition to regulations in the United States, we and our strategic alliance partners are subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. 

Whether or not we or our collaborators obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the European Union, for example, a clinical trial application, or CTA, must be submitted to each country&#8217;s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country&#8217;s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed. 

The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCPs and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 

To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug or biological product under European Union regulatory systems, we or our strategic alliance partners must submit a marketing authorization application. The application used to file the NDA or BLA in the United States is similar to that required in the European Union, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements. 

For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCPs and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 

If we or our strategic alliance partners fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
