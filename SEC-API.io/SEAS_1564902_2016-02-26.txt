 Item 1. Business

Company Overview

We are a leading theme park and entertainment company providing experiences that matter and inspiring guests to protect animals and the wild wonders of our world. We own or license a portfolio of recognized brands including SeaWorld, Busch Gardens and Sea Rescue. Over our more than 50 year history, we have built a diversified portfolio of 11 destination and regional theme parks that are grouped in key markets across the United States, many of which showcase our one-of-a-kind zoological collection representing more than 800 species of animals. Our theme parks feature a diverse array of rides, shows and other attractions with broad demographic appeal which deliver memorable experiences and a strong value proposition for our guests.

During the year ended December 31, 2015, we hosted approximately 22.5 million guests in our theme parks, including approximately 3.3 million international guests. In the year ended December 31, 2015, we had total revenues of $1.37 billion and net income of $49.1 million.

We generate revenue primarily from selling admission to our theme parks and from purchases of food, merchandise and other spending. For the year ended December 31, 2015, theme park admissions accounted for approximately 62% of our total revenue, and food, merchandise and other revenue accounted for approximately 38% of our total revenue. Over the same period of time, we reported $37.69 in admission per capita (calculated as admissions revenue divided by total attendance) and $23.32 in-park per capita spending (calculated as food, merchandise and other revenue divided by total attendance).

In November 2015, we communicated our roadmap to stabilize our business to drive sustainable growth. This plan encompasses five key points which include (i) providing experiences that matter; (ii) delivering distinct guest experiences that are fun and meaningful; (iii) pursuing organic and strategic revenue growth; (iv) addressing the challenges we face; and (v) financial discipline. The plan is intended to build on our strong business fundamentals by evolving the guest experience to align with consumer preferences for experiences that matter. Through family entertainment and distinct experiences and attractions, we provide our guests an opportunity to explore and learn more about the natural world and the plight of animals in the wild, to be inspired and to act to make a better world. The plan includes a new approach to in-park activities as well as &#8220;turning parks inside out&#8221; by taking our guests behind the scenes to provide a better understanding of our veterinary care and animal rescue operations. Other elements of the plan include implementing a simplified pricing model, targeted capital investments in new attractions across our parks, and an ongoing focus on cost control as part of a larger commitment to overall financial discipline. Additionally, we announced a new resort strategy that will include evaluating opportunities which could include purchasing or developing resort properties in or near some of our parks. 

As one of the world&#8217;s foremost zoological organizations and a global leader in animal welfare, training, husbandry and veterinary care, we are committed to helping protect and preserve the environment and the natural world. For more information, see the &#8220;&#8212;Our Animals&#8221; and &#8220;&#8212;Philanthropy and Community Relations&#8221; sections.

Recent Developments

Regulatory Developments 

On July 16, 2015, Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) offered an amendment to the Fiscal Year 2016 Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies spending bill during consideration of the bill by the full Committee on Appropriations. The amendment directed the U.S. Department of Agriculture&#8217;s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) to issue updated regulations for the display of marine mammals in domestic zoos and aquaria within six months of enactment. While that amendment was not included in the final Fiscal Year 2016 Omnibus Appropriations Bill, APHIS released a proposed rule on February 3, 2016 to amend the Animal Welfare Act regulations concerning the humane handling, care and treatment of marine mammals in captivity (the &#8220;Proposed APHIS Regulations&#8221;). 

On October 8, 2015, the California Coastal Commission approved our plan to build a new killer whale habitat (the &#8220;Blue World Project&#8221;) in San Diego, but attached certain conditions to its approval. Those conditions included, among other things, a prohibition against breeding killer whales or transporting killer whales to or from the habitat. On December 29, 2015, we filed a lawsuit against the California Coastal Commission on the grounds that the California Coastal Commission decision was outside the scope of its authority in imposing such conditions because it does not have jurisdiction over killer whales, which are regulated under federal law. 

On November 16, 2015, Representative Adam Schiff (D-CA) introduced the Orca Responsibility and Care Advancement Act (the &#8220;ORCA Act&#8221;). The bill has been referred to the Natural Resources and Agriculture Committe es. It is unclear whether this bill will be enacted into law, but if enacted, this bill would amend the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 and the Animal Welfare Act to prohibit the breeding, the taking (wild capture), and the import or export of killer whales for the purposes of public display. 

For a discussion of certain risks associated with the Proposed APHIS Regulations, the California Coastal Commission&#8217;s decision, and the ORCA Act, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry&#8212;We are subject to complex federal and state regulations governing the treatment of animals, which can change, and to claims and lawsuits by activist groups before government regulators and in the courts.&#8221;

On February 8, 2016, the San Diego City Council decided to put a proposal on the June 7, 2016 primary ballot for voters to decide whether the city of San Diego should have a higher minimum wage than the $10 per hour required by the State of California. If approved by a simple majority of San Diego voters, the proposal would make the city&#8217;s minimum wage $10.50 as soon as the election results are certified, and then increase it to $11.50 on January 1, 2017. Two years later in January 2019, annual increases to the San Diego minimum wage based on the consumer price index would start to be implemented. For a discussion of certain risks associated with the foregoing proposal, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry&#8212;Increased labor costs and employee health and welfare benefits may negatively impact our operations.&#8221;

Share Repurchase Program and Share Repurchases

In 2014, our Board of Directors (the &#8220;Board&#8221;) authorized the repurchase of up to $250.0 million of our common stock (the &#8220;Share Repurchase Program&#8221;). During 2015, we repurchased a total of 2,413,803 shares of common stock at an average price of $18.62 per share and a total cost of approximately $45.0 million. All of the repurchased common stock was held as treasury shares at December 31, 2015. We have approximately $190.0 million available for future repurchases under the Share Repurchase Program as of December 31, 2015. 

The amount available for future dividend declarations, share repurchases and certain other restricted payments under the covenant restrictions in the debt agreements is currently limited to $120.0 million for fiscal year 2016 based on the current calculation and adjusts at the beginning of each quarter as set forth in Note 11&#8211;Long-Term Debt to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

International Development Strategy

We believe that in addition to the growth potential that exists domestically, our brands can also have significant appeal in certain international markets. We are currently assessing these opportunities while maintaining a conservative and disciplined approach towards the execution of our international development strategy. Thus far, we have identified our international market priorities as well as our international partners within select markets. The market priorities were developed based on a specific set of criteria to ensure we expand our brands into the most attractive markets. On February 17, 2016, we moved to the next phase of our international development strategy with our partner in the Middle East (the &#8220;Middle East Project&#8221;) by (i) extending the exclusive negotiating period under our previously announced Memorandum of Understanding and (ii) executing an Interim Advisory Services Agreement. Pursuant to the Interim Advisory Services Agreement, we will commence certain advisory services pertaining to the planning and design of the Middle East Project, with funding from our partner in the Middle East offsetting our internal expenses. The Middle East Project is subject to, among other things, the parties completing the design development phase of such project and the mutual agreement of definitive documents. For a discussion of certain risks associated with our international development strategy, including the Middle East Project, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry&#8212;We may not realize the benefits of acquisitions or other strategic initiatives.&#8221;

Leadership Changes

On February 18, 2016, Daniel B. Brown announced his decision to retire as Chief Parks Operations Officer of the Company effective as of April 1, 2016. Mr. Brown will remain as an employee of the Company through May 31, 2016, to assist in the transition of his responsibilities. In connection with Mr. Brown&#8217;s retirement, on February 18, 2016, our Board of Directors appointed John Reilly, SeaWorld San Diego Park President, to the position of Chief Parks Operations Officer of the Company effective as of April 1, 2016.

Mr. Reilly, age 47, began his career at Busch Gardens Williamsburg in 1985. Most recently, Mr. Reilly has served as SeaWorld San Diego Park President since October 2010 and, prior to that, as the Busch Gardens Williamsburg Park President. Mr. Reilly is the chairman of the board of directors of the San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce and vice chairman of the board of directors of the San Diego Regional Economic Development Corporation. Mr. Reilly also serves on the board of trustees of the Hubbs-SeaWorld Research Institute and holds a Bachelor of Arts degree from The College of William &#38; Mary. 

O n February 19, 2016, we announced additional changes to our operational management team. As part of the organization changes, Dr. Christopher Dold, the Vice President of Veterinary Services will be promoted to the position of Chief Zoological Officer, eff ective April 1, 2016. Mr. Dold will succeed Brad Andrews who will continue to serve as the Company&#8217;s Zoological Director Emeritus. We also announced the formation of our Resort Development Group and the appointment of Steve Iandolo to the position of Vic e President of Resort Development, effective February 1, 2016. 

Director Not Standing for Re-Election

On February 24, 2016, Joseph P. Baratta, notified the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors (the &#8220;Board&#8221;) that he would not stand for re-election to the Board at the 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Mr. Baratta has served as a director of the Company since 2009. Mr. Baratta advised the Board that his decision not to stand for re-election was not due to a disagreement with the Company on any matters involving the Company&#8217;s operations, policies or practices. Mr. Baratta is expected to continue to serve as a director until the earlier of (i) the Board&#8217;s appointment of Mr. Baratta&#8217;s successor or (ii) the expiration of his current three-year term, which will end effective upon the election of directors at the Company&#8217;s 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 

Other Matters

In January 2016, we made a decision to remove deep-water lifting floors from the killer whale habitats at each of our three SeaWorld theme parks. The deep-water lifting floors were intended as another safety tool for conducting in-water training in the deeper pools. The lifting floors located in the medical pools, where our killer whale in-water training currently takes place, will not be affected. That training will continue as an essential part of our overall safety program. Having safely and successfully conducted in-water training in the medical pools for almost 4 years, our safety and zoological professionals determined that the deep-water lifting floors in the deeper pools are no longer needed. This change will provide more space for the animals, and increase the time that the deep-water pool is available by eliminating downtime for maintenance and cleaning. As a result, in the first half of 2016, we expect to record approximately $33.0 million of accelerated depreciation related to the disposal of these lifting floors. 

On February 22, 2016, the Board declared a cash dividend of $0.21 per share to all common stockholders of record at the close of business on March 14, 2016, which will be paid on April 1, 2016. Based on this dividend declaration, certain performance-vesting restricted shares (the &#8220;2.25x Performance Restricted shares&#8221;) held by some of our equity plan participants will vest on April 1, 2016. We expect to recognize approximately $28.0 million of equity compensation expense and record approximately $3.4 million of accumulated dividends related to these 2.25x Performance Restricted shares during the first quarter of 2016. See Note 18&#8211;Equity-Based Compensation to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Our Competitive Strengths

&#160;

&#183; 

Brands That Consumers Know and Love. We believe our brands attract and appeal to guests from around the world. We use our brands and intellectual property and the work we do to care for animals to increase awareness of our theme parks, drive attendance to our theme parks and create &#8220;out-of-park&#8221; experiences for our guests as a way to connect with them before they visit our theme parks and to stay connected with them after their visit. Such experiences include various media and consumer product offerings, including websites, advertisements and media programming, toys, books, apparel and technology accessories. For example, we have developed iPhone and Android smartphone applications for our SeaWorld, Busch Gardens and Sesame Place theme parks, which offer GPS navigation through the theme parks and interactive theme park maps that show the nearest dining locations, gift shops and ATMs and provide real-time updates on wait times for rides. 

We have also leveraged our brands into media, entertainment and consumer products. We produce two educational and entertaining television shows that highlight our rescue and rehabilitation and animal care efforts, Sea Rescue and The Wildlife Docs. Sea Rescue is a Saturday morning television show airing on the ABC Network featuring our ongoing work to rescue injured animals in coordination with various government agencies and other rescue organizations. Since its debut in 2012 through December 2015, on a cumulative basis, Sea Rescue has attracted over 281 million viewers and has been rated as the number one show in its timeslot in a number of major U.S. markets. In 2014, Sea Rescue was nominated for a Daytime Emmy &#174; Award in the category of Outstanding Children&#8217;s Series by the National Academy of Television Arts &#38; Sciences. The Wildlife Docs, which also airs on the ABC Network on Saturday mornings, centers on the day-to-day activities at our Animal Care Center at Busch Gardens Tampa. Since its debut in October 2013 through December 2015, on a cumulative basis, The Wildlife Docs has attracted over 168 million viewers and in 2015, The Wildlife Docs was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award in the category of Outstanding Children&#8217;s Series by the National Academy of Television Arts &#38; Sciences. In 2015, both Sea Rescue and The Wildlife Docs were each presented with a silver honor from the Parents' Choice Award &#174; , a nonprofit program created to recognize quality children&#8217;s media. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Differentiated Theme Parks. We own and operate 11 theme parks, including four of the top 20 theme parks and three of the top 10 water parks in North America as measured by attendance, according to the TEA/AECOM Report. Our theme parks are beautifully themed and deliver high-quality entertainment, aesthetic appe al, shopping and dining and have won numerous awards, including the Amusement Today Golden Ticket Award for Best Landscaping. Our theme parks feature eight of the 50 highest rated steel roller coasters in the world, led by Apollo&#8217;s Chariot, the #6 rated st eel roller coaster in the world according to the 2015 Amusement Today Annual Survey, and have won the top three spots in the Amusement Today annual Golden Ticket Award for Best Marine Life Park since the award&#8217;s inception in 2006 through 2014 and the top f our spots in 2015. We have over 600 attractions that appeal to guests of all ages, including 97 animal habitats, 117 shows and 194 rides. In addition, we have over 300 restaurants and specialty shops. Our theme parks appeal to the entire family and offer a broad range of experiences, ranging from emotional and educational animal encounters to thrilling rides and exciting shows. As a result of these distinctive offerings, our guest surveys routinely report very high &#8220;Overall Satisfaction&#8221; scores, with 96% of respondents in 2015 ranking their experience good or excellent. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Diversified Business Portfolio. Our portfolio of theme parks is diversified in a number of important respects. Our theme parks are located in geographic clusters across the United States, which helps protect us from the impact of localized events. Each theme park showcases a different mix of zoological, thrill-oriented and family friendly attractions. This varied portfolio of entertainment offerings attracts guests from a broad range of demographics and geographies. Our theme parks appeal to both regional and destination guests, which provide us with a diversified attendance base while allowing us to benefit from improvements in macroeconomic conditions, including increased consumer spending and international travel. 

&#160;

&#183; 

One of the World&#8217;s Largest Zoological Collections. We believe we are attractively positioned in the industry due to our ability to present our animals in a differentiated and interactive manner. We believe we have one of the world&#8217;s largest zoological collections, representing more than 800 species of animals. We have the largest group of killer whales, also known as orcas, in human care. We have not collected a killer whale from the wild in almost 40 years. More than 80% of our marine mammals were born in human care. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Strong Competitive Position. Our competitive position is enhanced by the combination of our powerful brands, extensive zoological collection and expertise and attractive in-park assets located on valuable real estate. Our zoological collection and expertise, which have evolved over our more than five decades of caring for animals, would be very difficult and expensive to replicate. We have made extensive investments in new attractions and infrastructure and we believe that our theme parks are well capitalized. The limited supply of real estate suitable for theme park development coupled with high initial capital investment, long development lead-times and zoning and other land use restrictions constrain the number of large theme parks that can be constructed. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Proven and Experienced Management Team and Employees with Specialized Animal Expertise. Our senior management team, led by Joel Manby, our President and Chief Executive Officer, includes some of the most experienced theme park executives in the world, with an average tenure of approximately 28 years in the industry, as of December 31, 2015. The management team is comprised of highly skilled and dedicated professionals with wide ranging experience in theme park operations, zoological operations, product development, business development, marketing and finance. In addition, we are one of the world&#8217;s foremost zoological organizations with approximately 1,500 employees dedicated to animal welfare, training, husbandry and veterinary care. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Proximity of Complementary Theme Parks. Our theme parks are grouped in key locations near large population centers across the United States, which allows us to realize revenue and operating expense efficiencies. Having complementary theme parks located within close proximity to each other also enables us to cross market and offer bundled ticket and travel packages. In addition, closely located theme parks provide operating efficiencies including sales, marketing, procurement and administrative synergies as overhead expenses are shared among the theme parks within each region. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Strong Cash Flow Generation. Our disciplined approach to capital expenditures and working capital management enables us to generate strong and recurring cash flow. Five of our 11 theme parks are open year-round, reducing our seasonal cash flow volatility. In addition, we have substantial tax assets, which we expect to be available to defer a portion of our cash tax burden going forward. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Care for Our Community and the Natural World. We are committed to the communities in which our theme parks are located and focus our philanthropic efforts in three areas: animal preservation and stewardship; youth development and education; and sustainable community projects and programs that help cr eate solutions for environmental sustainability concerns and address local socio-economic issues . Our theme parks inspire and educate children and guests of all ages through experiences that are fun and meaningful. We also partner with charities across the country whose values and missions are aligned with our own by providing financial support, in-kind resources, strategic guidance, and/or hands-on volunteer work. For example, we are the primary supporter and corporate member of the SeaWorld &#38; Busch Gar dens Conservation Fund, a non-profit conservation foundation, which makes grants to wildlife research and conservation projects that protect wildlife and wild places worldwide. In addition, we operate one of the world&#8217;s most respected rescue programs for i ll and injured marine animals, in collaboration with federal, state and local governments, and other members of accredited stranding networks, among others, with the goal of rehabilitating and returning them to the wild. For more than five decades, our ani mal experts have helped more than 27,000 ill, injured, orphaned and abandoned animals. We are committed to rescue, research and education and invest millions annually in these efforts. In 2014, the SeaWorld Animal Rescue Teams based in San Diego, Orlando and San Antonio were presented the Amusement Today 2014 Persons of the Year Award for their tireless dedication to animal welfare. 

Our Theme Parks

Our legacy started in 1959 with the opening of our first Busch Gardens theme park in Tampa, Florida. Since then, we have built our portfolio of strong brands and have strategically expanded our portfolio of theme parks across five states on approximately 2,000 acres of owned land and 190 acres of leased land in San Diego.

Our theme parks offer guests a variety of exhilarating experiences, from animal encounters that invite exploration and appreciation of the natural world, to thrilling rides and spectacular shows. Our theme parks are beautifully themed venues that are consistently recognized among the top theme parks in the world and rank among the most highly attended in the industry. In 2014, SeaWorld Orlando ranked among the top 25 theme parks worldwide based on attendance, and Aquatica Orlando ranked among the top 20 water parks worldwide based on attendance, according to the TEA/AECOM Report. In the 2015 Trip Advisor Travelers&#8217; Choice TM Awards, 7 of our 11 theme parks were ranked among the top 25 amusement parks or water parks in the United States. In addition, Discovery Cove was ranked the #1 amusement park in the world in the 2013 and 2014 Trip Advisor Travelers&#8217; Choice Awards and was ranked the #2 amusement park in the world in the 2015 Trip Advisor Travelers&#8217; Choice Awards. We generally locate our theme parks in geographic clusters, which improve our ability to serve guests by providing them with a varied, comprehensive vacation experience and valuable multi-park pricing packages, as well as improving our operating efficiency through shared overhead costs. Our portfolio of branded theme parks includes the following names:

&#183;

We also offer our guests numerous animal encounters, including the opportunity to work with trainers and feed marine animals, as well as themed thrill rides and theatrical shows that creatively incorporate our one-of-kind zoological collection. Collectively, our SeaWorld theme parks have won the top three spots in the Amusement Today annual Golden Ticket Award for Best Marine Life Park since the award&#8217;s inception in 2006 through 2014, and among the top four spots in 2015, with our Discovery Cove park ranking #3.

In addition, we have introduced Sesame Street brands in our other theme parks through Sesame Street-themed rides, shows, children&#8217;s play areas and merchand ise. Our rights to the Sesame Street brand in the United States extend through 2021.

Water Country USA . Located on 222 acres, Virginia&#8217;s largest family water park, Water Country USA, features state-of-the-art water rides and attractions, all set to a 1950s and 1960s surf theme. Water Country USA is the sixth most attended water park in North America according to the TEA/AECOM Report and features a 23,000 square-foot wave pool, a science fiction themed interactive children&#8217;s play area, kid-sized water slides, live shows and several other attractions. One of its newest attractions is Colossal Curl, an action packed family thrill ride that sends riders down a nearly 550 foot water slide. 

&#183; 

Adventure Island. Located adjacent to Busch Gardens Tampa, Adventure Island is a 56 acre water park that is filled with water rides, dining and other attractions that incorporate a Key West theme. The theme park is the seventh most attended water park in North America according to the TEA/AECOM Report and features a family-friendly wave pool and children&#8217;s water playground that appeal to its core constituency, local families with young children. Its newest water slide, Colossal Curl, opened in 2015 and is modeled after the Colossal Curl ride at Water Country USA.

The total number of animal habitats, rides, shows, events, distinctive experiences and play areas in our theme park portfolio varies seasonally.

Capital Improvements

We make annual targeted investments to support our existing theme park facilities and attractions, as well as enable the development of new theme park attractions and infrastructure. Maintaining and improving our theme parks, as well as opening new attractions, is critical to remain competitive, grow revenue and increase our guests&#8217; length of stay. Our theme parks feature a variety of attractions for our guests. Some of the new attractions in 2015 included:

&#160;

&#183; 

Tempesto (Busch Gardens Williamsburg): A new thrill roller coaster that features three launch experiences and races riders into tight turns at 63 miles per hour and a complete inversion 154 feet in the air. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Pacific Point Preserve (SeaWorld San Antonio): A new sea lion habitat which includes dining and merchandise venues. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Colossal Curl (Adventure Island): An action packed family thrill water slide that combines funnel and wave elements to give riders a sense of weightlessness. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Sea Lion High (SeaWorld Orlando and SeaWorld San Antonio): A new sea lion comedy show featuring sea lions, walruses and otters which takes place in an aquatic-themed high school. 

During 2016, we will open a new roller coaster, Mako, at our SeaWorld Orlando theme park and a family roller coaster, Cobra&#8217;s Curse, at our Busch Gardens Tampa theme park. In San Antonio, we will open Discovery Point at our SeaWorld San Antonio theme park, which will include a new dolphin habitat and an underwater viewing area. Discovery Point will also offer guests an opportunity to interact and swim with the dolphins. In addition, in 2016, Aquatica San Antonio will be converted into a stand-alone, separate admission park that guests can access through an independent gate without the need to purchase admission to SeaWorld San Antonio.

In 2014 we announced a plan to build new killer whale habitats at all three of our SeaWorld locations (the &#8220;Blue World Project&#8221;). The San Diego environment was expected to open to the public in 2018 with a new killer whale habitat to possibly follow at SeaWorld Orlando and SeaWorld San Antonio based on our experience in San Diego. The total investment was expected to be approximately $100.0 million per park by the project&#8217;s completion. On October 8, 2015, the California Coastal Commission approved our plan to build the Blue World Project in San Diego, but attached certain conditions to its approval. Those conditions included, among other things, a prohibition against breeding killer whales or transporting killer whales to or from the habitat. On December 29, 2015, we filed a lawsuit against the California Coastal Commission on the grounds that the California Coastal Commission decision was outside the scope of its authority in imposing such conditions because it does not have jurisdiction over killer whales, which are regulated under federal law. Due to the pending lawsuit and the uncertain legislative and regulatory environment in California, we are currently reevaluating our plans with respect to the scope of the Blue World Project and we may ultimately decide not to pursue the Blue World Project.

Maintenance and Inspection

Safety is of utmost importance to us. Maintenance at our theme parks is a key component of safety and guest service and includes two areas of focus: (i) facilities and infrastructure and (ii) rides and attractions. Facilities and infrastructure maintenance consists of all functions associated with upkeep, repair, preventative maintenance, code compliance and improvement of theme park infrastructure. This area is staffed with a combination of external contractors/suppliers and our employees.

Rides and attractions maintenance represents all functions dedicated to the inspec tion, upkeep, repair and testing of guest experiences, particularly rides. Rides and attractions maintenance is also staffed with a combination of external suppliers, inspectors and our employees, who work to assure that ride experiences are operating with in the manufacturer&#8217;s criteria and that maintenance is conducted according to internal standards, industry best practice and standards (such as ASTM International), state or jurisdictional requirements, as well as the ride designer or manufacturer&#8217;s specif ications. All ride maintenance personnel are trained to perform their duties according to internal training processes, in addition to recognized industry certification programs for maintenance leadership. Every ride at our theme parks is inspected regularl y, according to daily, weekly, monthly and annual schedules, by both park maintenance experts and external consultants. Additionally, all rides are inspected daily by maintenance personnel before use by guests to ensure proper and safe operation. 

A networked enterprise software system is used to plan and track various maintenance activities, in order to schedule and request work, track completion progress and manage costs of parts and materials.

Our Animals

We are one of the world&#8217;s foremost zoological organizations with approximately 1,500 employees dedicated to animal welfare, training, husbandry and veterinary care. Our mission is to provide experiences that matter, inspire guests through education and entertainment and to care for and protect animals and the wild wonders of our world. We believe we have one of the largest zoological collections in the world, representing more than 800 species of animals. Animals in our care include certain endangered or threatened species such as the cheetah, Bengal tiger, West Indian manatee, black rhinoceros and polar bear.

The well-being of the animals in our care is a top priority. Our veterinarians and zoological staff have been caring for animals for more than five decades, and our expertise is a resource for zoos, aquariums and conservation organizations worldwide. Our expertise and innovation in animal husbandry have led to many advances in the care of species in zoological facilities and in the conservation of wild populations. More than 80% of the marine mammals living in our zoological theme parks were born in human care. 

We have made many pioneering contributions to the zoological community. Until the birth of our first orca calf in 1985, no zoological institution had successfully bred orcas. We have not collected a killer whale from the wild in almost 40 years. We care for the largest orca population in zoological facilities worldwide and today have the most genetically diverse orca and dolphin population in our history. Six of our orcas are presently on loan to a third party pursuant to an agreement entered into in February 2004. Pursuant to this agreement, we receive an annual fee, which is not material to our results of operations. In addition to generating incremental revenue for our business, the agreement provides for additional housing capacity for our orcas. The agreement expires in 2031 and is renewable at the option of the parties.

Our commitment to animals also extends beyond our theme parks and throughout the world. We actively participate in species conservation and rescue efforts as discussed in &#8220;&#8212;Conservation Efforts&#8221; and &#8220;&#8212;Philanthropy and Community Relations&#8221; below.

Our Products and Services

Admission Tickets

We generate most of our revenue from selling admission to our theme parks. For the year ended December 31, 2015, theme park admissions accounted for approximately 62% of our revenue. We engage with travel agents, ticket resellers and travel agencies, and directly with our guests through our websites and social media, to promote advanced sales and provide guest convenience and ease of entry. Approximately 41% of our admission ticket purchases are made online.

Guests who visit our theme parks have the option of purchasing multiple types of admission tickets, from single and multi-day tickets to season and annual passes. We also offer a Fun Card at select theme parks that allows multiple visits throughout a calendar year. In addition, visitors can purchase vacation packages with preferred hotels, behind-the-scenes tours, specialty dining packages and front of the line &#8220;Quick Queue&#8221; access to enhance their experience.

We also participate in joint programs that are designed to provide visitors to Florida and Southern California with flexibility and value in creating their vacation itineraries. We have partnered with several theme parks and attractions to create joint ticket products which allow guests to purchase a ticket providing access to our theme parks as well as other local area attractions. We also partner with independent third parties who sell tickets and/or packages to our theme parks.

We actively run promotions and campaigns to maximize revenue and manage capacity. Recently, we introduced a simplified pricing framework to reduce complexity in the number of ticket offerings, encourage advan ced purchases and provide products that are more flexible for our guests to use. We have also launched a new website portal to give guests a balanced look at our park offerings with the ability to choose their experience, such as upgrades to include multi ple parks, additional days, dining experiences, tours or animal interactions. 

Theme Park Operations

Our theme park operations strive to deliver a high level of safety, security, guest service and cleanliness at our theme parks. The theme park operations team manages the planning and execution of the overall theme park experience on a daily basis, which is comprised of rides, shows and attractions operations, safety, security, environmental, water park and guest arrival services (including parking, tolls, admissions, guest relations, entry and exit). Our theme park operations team identifies and leverages internal best practices across all of our theme parks in order to create a seamless and enjoyable guest experience throughout the entire visit.

Culinary Offerings

We strive to deliver a variety of high quality, creative and memorable culinary experiences to our guests. Our culinary operations are strategically organized into five key guest-oriented disciplines designed to drive in-park per capita spending: restaurants, catering, carts and kiosks, specialty snacks and vending. Our culinary team focuses on providing creative menu offerings and ways to deliver those offerings that appeal to our diverse guest base.

We offer a variety of dining programs that provide quality food and great value to our guests and drive incremental revenues. While our menu offerings have broad appeal, they also cater to guests who desire healthy options and those with special allergy-related needs. Our successful all-day-dining program delivers convenience and value to our guests with numerous restaurant choices for one price. We also offer creative immersive dining experiences that allow guests to dine up-close with our animals and characters. Our commitment to care for the natural world extends to the food that we serve. Some of our menus feature sustainable, organic, seasonal and locally grown ingredients that aim to minimize environmental impacts to animals and their habitats. In addition, through culinary supply chain management initiatives, we are well-positioned to take advantage of changing economic and market conditions.

Merchandise

We offer guests the opportunity to capture memories through our products and services, including through traditional retail shops, game venues and customized photos and videos. We make a focused effort to leverage the emotional connection of the theme park experiences, capitalize on trends and optimize brand alignment with our merchandise product offerings.

We operate nearly 300 specialty retail shops at our theme parks, and our retail business encompasses the entire value chain, from product design to production and sourcing, importing and logistics and visual presentation up to the point of sale. Our products encompass more than 60,000 unique SKUs. Whether a plush toy, a stylish apparel item showcasing an attraction, a commemorative memento or a tote to carry it all, we carry items both big and small so that every guest has a chance to find that perfect item that is a reminder of the memories made in our theme parks.

Guests can purchase visual memories to commemorate their experience with us through real time photo and video technologies. Whether on a traditional ride or during one of our numerous animal experiences, we capture the moment through the use of state-of-the-art processes and technologies. We continue to explore and develop our photo and retail business with advanced offerings to extend beyond the visit with online opportunities to further create customized products. An example is PhotoKey through which guests can instantly view and share all of their photos using the PhotoKey app available on their smartphone devices.

In-park games span from traditional theme park operations to arcade experiences, all with the goal of creating positive family experiences for guests of every age. Our merchandise teams also focus on making a visit to our theme parks easy, convenient and comfortable. This includes offering lockers or service vehicle rentals such as strollers, electric personal carts and wheelchairs.

Licensing, Consumer Products and Media Enterprises

To capitalize on our popular brands, we leverage content through media and licensing arrangements. Our original television series, Sea Rescue and The Wildlife Docs, showcase our rescue and rehabilitation efforts. These Emmy-nominated programs are broadcast nationally through the ABC network, and have been renewed for an additional two seasons, through the summer of 2018. We also developed licensed consumer products to drive consumer sales through retail channels beyond our theme parks. Our licensed consumer product offerings currently include toys, games, books, apparel, DVD&#8217;s and technology accessories, among other product types.

In addition, we expanded our brand appeal through strategic alliances with well-known external brands, including Sesame Street and The Polar Express. In 2015, we acquired the license to incorporate Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer into our park holiday programs under a new agreement with Character Arts Creations, LLC. We als o released original songs and soundtracks from our theme parks and media enterprises for sale on digital music channels. 

While currently these products do not represent a material percentage of our revenue, we believe by leveraging our brands and our intellectual property through media and consumer products, we will create new revenue streams and enhance the value of our brands through greater brand visibility, consumer awareness and increased consumer loyalty.

Group Events and Conventions

We host a variety of different group events, meetings and conventions at our theme parks both during the day and at night. Our venues offer indoor and outdoor space for meetings, special events, entertainment shows, picnics, teambuilding events, group tours and special group ticket packages. Park buy-outs allow groups to enjoy exclusive itineraries, including meetings and shows, up-close encounters with animals and behind the scenes tours. Each of our theme parks offers attractive venues, such as SeaWorld Orlando&#8217;s Ports of Call, a 70,000 square foot dedicated special events complex and banquet facility at the theme park, which is themed as a nautical wharf-side warehouse district, complete with two miniature submarines. The facility offers more than 30,000 square feet of dining space, with a ballroom that provides seating for more than 750 guests and a larger outdoor garden reception area that can accommodate additional guests. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we hosted over 1,600 group events at our theme parks across the country.

Corporate Sponsorships and Strategic Alliances

We seek to secure long-term corporate sponsorships and strategic alliances with leading companies and brands that share our core values, deliver significant brand value and influence and drive mutual business gains. We identify prospective corporate sponsors based on their industry and industry-leading position, and we select them based on their ability to deliver impactful value to our theme parks and our brands, as well as to consumer products and various entertainment platforms. Our corporate sponsors contribute to us in a multitude of ways, such as through direct marketing, advertising, media exposure and licensing opportunities, as well as through contributions to the non-profit SeaWorld &#38; Busch Gardens Conservation Fund.

Our Corporate Culture

Our corporate culture is built on our mission to provide experiences that matter and inspire guests to protect animals and the wild wonders of our world. Our management team and our employees, referred to as ambassadors, are passionate about connecting people to nature and animals and are committed to working in a socially responsible and environmentally sustainable manner. We teach our ambassadors to be welcoming, friendly and attentive and to create an environment that allows our guests to build lasting memories with their family and friends. Our consumer-oriented corporate culture is integral to our organization and the cornerstone of our success.

Conservation Efforts

We contribute to species conservation, wildlife rescue, education and environmental stewardship programs around the world. Through the SeaWorld &#38; Busch Gardens Conservation Fund, a non-profit organization, we support wildlife research, habitat protection, animal rescue and conservation education. We also work with and support conservation-related organizations, including the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation and American Humane Association and contribute funds in support of efforts to ensure the sustainability of animal species in the wild. Some of our animals also serve as animal ambassadors in helping raise awareness for species in danger through numerous national media and public appearances. Through our theme parks&#8217; up-close animal encounters, educational exhibits and innovative entertainment, we strive to inspire each guest who visits one of our parks to care for and conserve the natural world.

In addition, we operate one of the world&#8217;s most respected rescue programs for ill and injured marine animals, in collaboration with federal, state and local governments, and other members of accredited stranding networks, among others, with the goal of rehabilitating and returning them to the wild. For more than five decades, our animal experts have helped more than 27,000 ill, injured, orphaned and abandoned animals. We are committed to rescue, rehabilitation, research and education and invest significant amounts annually in these efforts.

Our commitment to research and conservation also has led to advances in the care of animals in zo ological facilities and in conserving wild populations. We have pioneered new ways to rehabilitate animals in need. For example, we helped to create nutritional formulas and custom nursing bottles to hand-feed orphaned animals and developed techniques to h elp save sea turtles with cracked shells, created prosthetic beaks for injured birds and outfitted injured manatees with an &#8220;animal wetsuit&#8221; allowing them to stay afloat and warm. 

Philanthropy and Community Relations

We are committed to the communities in which our theme parks are located and focus our philanthropic efforts on three areas: animal preservation and stewardship; youth development and education; and sustainable community projects and programs that help create solutions for environmental sustainability concerns and address local socio-economic issues. We also partner with charities across the country whose values and missions are aligned with our own by providing financial support, in-kind resources, strategic guidance, and/or hands-on volunteer work.

Our theme parks inspire and educate children and guests of all ages by providing experiences that matter. Our philanthropic efforts reflect this commitment through educational outreach visits to inner-city schools and hosting &#8220;special wish&#8221; children to enjoy theme parks. Plus, through our SeaWorld Cares and Busch Gardens Cares initiatives, our employees are actively involved in volunteer activities such as beach and river cleanup efforts.

Finally, a key component of our community outreach is our long-term commitment to honoring the service of members of the U.S. military and acknowledging the sacrifices that their families have made. Currently, we offer a free admission program to the majority of our theme parks, which provided approximately 500,000 free single day passes to active military personnel and their families for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Our Guests and Customers

Our theme parks are located near a number of large metropolitan areas, with a total population of over 61 million people located within 150 miles of our parks. Additionally, because our theme parks are divided between regional and destination theme parks, our guests include local visitors, non-local domestic visitors and international tourists. Our theme parks are entertainment venues and have broad demographic appeal. For the year ended December 31, 2015, families comprised 51% of our attendance with an average party size of 3.8 people. 

Seasonality

The theme park industry is seasonal in nature. Historically, we generate the highest revenues in the second and third quarters of each year, in part because six of our theme parks are only open for a portion of the year. Approximately two-thirds of the Company&#8217;s attendance and revenues are generated in the second and third quarters of the year. The percent mix of revenues by quarter is relatively constant each year, but revenues can shift between the first and second quarters due to the timing of Easter and spring break holidays and between the first and fourth quarters due to the timing of Christmas and New Year. Even for our five theme parks open year-round, attendance patterns have significant seasonality, driven by holidays, school vacations and weather conditions. One of our goals is to continue to generate cash flow throughout the year to maximize profitability and minimize the effects of seasonality, in particular at our theme parks that are open year-round. In recent years, we have begun to encourage attendance during non-peak times by offering a variety of seasonal programs and events, such as shows for kids, special concert series, and Halloween and Christmas events. In addition, during seasonally slow times, operating costs are controlled by reducing operating hours and show schedules. Employment levels required for peak operations are met largely through part-time and seasonal hiring.

Marketing

Our marketing and sales efforts are focused on generating profitable attendance, in-park per capita spending and building the value of our brands. Through advertising, including park specific messages, promotions, retail and corporate partners, digital platforms, public relations and sales initiatives, we drive awareness of and intent to visit our theme parks, attendance and higher in-park per capita spending on an international, national and regional level. Our attractive destination locations and strategy of grouping parks together creates high appeal for multi-day visits. Our strategic priorities include: (i) emphasizing brand distinction, (ii) improving guest engagement and loyalty, (iii) driving maximum revenue and (iv) broadening appeal (among multi-cultural consumers, kids and domestic markets). 

Intellectual Property 

Our business is affected by our ability to protect against infringement of our intellectual property, including our trademarks, service marks, domain names, copyrights and other proprietary rights. Important intellectual property includes rights in names, logos, character likenesses, theme park attractions, content of television programs and systems related to the study and care of certain of our animals. In addition, we are party to key license agreements as licensee, including our agreements with Sesame Workshop and ABI as discussed below. To protect our intellectual property rights, we rely upon a combination of trademark, copyright, trade secret and unfair competition laws of the United States and other countries, as well as contract provisions and third-party policies and procedures governing internet/domain name registrations.

Busch Gardens License Agreement

Our subsidiary, SeaWorld Parks &#38; Entertainment LLC, is a party to a trademark license agreement with ABI, which governs our use of the Busch Gardens name and logo. Under the license agreement, ABI granted to us a perpetual, exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use the Busch Gardens trademark and certain related domain names in connection with the operation, marketing, promotion and advertising of our theme parks, as well as in connection with the production, use, distribution and sale of merchandise sold in connection with such theme parks.

The license extends to our Busch Gardens theme parks located in Williamsburg, Virginia and Tampa, Florida, and may also include any amusement or theme park anywhere in the world that we acquire, build or rebrand with the Busch Gardens name in the future, subject to certain conditions. ABI may not assign, transfer or sell the Busch Gardens mark without first granting us a reasonable right of first refusal to purchase such mark.

We have agreed to indemnify ABI from and against third party claims and losses arising out of or in connection with the operation of the theme parks and the related marketing or promotion thereof, any merchandise branded with the licensed marks and the infringement of a third party&#8217;s intellectual property. We are required to carry certain insurance coverage throughout the term of the license.

The license agreement can be terminated by ABI under certain limited circumstances, including in connection with certain types of change of control of SeaWorld Parks &#38; Entertainment LLC.

Sesame Licenses

Sesame Place Theme Park License Agreements

Our subsidiary, SeaWorld Parks &#38; Entertainment LLC (f/k/a SPI, Inc.), is a party to a license agreement with Sesame Workshop (f/k/a Children&#8217;s Television Workshop). Under the license agreement, we were granted the right to use titles, marks, names, and characters from the Sesame Street and The Electric Company television series, as well as certain characters and elements created by Muppets Inc. for the Sesame Street series, related marketing materials, and the Sesame Place design trademark in connection with the children&#8217;s play parks in Langhorne, Pennsylvania. We pay specified royalties based on receipts from business conducted on the premises of the theme park to Sesame Workshop. We are required to include Sesame Workshop and Muppets Inc. as insured parties under any relevant insurance policies, and have agreed to indemnify Sesame Workshop from and against certain claims and expenses arising out of any personal or property injury at our Sesame Place park or breach of the license agreement. The license agreement can be terminated by Sesame Workshop under certain circumstances, including in connection with a specified change of control of SeaWorld Parks &#38; Entertainment LLC, specified uncured breaches of the license agreement or specified bankruptcy events.

Under a separate agreement, Sesame Workshop granted SeaWorld Parks &#38; Entertainment LLC a license to develop, manufacture, and produce in the United States (and, in some circumstances, elsewhere in the world) and to distribute and sell at Sesame Place branded play parks, certain products bearing Sesame Place, Sesame Street, and Sesame Street Muppet characters, likenesses, logos, marks and materials, including apparel, flags, bags, mugs, buttons, pens, wristbands and other miscellaneous products. The parties have agreed to indemnify each other from and against claims and expenses in connection with our respective performance under the license agreement and any breach thereof. Sesame Workshop may terminate the license under certain circumstances, including our uncured breach or bankruptcy.

Both agreements are scheduled to remain in effect until December 31, 2021.

Multi-Park License 

Under a separate agreement, Sesame Workshop granted SeaWorld Parks &#38; Entertainment LLC rights to use the Sesame Place and Sesame Workshop names and logos, certain Sesame Street characters (including Elmo, Big Bird and Cookie Monster), and granted a limited term right of first negotiation to utilize characters from other Sesame Workshop television series at SeaWorld San Diego, SeaWorld San Antonio, SeaWorld Orlando, and our two Busch Gardens theme parks. Within these theme parks we have rights to use the marks and characters in connection with Sesame Street themed attractions, Sesame Street shows and character appearances, and the marketing, advertising and promotion of the theme parks.

Sesame Workshop has also granted us the right to develop, manufacture, distribute and sell products within our SeaWorld and Busch Gardens theme parks, at other parks in the United States that are owned or operated by SeaWorld Parks &#38; Entertainment LLC, its subsidiaries or affiliated entities, and through online stores on websites for our parks.

Pursuant to this agreement we pay a specified annual license fee, as well as a specified royalty based on revenues earned in connection with sales of licensed products, all food and beverage items utilizing the licensed elements and any events utilizing such elements if a separate fee is paid for such event.

The parties have agreed to indemnify each other from and against third party claims and expenses arising from their respective performance under the agreement or any breach thereof. Sesame Workshop has the right to terminate the agreement under certain limited circumstances, including a change of control of SeaWorld Parks &#38; Entertainment LLC, SeaWorld Parks &#38; Entertainment LLC&#8217;s bankruptcy or uncured breach of the agreement, or the termination of the license agreement regarding our Sesame Place theme park.

The agreement is scheduled to remain in effect until December 31, 2021 unless earlier terminated or extended.

Our Industry

We believe that the theme park industry is an attractive sector characterized by a proven business model that generates significant cash flow and has avenues for growth. Theme parks offer a strong consumer value proposition, particularly when compared to other forms of out-of-home entertainment such as concerts, sporting events, cruises and movies. As a result, theme parks attract a broad range of guests and generally exhibit strong operating margin across regions, operators, park types and macroeconomic conditions.

According to the IBISWorld Report, the U.S. amusement park industry is comprised of a large number of venues ranging from a small group of high attendance, heavily themed destination theme parks to a large group of lower attendance local theme parks and family entertainment centers. According to the TEA/AECOM Report, the United States is the largest theme park market in the world with five of the ten largest theme park operators and 9 of the 25 most-visited theme parks in the world. In 2015, the U.S. amusement park industry was expected to generate approximately $14.8 billion in revenues, according to the IBISWorld Report.

Competition

Our theme parks and other product and entertainment offerings compete directly for discretionary spending with other destination and regional theme parks and water and amusement parks and indirectly with other types of recreational facilities and forms of entertainment, including movies, home entertainment options, sports attractions, restaurants and vacation travel. Principal direct competitors of our theme parks include theme parks operated by The Walt Disney Company, Universal Studios, Six Flags, Cedar Fair, Merlin Entertainments and Hershey Entertainment and Resorts Company. Our highly differentiated products provide a value proposition and a complementary experience to those offered by fantasy-themed Disney and Universal parks. In addition, we benefit from the significant capital investments made in developing the tourism industry in the Orlando area. The Orlando theme park market is extremely competitive, with a high concentration of theme parks operated by several companies.

Competition is based on multiple factors including location, price, the originality and perceived quality of the rides and attractions, the atmosphere and cleanliness of the theme park, the quality of food and entertainment, weather conditions, ease of travel to the theme park (including direct flights by major airlines), and availability and cost of transportation to a theme park. We believe we can compete effectively, due to our strong brand recognition, unique and extensive zoological collection, targeted capital investments and valuable real estate. Additionally, we believe that our theme parks feature a sufficient quality and variety of rides and attractions, educational and interactive experiences, merchandise locations, restaurants and family orientation to make them highly competitive with other destination and regional theme parks, as well as other forms of entertainment.

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we employed approximately 5,000 full-time employees and approximately 6,300 part-time employees. During our peak operating season in 2015, we employed approximately 14,200 seasonal employees, many of whom are high school and college students. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we consider our employee relations to be good.

Regulatory

Our operations are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances including, but not limited to, those regulating the environment, display, possession and care of our animals, amusement park rides, building and construction, health and safety, labor and employment, workplace safety, zoning and land use and alcoholic beverage and food service. Key statutes and treaties relating to the display, possession and care of our zoological collection include the Endangered Species Act, Marine Mammal Protection Act, Animal Welfare Act, Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species and Fauna Protection Act and the Lacey Act. We must also comply with the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, Wild Bird Conservation Act and National Environmental Policy Act, among other laws and regulations. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable laws, regulations and ordinances; however, such requirements may change over time, and there can be no assurance that new requirements, changes in enforcement policies or newly discovered conditions relating to our properties or operations will not require significant expenditures in the future. For information on recent regulatory developments, see the &#8220;&#8212;Recent Developments&#8212;Regulatory Developments&#8221; section above.

Insurance

We maintain insurance of the type and in the amounts that we believe to be commercially reasonable for businesses in our industry. We maintain primary and excess casualty coverage of up to $100 million. As part of this coverage, we retain deductible/self-insured retention exposures of $1 million per occurrence for general liability claims, $250,000 per accident for automobile liability claims, and $750,000 per occurrence for workers compensation claims. We maintain employers&#8217; liability and all coverage required by law in the states in which we operate. Defense costs are included in the insurance coverage we obtain against losses in these areas. Based upon our historical experience of reported claims and an estimate for incurred-but-not-reported claims, we accrue a liability for our deductible/self-insured retention contingencies regarding general liability, automobile liability and workers compensation exposures. We maintain additional forms of special casualty coverage appropriate for businesses in our industry. We also maintain commercial property coverage against fire, natural perils, so-called &#8220;extended coverage&#8221; perils such as civil commotion, business interruption and terrorism exposures for protection of our real and personal properties (other than land). We generally renegotiate our insurance policies on an annual basis. We cannot predict the amounts of premium cost that we may be required to pay for future insurance coverage, the level of any deductibles/self-insured retentions we may retain applicable thereto, the level of aggregate excess coverage available or the availability of coverage for special or specific risks.
