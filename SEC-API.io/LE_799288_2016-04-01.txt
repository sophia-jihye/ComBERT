Lands&#8217; End was founded in 1963 by Gary Comer and his partners in Chicago, Illinois, to sell sailboat hardware and equipment by catalog. While our product focus has shifted significantly over the years, we have continued to adhere to our founder&#8217;s motto as one of our guiding principles: &#8220;Take care of the customer, take care of the employee and the rest will take care of itself.&#8221;

Key Capabilities 

Gary Comer founded Lands&#8217; End on certain principles of doing business that are embodied in our promise to deliver great quality, exceptional value and uncompromising service to our customers. These core principles of quality, value and service are the foundation of the competitive advantages that we believe distinguish us from our competitors, including: 

Large, loyal customer base. We believe that a principal factor in our success to date has been the development of our list of existing and prospective households, many of whom were identified by their responses to our marketing. We routinely update and refine our customer list prior to individual catalog and email mailings and monitor customer interest in our offerings as reflected by criteria such as the timing and frequency of purchases and the dollar amount of and types of products purchased. We believe that our customer base consists primarily of affluent, college-educated, professional and style-conscious women and men. In Fiscal 2015 , our customers had average annual household income of $106,000 and approximately 42% of our customers were within the 36-55 age group, according to an analysis of our customer file with data provided by our third-party consumer information provider using its proprietary demographic, behavioral, lifestyle, financial and home attribute databases. 

Innovative yet timeless products . We seek to develop new, innovative products for our customers by utilizing modern fabrics and quality construction to create timeless, affordable styles with consistently excellent fits. We also seek to present our products in an engaging and inspiring way. We believe that our typical customers value quality, seek good value for their money and are looking to add classics to their wardrobe while also placing an emphasis on being fashionable. From a design and merchandising perspective, we seek to balance our product offerings to provide the right combination of classic styles alongside modern touches that are consistent with current trends. We believe that we have had success adding relevant, timeless items into our product assortment, many of which have become customer favorites. We devote significant time and resources to quality assurance and product compliance. Our in-house team manages all product specifications and seeks to ensure brand integrity by providing our customers with the consistent, high-quality merchandise for which Lands&#8217; End is known. We are a vertically 

&#160; 

integrated retailer that manages all aspects of our design, marketing and distribution in-house, which provides us with maximum control over the promotion and sale of our products. 

Customer service. We are committed to building on Lands&#8217; End&#8217;s legacy of strong customer service. We believe that we have a strong track record of improving the customer service experience through innovation. Today, Lands&#8217; End is focused on making the shopping experience as easy and personalized as possible, regardless of whether our customers shop online, by phone or in one of our Lands&#8217; End Shops at Sears. Our operations, including prompt order fulfillment, responsiveness to our customers&#8217; requests and our unconditional return policy of Guaranteed. Period. &#174; , have contributed to our award-winning customer service, which we believe is one of our core strengths and a key point of differentiation from our competitors. Due to our commitment to excellent customer service, we have received many accolades over the years and most recently, in 2015, received the following:

Website Design. As one of the first apparel retailers to establish an online e-commerce presence, we are a leading digital innovator in the apparel industry. One of our strategic goals is to broaden our customer base by creating engaging shopping experiences through our e-commerce platforms. To this end, we launched a significantly improved and redesigned landsend.com website. Highlights of our new website include: 

&#8226; 

A new multi-brand architecture that provides flexible and compelling ways for customers to discover and engage with brand-specific assortments and visual experiences. 

&#8226; 

Streamlined checkout, optimized for mobile and tablet shoppers to capture an increasing share of sales as customer migrate to mobile devices. 

&#8226; 

Convenient payment types including Visa Pay to simplify checkout, especially from mobile devices. 

&#8226; 

Improved search and navigation to help customers quickly find products that best fulfill their product and style preferences. 

&#8226; 

New E- catalogs, which allow prospective and existing customers to view and shop our products in a new and innovative way. Our new E-catalog can be viewed at www.landsend.com. 

Marketing and Brand 

We believe that our most important asset is our brand. Lands&#8217; End is a well-recognized brand with a deeply rooted tradition of offering excellent quality, value and service along with the Lands&#8217; End guarantee, and we seek to reflect that tradition in all of our merchandise. Any item associated with our name falls under our unconditional return policy of Guaranteed. Period&#174;. We believe that this commitment has generated our large and loyal customer base for over fifty years. We invest significantly in brand development through our focus on providing excellent customer service and our emphasis on digital transformation and innovative product development. 

We attempt to build on our brand recognition through a multi-channel marketing campaign including an e-commerce website, www.landsend.com, catalog distribution, digital marketing and print media. Creative designs for these marketing platforms are mostly developed in-house by our talented creative team. We strive to be more efficient in our overall spend, enabling us to invest in initiatives that we believe will yield benefits over the longer-term. The majority of our marketing spend will be allocated to our catalog and digital marketing, where we can generate near term return on investment. We are also investing in branding initiatives designed to communicate the enhancements we are making to our product offering and to broaden the Lands&#8217; End image, while not stepping away 

&#160; 

from our core DNA. We will also continue to deliver the Lands&#8217; End value proposition with strategically planned promotions throughout the year. 

Suppliers 

Our apparel and non-apparel products are produced globally by independent manufacturers who are selected, monitored and coordinated by the Lands&#8217; End Global Sourcing team based in Dodgeville, Wisconsin, by Sears Holdings&#8217; Global Sourcing office in Asia, and a few designated agents. Our products are manufactured in approximately 25 to 30 countries and substantially all are imported from Asia and South America, depending on the nature of the product mix. Our top 10 vendors accounted for 60% of our merchandise purchases in Fiscal 2015 . In Fiscal 2015 , we worked with approximately 115 vendors that manufactured substantially all of our product receipts. We generally do not enter into long-term merchandise supply contracts. We continue to take advantage of opportunities to more efficiently source our products worldwide, consistent with our high standards of quality and value. Significant areas of non-product spend include transportation, information systems, marketing, packaging and catalog paper and print. 

Distribution 

We own and operate three distribution centers in Wisconsin to support our United States Direct and Retail businesses and a portion of our international business. Our Dodgeville facility is approximately 1.05 million square feet and is a full-service distribution center, including monogramming, hemming and embroidery services. Our Reedsburg location is approximately 400,000 square feet and offers all order fulfillment services except hemming. Our Stevens Point distribution center is approximately 150,000 square feet and primarily focuses on supporting Lands&#8217; End Business Outfitters with embroidery services. Customer orders are shipped via UPS, USPS and third-party parcel consolidators. 

We own and operate a distribution center in the United Kingdom based in Oakham, a rural community north of London. Order fulfillment and specialty services for our European businesses are performed at this facility, which originally opened in 1998 and totals approximately 175,000 square feet. We also lease a 71,160 square foot distribution center in Fujieda, Japan. 

Vendors 

&#32; We prioritize the selection of vendors that follow ethical employment practices, comply with all legal requirements, agree to our global compliance requirements and who we believe meet our product quality standards. Our vendors are required to provide full access to their facilities and to relevant records relating to their employment practices, such as, but not limited to child labor, wages and benefits, forced labor, discrimination, freedom of association, unlawful inducements, safe and healthy working conditions and other business practices so that we may monitor their compliance with ethical and legal requirements relating to the conduct of their business. 

Information Technology 

Our information technology systems provide comprehensive support for the design, merchandising, importing, marketing, distribution, sales, order processing and fulfillment of our Lands&#8217; End products. We believe our merchandising and financial systems, coupled with our e-commerce platforms and point-of-sale systems, allow for effective merchandise planning and sales accounting. 

We have a dedicated information technology team that provides strategic direction, application development, infrastructure services and systems support for the functions and processes of our business. The information technology team contracts with third-party consulting firms to provide cost-effective staff augmentation services and partners with leading hardware and software technology firms to provide the infrastructure necessary to run and operate our systems. Our core software applications are comprised of a combination of internally developed and packaged third-party systems. The e-commerce solutions powering www.landsend.com , the Lands&#8217; End Business Outfitters websites, and our international Lands&#8217; End websites are operated out of our own internal data centers as well as through hosting relationships with third parties. 

We are in the process of implementing new information technology systems as part of a multi-year plan to expand and upgrade our information technology platforms and infrastructure. In Fiscal 2015 we completed the implementation of a new e-commerce platform for the Lands' End Business Outfitters websites and introduced new 

&#160; 

capabilities across a number of areas including new digital experiences on the www.landsend.com &#32; platform and a new point-of-sale platform for Lands' End retail stores. In Fiscal 2016 we intend to continue to pursue additional strategic investments, including an integrated ERP to support business growth and additional digital capabilities including enhanced mobile experience, digital marketplace and social media integration, and continued enhancements to the digital shopping experiences on www.landsend.com . 

We are implementing an ERP and other complementary information technology systems over the next several years to create efficiencies within our internal processing and reporting. Implementation of these solutions and systems is highly dependent on coordination of numerous software, hardware and system integration providers. See also Item 1A, Risk Factors , in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials 

We purchase, in the ordinary course of business, raw materials and supplies essential to our operations from numerous suppliers around the world, including in the United States. There have been no recent significant availability problems or supply shortages. 

Orders 

Orders are generally filled on a current basis, and order backlog is not material to our business. 

Competition 

We operate primarily in the apparel industry. The apparel industry is highly competitive. We compete with a diverse group of direct-to-consumer companies and retailers, including national department store chains, men&#8217;s 

and women&#8217;s specialty apparel chains, outdoor specialty stores, apparel catalog businesses, sportswear marketers and online apparel businesses that sell similar lines of merchandise. We compete principally on the basis of merchandise value (quality and price), our established customer list and customer service, including reliable order fulfillment, our unconditional guarantee and services and information provided at our user-friendly websites. 

Seasonality 

We experience seasonal fluctuations in our net revenue and operating results and historically have realized a significant portion of our net revenue and earnings for the year during our fourth fiscal quarter. We generated 33.4% , 32.4% &#32;and 33.9% of our net revenue in the fourth fiscal quarter of Fiscal 2015 , Fiscal 2014 &#32;and Fiscal 2013 , respectively. Thus, lower than expected fourth quarter net revenue could have an adverse impact on our annual operating results. 

Working capital requirements typically increase during the second and third quarters of the fiscal year as inventory builds to support peak shipping/selling periods and, accordingly, typically decrease during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year as inventory is shipped/sold. Cash provided by operating activities is typically higher in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to reduced working capital requirements during that period. 

Intellectual Property 

Lands&#8217; End owns or has rights to use certain word and design trademarks, service marks, and trade names that are registered or exist under common law in the United States and other jurisdictions. The Lands&#8217; End&#174; trade name and trademark is used both in the United States and internationally, and is material to our business. In Fiscal 2015 the Company recognized an impairment to the Lands' End trade name of $98.3 million due to lower Fiscal 2015 revenues, which also drove lower future projected revenues. Trademarks that are important in identifying and distinguishing our products and services are Guaranteed. Period.&#174;, Lands&#8217; End Canvas&#174;, Lighthouse by Lands&#8217; End&#8482;, Square Rigger&#174;, Squall&#174;, Super-T&#8482;, Drifter&#8482;, Outrigger&#174;, Marinac&#174;, and Beach Living&#174;, all of which are owned by us, as well as the licensed marks Supima&#174;, No-Gape&#174;, and others. Other recognized trademarks owned by Lands&#8217; End include SwimMates&#8482;, Starfish&#8482;, Iron Knees&#174;, Willis &#38; Geiger&#174; and ThermaCheck&#174;. Lands&#8217; End&#8217;s rights to some of these trademarks may be limited to select markets. 

&#160; 

Employees 

We employ approximately 6,000 employees throughout our operations: approximately 5,000 employees in the United States and approximately 1,000 employees outside the United States. With the seasonal nature of the retail industry, over 2,000 flexible part-time employees join us each year to support our varying peak seasons, including the fourth quarter holiday shopping season. The non-peak workforce is comprised of approximately 17% salaried exempt employees, 7% salaried non-exempt employees, 33% regular hourly employees and 43% year-round flexible part-time employees. 

Pledged Assets 

In connection with the Separation, Lands' End entered into the ABL Facility and the Term Loan Facility. All domestic obligations under the Debt facilities are unconditionally guaranteed by Lands&#8217; End and, subject to certain exceptions, each of its existing and future direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries. In addition, the obligations of the UK Borrower under the ABL Facility are guaranteed by its existing and future direct and indirect subsidiaries organized in the United Kingdom. The ABL Facility is secured by a first priority security interest in certain working capital of the borrowers and guarantors consisting primarily of accounts receivable and inventory. The Term Loan Facility is secured by a second priority security interest in the same collateral, with certain exceptions. 

The Term Loan Facility also is secured by a first priority security interest in certain property and assets of the borrowers and guarantors, including certain fixed assets and stock of subsidiaries. The ABL Facility is secured by a second priority security interest in the same collateral. 

Sustainability Initiatives 

Lands&#8217; End is working towards improving its sustainable footprint through key practices like waste reduction, a "paper to digital strategy," and a goal to make our products more sustainable; as well as corporate partnerships with the National Forest Foundation and the Sustainable Apparel Coalition. Lands' End hopes to inspire customers and other corporations to increase sustainability awareness and initiatives. 

Environment. The Sustainable Paper Procurement Policy is a commitment to phase out fiber from unwanted sources, and procure paper sourced from credibly certified forest sources with verified chain-of-custody and/or recycled sources with a preference for post-consumer recycled. The policy also outlines supplier requirements and a preferred sustainable supplier program. We will continue to evaluate ways for additional improvement. 

We continue to drive a &#8220;paper to digital&#8221; roadmap that aims to engage, acquire, and migrate customers to a digital platform. With www.landsend.com &#32;as the center of the experience, we are utilizing email, social media, digital marketing and optimized searching to reach a larger group of customers. Since 2012, we have engaged with customers on multiple digital devices and platforms. Going forward we will rely less on traditional paper formats in our marketing campaigns. 

Additionally, we believe that we also demonstrate marketplace leadership by participating in industry educational workshops and initiatives. We select paper for use in our catalog materials based on ecological values, quality, availability and cost. Our catalog covers contain 10% post-consumer waste. The remainder of our catalog paper contains 100% chain-of-custody-certified fiber. This paper is third-party certified through programs such as the Forest Stewardship Council, the Sustainable Forestry Initiative and the Program for the Endorsement of Forest Certification. Between 2003 and 2015, use of corrugated cardboard packaging was reduced by 25%. In addition, the corrugated cardboard we use now contains a minimum of 60% recycled fiber. 

Reduction, Recycling and Waste Management . We have a focus on raising awareness and educating associates on reducing our internal use of consumables and natural resources. In addition, we have a broad range of recycling and waste management initiatives at our corporate office and distribution centers to address our use of paper products, aluminum cans, glass, electronics and plastic as well as maintenance operations, disposal of non-recyclables with composting and water management. In 2015, we reused or recycled approximately 90% of waste generated at our corporate headquarters. 

Purchasing recycled products is a significant component of the larger recycling picture. We continue to maintain an assertive program to buy non-catalog paper and other products made from recycled materials. We consistently monitor our efforts in each of these areas and constantly look for improvements. 

&#160; 

Partnerships. Finally, Lands&#8217; End has formed strategic partnerships with organizations like the Sustainable Apparel Coalition, bluesign ,National Forest Foundation, and the Clean Lakes Alliance. These partnerships, which respectively operate globally, nationally, and locally allow us to engage at a variety of levels. The Sustainable Apparel Coalition brings apparel brands, retailers and manufacturers around the world together to improve the sustainability of products, which is helpful to Lands' End as we look to make our products more sustainable. In Fiscal 2015 Lands' End became a member of bluesign, a system dedicated to sustainable apparel production, and is just in the beginning stages of using this resource in conjunction with the Sustainable Apparel Coalition to further reduce the environmental impact of the apparel industry. Our partnership with the National Forest Foundation has allowed us to give back by funding the planting of over a million trees in national forests over the past three years. Partnering with the Clean Lakes Alliance has allowed us help improve water quality in southern Wisconsin where our employees work, live, and play.
