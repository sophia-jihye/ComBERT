 

1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Description of Business 

Charles River Laboratories International, Inc. (the Company), together with its subsidiaries, is a full service, early-stage contract research organization (CRO). The Company has built upon its core competency of laboratory animal medicine and science (research model technologies) to develop a diverse portfolio of discovery and safety assessment services, both Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) and non-GLP, which is able to support its clients from target identification through preclinical development. The Company also provides a suite of products and services to support its clients&#8217; manufacturing activities. 

Principles of Consolidation 

The Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements reflect its financial statements and those of its subsidiaries in which the Company holds a controlling financial interest. For consolidated entities in which the Company owns or is exposed to less than 100% of the economics, the Company records net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests in its consolidated statements of income equal to the percentage of the economic or ownership interest retained in such entities by the respective noncontrolling parties. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. 

The Company&#8217;s fiscal quarters consists of the 3 months ending on the last Saturday on, or prior to, March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31. 

Reclassifications 

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year statements to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications have no impact on period reported net income or cash flow. 

Segment Reporting 

During the quarter ended June 28, 2014, following its acquisition of the CRO services division of Galapagos N.V. (Argenta and BioFocus), the Company revised its reportable segments to ensure alignment with the Company&#8217;s view of the business. The Company reviewed the new and existing markets addressed by the business, the recently revised go-to-market strategy, long-term operating margins, and the discrete financial information available to its Chief Operating Decision Maker, and considered how its businesses aggregate based on these qualitative and quantitative factors. Based on this review, the Company identified three reportable segments: Research Models and Services (RMS), Discovery and Safety Assessment (DSA) and Manufacturing Support (Manufacturing). The Company reported segment results on this basis for all periods presented. 

The revised reportable segments are as follows: Research Models and Services 

Discovery and Safety Assessment 

Manufacturing Support 

Research Models 

Discovery Services (2) 

Microbial Solutions (formerly 

Endotoxin and Microbial Detection, or EMD) 

Research Model Services (1) 

Safety Assessment 

Avian 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Biologics 

(1) Research Model Services includes Genetically Engineered Models and Services (GEMS), Research Animal Diagnostic Services (RADS), and Insourcing Solutions (IS). 

(2) Discovery Services includes both the In Vivo &#160; Discovery business and the Early Discovery business. Early Discovery includes Argenta and BioFocus, which were acquired in April 2014, ChanTest Corporation (ChanTest), which was acquired in October 2014 and Oncotest GmbH (Oncotest), which was acquired in November 2015.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

Prior to recasting the reportable segments, the businesses were reported in two segments as follows: Research Models and Services 

Preclinical Services 

Research Models (3) 

Discovery Services 

Research Model Services (4) 

Safety Assessment 

Endotoxin and Microbial Detection 

Biologics Testing Solutions 

(3) Research Models included Avian Vaccine Services. 

(4) Research Model Services included GEMS, RADS, IS and Discovery Research Services. As part of the segment revisions, the former Discovery Research Services was folded into the Company&#8217;s Discovery Services business, previously located under the Preclinical Services segment. 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (U.S. GAAP) requires that the Company makes estimates and judgments that may affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, judgments and methodologies. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results in the period in which they become known. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

Cash equivalents include money market funds, time deposits and other investments with remaining maturities at the purchase date of three months or less. 

Investments 

Marketable securities are reported at fair value. Realized gains and losses on marketable securities are included in other income (expense), net and are determined using the specific identification method. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale marketable securities are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Time deposits with original maturities of greater than three months are reported as investments. 

Trade Receivables, Net 

The Company records trade receivables net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. An allowance for doubtful accounts is established based on historical collection information, a review of major client accounts receivable balances and current economic conditions in the geographies in which it operates. Amounts determined to be uncollectible are charged or written off against the allowance. 

Concentrations of Credit Risk 

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, investments and trade receivables. The Company places cash and cash equivalents and investments in various financial institutions with high credit rating and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution. Trade receivables are primarily from clients in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, as well as academic and government institutions. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables, which are typically unsecured, are limited due to the wide variety of customers using the Company&#8217;s products and services as well as their dispersion across many geographic areas. No &#32;single client accounted for more than 5% &#32;of revenue or trade receivables for any period presented. 

Fair Value Measurements 

The accounting standard for fair value measurements defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and requires certain disclosures about fair value measurements. Under this standard, fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Company has certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value which have been classified as Level 1, 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy: 

&#8226; 

Level 1 - Fair values are determined utilizing quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access; 

&#32;55 

CHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC. 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

&#8226; 

Level 2 - Fair values are determined by utilizing quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in active markets or other market observable inputs such as interest rates, yield curves and foreign currency spot rates; 

&#8226; 

Level 3 - Prices or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. 

The fair value hierarchy level is determined by asset or liability class based on the lowest level of significant input. The observability of inputs may change for certain assets or liabilities. This condition could cause an asset or liability to be reclassified between levels. The Company recognizes transfers between levels within the fair value hierarchy, if any, at the end of each quarter. 

Valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities measured or disclosed at fair value are as follows: 

&#8226; 

Cash equivalents - Valued at quoted market prices determined through third-party pricing services. 

&#8226; 

Mutual funds - Valued at the unadjusted quoted net asset value of shares held by the Company. 

&#8226; 

Foreign currency forward contracts - Valued using readily observable market inputs, such as forward foreign exchange points and foreign exchanges rates. 

&#8226; 

Life insurance policies - Valued at cash surrender value based on fair value of underlying investments. 

&#8226; 

Contingent consideration - Valued based on a probability weighting of the future cash flows associated with the potential outcomes. 

&#8226; 

Redeemable noncontrolling interest - Valued using the income approach based on estimated future cash flows of the underlying business discounted by a weighted average cost of capital. 

Inventories 

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined on the average cost method for the small model business and first-in-first-out for the Company&#8217;s large model and Microbial Solutions businesses. For the small model business, cost includes direct materials such as feed and bedding, costs of personnel directly involved in the care of the models, and an allocation of facility overhead. For the large model business, cost is primarily the external cost paid to acquire the model. Certain businesses value inventory based on standard costs, which are periodically compared to and adjusted to actual costs. Inventory costs are charged to cost of revenue in the period the products are sold to an external party. The Company analyzes its inventory levels on a quarterly basis and writes down inventory that is determined to be damaged, obsolete or otherwise unmarketable, with a corresponding charge to cost of products sold. 

Property, Plant and Equipment, Net 

Property, plant and equipment, including improvements that significantly add to productive capacity or extend useful life, are carried at cost and are subject to review for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. The cost of normal, recurring, or periodic repairs and maintenance activities related to property, plant and equipment is expensed as incurred. In addition, the Company capitalizes certain internal use computer software development costs. Costs incurred during the preliminary project stage are expensed as incurred, while costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the software. The Company also capitalizes costs related to specific upgrades and enhancements when it is probable the expenditures will result in additional functionality. Maintenance and training costs related to software obtained for internal use are expensed as incurred. 

Interest costs incurred during the construction of major capital projects are capitalized until the underlying asset is ready for its intended use, at which point the interest costs are amortized as depreciation expense over the life of the underlying asset. 

&#32;56 

CHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC. 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

The Company generally depreciates the cost of its property, plant and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets as follows: &#160; 

Estimated Useful Lives 

&#160; 

(in years) 

Land 

Indefinite 

Buildings 

20 - 40 

Machinery and equipment 

3 - 20 

Furniture and fixtures 

5 - 10 

Computer hardware and software 

3 - 8 

Vehicles 

3 - 5 

Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. Capital lease assets are amortized over the lease term, however, if ownership is transferred by the end of the capital lease, or there is a bargain purchase option, such capital lease assets are amortized over the useful life that would be assigned if such assets were owned. 

When the Company disposes of property, plant and equipment, it removes the associated cost and accumulated depreciation from the related accounts on its consolidated balance sheet and includes any resulting gain or loss in its consolidated statement of income. 

Business Acquisitions 

The Company accounts for acquisitions as business acquisitions under the acquisition method of accounting. The Company allocates the amounts that it pays for each acquisition to the assets it acquires and liabilities it assumes based on their fair values at the dates of acquisition, including identifiable intangible assets. The Company bases the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination on valuations that use information and assumptions determined by management and which consider management&#8217;s best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use. 

Contingent Consideration 

The consideration for the Company&#8217;s acquisitions often includes future payments that are contingent upon the occurrence of a particular event. The Company records an obligation for such contingent payments at fair value on the acquisition date. The Company estimates the fair value of contingent consideration obligations through valuation models that incorporate probability adjusted assumptions related to the achievement of the milestones and thus likelihood of making related payments. The Company revalues these contingent consideration obligations each reporting period. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations are recognized in the Company&#8217;s consolidated statements of income as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations can result from changes to one or multiple inputs, including adjustments to the discount rates and changes in the assumed probabilities of successful achievement of certain financial targets. 

Discount rates in the Company&#8217;s valuation models represent a measure of the credit risk associated with settling the liability. The period over which the Company discounts its contingent obligations is typically based on when the contingent payments would be triggered. These fair value measurements are based on significant inputs not observable in the market. See Note 5, &#8220;Fair Value.&#8221; 

Goodwill and Intangible Assets 

Goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible net assets when accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Goodwill is not amortized, but reviewed for impairment on an annual basis, during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of the Company's reporting units below their carrying amounts. 

The Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step impairment test. If the Company elects this option and believes, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the carrying value of goodwill is not recoverable, the quantitative two-step impairment test is required; otherwise, no further testing is required. Alternatively, the Company may elect to not first assess qualitative factors and immediately perform the quantitative two-step impairment test. In the first step, the Company compares the fair value of its reporting units 

&#32;57 

CHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC. 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

to their carrying values. If the carrying values of the net assets assigned to the reporting units exceed the fair values of the reporting units, then the second step of the impairment test is performed in order to determine the implied fair value of the Company&#8217;s goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting unit&#8217;s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then the Company would record an impairment loss equal to the difference. 

Definite-lived intangible assets, including client relationships, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets or asset group may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset, which requires the use of customer attribution rates and other assumptions. In the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the definite-lived intangible assets, the definite-lived intangible assets are written-down to their fair values. 

Valuation and Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 

Long-lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets or asset group may not be recoverable. 

Determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. In the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the assets, the assets are written-down to their fair values. 

Long-lived assets to be disposed of are carried at fair value less costs to sell. 

Limited Partnerships 

The Company invests in several venture capital limited partnerships that invest in start-up companies primarily in the life sciences industry. The Company ownership interest in these limited partnerships ranges from 3.6% &#32;to 12.0% . The Company accounts for such investments under the equity method of accounting, whereby its portion of the investment gains and losses, as reported in the fund&#8217;s financial statements on a quarterly lag each reporting period, is recorded in other income (expense), net. In addition, the Company adjusts the carrying value of these investments to reflect its estimate of changes to fair value since the fund&#8217;s financial statements based on information from the fund&#8217;s management team, market prices of known public holdings of the fund and other information. 

Life Insurance Contracts 

Investments in life insurance contracts are recorded at cash surrender value. The initial investment at the transaction price is recognized and remeasured based on fair value of underlying investments or contractual value each reporting period. Investments in and redemptions of these life insurance contracts are reported as cash flows from investing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows. As of December 26, 2015 &#32;and December 27, 2014 , the Company held 42 &#32;and 40 &#32;contracts, respectively, with a face value of $60.5 million &#32;and $68.2 million , respectively. 

Stock-Based Compensation 

The Company grants stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance share units (PSUs) to employees and stock options and restricted stock to non-employee directors under stock-based compensation plans. Stock-based compensation is recognized as an expense in the consolidated financial statements based on the grant date fair value, adjusted for estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period. 

For stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units that vest based on service conditions, the Company uses the straight-line method to allocate compensation expense to reporting periods. Where awards are made with non-substantive vesting periods, where a portion of the award continues to vests after the employee&#8217;s retirement, the Company recognizes expense based on the period from the grant date to the date on which the employee is retirement eligible. &#32;The Company records the expense for PSU grants subject to performance and/or market conditions using the accelerated attribution method over the remaining service period when management determines that achievement of the performance-based milestone is probable. 

The fair value of stock options granted is calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and the fair value of PSUs is estimated using a lattice model with a Monte Carlo simulation, both of which require the use of subjective assumptions including volatility and expected term, among others. The expected volatility assumption is typically determined using the historical volatility of the Company&#8217;s common stock over the expected life of the stock-based award. The expected term is determined using historical option exercise activity. The fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units is based on the market value of the Company&#8217;s common stock on the date of grant.

Revenue Recognition 

The Company recognizes revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been provided, the price to the customer is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. 

Service revenue is generally evidenced by client contracts, which range in duration from a few weeks to a few years and typically take the form of an agreed upon rate per unit or fixed fee arrangements. Such contracts typically do not contain acceptance provisions based upon the achievement of certain study or laboratory testing results. Revenue of agreed upon rate per unit contracts is recognized as services are performed, based upon rates specified in the contract. In cases where performance spans reporting periods, revenue of fixed fee contracts is recognized as services are performed, measured on the ratio of outputs or performance obligations completed to the total contractual outputs or performance obligations to be provided. Changes in estimated effort to complete the fixed fee contract are reflected in the period in which the change becomes known. Changes in scope of work are common, especially under long-term contracts, and generally result in a change in contract value. Once the client has agreed to the changes in scope and renegotiated pricing terms, the contract value is amended and revenue is typically recognized as described above. 

Billing schedules and payment terms are generally negotiated on a contract-by-contract basis. Payments received in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue. As the contracted services are subsequently performed and the associated revenue is recognized, the deferred revenue balance is reduced by the amount of revenue recognized during the period. In other cases, services may be provided and revenue is recognized before the client is invoiced. In these cases, revenue recognized will exceed amounts billed and the difference, representing amounts which are currently unbillable to the customer pursuant to contractual terms, is recorded as an unbilled receivable. Once the client is invoiced, the unbilled receivable is reduced for the amount billed, and a corresponding trade receivable is recorded. 

Most contracts are terminable by the client, either immediately or upon notice. These contracts often require payment to the Company of expenses to wind down the project, fees earned to date or, in some cases, a termination fee. Such payments are included in revenues when earned. 

The Company recognizes product revenue net of allowances for estimated returns, rebates and discounts when title and risk of loss pass to customers. When the Company sells equipment with specified acceptance criteria, it assesses its ability to meet the acceptance criteria in order to determine the timing of revenue recognition. The Company would defer revenue until completion of customer acceptance testing if it is not able to demonstrate the ability to meet such acceptance criteria. 

A portion of the Company&#8217;s revenue is from multiple-element arrangements that include multiple products and/or services as deliverables in a single arrangement with each deliverable, or a combination of the deliverables, representing a separate unit of accounting. The Company allocates revenues to each element in a multiple-element arrangement based upon the relative selling price of each deliverable. Revenue allocated to each deliverable is then recognized when all revenue recognition criteria are met. Judgments as to the identification of deliverables, units of accounting, the allocation of consideration to the deliverable, and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are critical with respect to these arrangements. 

At the inception of each arrangement that includes milestone payments, the Company evaluates whether each milestone is substantive. This evaluation includes an assessment of whether (a) the consideration is commensurate with either (1) the Company&#8217;s performance to achieve the milestone, or (2) the enhancement of the value of the delivered item(s) as a result of a specific outcome resulting from the Company&#8217;s performance to achieve the milestone; (b) the consideration relates solely to past performance; and (c) the consideration is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement. If a substantive milestone is achieved and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured, the Company recognizes revenue related to the milestone in its entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved. In those circumstances where a milestone is not substantive, the Company recognizes as revenue, on the date the milestone is achieved, an amount equal to the applicable percentage of the performance period that had elapsed as of the date the milestone was achieved, with the balance being deferred and recognized over the remaining period of performance. As of December 26, 2015, the Company had no &#32;significant milestones that were deemed substantive. 

Advertising Costs 

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. For the fiscal years 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , advertising costs totaled $1.2 million , $1.3 million &#32;and $1.1 million , respectively. 

&#32;59 

CHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC. 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

Income Taxes 

The provision for income taxes includes federal, state, local and foreign taxes. Income taxes are accounted for under the liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statements carrying amounts and their respective tax basis. The Company measures deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences are expected to be settled. The Company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets and establishes a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. 

The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions using a &#8220;more-likely-than-not&#8221; threshold for recognizing and resolving uncertain tax positions. The Company evaluates uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis and considers various factors, including, but not limited to, changes in tax law, the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns, the effective settlement of matters subject to audit, information obtained during in process audit activities and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position. The Company also accrues for potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. 

Foreign Currency Contracts 

Foreign currency contracts are recorded at fair value in the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheet and are not designated as hedging instruments. Any gains or losses on such contracts are immediately recognized in other income (expense), net. 

Translation of Foreign Currencies 

For the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries that transact in a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar, assets and liabilities are translated at current rates of exchange at the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average foreign exchange rates for the period. Adjustments resulting from the translation of the financial statements of our foreign operations into U.S. dollars are excluded from the determination of net income and are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a separate component of equity. 

Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefit Plans 

The Company recognizes the funded status of its defined benefit pension and other post-retirement benefit plans as an asset or liability. This amount is defined as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation. The Company measures plan assets and benefit obligations as of its fiscal year end. 

The key assumptions used to calculate benefit obligations and related pension costs include expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, withdrawal and mortality rates, expected rate of increase in employee compensation levels and discount rate. Assumptions are determined based on the Company&#8217;s data and appropriate market indicators, and evaluated each year as of the plan&#8217;s measurement date. 

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligations. In determining the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the Company considers the relative weighting of plan assets, the historical performance of total plan assets and individual asset classes and economic and other indicators of future performance. 

In the fiscal year 2014, for the U.K. and U.S. plans, the Company adopted newly released mortality tables and mortality improvement scales for measurement of retirement plan obligations, which increased the Company&#8217;s benefit obligations by $7.9 million &#32;as of December 27, 2014. In the fiscal year 2015, new mortality improvement scales were issued in the U.S. and the U.K. reflecting a decline in longevity projection from the 2014 releases that the Company adopted, which decreased the Company&#8217;s benefit obligations by $3.3 million &#32;as of December 26, 2015. 

The discount rate reflects the rate the Company would have to pay to purchase high-quality investments that would provide cash sufficient to settle its current pension obligations. Beginning in the fiscal year 2014, the Company had employed a discount rate based on a cash-flow matching analysis using Towers Watson&#8217;s proprietary Bond:Link tool. Prior to the fiscal year 2014, the Company employed a cash-flow matching methodology, which used the spot yield curve underlying the Citigroup Index. The refined estimation technique permits the Company to more closely match cash flows to the expected payments to participants than would be possible with the previously used yield curve model. This refinement reduced the Company&#8217;s benefit obligations as of December 27, 2014 by $5.5 million . 

The rate of compensation increase reflects the expected annual salary increases for the plan participants based on historical experience and the current employee compensation strategy.

CHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC. 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

The Company is required to recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the actuarial gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise but were not previously required to be recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost. Other comprehensive income is adjusted as these amounts are later recognized in income as components of net periodic benefit cost. 

Earnings Per Share 

Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing net income attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Except where the result would be anti-dilutive to income from continuing operations, diluted earnings per share is computed using the treasury stock method, assuming the exercise of stock options and the vesting of restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, or PSUs, as well as their related income tax effects. 

Newly Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 

In November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2015-17, &#8220;Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes,&#8221; that requires companies to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any valuation allowance, as noncurrent on the balance sheet instead of separating deferred taxes into current and noncurrent amounts. The guidance does not change the existing requirement that only permits offsetting within a jurisdiction. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company elected early adoption of this standard as it improved the efficiency of the year end financial reporting process for income taxes &#32;and applied the changes retrospectively to all prior periods presented in its consolidated financial statements. 

As of December 27, 2014, the adoption of this standard has resulted in decreases of $27.6 million , $1.5 million , and $7.7 million &#32;to other current assets, other current liabilities and noncurrent deferred tax liabilities, respectively, and an increase of $18.4 million &#32;to noncurrent deferred tax assets. 

In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16, &#8220;Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments,&#8221; that eliminates the current requirement for an acquirer in a business combination to account for measurement-period adjustments retrospectively. Instead, acquirers will recognize measurement-period adjustments during the period in which they determine the amount of the adjustments, including the effect on earnings of any amounts they would have recorded in previous periods if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company elected early adoption of this standard. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact to the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-04, &#8220;Practical Expedient for the Measurement Date of an Employer&#8217;s Defined Benefit Obligation and Plan Assets&#8221; to provide a practical expedient related to the measurement date of the defined benefit plan assets and obligations. The practical expedient allows employers with fiscal year-end dates that do not coincide with a calendar month end to measure pension and post-retirement benefit plan assets and obligations as of the calendar month-end date closest to the fiscal year end. The standard requires entities that elect the practical expedient to adjust the measurement of benefit plan assets and obligations for contributions or significant events between the month-end measurement date and the entity fiscal year end. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company elected not to utilize the practical expedient provided by ASU 2015-04. 

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, &#8220;Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,&#8221; which requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the associated debt liability, consistent with the presentation of debt discounts or premiums. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. During the second quarter of 2015, the Company elected early adoption of this standard and applied the changes retrospectively to all prior periods presented in its consolidated financial statements. 

The Company historically presented deferred debt issuance costs, or fees related to directly issuing debt, as assets on the consolidated balance sheets. As of December 27, 2014, the adoption of this standard has resulted in the reclassification of $5.4 million &#32;from other assets to long-term debt, net and capital leases. These costs will continue to be amortized as interest expense over the term of the corresponding debt issuance. 

In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, &#8220;Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis,&#8221; which amends existing consolidation requirements. The guidance affects reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. Specifically, the guidance amends (i) the identification of variable interests (fees paid to a 

&#32;61 

CHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC. 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

decision maker or service provider), (ii) the variable interest entity characteristics for a limited partnership or similar entity and (iii) the primary beneficiary determination. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company elected early adoption of this standard. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact to the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. 

Newly Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, &#8220;Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory,&#8221; that simplifies the subsequent measurement of inventories by replacing the current lower of cost or market test with a lower of cost or net realizable value test. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is still evaluating the impact this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, &#8220;Revenue from Contracts with Customers.&#8221; The standard requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The standard will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective and permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The standard will be effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company has not yet selected a transition method and is evaluating the impact the adoption will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

2. BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS 

Oncotest 

On November 18, 2015, the Company acquired Oncotest, a German CRO providing discovery services for oncology, one of the largest therapeutic areas for biopharmaceutical research and development spending. With this acquisition, the Company has expanded its oncology services capabilities, enabling it to provide clients with access to a more comprehensive portfolio of technologies, including patient-derived xenograft (PDX) and syngeneic models. The purchase price for Oncotest was approximately $ 36.0 million , including $ 0.3 million &#32;in contingent consideration. The acquisition was funded by borrowings on the Company's revolving credit facility. The business is reported in the Company&#8217;s DSA reportable segment. 

The contingent consideration is a one-time payment that could become payable based on the achievement of a revenue target for the fiscal year 2016. If achieved, the payment will become due in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. The aggregate, undiscounted amount of contingent consideration that the Company may pay is &#8364;2.0 million &#32;( $2.2 million &#32;as of December 26, 2015). The Company estimated the fair value of this contingent consideration based on a probability-weighted set of outcomes. 

The preliminary purchase price allocation of $35.4 million , net of $ 0.6 million &#32;of cash acquired, was as follows: &#160;

Sunrise 

On &#32; May 5, 2015, the Company acquired Sunrise Farms, Inc. (Sunrise), a producer of specific-pathogen-free fertile chicken eggs and chickens used in the manufacture of live viruses. The purpose of this business acquisition was to expand the capabilities of the Company&#8217;s existing Avian Vaccine Services business. The purchase price of the acquisition was $ 9.6 million &#32;and was funded by cash on hand and borrowings on the Company&#8217;s revolving credit facility. The business is reported in the Company&#8217;s Manufacturing reportable segment. 

The Company recorded a bargain purchase gain of $ 9.8 million , which represents the excess of the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired over the preliminary purchase price. The bargain purchase gain was recorded in other income (expense), net in the Company&#8217;s consolidated statement of income and was not recognized for tax purposes. The Company believes there were several factors that contributed to this transaction resulting in a bargain purchase gain, including the highly specialized nature of Sunrise&#8217;s business falling outside of the seller&#8217;s core activities and a limited pool of potential buyers.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

Before recognizing the gain from the bargain purchase, the Company reassessed its initial identification and valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed to validate that all assets and liabilities that the Company was able to identify at the acquisition date were properly recognized.

The purchase price allocations were prepared on a preliminary basis and are subject to change as additional information becomes available concerning the fair value and tax basis of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. During the fiscal year 2015 , the Company recorded measurement-period adjustments related to the Sunrise acquisition that resulted in an immaterial change to the purchase price allocation and bargain purchase gain. Any additional adjustments to the purchase price allocation will be made as soon as practicable but no later than one &#32;year from the date of acquisition. 

The identifiable definite-lived intangible assets acquired represent the client relationships intangible, which is being amortized over the estimated useful life of approximately 15 &#32;years. 

The Company incurred transaction and integration costs in connection with the acquisition of $ 1.5 million &#32;during the fiscal year 2015 , which were included in selling, general and administrative expenses. 

ChanTest 

On October 29, 2014, the Company acquired ChanTest, a leading provider of ion channel testing services to the biopharmaceutical industry. The acquisition augments the Company&#8217;s early discovery capabilities and enhances the Company&#8217;s ability to support clients&#8217; target discovery and lead optimization efforts. The purchase price of the acquisition was $ 59.2 million , including $ 0.3 million &#32;in contingent consideration. The business is reported in the Company&#8217;s DSA reportable segment.

As a result, the related contingent consideration liability was reversed and a gain of $0.3 million &#32;was recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses, as no payments are expected to be made. The aggregate, undiscounted amount of contingent consideration that could have become payable was $ 2.0 million . The Company estimated the fair value of this contingent consideration based on a probability-weighted set of outcomes.

VivoPath 

On June 16, 2014, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of VivoPath LLC (VivoPath), a discovery services company specializing in the rapid, in vivo &#32;compound evaluation of molecules in the therapeutic areas of metabolism, inflammation and oncology. The purchase price was $ 2.3 million , including $ 1.6 million &#32;in contingent consideration, and was allocated primarily to the intangible assets acquired. The Company estimated the fair value of this contingent consideration based on a probability-weighted set of outcomes. The undiscounted total amount of contingent consideration was a maximum of $ 2.4 million , payable over three &#32;years based on the achievement of revenue growth targets and other contractual requirements. During the fiscal year 2015 , the Company paid the first year tranche of the contingent consideration of $ 0.6 million &#32;and recorded a gain of $ 0.8 million , primarily due to a decrease in the expected future contingent consideration payments. As of December 26, 2015 , the remaining contingent consideration payable is a maximum of $ 0.4 million . The business is reported in the Company&#8217;s DSA reportable segment. 

Argenta and BioFocus 

On April 1, 2014, the Company acquired (1) 100% &#32;of the shares of the United Kingdom (U.K.) based entities Argenta and BioFocus, and (2) certain Dutch assets.

With this acquisition, the Company has enhanced its position as a full service, early-stage CRO, with integrated in vitro &#32;and in vivo &#32;capabilities from target discovery through preclinical development. The purchase price of the acquisition was $191.8 million , including $0.9 million &#32;in contingent consideration. The acquisition was funded by cash on hand and borrowings on the Company&#8217;s revolving credit facility. The businesses are reported in the Company&#8217;s DSA reportable segment. 

The contingent consideration earn-out period ended on April 1, 2015. As a result, the related contingent consideration liability, as adjusted for subsequent changes in fair value, was reversed and a gain of $0.8 million &#32;was recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses during the fiscal year 2015 , as no payments are expected to be made. The contingent consideration was a one-time payment that could have become payable in the second quarter of 2015 based on the achievement of a certain revenue target for the twelve-month period following the acquisition. The aggregate, undiscounted amount of contingent consideration that the Company could have paid was &#8364; 5.0 million &#32;( $5.5 million &#32;as of December 26, 2015 ). The Company estimated the fair value of this contingent consideration based on a probability-weighted set of outcomes.

The goodwill resulting from the transaction is primarily attributed to the potential growth of the business in China and is not deductible for tax purposes. 

Concurrent with the acquisition, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with the noncontrolling interest holders that provide the Company with the right to purchase the remaining 25% &#32;of the entity for cash at its then appraised value beginning in January 2016. Additionally, the noncontrolling interest holders were granted the right to require the Company to purchase the remaining 25% &#32;of the entity at its then appraised value beginning in January 2016 for cash. These rights are accelerated in certain events. As the noncontrolling interest holders can require the Company purchase the remaining 25% &#32;interest, the noncontrolling interest is classified in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheet, which is above the equity section and below liabilities. The acquisition-date fair value of the noncontrolling interest was determined based on the fair value of the consideration exchanged for the 75% &#32;of Vital River. Subsequent to the acquisition, the noncontrolling interest carrying amount is adjusted to the fair value each quarter using an income approach. The income approach uses estimated future cash flows based on projected financial data discounted by a rate which considers the Company&#8217;s weighted average cost of capital and the specific risks of achieving these cash flows. Adjustments to fair value are recorded through additional paid-in capital.

As of December 26, 2015 , the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company&#8217;s redeemable noncontrolling interest are the estimated future cash flows and a discount rate of 18.0% . Significant changes in the timing or amounts of the estimated future cash flows would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement. Significant increases or decreases in the discount rate would result in a significantly lower or higher fair value measurement, respectively. A 1% &#32;increase in the discount rate used would result in a $1.7 million &#32;decrease in the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest.

The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company&#8217;s contingent consideration are the probabilities of successful achievement of certain financial targets and a discount rate. Significant increases or decreases in any of the probabilities of success would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement, respectively. Significant increases or decreases in the discount rate would result in a significantly lower or higher fair value measurement, respectively. 

Debt Instruments 

The book value of the Company&#8217;s term and revolving loans, which are variable rate loans carried at amortized cost, approximates their fair value based on current market pricing of similar debt. As the fair value is based on significant other observable inputs, including current interest and foreign currency exchange rates, it is deemed to be Level 2.

In the second quarter of 2014, the Company revised its reportable segments to align with the view of the business following its acquisition of Argenta and BioFocus. See Note 1, "Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies." As a result of this reorganization, goodwill was allocated from the Company's prior reportable segments to new reportable segments, as shown in the preceding table within "transfers." The allocation was based on the fair value of each business group within its original reporting unit relative to the fair value of that reporting unit. In addition, the Company completed an assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for all reporting units immediately prior to the reallocation and determined that no impairment existed. 

Based on the Company&#8217;s step one goodwill impairment test for the fiscal years 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the reporting unit&#8217;s book value and, therefore, goodwill was not impaired.

(1) During the second quarter of 2015, the Company adopted ASU 2015-03 and reclassified unamortized debt issuance costs from other assets to long-term debt, net and capital leases. See Note 1, &#8220;Basis of Presentation&#8221; for further discussion. 

In April 2015, the Company amended and restated the $ 970M &#32;Credit Facility, creating a $ 1.3 billion &#32;facility ($ 1.3B &#32;Credit Facility) that provides for a $ 400.0 million &#32;term loan facility and a $ 900.0 million &#32;multi-currency revolving facility. The term loan facility matures in 20 &#32;quarterly installments with the last installment due April 22, 2020. The revolving facility matures on April 22, 2020 and requires no scheduled payment before that date. 

The interest rates applicable to term loans and revolving loans under our credit agreement are, at the Company&#8217;s option, equal to either the alternate base rate (which is the higher of (1) the prime rate, (2) the federal funds rate plus 0.5% &#32;or (3) the one-month adjusted LIBOR rate plus 1% ), or the adjusted LIBOR rate plus an interest rate margin based upon the Company&#8217;s leverage ratio. As of December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014, the weighted average interest rate on the Company&#8217;s debt was 1.33% &#32;and 1.42% , respectively. 

The $ 1.3B &#32;Credit Facility includes certain customary representations and warranties, events of default, notices of material adverse changes to the Company&#8217;s business and negative and affirmative covenants. These covenants include (1) maintenance of a ratio of consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) less capital expenditures to consolidated cash interest expense, for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, of no less than 3.5 &#32;to 1.0 &#32;as well as (2) maintenance of a ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, of no more than 3.5 &#32;to 1.0 . As of December 26, 2015, the Company was compliant with all covenants. The Company&#8217;s obligations under the credit agreement are collateralized by substantially all of the Company&#8217;s assets. 

As of December 26, 2015 &#32;and December 27, 2014 , the Company had $4.9 million &#32;and $5.0 million , respectively, outstanding under letters of credit.

Capital Lease Obligations 

The Company acquired a build-to-suit lease as part of its acquisition of Argenta and BioFocus. In accordance with accounting guidance applicable to entities involved with the construction of an asset that will be leased when the construction is completed, the Company was considered the owner, for accounting purposes, of this property during the construction period. Accordingly, the Company recorded an asset and a corresponding financing obligation on its consolidated balance sheet for the amount of total project costs incurred related to the construction in progress for this property through completion of the construction period. Upon completion of the construction during the second quarter of 2015, the Company determined that it was no longer considered the owner of the property because it did not have continuing involvement. Consequently, the Company recorded a successful sale leaseback and derecognized the property and the associated financing obligation from the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheet and recorded a capital lease asset and a corresponding liability of $ 35.8 million . 

The Company&#8217;s capital lease obligations amounted to $33.6 million &#32;and $1.0 million &#32;as of December 26, 2015 &#32;and December 27, 2014 , respectively.

The tax rate benefit for the impact of tax uncertainties is primarily related to a $10.4 million &#32;reduction in unrecognized tax benefits and related interest due to the expiration of the statute of limitations associated with pre-acquisition tax positions on the forgiveness of debt. The tax rate benefit for enacted tax rate changes is primarily associated with a reduction in the U.K.&#8217;s statutory tax rates. The tax benefit associated with a $ 9.8 million &#32;non-taxable bargain purchase gain related to the acquisition of Sunrise is included within the impact of acquisitions and restructuring line of the rate reconciliation above. 

As of December 26, 2015 , the Company had foreign net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of $34.6 million , as compared to $39.8 million &#32;as of December 27, 2014 . Of this amount, $4.3 million &#32;will expire beginning after 2015, $18.7 million &#32;will begin to expire in 2032 and beyond, and the remainder of $11.6 million &#32;can be carried forward indefinitely. In accordance with Canadian Federal tax law, the Company claims Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&#38;ED) credits on qualified research and development costs incurred in its Safety Assessment facility in Montreal, and currently maintains $18.7 million &#32;in credit carryforwards, which will begin to expire in 2032. Additionally, the Company records a benefit to operating income for research and development credits in both Quebec and the U.K. related to its Safety Assessment and Early Discovery facilities. 

The Company has fully recognized its deferred tax assets on the belief that it is more likely than not that they will be realized. The only exceptions relate to deferred tax assets primarily for net operating losses in Hong Kong, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, capital losses in the U.S. and Canada, and fixed assets in the U.K. The valuation allowance increased by $0.2 million &#32;from $5.9 million &#32;as of December 27, 2014 &#32;to $6.1 million &#32;as of December 26, 2015 .

The $11.3 million &#32;decrease in unrecognized income tax benefits during the fiscal year 2015 is primarily attributable to the expiration of the statute of limitations associated with pre-acquisition tax positions on forgiveness of debt. 

&#32;79 

CHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC. 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

The amount of unrecognized income tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably impact the effective tax rate was $ 20.1 million &#32;as of December 26, 2015 and $32.3 million &#32;as of December 27, 2014. The $12.2 million &#32;decrease is primarily attributable to the expiration of the statute of limitations associated with pre-acquisition tax positions on forgiveness of debt. It is reasonably possible as of December 26, 2015 that the liability for unrecognized tax benefits for the uncertain tax position will decrease by $ 1.9 million , primarily as a result of the outcome of a pending tax ruling. The Company continues to recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized income tax benefits in income tax expense. The total amount of accrued interest related to unrecognized income tax benefits as of December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014 was $ 1.0 million &#32;and $ 1.4 million , respectively. 

The Company conducts business in a number of tax jurisdictions. As a result, it is subject to tax audits on a regular basis including, but not limited to, such major jurisdictions as the U.S., the U.K., France, Japan, Germany and Canada. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. and international income tax examinations for years before 2012. 

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are currently under audit by various tax authorities in the U.S. and France. The Company does not anticipate resolution of these audits will have a material impact on its financial statements. 

During 2015, the Company applied with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and Canadian Revenue Authority (CRA) for relief pursuant to the competent authority procedure provided in the tax treaty between the U.S. and Canada for transfer pricing tax assessments related to the tax years 2008 through 2012. The Company believes that the controversy will likely be ultimately settled via the competent authority process and accordingly have recorded both a Canadian liability and a U.S. receivable. The actual amounts of the liability for Canadian taxes and the asset for the correlative relief in the U.S. could be different based upon the agreement reached between the IRS and the CRA. 

On October 21, 2015, the Quebec government enacted Bill 13, which provides for a one-time retroactive benefit to operating income in the fourth quarter of 2015 related to tax years 2012 through 2014 and provides for a corresponding increase to the Company&#8217;s effective tax rate. Additionally, the tax law change provides for an ongoing reduction in benefit to operating income and an additional corresponding increase to the Company&#8217;s effective tax rate beginning in 2015 and beyond. The cumulative impact of this law change has been reflected in the fourth quarter results. 

In accordance with the Company&#8217;s policy, the undistributed earnings of the Company&#8217;s non-U.S. subsidiaries remain indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. as of the end of 2015 as they are required to fund needs outside the U.S. and cannot be repatriated in a manner that is substantially tax free. As of December 26, 2015, the earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries considered to be indefinitely reinvested totaled $547.6 million . No provision for U.S. income taxes has been provided herein. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liabilities on these earnings is not practicable because of the complexities with the hypothetical calculation. Additionally, the amount of liability is dependent on circumstances existing if and when remittance occurs. On December 18, 2015, the U.S. enacted the Consolidated Appropriations Act, which provides for a reinstatement and extension of the controlled foreign corporation look-through rules. This rule allows the Company to access Chinese and Canadian cash in a more tax-efficient manner and utilize the cash outside of the U.S. without triggering residual U.S. tax. As such, in 2015 the Company accrued $6.6 million &#32;of foreign withholding taxes to reflect this change. 

10. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS 

Charles River Laboratories Employee Savings Plan 

The Charles River Laboratories Employee Savings Plan is a defined contribution plan in the form of a qualified 401(k) plan in which substantially all U.S. employees are eligible to participate upon employment. The plan contains a provision whereby the Company matches a percentage of employee contributions. During the fiscal years 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , the costs associated with this defined contribution plan totaled $5.3 million , $4.9 million &#32;and $4.7 million , respectively.

The Company maintains a non-qualified deferred compensation plan, known as the Charles River Laboratories Deferred Compensation Plan (DCP), which allows a select group of eligible employees to defer a portion of their compensation. At the present time, no contributions are credited to the DCP, except as set forth below. Participants must specify the distribution date for deferred amounts at the time of deferral, in accordance with applicable IRS regulations. Generally, amounts may be paid in lump sum or installments upon retirement or termination of employment, or later if the employee terminates employment after age 55 and before age 65. Amounts may also be distributed during employment, subject to a minimum deferral requirement of three years. 

The Company provides certain active employees an annual contribution into their DCP account of 10% &#32;of the employee&#8217;s base salary plus the lesser of their target annual bonus or actual annual bonus.

CHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC. 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

In addition to the DCP, certain officers and key employees also participate, or in the past participated, in the Company&#8217;s Executive Supplemental Life Insurance Retirement Plan (ESLIRP), which is a non-funded, non-qualified arrangement. Annual benefits under this plan will equal a percentage of the highest five consecutive years of compensation, offset by amounts payable under the Charles River Laboratories, Inc. Pension Plan (CRL Pension Plan) and Social Security. In connection with the establishment of the DCP, certain active ESLIRP participants, who agreed to convert their accrued ESLIRP benefit to a comparable deferred compensation benefit, discontinued their direct participation in the ESLIRP. Instead, the present values of the accrued benefits of ESLIRP participants were credited to their DCP accounts, and future accruals are converted to present values and credited to their DCP accounts annually. &#160; 

The costs associated with these plans, including the ESLIRP, for the fiscal years 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;totaled $2.6 million , $ 3.3 million &#32;and $3.3 million , respectively. 

The Company has invested in several corporate-owned key-person life insurance policies and mutual funds with the intention of using these investments to fund the ESLIRP and the DCP. Participants have no interest in any such investments. As of December 26, 2015 &#32;and December 27, 2014 , the cash surrender value of these life insurance policies were $27.6 million &#32;and $27.6 million , respectively. 

Post-Retirement Health and Life Insurance Plans 

The Company&#8217;s Canadian location offers post-retirement life insurance benefits to its employees and post-retirement medical and dental insurance coverage to certain executives. The plan is non-contributory and unfunded. As of December 26, 2015 &#32;and December 27, 2014 , the accumulated benefit obligation related to the plan was $0.9 million &#32;and $1.2 million , respectively. The amounts included in other accumulated comprehensive income as well as expenses related to the plan were insignificant in the fiscal years 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 . 

Pension Plans 

The CRL Pension Plan is a qualified, non-contributory defined benefit plan covering certain U.S. employees. Effective 2002, the plan was amended to exclude new participants from joining and in 2008 the accrual of benefits was frozen. 

The Charles River Pension Plan is a defined contribution and defined benefit pension plan covering certain U.K. employees. Benefits are based on participants&#8217; final pensionable salary and years of service. Participants&#8217; rights vest immediately. Effective December 31, 2002, the plan was amended to exclude new participants from joining the defined benefit section of the plan and a defined contribution section was established for new entrants. Contributions under the defined contribution plan are determined as a percentage of gross salary. In the fourth quarter of 2015, the Charles River Pension Plan was amended such that the members of the defined benefit section of the plan will cease to accrue additional benefits; however, their benefits will continue to be adjusted for changes in their final pensionable salary or a specified inflation index, as applicable. 

In addition, the Company has several defined benefit plans in certain other countries in which it maintains an operating presence, including Japan, Canada and France.

Plan assets 

The Company invests its pension assets with the objective of achieving a total long-term rate of return sufficient to fund future pension obligations and to minimize future pension contributions. The Company is willing to tolerate a commensurate level of risk to achieve this objective. The Company controls its risk by maintaining a diversified portfolio of assets classes. Plan assets

11. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION 

The Company has stock-based compensation plans under which employees and non-employee directors may be granted stock-based awards such as stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and PSUs. 

During the fiscal years 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , the primary share-based awards and their general terms and conditions are as follows: 

&#8226; 

Stock options, which entitle the holder to purchase a specified number of shares of common stock at an exercise price equal to the closing market price of common stock on the date of grant; typically vest over 4 &#32;years; and typically expire 5 &#32;to 7 &#32;years from date of grant. 

&#8226; 

Restricted stock units, which represent an unsecured promise to grant at no cost a set number of shares of common stock upon the completion of the vesting schedule, and typically vest over 2 &#32;to 4 &#32;years. With respect to restricted 

&#32;84 

CHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC. 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

stock units, recipients are not entitled to cash dividends and have no voting rights on the stock during the vesting period. 

&#8226; 

Restricted stock, which is an award of common stock issued on the grant date and subject to vesting, typically over 2 &#32;to 4 &#32;years. Recipients cannot sell or transfer the shares until the restriction period has lapsed, but are entitled to forfeitable cash dividends and to vote their respective shares upon grant. 

&#8226; 

PSUs, which entitle the holder to receive at no cost, a specified number of shares of common stock within a range of shares from zero &#32;to a specified maximum and typically vest over 3 &#32;years. Payout of this award is contingent upon achievement of certain performance and market conditions. 

In May 2007, the Company&#8217;s shareholders approved the 2007 Incentive Plan, which was amended in 2009, 2011 and 2013 (2007 Plan). The 2007 Plan provided no further awards to be granted under preexisting stock option and incentive plans; provided, however, that any shares that have been forfeited or canceled in accordance with the terms of the applicable award under a preexisting plan may be subsequently awarded in accordance with the terms of the preexisting plan. The 2007 Plan allows a maximum of 18.7 million &#32;shares to be awarded, of which restricted stock grants, restricted stock units and performance based stock awards count as 2.3 &#32;shares and stock options count as 1.0 &#32;shares. Any stock options and other share-based awards that were granted under prior plans and were outstanding in May 2007, continue in accordance with the terms of the respective plans. 

As of December 26, 2015 , approximately 6.3 million &#32;shares were authorized for future grants under the Company&#8217;s share-based compensation plans. The Company settles employee share-based compensation awards with newly issued shares.

During the fiscal year 2015 , the Company modified certain stock-based awards granted in previous years as part of executive retirement transitions. For the stock-based awards granted to employees during 2015 , the Company introduced a new retirement provision, which allows for continued vesting of such awards after the employee&#8217;s retirement if certain eligibility conditions are met. The introduction of the new retirement provision and stock-based award modifications increased the Company&#8217;s stock-based compensation expense for 2015 &#32;by $4.5 million . 

The Company capitalized no &#32;stock-based compensation related costs for the fiscal years 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 . 

The Company&#8217;s pool of excess tax benefits, which is computed in accordance with the long form method, was $22.3 million &#32;as of December 26, 2015 , $10.8 million &#32;as of December 27, 2014 , and $7.3 million &#32;as of December 28, 2013 . During the fiscal year 2015 , the Company recorded a tax benefit of $10.6 million &#32;to additional paid-in capital related to the exercise of stock options and vesting of restricted shares and restricted stock units, compared to a tax benefit of $4.3 million &#32;in the fiscal year 2014 . The windfall tax benefit reduction of $1.6 million &#32;in the fiscal year 2014 , due to the utilization of foreign tax credits, was reversed in the fiscal year 2015 .

Performance Based Stock Award Program 

In the fiscal years 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013, the Company issued PSUs to certain corporate officers. The number of shares of common stock issued for each PSU is adjusted based on a performance condition linked to the Company&#8217;s financial performance. Certain awards are further adjusted based on a market condition, which is calculated based on the Company&#8217;s stock performance relative to a peer group over the three-year vesting period. The fair value of the market condition is reflected in the fair value of the award at grant date. 

The Company utilizes a Monte Carlo simulation valuation model to value these awards. Information pertaining to the Company&#8217;s PSUs and the related estimated weighted-average assumptions used to calculate their fair value were as follows: &#160;

The maximum amount of common shares to be issued upon vesting of PSUs is approximately 0.8 million . For the fiscal years 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , the Company recognized stock-based compensation related to PSUs of $14.7 million , $8.5 million &#32;and $2.2 million , respectively. The total fair value of PSUs that vested during the fiscal year 2015 was $6.6 million . 

In the fiscal year 2015, the Company also issued approximately 15,000 &#32;PSUs using a fair value per share of $76.67 . These PSUs vest upon the achievement of financial targets and other performance measures. 

12. FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS 

During the fiscal year 2015, the Company entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to limit its foreign currency exposure related to intercompany loans denominated in Euros that are not of a long-term investment nature. These contracts are recorded at fair value in the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheet and are not designated as hedging instruments. Any gains or losses on such contracts are immediately recognized in other income (expense), net, and are largely offset by the remeasurement of the underlying intercompany loan balances. 

The notional amount and fair value of the Company&#8217;s foreign currency forward contracts is summarized as follows: December 26, 2015

13. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 

Operating Leases 

The Company rents laboratory and office space, land, vehicles and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. These lease agreements contain various clauses for renewal at the Company&#8217;s option and, in certain cases, rent escalation 

&#32;87 

CHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC. 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

clauses. Rental expense under these leases amounted to $23.4 million , $14.2 million &#32;and $16.7 million &#32;in the fiscal years 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. In addition to rent, the leases may require the Company to pay additional amounts for taxes, insurance, maintenance and other operating expenses. 

As of December 26, 2015 , minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable leases, net of income from subleases, for each of the next five years and total thereafter were as follows:

Insurance 

The Company maintains various insurance policies that maintain large deductibles up to approximately $5.0 million , some with or without stop-loss limits, depending on market availability. Insurance policies at certain locations are based on a percentage of the insured assets, for which deductibles for certain property may exceed $5.0 million &#32;in the event of a catastrophic event. 

Litigation 

Various lawsuits, claims, and proceedings of a nature considered normal to its business are pending against the Company. While the outcome of any of these proceedings cannot be accurately predicted, the Company does not believe the ultimate resolution of any of these existing matters would have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business or financial condition. 

In July 2015, IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. and IDEXX Distribution, Inc. (collectively, IDEXX) filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware alleging the Company has infringed three &#32;recently issued patents related to a blood spot sample collection method used in determining the presence or absence of an infectious disease in a population of rodents. On September 21, 2015, the Company timely filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that all of the claims are directed to unpatentable subject matter and therefore are invalid. On October 7, 2015, IDEXX filed an amended complaint which substantially asserts the same patents and infringement allegations as asserted in the original complaint, and on October 26, 2015, the Company timely filed a motion to dismiss this amended complaint. While no prediction may be made as to the outcome of litigation, the Company intends to defend against this proceeding vigorously and therefore an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made. 

In May 2013, the Company commenced an investigation into inaccurate billing with respect to certain government contracts. The Company promptly reported these matters to the relevant government contracting officers, the Department of Health and Human Services&#8217; Office of the Inspector General, and the Department of Justice, and the Company is cooperating with these agencies to ensure the proper repayment and resolution of this matter. The Company has identified approximately $ 1.5 million &#32;in excess amounts billed on these contracts since January 1, 2007 and has recorded a liability for such amount as of December 26, 2015 as this represents the Company&#8217;s best estimate. Because of the ongoing discussions with the government and the complex nature of this matter, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that additional losses may be incurred but cannot at this time make a reasonable estimate of the potential range of loss beyond such estimated liability. 

Guarantees 

The Company enters into certain agreements with other parties in the ordinary course of business that contain indemnification provisions. These typically include agreements with directors and officers, business partners, contractors, landlords, and customers. Under these provisions, the Company generally indemnifies and holds harmless the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party as a result of the Company&#8217;s activities. These indemnification provisions generally survive termination of the underlying agreement. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification provisions is unlimited. However, to date the Company has not incurred 

&#32;88 

CHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC. 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

material costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification provisions. As a result, the estimated fair value of these obligations is minimal. 

14. SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION 

The Company revised its reportable segments during the fiscal year 2014 to align with its view of the business following its acquisition of Argenta and BioFocus. See Note 1, &#8220;Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.&#8221; The Company reported segment results on this basis retrospectively for all comparable prior periods. Asset information on a reportable segment basis is not disclosed as this information is not separately identified and internally reported to the Company&#8217;s Chief Operating Decision Maker.
