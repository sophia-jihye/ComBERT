 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160;

BUSINESS OVERVIEW 

&#160;

THE COMPANY 

&#160;

Biomerica, Inc. ("Biomerica", the "Company", "we" or "our") was incorporated in Delaware in September 1971 as Nuclear Medical Systems, Inc. The Company also has two wholly owned subsidiaries, Biomerica de Mexico, established for future use as a maquiladora and BioEurope GmbH, which acts as a distributor of Biomerica products in certain markets. 

&#160;

The Company develops, manufactures, and markets medical diagnostic products designed for the early detection and monitoring of chronic diseases and medical conditions. Our medical diagnostic products are sold worldwide in two markets: 1) clinical laboratories and 2) point of care (physicians' offices and over-the-counter drugstores). Our diagnostic test kits are used to analyze blood, urine, or fecal specimens from patients in the diagnosis of various diseases and other medical complications, or to measure the level of specific hormones, antibodies, antigens or other substances, which may exist in the human body in extremely small concentrations. 

&#160;

We primarily focus on products for gastrointestinal, food intolerances, diabetes and esoteric tests. These diagnostic test products utilize immunoassay technology. Some of these products have not yet been submitted for clearance by the Food and Drug Administration (&#147;FDA&#148;) or each country&#146;s equivalent for diagnostic use, but can still be sold in various foreign countries without this approval. 

&#160;

Technological advances in medical diagnostics have made it possible to perform diagnostic tests within the home and the physician's office (the point of care), rather than in the clinical laboratory. One of our objectives has been to develop and market rapid diagnostic tests that are accurate, employ easily obtained specimens, and are simple to perform without instrumentation. Our over-the-counter and professional rapid diagnostic products help to manage existing medical conditions and may save lives through early detection and prompt diagnosis. In the past, tests of this kind required the services of medical technologists and sophisticated instrumentation. Frequently, results were not available until at least the following day. We believe that rapid point of care tests can be as accurate as laboratory tests when used properly, require no instrumentation, give reliable results in minutes and can be performed with confidence in the home or the physician's office. 

&#160;

Biomerica maintains its headquarters in Irvine, California where it houses administration, product development, sales and marketing, customer services and some manufacturing operations. A part of Biomerica's manufacturing and assembly operations is located in Mexicali, Mexico, in order to reduce the cost of manufacturing and compete more effectively worldwide. Biomerica has established wholly owned subsidiaries in Mexico and Germany for future use. The Company expends considerable funds in the effort to ready certain new products for market (both internally developed and licensed from others). We utilize technical personnel to conduct product improvement and technical transfer development activities, as well as explore potential new technologies that the Company may wish to develop. We are currently pursuing the development of two tests for the gastrointestinal market. 

&#160;

Biomerica is a well-established, medical diagnostics manufacturer and distributor, especially active in the Physicians&#146; Office and Clinical Lab space. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

PRODUCTION 

&#160;

Most of our diagnostic test kits are processed and assembled at our facilities in Irvine, California and in Mexicali, Mexico. We established our manufacturing facility in Mexicali, Mexico in fiscal 2003 and moved a significant portion of our diagnostic production (primarily a portion of our packaging and assembly) to that facility. We sublease facilities from and subcontract with Lancer Orthodontics (a former subsidiary) (&#147;Lancer&#148;) to provide labor and other services. Production of diagnostic tests can involve formulating component antibodies and antigens in specified concentrations, attaching a tracer to the antigen, filling components into vials, packaging and labeling. We continually engage in quality control procedures to assure the consistency and quality of our products and to comply with applicable FDA and international regulations. 

&#160;

Our manufacturing operations are regulated by the FDA Good Manufacturing Practices for medical devices. We have an internal Quality department that monitors and evaluates product quality and output. We also have an internal Quality Systems department which ensures that our operating procedures are in compliance with current FDA, CE Mark and International Organization for Standardization &#160; (&#147;ISO&#148;) regulations. We either produce our own antibodies and antigens or purchase these materials from qualified vendors. We have alternate, approved sources for most critical raw materials and are working to procure alternate sources for the few that we do not have. Based on our experience, we do not believe that material availability in the foreseeable future will be a problem. 

&#160;

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 

&#160;

We are currently pursuing the development of two tests for the gastrointestinal market. Our increase in research and development spending is due to our focus on these tests and the feasibility of possible FDA clearance for such tests. The Company also utilizes technical personnel to conduct other development activities and improve existing products, as well as explore potential new technologies that the Company may wish to develop. Research and development expenses include the costs of materials, supplies, personnel, consultants, facilities and equipment as well as outside contract services. Consolidated research and development expenses incurred by Biomerica for the years ended May 31, 2016 and 2015 aggregated $780,333 and $733,640, respectively. 

&#160;

InFoods&#174; is a new approach to the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) &#151;a large market with a lot of space for better solutions. Our Company&#146;s GI focus has led us to the development of a diagnostic-guided therapy for treatment of all subtypes of IBS (IBS-C, IBS-D and IBS-M). Specifically, we are developing a patent-pending method that is designed to identify patient-specific foods, the avoidance of which could alleviate an individual&#146;s IBS symptoms. A point-of-care product is being developed to allow physicians to perform the test in-office using a finger stick blood sample and could provide new incremental revenues to a GI medical practice. A billable CPT code that can be used by both clinical labs and physicians&#146; offices is available for InFoods&#174; diagnostic products. The clinical lab product will be the first product we plan to submit for regulatory clearance. The InFoods&#174; product is unique in that it has no drug-type side effects. 

&#160;

We are planning to pursue a de novo 510(k) rather than a PMA (Premarket Approval Application). De novo clearance is faster and less expensive than the PMA route, which is the most stringent type of device marketing application required by the FDA. 

&#160;

MARKETS AND METHODS OF DISTRIBUTION 

&#160;

Biomerica has approximately 340 current customers for its diagnostic business, of which approximately 100 are foreign distributors, 40 are domestic distributors and the balance are hospital and clinical laboratories, medical research institutions, medical schools, pharmaceutical companies, chain drugstores, wholesalers and physicians' offices. 

&#160;

We rely on affiliated and unaffiliated distributors, advertising in medical and trade journals, exhibitions at trade shows, direct mailings and an internal sales staff to market our diagnostic products. We target two main markets: (a) clinical laboratories and (b) point of care testing (physicians' offices and over-the-counter drug stores). &#160;

&#160;

For the years ended May 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had one distributor which accounted for &#173;30.3% and 16.3%, respectively, of consolidated sales. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

BACKLOG 

&#160;

At May 31, 2016 and 2015, Biomerica had a backlog of approximately and $386,000 and $154,000, respectively. 

&#160;

RAW MATERIALS 

&#160;

The principal raw materials utilized by Biomerica consist of various chemicals, serums, reagents and packaging supplies. Almost all of our raw materials are available from several sources, and we are not dependent upon any single source of supply or a few suppliers. However, due to the limited number of suppliers of some materials, especially those such as antibodies, there is always the possibility that the Company may encounter difficulty in the future obtaining key raw materials for its manufacturing processes or that such materials may be exceedingly costly. For the year ended May 31, 2016, two companies combined accounted for 25.3% of the purchases of raw materials. For the year ended May 31, 2015, one company accounted for 13.6% of the purchases of raw materials. 

&#160;

Our inventory consists of various types of materials including antibodies, antigens, bottles, boxes, various chemicals and reagents utilized in the manufacture of our test kits as well as products in various stages of completion. 

&#160;

COMPETITION 

&#160;

Immunodiagnostic products are currently produced by more than 100 companies. Biomerica is not a significant player in the overall market. 

&#160;

Our competitors vary greatly in size. Many are divisions or subsidiaries of well-established medical and pharmaceutical companies which are much larger than Biomerica and expend substantially greater amounts than we do for research and development, manufacturing, advertising and marketing. 

&#160;

The primary competitive factors affecting the sale of diagnostic products are uniqueness, technology, quality of product, performance, price, service and marketing. We believe we compete primarily on the basis of the uniqueness of our products, the quality of our products, the speed of our test results, our patent position, our favorable pricing and our prompt shipment of orders. We offer a broader range of products than many competitors of comparable size, but have had limited marketing capability. We are working on expanding this capability through marketing and strategic cooperation with larger companies and distributors. 

&#160;

GOVERNMENT REGULATION OF OUR DIAGNOSTIC BUSINESS 

&#160;

Our primary business consists of selling products that are legally defined to be in vitro diagnostic and medical devices. As a result, we are considered to be an in vitro diagnostic and medical device manufacturer, and as such are subject to the regulations of numerous governmental entities. These agencies include the FDA, Environmental Protection Agency, Federal Trade Commission, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, U.S. Department of Agriculture ("USDA"), and Consumer Product Safety Commission. These activities are also regulated by various agencies of the states and localities in which our products are sold. These regulations govern the introduction of new medical devices, the observance of certain standards with respect to the manufacture and labeling of medical devices, the maintenance of certain records, the reporting of potential product problems, and other matters. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The Food, Drug &#38; Cosmetic Act of 1938 (the "FDCA") regulates medical devices in the United States by classifying them into one of three classes based on the extent of regulation believed necessary to ensure safety and effectiveness. Class I devices are those devices for which safety and effectiveness can reasonably be assured through general controls, such as device listing, adequate labeling, and adherence to the Quality System Regulation ("QSR") as well as Medical Device Reporting (&#147;MDR&#148;), labeling and other regulatory requirements. Some Class I medical devices are exempt from the requirement of Pre-Market Notification or clearance. Class II devices are those devices for which safety and effectiveness can reasonably be ensured through the use of special controls, such as performance standards, post-market surveillance and patient registries, as well as adherence to the general controls provisions applicable to Class I devices. Class III devices are devices that generally must receive clearance prior to marketing by the FDA pursuant to a pre-market approval to ensure their safety and effectiveness. Generally, Class III devices are limited to life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices. However, this classification can also apply to novel technology or new intended uses or applications for existing devices. The Company's products are primarily either Class I or Class II medical devices. 

&#160;

Pursuant to FDA requirements, we have registered our manufacturing facility with the FDA as a medical device manufacturer, and listed the medical devices we manufacture. We are also subject to inspection on a routine basis for compliance with FDA regulations. This includes the QSR, which requires that we manufacture our products and maintain our documents in a prescribed manner with respect to issues such as design controls, manufacturing, testing and validation activities. Further, we are required to comply with other FDA requirements with respect to labeling, and MDR regulation which requires that we provide information to the FDA on deaths or serious injuries alleged to have been associated with the use of our products, as well as product malfunctions that are likely to cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. We believe that we are currently in material compliance with all relevant QSR and MDR requirements. 

&#160;

In addition, our facility is required to have a California Medical Device Manufacturing License. The license is not transferable and must be renewed biannually. Approval of the license requires that we be in compliance with QSR, labeling and MDR regulations. Our license expires on November 19, 2016. These licenses are renewed periodically, and to date we have never failed to obtain a renewal. 

&#160;

Through compliance with FDA and California regulations, we can market our medical devices throughout the United States. International sales of medical devices are also subject to the regulatory requirements of each country. In Europe, the regulations of the European Union (&#147;EU&#146;) require that a device have a "CE Mark" in order to be sold in EU countries. The directive went into effect beginning December 7, 2003. The Company has completed the process for complying with the "CE Mark" directives; and In Vitro Diagnostics Directive 98/79/EC. We also comply with ISO 13485 for medical devices. 

&#160;

At present, outside the EU the regulatory international review process varies from country to country. We, in general, rely upon our distributors and sales representatives in the foreign countries in which we market our products to ensure that we comply with the regulatory laws of those countries. We believe that our international sales to date have been in compliance with the laws of all foreign countries in which we have made sales. Exports of most medical devices are also subject to certain FDA regulatory controls. 

&#160;

Biomerica is licensed to design, develop, manufacture and distribute in vitro diagnostic and medical devices and is subject to the Code of Federal Regulations, Section 21, parts 800 - 1299. The FDA is the governing body that assesses and issues Biomerica's license to assure that it complies with these regulations. Biomerica is currently licensed, and its last assessment was in February 2015. During the inspection, the FDA noted five observations that were corrected in a timely manner. Biomerica is also registered and licensed with the State of California's Department of Health Services. The last audit with the State of California was in November 2009 and no observations were noted. The Company believes that all Biomerica products sold in the U.S. comply with the FDA and state regulations. 

&#160;

Biomerica's Quality Management System is in compliance with the EN ISO 13485:2003. EN ISO 13485:2003 is an internationally recognized standard in which companies establish their methods of operation and commitment to quality. 

&#160;

&#160;

We recognize that our foreign sales could be subject to some special or unusual risks, which are not present in the ordinary course of business in the United States. Changes in economic factors, government regulations, terrorism and import restrictions all could impact sales within certain foreign countries. Foreign countries have licensing requirements applicable to the sale of diagnostic products, which vary substantially from domestic requirements; depending upon the product and the foreign country, these may be more or less restrictive than requirements within the United States. Foreign diagnostic sales at Biomerica are made primarily through a network of approximately 100 independent distributors in approximately 65 countries. 

&#160;

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 

&#160;

We regard the protection of our copyrights, service marks, trademarks and trade secrets as important to our future success. We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, patents, service mark and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect our proprietary rights in products and services. We have entered into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and nondisclosure agreements with most of our fulfillment partners and strategic partners to limit access to and disclosure of proprietary information. We cannot be certain that these contractual arrangements or the other steps taken by us to protect our intellectual property will prevent misappropriation of our technology. We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to third parties. While we attempt to ensure that the quality of our product brands is maintained by such licensees, we cannot be certain that such licensees will not take actions that might hurt the value of our proprietary rights or reputation. 

&#160;

BRANDS, TRADEMARKS, PATENTS, LICENSES 

&#160;

We registered the tradenames "Fortel", "Isletest", and "GAP" with the Office of Patents and Trademarks on December 31, 1985. We have also registered the tradename &#147;InFoods&#148;. Our unregistered tradenames are "EZ-Detect", "EZ-H.P" and "EZ-PSA". A trademark for "Aware" was issued and assigned in November 2001 and renewed in 2011. Biomerica has obtained the rights to manufacture and sell certain products. In some cases royalties are paid on the sales of these products. Biomerica anticipates that it will license or purchase the rights to other products or technology in the future. Biomerica has filed several patent applications with regard to new tests to identify possible triggers for causing specific symptoms. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S. Effective copyright, trademark and trade secret protection may not be available in such jurisdictions. Our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights may not prevent misappropriation of our content. In addition, there can be no assurance that Biomerica is not violating any third party patents. 

&#160;

The Company has two royalty agreements in which it has obtained rights to manufacture and market certain products for the life of the products. Royalty expense of approximately $24,000 and $21,000 is included in cost of sales for these agreements for each of the years ended May 31, 2016 and 2015. Beginning in fiscal 2011, the supplier was only required to pay royalties for one of the products due to the fact that the company no longer provides materials to make the other product, which was part of the original agreement. Sales of products manufactured under these agreements comprise approximately 3.5% and 3.2% of total sales for the years ended May 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company may license other products or technology in the future as it deems necessary for conducting business. 

&#160;

EMPLOYEES 

&#160;

As of May 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company employed 36 employees, respectively, one of whom is employed part-time in the United States. The following is a breakdown between departments:

In addition, Biomerica contracts with Lancer for the services of 16 people at its Mexico facility. We also engage the services of various outside Ph.D. and M.D. consultants as well as medical institutions for technical support on a regular basis. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreement and have never experienced a work stoppage. We consider our employee relations to be good. 

&#160;
