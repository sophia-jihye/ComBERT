 ITEM 1. Business 

The Company 

&#160; 

&#160; We were incorporated in May 2007 by private equity funds sponsored by Bain Capital Partners, LLC (&#8220;Bain Capital&#8221;) and Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P. (&#8220;THL,&#8221; and together, the &#8220;Sponsors&#8221;) for the purpose of acquiring the business of iHeartCommunications, Inc., a Texas corporation (&#8220;iHeartCommunications&#8221;). The acquisition was completed on July 30, 2008 pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated November 16, 2006, as amended on April 18, 2007, May 17, 2007 and May 13, 2008 (the &#8220;Merger Agreement&#8221;). As a result of the merger, each issued and outstanding share of iHeartCommunications, other than shares held by certain of our principals that were rolled over and exchanged for shares of our Class A common stock, was either exchanged for (i) $36.00 in cash consideration or (ii) one share of our Class A common stock. Prior to the consummation of our acquisition of iHeartCommunications, we had not conducted any activities, other than activities incident to our formation and in connection with the acquisition, and did not have any assets or liabilities, other than those related to the acquisition. 

Our corporate headquarters are in San Antonio, Texas and we have executive offices in New York, New York. Our headquarters are located at 200 East Basse Road, Suite 100, San Antonio, Texas 78209 (telephone: 210-822-2828). 

&#160;

&#160; 

iHM 

Our iHM operations include broadcast and digital radio, online and mobile services and products, program syndication, entertainment, traffic and weather data distribution and music research services. Our radio stations and content can be heard on AM/FM stations, HD digital radio stations, satellite radio, at iHeartRadio.com and our radio stations&#8217; websites, and through our iHeartRadio mobile application on smart phones and tablets, on gaming consoles, via in-home entertainment, in enhanced automotive platforms and navigation systems. 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we owned 861 domestic radio stations servicing more than 150 U.S. markets, including 44 of the top 50 markets and 84 of the top 100 markets. In addition, we provide programming and sell air time on one radio station owned by a third-party under a local marketing agreement. We are also the beneficiary of Aloha Station Trust, LLC, which owns and operates 

&#160; 

15 radio stations, and the Brunswick Trust, which owns and operates 1 radio station, all of which we were required to divest in order to comply with Federal Communication Commission (&#8220;FCC&#8221;) media ownership rules, and which are being marketed for sale. 

&#160; 

In addition to our local radio programming, we also operate Premiere Networks (&#8220;Premiere&#8221;), a national radio network that produces, distributes or represents more than 100 syndicated radio programs and serves more than 5,500 radio station affiliates. We also deliver real-time traffic and weather information via navigation systems, radio and television broadcast media and wireless and Internet-based services through our traffic business, Total Traffic &#38; Weather Network. 

&#160; 

We also promote, produce and curate special nationally-recognized events for our listeners and advertising partners, including the iHeartRadio Music Festival, the iHeartRadio Music Awards, the iHeartRadio Summer Pool Party, the iHeartRadio Jingle Ball Concert Tour, the iHeart Country Festival, the iHeartRadio Fiesta Latina and our new iHeart 80s Party. 

&#160; 

Strategy 

Our iHM strategy centers on delivering entertaining and informative content across multiple platforms, including broadcast, mobile and digital as well as events. We strive to serve our listeners by providing the content they desire on the platform they prefer, while supporting advertisers, strategic partners, music labels and artists with a diverse platform of creative marketing opportunities designed to effectively reach and engage target audiences. Our iHM strategy also focuses on continuing to improve the operations of our stations by providing valuable programming and promotions, as well as sharing best practices across our stations in marketing, distribution, sales and cost management. 

&#160; 

Promote Broadcast Radio Media Spending. Given the attractive reach and metrics of both the broadcast radio industry in general and iHM in particular, as well as our depth and breadth of relationships with both media agencies and national and local advertisers, we believe we can drive broadcast radio&#8217;s share of total media spending by using our dedicated national sales team to highlight the value of broadcast radio relative to other media. We have made and continue to make significant investments in research to enable our clients to better understand how our assets can successfully reach their target audiences and promote their advertising campaigns; broadened our national sales teams and initiatives to better develop, create and promote their advertising campaigns; invested in technology to enhance our platform and capabilities; and continue to seek opportunities to deploy our iHeartRadio digital radio service across both existing and emerging devices and platforms. We are also working closely with advertisers, marketers and agencies to meet their needs through new products, events and services developed through optimization of our current portfolio of assets, as well as to develop tools to determine how effective broadcast radio is in reaching their desired audiences. 

&#160; 

Promote Local and National Advertising. &#160; We intend to grow our iHM businesses by continuing to develop effective programming, creating new solutions for our advertisers and agencies, fostering key relationships with advertisers and improving our local and national sales teams. We intend to leverage our diverse collection of assets, our programming and creative strengths, and our consumer relationships to create events, such as one-of-a-kind local and national promotions for our listeners, and develop new, innovative technologies and products to promote our advertisers. We seek to maximize revenue by closely managing our advertising opportunities and pricing to compete effectively in local markets. We operate price and yield information systems, which provide detailed inventory information. These systems enable our station managers and sales directors to adjust commercial inventory and pricing based on local market demand, as well as to manage and monitor different commercial durations (60 second, 30 second, 15 second and five second) in order to provide more effective advertising for our customers at what we believe are optimal prices given market conditions. 

&#160; 

Continue to Enhance the Listener Experience. &#160; We intend to continue enhancing the listener experience by offering a wide variety of compelling content and methods of delivery. We will continue to provide the content our listeners desire on their preferred platforms. Our investments have created a collection of leading on-air talent. For example, Premiere offers more than 100 syndicated radio programs and services for more than 5,500 radio station affiliates across the United States, including popular programs featuring top talent such as Ryan Seacrest, Big Boy, Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Glenn Beck, Steve Harvey, Elvis Duran, Bobby Bones and Delilah. Our distribution capabilities allow us to attract top talent and more effectively utilize programming, sharing our best and most compelling content across many stations. 

&#160; 

Continue to Deliver Nationally-Recognized Live Events. We intend to continue to deliver nationally-recognized live events to our listeners, such as the iHeartRadio Music Festival, the iHeartRadio Music Awards, the iHeartRadio Summer Pool Party, the iHeartRadio Jingle Ball Concert Tour, the iHeart Country Festival, the iHeartRadio Fiesta Latina and our new iHeart 80s Party, featuring some of the biggest names in the music industry. 

&#160; 

Deliver Content via Multiple Distribution Technologies. &#160; We continue to expand the choices for our listeners. We deliver music, news, talk, sports, traffic and other content using an array of distribution technologies, including broadcast and digital radio and HD radio channels, satellite radio, digitally via iHeartRadio.com and our stations&#8217; websites, and through our iHeartRadio mobile 

&#160; 

application on smart phones and tablets, on gaming consoles, via in-home entertainment, in enhanced automotive platforms, as well as in-vehicle entertainment and navigation systems. Some examples of our recent initiatives are as follows: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Streaming. &#160; We provide streaming content via the Internet, mobile and other digital platforms. We rank among the top streaming networks in the U.S. with regards to Average Active Sessions (&#8220;AAS&#8221;), Session Starts (&#8220;SS&#8221;) and Average Time Spent Listening (&#8220;ATSL&#8221;). AAS and SS measure the level of activity while ATSL measures the ability to keep the audience engaged. 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Websites and Mobile Applications. &#160; We have developed mobile and Internet applications such as the iHeartRadio smart phone and tablet applications and website and websites for our stations and personalities. These mobile and Internet applications allow listeners to use their smart phones, tablets or other digital devices to interact directly with stations, find titles/artists, request songs and create custom and personalized stations while providing an additional method for advertisers to reach consumers. As of December 31, 2015, our iHeartRadio mobile application has been downloaded more than 800 million times (including updates). iHeartRadio provides a unique digital music experience by offering access to more than 2,100 live broadcast and digital-only radio stations, plus user-created custom stations with broad social media integration and our on demand content from our premium talk partnerships and user generated talk shows. 

&#160; 

Sources of Revenue 

Our iHM segment generated 53%, 50%, and 50% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The primary source of revenue in our iHM segment is the sale of advertising on our radio stations for local and national advertising. Our iHeartRadio mobile application and website, our station websites, national live events and Total Traffic &#38; Weather Network also provide additional means for our advertisers to reach consumers. We also generate revenues from network compensation, our online services, our traffic business, events and other miscellaneous transactions. These other sources of revenue supplement our traditional advertising revenue without increasing on-air advertising time. 

&#160; 

Our advertisers cover a wide range of categories, including consumer services, retailers, entertainment, health and beauty products, telecommunications, automotive, media and political. Our contracts with our advertisers range from less than one-year to multi-year terms. 

&#160; 

Each radio station&#8217;s local sales staff solicits advertising directly from local advertisers or indirectly through advertising agencies. Our ability to produce content that respond to the specific needs of our advertisers helps to build local direct advertising relationships. To generate national advertising sales, we leverage national sales teams and engage our Katz Media unit, which specializes in soliciting radio advertising sales on a national level for us and other radio and television companies. National sales representatives such as Katz Media obtain advertising principally from advertising agencies located outside the station&#8217;s market and receive commissions based on advertising sold. 

&#160; 

Advertising rates are principally based on the length of the spot and how many people in a targeted audience listen to our stations, as measured by independent ratings services. A station&#8217;s format can be important in determining the size and characteristics of its listening audience, and advertising rates are influenced by the station&#8217;s ability to attract and target audiences that advertisers aim to reach. The size of the market influences rates as well, with larger markets typically receiving higher rates than smaller markets. Rates are generally highest during morning and evening commuting periods. 

&#160; 

Radio Stations 

As of December 31, 2015, we owned 861 radio stations, including 247 AM and 614 FM radio stations, of which 148 stations were in the top 25 markets. All of our radio stations are located in the United States. N o one station is material to our overall operations. We believe that our properties are in good condition and suitable for our operations. 

&#160; 

Radio broadcasting is subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Communications Act&#8221;). As described in &#8220;Regulation of Our iHeartMedia Business&#8221; below, the FCC grants us licenses in order to operate our radio stations. The following table provides the number of owned radio stations in the top 25 Nielsen-ranked markets within our iHM segment.

Premiere Networks 

We operate Premiere, a national radio network that produces, distributes or represents more than 100 syndicated radio programs and services for more than 5,500 radio station affiliates. Our broad distribution capabilities enable us to attract and retain top programming talent. Some of our more popular syndicated programs feature top talent including Ryan Seacrest, Big Boy, Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Glenn Beck, Steve Harvey, Elvis Duran, Bobby Bones and Delilah. We believe recruiting and retaining top talent is an important component of the success of our radio networks. 

&#160; 

Total Traffic &#38; Weather Network 

Total Traffic &#38; Weather Network delivers real-time local traffic flow and incident information along with weather updates to more than 1,800 radio and approximately 130 television affiliates, as well as through Internet and mobile partnerships, reaching over 200 million consumers each month. Total Traffic &#38; Weather Network services more than 190 markets in the United States, Canada and Mexico. It operates the largest broadcast traffic navigation network in North America and has expanded its offerings to include news and sports content. 

&#160; 

Competition 

Our broadcast radio stations, as well as our mobile and digital applications and our traffic business, compete for listeners and advertising revenues directly with other radio stations within their respective markets, as well as with other advertising media, including broadcast and cable television, online, print media, outdoor advertising, satellite radio, direct mail and other forms of advertisement. In addition, the radio broadcasting industry is subject to competition from services that use media technologies such as Internet-based media, mobile applications and other digital radio services. Such services reach national and local audiences with multi-channel, multi-format, digital radio services. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Our broadcast radio stations compete for listeners primarily on the basis of program content that appeals to a particular demographic group. Our targeted listener base of specific demographic groups in each of our markets allows us to attract advertisers seeking to reach those listeners. 

&#160; 

Americas Outdoor Advertising 

We are one of the largest outdoor advertising companies in North America (based on revenues), which includes the United States, Canada and Latin America. Approximately 90% of our revenue in our Americas outdoor advertising segment was derived from the United States in each of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. As of December 31, 2015, we own or operate approximately 107,000 display structures in our Americas outdoor segment with operations in 44 of the 50 largest markets in the United States, including all of the 20 largest markets. 

&#160; 

In the first quarter of 2016, Americas outdoor sold nine non-strategic outdoor markets including Cleveland and Columbus, Ohio, Des Moines, Iowa, Ft. Smith, Arkansas, Memphis, Tennessee, Portland, Oregon, Reno, Nevada, Seattle, Washington and Wichita, Kansas for approximately $602 million in cash and certain advertising assets in Florida. 

&#160; 

Our Americas outdoor assets consist of traditional and digital billboards, street furniture and transit displays, airport displays and wallscapes and other spectaculars , which we own or operate under lease management agreements . Our Americas outdoor advertising business is focused on metropolitan areas with dense populations. 

&#160; 

Strategy 

We seek to capitalize on our Americas outdoor network and diversified product mix to maximize revenue. In addition, by sharing best practices among our business segments, we believe we can quickly and effectively replicate our successes in our other markets. Our outdoor strategy focuses on pursuing the technology of digital displays, as well as leveraging our diversified product mix and long-standing presence in many of our existing markets, which provides us with the ability to launch new products and test new initiatives in a reliable and cost-effective manner. 

&#160; 

Promote Outdoor Media Spending. &#160; Given the attractive industry fundamentals of outdoor media and our depth and breadth of relationships with both local and national advertisers, we believe we can drive outdoor advertising's share of total media spending by using our dedicated national sales team to highlight the value of outdoor advertising relative to other media. Outdoor advertising only represented 4% of total dollars spent on advertising in the United States in 2015. We have made and continue to make significant investments in research tools that enable our clients to better understand how our displays can successfully reach their target audiences and promote their advertising campaigns. Also, we are working closely with clients, advertising agencies and other diversified media companies to develop more sophisticated systems that will provide improved audience metrics for outdoor advertising. 

&#160; 

Continue to Deploy Digital Displays. &#160; Our long-term strategy for our outdoor advertising businesses includes pursuing the technology of digital displays, including flat screens, LCDs and LEDs, as additions to traditional methods of displaying our clients&#8217; advertisements. Digital outdoor advertising provides significant advantages over traditional outdoor media. Our electronic displays are linked through centralized computer systems to instantaneously and simultaneously change advertising copy on a large number of displays, allowing us to sell more advertising opportunities to advertisers. The ability to change copy by time of day and quickly change messaging based on advertisers&#8217; needs creates additional flexibility for our customers. Although digital displays require more capital to construct compared to traditional bulletins, the advantages of digital allow us to penetrate new accounts and categories of advertisers, as well as serve a broader set of needs for existing advertisers. Digital displays allow for high-frequency, 24-hour advertising changes in high-traffic locations and allow us to offer our clients optimal flexibility, distribution, circulation and visibility. We expect this trend to continue as we increase our quantity of digital inventory. As of December 31, 2015, we had deployed more than 1,200 digital billboards in 37 markets in the United States. 

&#160; 

Sources of Revenue 

Americas outdoor generated 22%, 21% and 22% of our revenue in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Americas outdoor revenue is derived from the sale of advertising copy placed on our traditional and digital displays. Our display inventory consists primarily of billboards, street furniture displays and transit displays. The margins on our billboard contracts, including those related to digital billboards, tend to be higher than those on contracts for other displays, due to their greater size, impact and location along major roadways that are highly trafficked. Billboards comprise approximately two-thirds of our display revenues. The following table shows the approximate percentage of revenue derived from each category for our Americas outdoor inventory:

&#160; 

Our Americas outdoor segment generates revenues from local and national sales. Our advertising rates are based on a number of different factors including location, competition, size of display, illumination, market and gross ratings points. Gross ratings points are the total number of impressions delivered, expressed as a percentage of a market population, of a display or group of displays. The number of impressions delivered by a display is measured by the number of people passing the site during a defined period of time. For all of our billboards in the United States, we use independent, third-party auditing companies to verify the number of impressions delivered by a display. 

&#160; 

While location, price and availability of displays are important competitive factors, we believe that providing quality customer service and establishing strong client relationships are also critical components of sales. In addition, we have long-standing relationships with a diversified group of advertising brands and agencies that allow us to diversify client accounts and establish continuing revenue streams. 

&#160; 

Billboards 

Our billboard inventory primarily includes bulletins and posters. 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Bulletins. &#160; Bulletins vary in size, with the most common size being 14 feet high by 48 feet wide. Digital bulletins display static messages that resemble standard printed bulletins when viewed, but also allow advertisers to change messages throughout the course of a day, and may display advertisements for multiple customers. Our electronic displays are linked through centralized computer systems to instantaneously and simultaneously change advertising copy as needed. Because of their greater size, impact, high-frequency and 24-hour advertising changes, we typically receive our highest rates for digital bulletins. Almost all of the advertising copy displayed on traditional bulletins is computer printed on vinyl and transported to the bulletin where it is secured to the display surface. Bulletins generally are located along major expressways, primary commuting routes and main intersections that are highly visible and heavily trafficked. Our clients may contract for individual bulletins or a network of bulletins, meaning the clients&#8217; advertisements are rotated among bulletins to increase the reach of the campaign. Our client contracts for bulletins, either traditional or digital, generally have terms ranging from four weeks to one year. 

&#183; &#160; Posters. &#160; Traditional posters are approximately 11 feet high by 23 feet wide, and the traditional junior posters are approximately 5 feet high by 11 feet wide. Digital posters are available in addition to the traditional poster-size and junior poster-size. Similar to digital bulletins, digital posters display static messages that resemble standard printed posters when viewed, and are linked through centralized computer systems to instantaneously and simultaneously change messages throughout the course of a day. Advertising copy for traditional posters is digitally printed on a single piece of polyethylene material that is then transported and secured to the poster surfaces. Advertising copy for traditional junior posters is printed using silk screen, lithographic or digital process to transfer the designs onto paper that is then transported and secured to the poster surfaces. Posters generally are located in commercial areas on primary and secondary routes near point-of-purchase locations, facilitating advertising campaigns with greater demographic targeting than those displayed on bulletins. Our poster rates typically are less than our bulletin rates, and our client contracts for posters generally have terms ranging from four weeks to one year. Premiere displays, which consist of premiere panels and squares, are innovative hybrids between bulletins and posters that we developed to provide our clients with an alternative for their targeted marketing campaigns. The premiere displays use one or more poster panels, but with vinyl advertising stretched over the panels similar to bulletins. Our intent is to combine the creative impact of bulletins with the additional reach and frequency of posters. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Street Furniture Displays 

Our street furniture displays include advertising surfaces on bus shelters, information kiosks, freestanding units and other public structures, are available in both traditional and digital formats, and are primarily located in major metropolitan areas and along major commuting routes. Generally, we are responsible for the construction and maintenance of street furniture structures. Contracts for the right to place our street furniture displays in the public domain and sell advertising space on them are awarded by municipal and transit authorities in competitive bidding processes governed by local law. Generally, these contracts have terms ranging from 10 to 20 years. As compensation for the right to sell advertising space on our street furniture structures, we pay the municipality or transit authority a fee or revenue share that is either a fixed amount or a percentage of the revenue derived from the street furniture displays. Typically, these revenue sharing arrangements include payments by us of minimum guaranteed amounts. Client contracts for street furniture displays typically have terms ranging from four weeks to one year, and are typically for network packages of multiple street furniture displays. 

&#160; 

Transit Displays 

Our transit displays are advertising surfaces on various types of vehicles or within transit systems, including on the interior and exterior sides of buses, trains, trams, and within the common areas of rail stations and airports, and are available in both traditional and digital formats. Similar to street furniture, contracts for the right to place our displays on such vehicles or within such transit systems and to sell advertising space on them generally are awarded by public transit authorities in competitive bidding processes or are negotiated with private transit operators. Generally, these contracts have terms ranging from five to ten years. Our client contracts for transit displays generally have terms ranging from four weeks to one year. 

&#160; 

Other Displays 

The balance of our display inventory consists of spectaculars and wallscapes. Spectaculars are customized display structures that often incorporate video, multidimensional lettering and figures, mechanical devices and moving parts and other embellishments to create special effects. The majority of our spectaculars are located in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Times Square in New York City and the Gardiner Expressway in Toronto. Client contracts for spectaculars typically have terms of one year or longer. A wallscape is a display that drapes over or is suspended from the sides of buildings or other structures. Generally, wallscapes are located in high-profile areas where other types of outdoor advertising displays are limited or unavailable. Clients typically contract for individual wallscapes for extended terms. 

&#160; 

Advertising Inventory and Markets 

As of December 31, 2015, we owned or operated approximately 107,000 display structures in our Americas outdoor advertising segment with operations in 44 of the 50 largest markets in the United States, including all of the 20 largest markets. Therefore, no one property is material to our overall operations. We believe that our properties are in good condition and suitable for our operations. 

&#160; 

In the first quarter of 2016, we sold our outdoor business in nine non-strategic markets. 

&#160; 

Our displays are located on owned land, leased land or land for which we have acquired permanent easements. The majority of the advertising structures on which our displays are mounted require permits. Permits are granted for the right to operate an advertising structure as long as the structure is used in compliance with the laws and regulations of the applicable jurisdiction. 

&#160; 

Production 

In a majority of our markets, our local production staff performs the full range of activities required to create and install advertising copy. Production work includes creating the advertising copy design and layout, coordinating its printing and installing the copy on displays. We provide creative services to smaller advertisers and to advertisers not represented by advertising agencies. National advertisers often use preprinted designs that require only installation. Our creative and production personnel typically develop new designs or adopt copy from other media for use on our inventory. Our creative staff also can assist in the development of marketing presentations, demonstrations and strategies to attract new clients. 

Construction and Operation 

We typically own the physical structures on which our clients&#8217; advertising copy is displayed. We build some of the structures at our billboard fabrication business in Illinois and erect them on sites we either lease or own or for which we have acquired permanent easements. The site lease terms generally range from one to 20 years. In addition to the site lease, we must obtain a permit to build the sign. Permits are typically issued in perpetuity by the state or local government and typically are transferable or renewable for a minimal, or no, fee. Traditional bulletin and poster advertising copy is either printed with computer generated 

&#160; 

graphics on a single sheet of vinyl or placed on lithographed or silk-screened paper sheets supplied by the advertiser. These advertisements are then transported to the site and in the case of vinyl, wrapped around the face of the site, and in the case of paper, pasted and applied like wallpaper to the site. The operational process also includes conducting visual inspections of the inventory for display defects and taking the necessary corrective action within a reasonable period of time. 

Client Categories 

In 2015, the top five client categories in our Americas segment were retail, business services, media, healthcare and medical, and banking and financial services. 

&#160; 

Competition 

The outdoor advertising industry in the Americas is fragmented, consisting of several large companies involved in outdoor advertising, such as OUTFRONT Media Inc. and Lamar Advertising Company, as well as numerous smaller and local companies operating a limited number of displays in a single market or a few local markets. We also compete with other advertising media in our respective markets, including broadcast and cable television, radio, print media, direct mail, online and other forms of advertisement. Outdoor advertising companies compete primarily based on ability to reach consumers, which is driven by location of the display. 

&#160; 

International Outdoor Advertising 

Our International outdoor business segment includes our operations in Europe, Asia and Australia, with approximately 34%, 35% and 35% of our revenue in this segment derived from France and the United Kingdom for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. As of December 31, 2015, we owned or operated more than 540,000 displays across 22 countries. 

&#160; 

Our International outdoor assets consist of street furniture and transit displays, billboards, mall displays, SmartBike programs, wallscapes and other spectaculars, which we own or operate under lease agreements. Our International business is focused on densely-populated metropolitan areas. 

&#160; 

Strategy 

Similar to our Americas outdoor advertising business, we believe our International outdoor advertising business has attractive industry fundamentals, including the ability to reach a broad audience and drive foot traffic to the point-of-sale, making outdoor a cost-effective medium for advertisers as measured by cost per thousand persons reached compared to other traditional media. Our International business focuses on the following strategies: 

&#160; 

Promote Overall Outdoor Media Spending. Our strategy is to promote growth in outdoor advertising&#8217;s share of total media spending by demonstrating the strength of our medium. As part of this effort, we are focusing on developing and implementing improved outdoor audience delivery measurement systems to provide advertisers with tools to plan their campaigns and determine how effectively their message is reaching the desired audience. 

&#160; 

Differentiate on Sales and Marketing . Over the past five years, we have spent time and resources building commercial capabilities through a company wide sales force effectiveness program and an upgrade in our sales and marketing talent. These capabilities allow us to build and nurture relationships with our clients and their agencies as well as to offer packages and products that meet our clients&#8217; advertising needs. Going forward, particular areas of focus include pricing, packaging and programmatic selling. 

Capitalize on Product and Geographic Opportunities. &#160; We are also focused on growing our relevance to our advertising customers by continuously optimizing our display portfolio and targeting investments in promising market segments. We have continued to innovate and introduce new products in our markets based on local demand. Our street furniture business generates the largest portion of our revenue and that is where we plan to focus much of our investment. We plan to continue to evaluate municipal contracts that may come up for bid and will make prudent investments where we believe we can generate attractive returns. 

&#160; 

Continue to Deploy Digital Display Networks. &#160; Our digital outdoor displays are a dynamic medium, which enables our customers to engage in real-time, tactical, topical and flexible advertising. We will continue our focused and dedicated digital strategy and remain committed to the development of digital out-of-home communication solutions. Through our digital brand, Clear Channel Play, we are able to offer networks of digital displays in multiple formats and multiple environments including bus shelters, billboards, airports, transit, malls and flagship locations. Part of our long-term strategy is to pursue the diversification of our product offering by introducing novel technologies, such as beacons, small cells, wayfinding stations and provision of wifi in our street furniture network, as additions to traditional methods of displaying our clients&#8217; advertisements. We are currently installing these technologies in our various markets. We seek to achieve greater consumer engagement and flexibility by delivering powerful, flexible and interactive 

&#160; 

campaigns that open up new possibilities for advertisers to engage with their target audiences. We had more than 6,600 digital displays in 19 countries across Europe, Asia and Australia as of December 31, 2015. 

&#160; 

Sources of Revenue 

Our International outdoor segment generated 23%, 26% and 25% of our revenue in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Our International outdoor display inventory consists primarily of street furniture displays, billboards, transit displays and other out-of-home advertising displays. The following table shows the approximate percentage of revenue derived from each inventory category of our International outdoor segment:

&#160; 

Our International outdoor segment generates the majority of its revenue from the sale of advertising space on street furniture displays, billboards, retail displays and transit displays. Similar to our Americas outdoor business, advertising rates generally are based on the gross ratings points of a display or group of displays. In some of the countries where we have operations, the number of impressions delivered by a display is weighted to account for such factors as illumination, proximity to other displays and the speed and viewing angle of approaching traffic. 

&#160; 

While location, price and availability of displays are important competitive factors, we believe that providing quality customer service and establishing strong client relationships are also critical components of sales. Our entrepreneurial culture allows local management to operate their markets as separate profit centers, encouraging customer cultivation and service. 

&#160; 

Street Furniture Displays 

Our International street furniture displays, available in traditional and digital formats, are substantially similar to their Americas street furniture counterparts, and include bus shelters, freestanding units, various types of kiosks, benches and other public structures. Internationally, contracts with municipal and transit authorities for the right to place our street furniture in the public domain and sell advertising on such street furniture typically provide for terms ranging from two to 15 years. The major difference between our International and Americas street furniture businesses is in the nature of the municipal contracts. In our International outdoor business, these contracts typically require us to provide the municipality with a broader range of metropolitan amenities such as bus shelters with or without advertising panels, information kiosks and public wastebaskets, as well as space for the municipality to display maps or other public information. In exchange for providing such metropolitan amenities and display space, we are authorized to sell advertising space on certain sections of the structures we erect in the public domain. Our International street furniture is typically sold to clients as network packages of multiple street furniture displays, with contract terms ranging from one to two weeks. Client contracts are also available for longer terms. 

&#160; 

Billboards 

The sizes of our International billboards are not standardized. The billboards vary in both format and size across our networks, with the majority of our International billboards being similar in size to our posters used in our Americas outdoor business. 

&#160; 

Our billboard inventory is primarily comprised of premium billboards and classic billboards and is available in traditional and digital formats. 

&#183; &#160; Premium . Digital premium billboards typically display static messages that resemble standard printed billboards when viewed, but also allow advertisers to change messages throughout the course of a day, and may display advertisements for multiple customers. Our electronic displays are linked through centralized computer systems to instantaneously and simultaneously change advertising copy as needed. Because of their greater size, impact, high frequency and 24-hour 

&#160; 

advertising changes, digital premium billboards typically deliver our highest rates. Almost all of the advertising copy displayed on traditional premium billboards is digitally-printed and transported to the billboard where it is secured to the display surface. Premium billboards generally are located along major expressways, primary commuting routes and main intersections that are highly visible and heavily trafficked. Our clients may contract for individual billboards or a network of billboards. 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Classic . Digital and traditional classic billboards are available in a variety of formats across our markets. Similar to digital premium billboards, classic digital billboards typically display static messages that resemble standard printed posters when viewed, and are linked through centralized computer systems to instantaneously and simultaneously change messages throughout the course of a day. Advertising copy for traditional classic billboards is digitally printed then transported and secured to the poster surfaces. Classic billboards generally are located in commercial areas on primary and secondary routes near point-of-purchase locations, facilitating advertising campaigns with greater demographic targeting than those displayed on premium billboards. Classic billboards typically deliver lower rates than our premium billboards. Our intent is to combine the creative impact of premium billboards with the additional reach and frequency of classic billboards. 

&#160; 

Our billboards are primarily sold to clients as network packages with contract terms typically ranging from one to two weeks. Long-term client contracts are also available and typically have terms of up to one year. We lease the majority of our billboard sites from private landowners, usually for one to ten years. 

&#160; 

Retail Displays 

Our retail displays are mainly standalone advertising structures in or in close proximity to retail outlets such as malls and supermarkets. The right to place our displays in these locations and to sell advertising space on them generally is awarded by retail outlet operators such as large retailers or mall operators either through private tenders or bilateral negotiations. Upfront investment and ongoing maintenance costs vary across contracts. Contracts with mall operators and retailers have terms ranging from three to ten years. Our client contracts for retail displays, either traditional or digital, generally have terms ranging from one week to two weeks. 

Transit Displays 

Our International transit display contracts are substantially similar to their Americas transit display counterparts. They are advertising surfaces on various types of vehicles or within transit systems, including on the interior and exterior sides of buses, trains, trams and within the common areas of rail stations and airports, and are available in both traditional and digital formats. Similar to street furniture, contracts for the right to place our displays on such vehicles or within such transit systems and to sell advertising space on them generally are awarded by public transit authorities in competitive bidding processes or are negotiated with private transit operators. Our transit display contracts often require us to make only a minimal initial investment and few ongoing maintenance expenditures. Contracts with public transit authorities or private transit operators typically have terms ranging from two to five years. Our client contracts for transit displays, either traditional or digital, generally have terms ranging from one week to one year, or longer. 

&#160; 

Other International Displays and Services 

The balance of our revenue from our International outdoor segment consists primarily of advertising revenue from mall displays, other small displays and non-advertising revenue from sales of street furniture equipment, cleaning and maintenance services and production and creative services revenue. Our International inventory includes other small displays that are counted as separate displays since they form a substantial part of our network and International outdoor advertising revenue. We also have a SmartBike bicycle rental program which provides bicycles for rent to the general public in several municipalities. In exchange for operating these bike rental programs, we generally derive revenue from advertising rights to the bikes, bike stations, additional street furniture displays, and/or a share of rental income from the local municipalities. In several of our International markets, we sell equipment or provide cleaning and maintenance services as part of street furniture contracts with municipalities. 

&#160; 

Advertising Inventory and Markets 

As of December 31, 2015, we owned or operated more than 540,000 displays in our International outdoor segment, with operations across 22 countries. Our International outdoor display count includes display faces, which may include multiple faces on a single structure, as well as small, individual displays. As a result, our International outdoor display count is not comparable to our Americas outdoor display count, which includes only unique displays. No one property is material to our overall operations. We believe that our properties are in good condition and suitable for our operations. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Competition 

The international outdoor advertising industry is competitive, consisting of several large companies involved in outdoor advertising, such as JCDecaux SA and ExterionMedia (UK) Limited, as well as numerous smaller and local companies operating a limited number of displays in a single market or a few local markets. We also compete with other advertising media in our respective markets, including broadcast and cable television, radio, print media, direct mail, online, mobile and other forms of advertisement. Outdoor companies compete primarily based on ability to reach consumers, which is driven by location of the display. 

&#160; 

Our business requires us to obtain and renew contracts with municipalities and other governmental entities, which frequently require us to participate in competitive bidding processes at each renewal. Many of these contracts typically have terms ranging from two to 15 years and have revenue share, capital expenditure requirements and/or fixed payment components. Competitive bidding processes are complex and sometimes lengthy. Substantial costs may be incurred in connection with preparing bids for such processes. Our competitors, individually or through relationships with third parties, may be able to provide municipalities with different or greater capabilities or prices or benefits than we can provide. In the past we have not, and most likely in the future will not, be awarded all of the contracts on which we bid. There can be no assurance that we will win any particular bid, or that we will be able to replace any revenues lost upon expiration or completion of a contract. Our inability to renew existing contracts can also result in significant expenses from the removal of our displays. Furthermore, if and when we do obtain a contract, we are generally required to incur significant start-up expenses. The costs of bidding on contracts and the start-up costs associated with new contracts we may obtain may significantly reduce our cash flow and liquidity. The success of our business also depends generally on our ability to obtain and renew contracts with private landlords. 

&#160; 

Other 

Our Other category includes our media representation firm, Katz Media, as well as other general support services and initiatives that are ancillary to our other businesses. 

&#160; 

Katz Media, a leading media representation firm in the U.S. for radio and television stations, sells national spot advertising time for clients in the radio and television industries throughout the United States. As of December 31, 2015, Katz Media represented more than 3,000 radio stations. Katz Media also represents more than 700 television and digital multicast stations. 

&#160; 

Katz Media generates revenue primarily through contractual commissions realized from the sale of national spot and online advertising. National spot advertising is commercial airtime sold to advertisers on behalf of radio and television stations. Katz Media represents its media clients pursuant to media representation contracts, which typically have terms of up to ten years in length. 

&#160; 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 14,400 domestic employees and approximately 4,300 international employees, of which approximately 17,300 were in direct operations and 1,400 were in administrative or corporate related activities. Approximately 800 of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements in their respective countries. We are a party to numerous collective bargaining agreements, none of which represent a significant number of employees. We believe that our relationship with our union and non-union employees is good.

&#160; 

Regulation of our iHeartMedia Business 

&#160; 

General 

The following is a brief summary of certain statutes, regulations, policies and proposals affecting our iHeartMedia business. For example, radio broadcasting is subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC under the Communications Act. The Communications Act permits the operation of a radio broadcast station only under a license issued by the FCC upon a finding that grant of the license would serve the public interest, convenience and necessity. Among other things, the Communications Act empowers the FCC to: issue, renew, revoke and modify broadcasting licenses; assign frequency bands for broadcasting; determine stations&#8217; frequencies, locations, power and other technical parameters; impose penalties for violation of its regulations, including monetary forfeitures and, in extreme cases, license revocation; impose annual regulatory and application processing fees; and adopt and implement regulations and policies affecting the ownership, program content, employment practices and many other aspects of the operation of broadcast stations. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

This summary does not comprehensively cover all current and proposed statutes, regulations and policies affecting our iHeartMedia business. Reference should be made to the Communications Act and other relevant statutes, regulations, policies and proceedings for further information concerning the nature and extent of regulation of our iHeartMedia business. Finally, several of the following matters are now, or may become, the subject of court litigation, and we cannot predict the outcome of any such litigation or its impact on our iHeartMedia business. 

&#160; 

License Assignments 

The Communications Act prohibits the assignment of a license or the transfer of control of an FCC licensee without prior FCC approval. Applications for license assignments or transfers involving a substantial change in ownership are subject to a 30-day period for public comment, during which petitions to deny the application may be filed and considered by the FCC. 

&#160; 

License Renewal 

The FCC grants broadcast licenses for a term of up to eight years. The FCC will renew a license for an additional eight-year term if, after consideration of the renewal application and any objections thereto, it finds that the station has served the public interest, convenience and necessity and that, with respect to the station seeking renewal, there have been no serious violations of either the Communications Act or the FCC&#8217;s rules and regulations by the licensee and no other such violations which, taken together, constitute a pattern of abuse. The FCC may grant the license renewal application with or without conditions, including renewal for a term less than eight years. The vast majority of radio licenses are renewed by the FCC for the full eight-year term. While we cannot guarantee the grant of any future renewal application, our stations&#8217; licenses historically have been renewed for the full eight-year term. 

&#160; 

Ownership Regulation 

FCC rules and policies define the interests of individuals and entities, known as &#8220;attributable&#8221; interests, which implicate FCC rules governing ownership of broadcast stations and other specified mass media entities. Under these rules, attributable interests generally include: (1) officers and directors of a licensee or of its direct or indirect parent; (2) general partners; (3) limited partners and limited liability company members, unless properly &#8220;insulated&#8221; from management activities; (4) a 5% or more direct or indirect voting stock interest in a corporate licensee or parent, except that, for a narrowly defined class of passive investors, the attribution threshold is a 20% or more voting stock interest; and (5) combined equity and debt interests in excess of 33% of a licensee&#8217;s total asset value, if the interest holder provides over 15% of the licensee station&#8217;s total weekly programming, or has an attributable broadcast or newspaper interest in the same market (the &#8220;EDP Rule&#8221;). An entity that owns one or more radio stations in a market and programs more than 15% of the broadcast time, or sells more than 15% per week of the advertising time, on a radio station in the same market is generally deemed to have an attributable interest in that station. 

&#160; 

Debt instruments, non-voting corporate stock, minority voting stock interests in corporations having a single majority stockholder, and properly insulated limited partnership and limited liability company interests generally are not subject to attribution unless such interests implicate the EDP Rule. To the best of our knowledge at present, none of our officers, directors or 5% or greater shareholders holds an interest in another television station, radio station or daily newspaper that is inconsistent with the FCC&#8217;s ownership rules. 

&#160; 

The FCC is required to conduct periodic reviews of its media ownership rules. In 2003, the FCC, among other actions, modified the radio ownership rules and adopted new cross-media ownership limits. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit initially stayed implementation of the new rules. Later, it lifted the stay as to the radio ownership rules, allowing the modified rules to go into effect. It retained the stay on the cross-media ownership limits and remanded them to the FCC for further justification (leaving in effect separate pre-existing FCC rules governing newspaper-broadcast and radio-television cross-ownership). In 2007, the FCC adopted a decision that revised the newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership rule but made no changes to the radio ownership or radio-television cross-ownership rules. In 2011, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit vacated the FCC&#8217;s revisions to the newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership rule and otherwise upheld the FCC&#8217;s decision to retain the current radio ownership and radio-television cross-ownership rules. The U.S. Supreme Court denied review of the Third Circuit&#8217;s decision. The FCC began a periodic review of its media ownership rules in 2010 and issued a notice of proposed rulemaking, but did not complete the proceeding. The FCC has commenced its 2014 periodic review and has incorporated the record of the 2010 review proceeding with a further notice of proposed rulemaking. We cannot predict the outcome of the FCC&#8217;s media ownership proceedings or their effects on our business in the future. 

&#160; 

Irrespective of the FCC&#8217;s radio ownership rules, the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (&#8220;DOJ&#8221;) and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (&#8220;FTC&#8221;) have the authority to determine that a particular transaction presents antitrust concerns. In particular, where the proposed purchaser already owns one or more radio stations in a particular market and seeks to acquire additional radio stations in that market, the DOJ has, in some cases, obtained consent decrees requiring radio station divestitures. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The current FCC ownership rules relevant to our business are summarized below. 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Local Radio Ownership Rule. The maximum allowable number of radio stations that may be commonly owned in a market is based on the size of the market. In markets with 45 or more stations, one entity may have an attributable interest in up to eight stations, of which no more than five are in the same service (AM or FM). In markets with 30-44 stations, one entity may have an attributable interest in up to seven stations, of which no more than four are in the same service. In markets with 15-29 stations, one entity may have an attributable interest in up to six stations, of which no more than four are in the same service. In markets with 14 or fewer stations, one entity may have an attributable interest in up to five stations, of which no more than three are in the same service, so long as the entity does not have an interest in more than 50% of all stations in the market. To apply these ownership tiers, the FCC relies on Nielsen Metro Survey Areas, where they exist, and a signal contour-overlap methodology where they do not exist. An FCC rulemaking is pending to determine how to define radio markets for stations located outside Nielsen Metro Survey Areas. 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Newspaper-Broadcast Cross-Ownership Rule. FCC rules generally prohibit an individual or entity from having an attributable interest in either a radio or television station and a daily newspaper located in the same market. 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Radio-Television Cross-Ownership Rule. FCC rules permit the common ownership of one television and up to seven same-market radio stations, or up to two television and six same-market radio stations, depending on the number of independent media voices in the market and on whether the television and radio components of the combination comply with the television and radio ownership limits, respectively. 

&#160; 

Alien Ownership Restrictions 

The Communications Act restricts foreign entities or individuals from owning or voting more than 20% of the equity of a broadcast licensee directly. It also restricts foreign entities or individuals from owning or voting more than 25% of a licensee&#8217;s equity indirectly (i.e., through a parent company), unless the FCC has made a finding that greater indirect foreign ownership is in the public interest. Since we serve as a holding company for FCC licensee subsidiaries, we are effectively restricted from having more than one-fourth of our stock owned or voted directly or indirectly by foreign entities or individuals. In November 2013, the FCC clarified that it would entertain and authorize, on a case-by-case basis and upon a sufficient public interest showing, proposals to exceed the 25% foreign ownership limit in broadcasting holding companies. In October 2015, the FCC proposed rules to simplify and streamline the process for requesting authority to exceed the 25% indirect foreign ownership limit and solicited public comment on related matters, such as revising the methodology that broadcasters may use to assess their compliance with the 25% limit. 

&#160; 

Indecency Regulation 

Federal law regulates the broadcast of obscene, indecent or profane material. Legislation enacted by Congress provides the FCC with authority to impose fines of up to $325,000 per utterance with a cap of $3.0 million for any violation arising from a single act. In June 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on the appeals of several FCC indecency enforcement actions. While setting aside the particular FCC actions under review on narrow due process grounds, the Supreme Court declined to rule on the constitutionality of the FCC&#8217;s indecency policies, and the FCC has since solicited public comment on those policies. &#160; We have received, and may receive in the future, letters of inquiry and other notifications from the FCC concerning complaints that programming aired on our stations contains indecent or profane language. We cannot predict the outcome of our outstanding letters of inquiry and notifications from the FCC or the nature or extent of future FCC indecency enforcement actions. 

&#160; 

Equal Employment Opportunity 

The FCC&#8217;s rules require broadcasters to engage in broad equal employment opportunity recruitment efforts, retain data concerning such efforts and report much of this data to the FCC and to the public via periodic reports filed with the FCC or placed in stations&#8217; public files and websites. Broadcasters could be sanctioned for noncompliance. 

&#160; 

Technical Rules 

Numerous FCC rules govern the technical operating parameters of radio stations, including permissible operating frequency, power and antenna height and interference protections between stations. Changes to these rules could negatively affect the operation of our stations. For example, in January 2011 a law that eliminates certain minimum distance separation requirements between full-power and low-power FM radio stations was enacted. In March 2011, the FCC adopted policies which, in certain circumstances, could make it more difficult for radio stations to relocate to increase their population coverage. In October 2015, the FCC proposed rules, which could reduce the degree of interference protection afforded to certain of our AM radio stations that serve wide areas. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Content, Licenses and Royalties 

We must pay royalties to copyright owners of musical compositions (typically, songwriters and publishers) whenever we broadcast or stream musical compositions. Copyright owners of musical compositions most often rely on intermediaries known as performing rights organizations (&#8220;PROs&#8221;) to negotiate licenses with copyright users for the public performance of their compositions, collect royalties under such licenses and distribute them to copyright owners. We have obtained public performance licenses from, and pay license fees to, the three major PROs in the United States, which are the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (&#8220;ASCAP&#8221;), Broadcast Music, Inc. (&#8220;BMI&#8221;) and SESAC, Inc. (&#8220;SESAC&#8221;). There is no guarantee that a given songwriter or publisher will remain associated with ASCAP, BMI or SESAC or that additional PROs will not emerge. In 2013, a new PRO was formed named Global Music Rights (&#8220;GMR&#8221;). Irving Azoff, one of our directors, is the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Azoff MSG Entertainment LLC, which owns 85% of GMR. GMR has secured the rights to certain high-value copyrights. Further, certain music publishers have attempted to withdraw their rights from ASCAP and BMI. The withdrawal of a significant number of musical composition copyright owners from the three established PROs, and/or the emergence of one or more additional PROs, could increase our royalty rates and negotiation costs. 

&#160; 

To secure the rights to stream music content over the Internet, we also must obtain performance rights licenses and pay public performance royalties to copyright owners of sound recordings (typically, performing artists and record companies). Under Federal statutory licenses, we are permitted to stream any lawfully released sound recordings and to make ephemeral reproductions of these recordings on our computer servers without having to separately negotiate and obtain direct licenses with each individual copyright owner as long as we operate in compliance with the rules of those statutory licenses and pay the applicable royalty rates to SoundExchange, the organization designated by the Copyright Royalty Board (&#8220;CRB&#8221;) to collect and distribute royalties under these statutory licenses. Sound recordings fixed on or after February 15, 1972 are protected by federal copyright law. Sound recording copyright owners have asserted that state law provides copyright protection for the recordings fixed before that date (&#8220;pre-72 recordings&#8221;). Sound recording copyright owners have sued radio broadcasters and digital audio transmission services (including us) for unauthorized public performances and reproductions of pre-72 recordings under various state laws, and courts in two states have issued decisions favorable to the copyright owners. If one or more of these decisions is upheld on appeal and held to apply to radio broadcasting or Internet simulcasting, it could impede our ability to broadcast or stream pre-72 recordings and/or increase our licensing and negotiating costs of doing so. 

&#160; 

The rates at which we pay royalties to copyright owners are privately negotiated or set pursuant to a regulatory process. In addition, we have business arrangements directly with some copyright owners to receive deliveries of and, in some cases, to directly license their sound recordings for use in our Internet operations. There is no guarantee that the licenses and associated royalty rates that currently are available to us will be available to us in the future. Congress may consider and adopt legislation that would require us to pay royalties to sound recording copyright owners for broadcasting those recordings on our terrestrial radio stations. In addition, the CRB recently issued an initial determination establishing copyright royalty rates for the public performance and ephemeral reproduction of sound recordings by various noninteractive webcasters, including radio broadcasters that simulcast their terrestrial programming online, to apply to the period January 1, 2016-December 31, 2020 under the so-called webcasting statutory license. The rates set by the CRB represent a decrease from the 2015 CRB rates applicable to broadcasters and other webcasters, but the determination has not been finalized and is subject to appeal. Increased royalty rates could significantly increase our expenses, which could adversely affect our business. Moreover, some record companies recently have threatened to seek to enforce certain eligibility conditions applicable to the webcasting statutory license that in the past they had agreed to waive. Some of these conditions may be inconsistent with customary radio broadcasting practices.

Privacy and Data Protection 

We collect certain types of information from users of our technology platforms, including, without limitation, our websites, web pages, interactive features, applications, Twitter and Facebook pages, and mobile application (&#8220;Platforms&#8221;), in accordance with the privacy policies and terms of use posted on the applicable Platform. We collect personally identifiable information directly from Platform users in several ways, including when a user purchases our products or services, registers to use our services, fills out a listener profile, posts comments, uses our social networking features, participates in polls and contests and signs up to receive email newsletters. We also may obtain information about our listeners from other listeners and third parties. We use the information we collect about and from Platform users for a variety of business purposes. 

&#160; 

As a company conducting business on the Internet, we are subject to a number of laws and regulations relating to consumer protection, information security, data protection and privacy, among other things. Many of these laws and regulations are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. In the area of information security and data protection, the laws in several states require companies to implement specific information security controls to protect certain types of personally identifiable information. Likewise, all but a few states have laws in place requiring companies to notify users if there is a security 

&#160; 

breach that compromises certain categories of their personally identifiable information. Any failure on our part to comply with these laws may subject us to significant liabilities. 

&#160; 

We have implemented commercially reasonable physical and electronic security measures to protect our proprietary business information and to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of our listeners&#8217; personally identifiable information. However, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and we may be unable to anticipate or prevent unauthorized access to such information. Any failure or perceived failure by us to protect our information or information about our listeners or to comply with our policies or applicable regulatory requirements could result in damage to our business and loss of confidence in us, damage to our brands, the loss of listeners, consumers, business partners and advertisers, as well as proceedings against us by governmental authorities or others, which could harm our business.

Other 

Congress, the FCC and other government agencies and regulatory bodies may in the future adopt new laws, regulations and policies that could affect, directly or indirectly, the operation, profitability and ownership of our broadcast stations and Internet-based audio music services. In addition to the regulations and other arrangements noted above, such matters may include, for example: proposals to impose spectrum use or other fees on FCC licensees; changes to the political broadcasting rules, including the adoption of proposals to provide free air time to candidates; restrictions on the advertising of certain products, such as beer and wine; frequency allocation, spectrum reallocations and changes in technical rules; and the adoption of significant new programming and operational requirements designed to increase local community-responsive programming and enhance public interest reporting requirements.

Regulation of our Americas and International Outdoor Advertising Businesses 

The outdoor advertising industry in the United States is subject to governmental regulation at the federal, state and local levels. These regulations may include, among others, restrictions on the construction, repair, maintenance, lighting, upgrading, height, size, spacing and location and permitting of and, in some instances, content of advertising copy being displayed on outdoor advertising structures. In addition, international regulations have a significant impact on the outdoor advertising industry. International regulation of the outdoor advertising industry can vary by municipality, region and country, but generally limits the size, placement, nature and density of out-of-home displays. Other regulations may limit the subject matter and language of out-of-home displays. 

&#160; 

From time to time, legislation has been introduced in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions attempting to impose taxes on revenue from outdoor advertising or for the right to use outdoor advertising assets. Several jurisdictions have imposed such taxes as a percentage of our outdoor advertising revenue generated in that jurisdiction. In addition, some jurisdictions have taxed our personal property and leasehold interests in advertising locations using various valuation methodologies. We expect U.S. and foreign jurisdictions to continue to try to impose such taxes as a way of increasing revenue. In recent years, outdoor advertising also has become the subject of targeted taxes and fees. These laws may affect prevailing competitive conditions in our markets in a variety of ways. Such laws may reduce our expansion opportunities or may increase or reduce competitive pressure from other members of the outdoor advertising industry. No assurance can be given that existing or future laws or regulations, and the enforcement thereof, will not materially and adversely affect the outdoor advertising industry. However, we contest laws and regulations that we believe unlawfully restrict our constitutional or other legal rights and may adversely impact the growth of our outdoor advertising business. 

&#160; 

In the United States, federal law, principally the Highway Beautification Act (&#8220;HBA&#8221;), regulates outdoor advertising on Federal-Aid Primary, Interstate and National Highway Systems roads within the United States (&#8220;controlled roads&#8221;). The HBA regulates the size and placement of billboards, requires the development of state standards, mandates a state&#8217;s compliance program, promotes the expeditious removal of illegal signs and requires just compensation for takings. 

&#160; 

To satisfy the HBA&#8217;s requirements, all states have passed billboard control statutes and regulations that regulate, among other things, construction, repair, maintenance, lighting, height, size, spacing and the placement and permitting of outdoor advertising structures. We are not aware of any state that has passed control statutes and regulations less restrictive than the prevailing federal requirements on the federal highway system, including the requirement that an owner remove any non-grandfathered, non-compliant signs along the controlled roads, at the owner&#8217;s expense and without compensation. Local governments generally also include billboard control as part of their zoning laws and building codes regulating those items described above and include similar provisions regarding the removal of non-grandfathered structures that do not comply with certain of the local requirements. Some local governments have initiated code enforcement and permit reviews of billboards within their jurisdiction. In some instances we have had to remove billboards as a result of such reviews. 

&#160; 

As part of their billboard control laws, state and local governments regulate the construction of new signs. Some jurisdictions prohibit new construction, some jurisdictions allow new construction only to replace or relocate existing structures and some jurisdictions allow new construction subject to the various restrictions discussed above. In certain jurisdictions, restrictive 

&#160; 

regulations also limit our ability to relocate, rebuild, repair, maintain, upgrade, modify or replace existing legal non-conforming billboards. 

&#160; 

U.S. federal law neither requires nor prohibits the removal of existing lawful billboards, but it does mandate the payment of compensation if a state or political subdivision compels the removal of a lawful billboard along the controlled roads. In the past, state governments have purchased and removed existing lawful billboards for beautification purposes using federal funding for transportation enhancement programs, and these jurisdictions may continue to do so in the future. From time to time, state and local government authorities use the power of eminent domain and amortization to remove billboards. Amortization is the required removal of legal non-conforming billboards (billboards which conformed with applicable laws and regulations when built, but which do not conform to current laws and regulations) or the commercial advertising placed on such billboards after a period of years. Pursuant to this concept, the governmental body asserts that just compensation is earned by continued operation of the billboard over that period of time. Although amortization is prohibited along all controlled roads, amortization has been upheld along non-controlled roads in limited instances where permitted by state and local law. Thus far, we have been able to obtain satisfactory compensation for, or relocation of, our billboards purchased or removed as a result of these types of governmental action, although there is no assurance that this will continue to be the case in the future. 

&#160; 

We have introduced and intend to expand the deployment of digital billboards that display static digital advertising copy from various advertisers that change up to several times per minute. We have encountered some existing regulations in the U.S. and across some international jurisdictions that restrict or prohibit these types of digital displays. However, since digital technology for changing static copy has only recently been developed and introduced into the market on a large scale, and is in the process of being introduced more broadly in our international markets, existing regulations that currently do not apply to digital technology by their terms could be revised to impose greater restrictions. These regulations, or actions by third parties, may impose greater restrictions on digital billboards due to alleged concerns over aesthetics or driver safety.
