 Item 1. Business 

&#160;

The Company was incorporated in Delaware in 1990 and was founded to design, manufacture, sell and service image-directed, computer-controlled robotic software and hardware products for use in orthopedic surgical procedures. On June 28, 2007, the Company completed the sale of substantially all of its operating assets. After completion of the sale, the Company no longer engaged in any business activities related to its former business, described above. The Company&#8217;s current operations are limited to completing a business combination or strategic alliance, when a suitable candidate is identified.

&#160;

The management of the Company intends to identify a target business and effect a business combination with a target business. It is anticipated that any business combination will be by negotiation rather than hostile takeover. At this time, there is no schedule of when it might be able to initiate or consummate a specific business combination.

&#160;

Management has substantial flexibility in identifying and selecting prospective target businesses to evaluate and finally deciding to pursue as an acquisition. In evaluating a prospective target business, management will consider, among other factors, the following:

&#160;

(i) the costs associated with effecting the business combination; &#160;

(ii) the amount of the equity interest it will be able to acquire in the business and opportunity to obtain control; &#160;

(iii) the growth potential of the target business; &#160;

(iv) the experience and skill of the management of the target business and availability of additional personnel for the target business; &#160;

(v) the current and anticipated capital requirements of the target business; &#160;

(vi) the competitive position of the target business in its industry; &#160;

(vii) the stage of business development of the target business; &#160;

(viii) the degree of current or the potential market acceptance of the products or services of the target business; &#160;

(ix) the existence of any proprietary features or intellectual property of the target business; &#160;

(x) the overall financial condition of the target business; and &#160;

(xi) the regulatory environment in which the target business operates. &#160;

In connection with its search for an acquisition opportunity, the Company may engage investment banking firms to help it identify and approach target businesses. The Company currently has an exclusive agreement with MDB Capital Group LLC (&#8220;MDB&#8221;), under which MDB will be entitled to cash and equity based compensation in connection with it finding an acquisition candidate. The cash amount and number of shares under the warrant will be based on the transaction value, if completed. MDB is provided expense reimbursement in connection with a transaction. MDB is a company controlled by Mr. Christopher Marlett, one of our directors and officers, and a company that employs Mr. Robert Levande, one of our directors and officers, and Mr. Gary Schuman, one of our officers. The term of this agreement is currently indefinite, but may be terminated upon thirty days advance notice by either party. Additionally, management will consider retaining one or more independent investment banking firms, each of which will be a member in good standing of FINRA to assist the Company in appraising, structuring and negotiating a potential business combination. These firms may only be engaged if MDB provides a waiver of its exclusivity arrangement with the Company. In connection with its evaluation of a prospective target business, management will conduct a due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meeting with incumbent management, inspecting the facilities, and reviewing the financial, legal and other information made available to the Company.

&#160;

The time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business (including conducting a due diligence review) and to structure and consummate any business combination (including negotiating relevant agreements and preparing requisite documents for filing pursuant to applicable securities laws and state &#34;blue sky&#34; and corporation laws) will not be ascertainable with any degree of certainty until consummation of the business combination. Any costs incurred in connection with the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which a business combination is not ultimately consummated will result in an expense to the Company.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The Company will use its current working capital and other capital resources to consummate a business combination. In addition, because the Company believes that the resources of the Company are not sufficient to fund a business combination, it will have to raise additional capital. The capital may be in the form of equity or debt or both, and will likely be based solely on the business operation and financial condition of the target business. Therefore, it is not possible at this time to determine the amount of capital that will be needed or will be available for a business combination. There currently are no limitations on the Company's ability to privately obtain funds for a business combination. Nonetheless, the Company's limited resources and lack of operating history may make it difficult to obtain funds. Because of certain SEC interpretations and related rules, the Company does not believe it can publicly raise funds prior to a business combination with an operating company, unless the Company has in excess of $5,000,000 in assets.

&#160;

The amount and nature of any funding will depend on numerous considerations, including the Company's capital requirements, potential lenders' evaluation of the Company's ability to meet debt service on borrowings and the then prevailing conditions in the financial markets, as well as general economic conditions. The Company does not have any arrangements with any bank or financial institution to secure additional financing, and there can be no assurance that such arrangements if required will be obtainable or otherwise in the best interests of the Company. The inability of the Company to obtain the funds required to effect a business combination, or to provide funds for an additional infusion of capital into a target business, may have material adverse effects on the Company's business prospects, including the ability to effect a business combination.

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, the Company had no employees, and the Company relies on outside contractors to perform basic and necessary services.
