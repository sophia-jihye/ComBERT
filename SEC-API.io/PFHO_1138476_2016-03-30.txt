 IT EM 1. BUSINESS 

Company History 

Pacific Health Care Organization, Inc. is a Utah corporation incorporated in 1970. Through Medex we manage and administer Health Care Organizations and Medical Provider Networks in the state of California. Through IRC we participate in the business of creating legal agreements for the implementation and administration of Workers&#8217; Compensation Carve-Outs for California employers with collective bargaining units. Through MMC we oversee and manage our utilization review and managed bill review business. Through MMM we oversee and manage our nurse case management services. Through MLS we offer lien representation and Medicare Set Aside services to our clients. 

Business of the Company 

We are a specialty workers&#8217; compensation managed care company providing a range of services for self-administered employers, insurers, third party administrators, municipalities and others. Our clients are primarily located in the state of California, although we have processed bill reviews in 31 other states from our customers as well. Workers&#8217; compensation costs continue to increase due to rising medical costs, inflation, fraud and other factors. Medical and indemnity costs associated with workers&#8217; compensation in the state California are billions of dollars annually. Our focus goes beyond the medical cost of claims. Our goal is to reduce the entire cost of the claim, including medical, legal and administrative costs. As noted above, through our subsidiary companies we provide a range of effective workers&#8217; compensation cost containment services, including but not limited to:

Medicare Set Aside (&#8220;MSA&#8221;) 

According to studies conducted by auditing bodies on behalf of the California Division of Workers&#8217; Compensation, (&#8220;DWC&#8221;) the two most significant cost drivers for workers&#8217; compensation are claims frequency and medical treatment costs. It is the latter that our services impact. 

&#160; 

As of the end of December 31, 2014, according to the Workers&#8217; Compensation Insurance Rating Bureau of California , California (with the highest claims costs in the nation per claim) continues reporting costs for workers&#8217; compensation claims that are well in excess of 188% above the median for all states. Medical costs per claim have risen since 2005 by nearly $30,000 per claim. SB 863, which was an attempt to reduce costs in California, has had little demonstrated results. The use of the highly administered Company medical control tools listed above greatly diminishes costs for unnecessary and prolonged medical treatment. In addition, our network of specially selected and overseen providers are competent in returning injured workers back to modified or full duty in the most expeditious manner, thus saving costs for temporary disability payments. 

While the goal of services we perform is to deliver the highest quality of timely medical care under state guidelines, we also focus on ensuring that the provision of such care significantly reduces the costs associated with payment for claims. 

Health Care Organizations 

HCOs are networks of health care professionals specializing in the treatment of workplace injuries and in back-to-work rehabilitation and training. HCOs were created to appeal to employees, while providing substantial savings to the employer clients. In most cases, the HCO program gives the employer client 180 days of medical control in a provider network within which the employer client has the ability to direct the claim. The injured worker may change physicians once, but may not leave the network. The increased length of time during which the employer has control over the claim is designed to decrease the incidence of fraudulent claims and disability awards and is also based upon the notion that if there is more control over medical treatment there will be more control over getting injured workers back on the job and therefore, more control over the cost of claims and workers&#8217; compensation premiums. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Our subsidiary Medex holds two HCO licenses. Through these licenses we cover the entire state of California. We offer injured workers a choice of enrolling in an HCO with a network managed by primary care providers requiring referrals to specialists or a second HCO where injured workers do not need any prior authorization to be seen and treated by specialists. &#160; 

Our two HCO networks have contracted with over 3,900 individual providers and clinics, as well as hospitals, pharmacies, rehabilitation centers and other ancillary services enabling our HCOs to provide comprehensive medical services throughout California. We are continually developing these networks based upon the nominations of new clients and the approvals of their claims administrators. Provider credentialing is performed by Medex. 

HCO guidelines impose certain medical oversight, reporting, information delivery and usage fees upon HCOs. These requirements increase the administrative costs and obligations on HCOs as compared to MPNs, although the obligations and cost differentials are not currently as substantial as they were in the past. 

Medical Provider Networks 

&#160; 

Like an HCO, an MPN is a network of health care professionals, but MPN networks do not require the same level of medical expertise in treating work place injuries. Under an MPN program the employer client dictates which physician the injured employee will see for the initial visit. Thereafter, the employee can choose to treat with any physician within the MPN network. Under the MPN program, however, for as long as the employee seeks treatment for his injury, he can only seek treatment from physicians within the MPN network. 

The MPN program substantially allows medical control by the employer client for the life of the claim because the employee must stay within the MPN network for treatment. The employer client, however, has full control of only the initial treatment following which, the employee can treat with anyone in the network. In addition, the MPN statutes and regulations allow the injured worker to dispute treatment decisions, leading to second and third opinions, and then a review by an independent medical reviewer, whose decision can result in the employer client losing medical control. 

Unlike HCOs, MPNs are not assessed annual fees and have no annual enrollment notice delivery requirements. As a result, there are fewer administrative costs associated with an MPN program, which allows MPNs to market their services at a lower cost than HCOs. For this reason, many clients opt to use the less complicated MPN even though the employer client has less control over employee claims. 

HCO + MPN 

As a licensed HCO and MPN, in addition to offering HCO and MPN programs, we are also able to offer our clients a combination of the HCO and MPN programs. Under this plan model an employer would enroll its employees in the HCO program; if the employee requires continued treatment for his/her injury subsequent to the HCO medical control period, the employer can then enroll the employee into the MPN program. This allows employers to take advantage of both programs. We believe that we are currently the only entity that offers both programs together in a combination program. 

Workers&#8217; Compensation Carve-outs 

&#160; 

Through IRC we seek to create legal agreements for the implementation of Workers&#8217; Compensation Carve-Outs for California employers with collective bargaining units and the administration of such programs within the statutory and regulatory requirements. The California legislature permits employers and employees to engage in collective bargaining over alternative systems to resolve disputes in the workers&#8217; compensation context. These systems are called carve-outs because the employers and employees covered by such collective bargaining agreements are carved out from the state workers&#8217; compensation system. 

Utilization Review 

&#160; 

Utilization review includes &#160; utilization review or utilization management functions that prospectively, retrospectively, or concurrently review and approve, modify, delay, or deny, based in whole or in part on medical necessity to cure and relieve, treatment recommendations by physicians, prior to, retrospectively, or concurrently with the provision of such medical treatment services pursuant to California Workers&#8217; Compensation law, or other jurisdictional statutes. 

We provide UR to self-insured clients, insurance companies and public entities through MMC. UR helps to reduce costs for the payor and determine if the recommended treatment is appropriate. MMC offers automated review services that can cut the overhead costs of our clients and increase payer savings. Our UR staff is experienced in the workers&#8217; compensation industry and dedicated to providing a high standard of customer service. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Medical Bill Review 

&#160; 

Medical bill review &#160; refers to professional analysis of medical provider, services, or equipment billing to ascertain the proper reimbursement. Such services include, but are not limited to, coding review and rebundling, customary and reasonableness review, fee schedule analysis, out-of-network bill review, pharmacy review, PPO management, and repricing. 

In connection with our MBR services, we provide bill review (cost containment) services to self-insured employers, insurance companies and the public sector to help reduce medical expenses paid by our customers through MMC. In providing these services we provide network savings on top of State Fee Schedule savings allowing top provider networks to achieve savings. 

&#160; 

We offer our clients quick turnaround, state of the art software and the expertise of our bill review staff. We are committed to service and believe the reputation of our staff sets us apart from our competition. 

&#160; 

Nurse Case Management 

Nurse case management is a collaborative process that assesses plans, implements, coordinates, monitors and evaluates the options and services required to meet an injured worker&#8217;s health needs. Our nurse case managers use communication and available resources to promote quality, cost-effective outcomes with the goal of returning the injured worker to gainful employment and maximum medical improvement as soon as medically appropriate. 

Our credentialed registered nurses have expertise in various clinical areas and extensive backgrounds in workers&#8217; compensation. This combination allows our nurses the opportunity to facilitate medical treatment while understanding the nuances of workers&#8217; compensation, up to and including litigation. By providing these services through MMM we contribute to effective delivery of medical treatment assuring the injured worker receives quality treatment in a timely and appropriate manner to return the worker to gainful employment. 

Network Access and Repricing Fees 

Our network access and claims repricing fees are generated from certain customers who have access to our network and who split with Medex the cost savings generated from their PPOs. &#160; 

&#160; 

Lien Representation 

Through MLS we offer our customers comprehensive lien representation services from negotiation to litigation, including filing petitions for reconsideration. Our lien representation services offer high potential savings for our clients. 

Medicare Set Aside 

In December 2015, MLS commenced offering MSA services for Workers&#8217; Compensation claims which is a financial agreement that allocates a portion of a workers&#8217; compensation settlement to pay for future medical services related to the worker related injury, illness, or disease. The purpose of the Medicaid Set Aside arrangement is to provide fund to the injured party to pay for future medical expenses that would otherwise be covered by Medicare. &#160; This program affords our clients an effective way to overcome complications after settlement and avoids unnecessary costs attached to the claim. 

Significant Customers 

We provide services to insurers, third party administrators, self-administered employers, municipalities and other industries. We are able to provide our full range of services to virtually any size employer in the state of California. We are also able to provide to our significant customers UR, MBR, NCM, network access fee and MSA services both inside and outside the state of California. 

During 2015, AmTrust North America (&#8220;AmTrust&#8221;) and Carl Warren &#38; Company (&#8220;Carl Warren&#8221;) accounted for approximately 31% and 13%, respectively, of our total sales. During 2014, AmTrust, Companion Property and Casualty Insurance Co. (&#8220;Companion&#8221;) and Prime Health Services, Inc. (&#8220;Prime&#8221;), previously reported as our third-party partner for UR services, accounted for approximately 19%, 13% and 13%, respectively of our total sales. 

As previously reported, effective June 1, 2015, Companion ceased using our MBR services following its acquisition by a third party and the decision to take its business in-house. As a result, we realized no MBR fee revenues from Companion during the six-month period ended December 31, 2015. 

&#160;

&#160; 

As previously reported, during the fourth quarter 2015, AmTrust, the Company&#8217;s largest customer, notified the Company it would be terminating the services provided by the Company in December 2015. AmTrust cited changing business needs in its termination letter as the reason for termination. The Company was providing UR, NCM, MPN and network access fee services to AmTrust. We anticipate the loss of AmTrust will significantly impact our profitability and liquidity until such time as we are able to replace the revenues generated from AmTrust. During the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 fees generated from AmTrust were approximately $2,564,042 and $1,804,095, respectively. 

&#160;

Competition 

We were one of the first commercial enterprises capable of offering HCO services and MPN services in California. Now there are many companies who compete in this market. Many of these competitors may have greater financial, research and marketing experience and resources than we do, and they may therefore represent substantial long-term competition. As of December 31, 2015, in California there were nine certified health care organization licenses issued to six companies. We own two of the nine licenses. This translates into five direct HCO competitors. Only three of these HCO competitors, however, are currently writing HCO business due to the complexity of the HCO regulations and minimal requirements for establishing MPNs. By contrast, there were in excess of 2,242 approved MPNs in the state of California according to the DWC MPN website, (last update January 7, 2016), 97 of which we administer. Also, our customers may establish the in-house capability of performing the services we offer. If we are unable to compete effectively, it will be difficult for us to retain current customers or add new customers, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 

We recently obtained approvals for four MPN filings that are based solely on our status and our expertise. These do not require partnership with any payer, whether carrier or self-insured, and may be readily offered for any client without the delays that were encountered before these regulations were changed. 

We rely on our well-trained and knowledgeable in-house professionals to identify, market and sell our services to insurers, third party administrators, self-administered employers, insurers and others to whom we offer and sale our services. We contract directly with medical providers based on quality determinations rather than the provision of discounted medical services. We believe this provides us a competitive advantage because we can market a direct relationship with providers who have demonstrated expertise in treating work related injuries and writing credible medical reports rather than relying on third party relationships or discounts alone. 

We offer both HCO and MPN programs to potential clients, as well as an HCO/MPN combination model, which we believe also gives us a competitive advantage, because of the manner in which the network was created. While some of our competitors offer either HCO or MPN services, to our knowledge, none of our competitors offers this type of HCO/MPN combination model, nor, in our opinion, do they have the legal and medical expertise to administer one. 

We also offer nurse case management, utilization review, and bill review services. While there are virtually hundreds of much larger competitors in these areas, we focus our business primarily to those employers and payers who use HCO and/or MPN services. We believe this keeps the majority of this business stable and renewable. 

Governmental Regulation 

Managed care programs for workers&#8217; compensation are subject to various laws and regulations. The nature and degree of applicable regulation varies by state and by the specific services provided. Parties that provide or arrange for the provision of healthcare services are subject to numerous complex regulatory requirements that govern many aspects of their conduct and operations. Because managed healthcare is a rapidly changing and expanding industry and the cost of providing healthcare continues to increase, it is possible that the applicable federal and state regulatory frameworks will expand to have a greater impact upon the conduct and operation of our business. 

As discussed above, the provision of workers&#8217; compensation managed care in the state of California is governed by legislation and secondary regulations. The services we provide have developed largely in response to legislation or other governmental action. Changes in the legislation regulating workers&#8217; compensation may create greater or lesser demand for the services we offer or require us to develop new or modified services to meet the needs of the marketplace and compete effectively. We could also be materially and adversely affected if the state of California were to elect to reduce the extent of medical cost containment strategies available to insurance companies and other payers, or adopt other strategies for cost containment that would not support demand for our services. 

&#160;

&#160; 

There has been considerable discussion of healthcare reform at both the federal and state level in recent years. Due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate features of reform initiatives and the timing of their enactment, we cannot predict which, if any, reforms will be adopted, when they may be adopted, or what impact they may have on our business or within the industry in which we participate. 

Employees 

Including the employees of our subsidiaries, as of March 16, 2016 we employed 36 people, all of which are employed on a full-time basis. We also use the services of a number of consultants. In addition, all officers work on a full-time basis. Over the next twelve months, we anticipate hiring additional employees only if business revenues increase and our operating requirements warrant such hiring. 

Reports to Security Holders 

We file annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy and information statements and other filings pursuant to Sections 13, 14 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act, and amendments to such filings with the Commission. The public may read and copy any materials we file with the Commission at its Public Reference Room at 100 F Street N.E., Washington, DC 20549. The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The Commission maintains its internet site www.sec.gov, which contains reports, proxy and information statements and our other Commission filings. We also post an electronic copy of our annual report on Form 10-K on our website www.pacifichealthcareorganization.com, which you can view or download free of charge.
