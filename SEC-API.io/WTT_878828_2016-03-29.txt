&#160;

Market 

&#160;

Since the Company&#8217;s incorporation in the State of New Jersey in 1985, it has been primarily engaged in supplying noise source products, electronic testing and measurement instruments, and RF passive components to various customers. Approximately 89% and 88% of the Company&#8217;s consolidated sales in fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively, were derived from commercial customers. The remaining consolidated sales (approximately 11% and 12%, respectively) were comprised of sales made to the United States government (particularly the armed forces) and prime defense contractors.

&#160;

Products 

&#160;

The Company, through its Microlab subsidiary, designs and manufactures a wide selection of RF passive components and integrated subsystems for signal conditioning and distribution in the wireless infrastructure markets, particularly for DAS, the in-building wireless solutions industry, radio base-station market and medical equipment sector. Microlab&#8217;s passive RF components share unique capabilities in the area of broadband frequency coverage, minimal loss and low Passive Intermodulation (&#8220;PIM&#8221;).

&#160;

Microlab product offerings include: neutral host DAS and co-siting combiner solutions, hybrid couplers and hybrid matrices, cross band couplers, attenuators, RF terminations, RF power splitter and diplexers, as well as RF combiners and broadband combiner boxes for in-building DAS deployments.

&#160;

The Company, through its Boonton subsidiary, designs and produces electronic test and measurement equipment including power meters, voltmeters, capacitance meters, audio and modulation meters, portable

passive intermodulation test equipment for field-based testing of cellular transmission signals and accessory products. These products measure the power of RF and microwave systems used by the military and in commercial sectors like telecommunications.

&#160;

Boonton products are also used to test terrestrial and satellite communications, radar and telemetry. Certain power meter products are designed for measuring signals based on wideband modulation formats, allowing a variety of measurements to be made, including maximum power, peak power, average power and minimum power.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s noise components and instruments (noise source products) are used as a method to provide wide band signals for sophisticated telecommunication and defense applications, and as a stable reference standard for instruments and systems, including radar and satellite communications. Furthermore, noise sources can simulate challenging signaling conditions in data and RF transmission systems. Examples are jitter testing for high speed data lines used in modern computer architecture and signal to noise measurements to optimize wireless receivers and transmitters. Additionally, noise sources are used for jamming RF signals, and blocking or disturbing enemy radar and other communications, as well as insulating and protecting friendly communications.

&#160;

Noise sources also are used in radar systems as part of built-in test equipment to continuously monitor the radar receiver and in satellite communications where the use of back-up receivers are becoming more common as the demand for communication availability and reliability is increasing. This test helps assure that the back-up receiver is functional and ready.

&#160;

The Company also offers a line of broadband test sources serving the Cable Television and Cable Modem industry, including measurement solutions for CATV equipment, Data-Over-Cable Service Interface Specification (&#8220;DOCSIS&#8221;) and Digital TV.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s products consist of several models with varying degrees of capabilities, which can be customized to meet particular customer requirements. They may be incorporated directly into the electronic equipment concerned or may be stand-alone components or devices that are connected to, or used in conjunction with, such equipment operating from an external site, in the factory or in the field. Prices of products range from approximately $100 to $100,000 per unit, with most sales occurring between $2,000 and $35,000 per unit.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s products have extended useful lives and the Company provides recalibration services for its instrument products to ensure their accuracy, for a fee, to its domestic and international customers, and also calibrates test equipment manufactured by others. Such services accounted for approximately 4% and 3% of consolidated sales for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 

&#160;

Marketing and Sales 

&#160;

As of March 18, 2016, the Company&#8217;s in-house marketing and sales force consisted of twenty-one individuals. The Company promotes the sale of its products to customers and manufacturers&#8217; representatives through its web-site, product literature, publication of articles, presentations at technical conferences, direct mailings, trade advertisements and trade show exhibitions.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s products are sold globally through its in-house sales people and by over one hundred manufacturers&#8217; representatives and distributors (i.e., the Company&#8217;s channel partners). Generally, our channel partners do not stock inventories of the Company&#8217;s products. Channel partners accounted for 90% and 80% of the Company&#8217;s consolidated sales for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, no single channel partner accounted for more than 10% of total consolidated sales. The Company does not believe that the loss of any single channel partner would have a material adverse effect on its business.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s relationship with its channel partners is usually governed by written contracts that either run for one-year renewable periods terminable by either party on 60 days prior notice or have indefinite

lives terminable by either party on 60 days prior notice. The contracts generally provide for territorial and product representation. The Company continually reviews and assesses the performance of its channel partners and makes changes from time to time based on such assessments.

&#160;

Management believes that its products offer state-of-the-art performance combined with outstanding customer and technical support. The Company has always placed great emphasis on designing its products to be user-friendly.

&#160;

Customers 

&#160;

The Company currently sells the majority of its products to various commercial users in the communications industry. Other sales are made to large defense contractors, which incorporate the Company&#8217;s products into their products for sale to the U.S. and foreign governments, multi-national concerns and Fortune 500 companies.

&#160;

For the year ended December 31, 2015, no one single customer accounted for 10% or more of total consolidated sales. For the year ended December 31, 2014, one customer accounted for 10% of total consolidated sales. The Company&#8217;s largest customers vary from year to year. Accordingly, while the complete loss or substantial reduction of sales to any large customer could have a material adverse effect on the Company, the Company has experienced shifts in sales patterns with such large companies in the past without any material adverse effect. There can be no assurance, however, that the Company will not experience future shifts in sales patterns not having a material adverse effect on its business.

&#160;

Regional consolidated sales from operations for fiscal 2015 were made to customers in the Americas ($24,946,340 or 75% of total consolidated sales), Europe, Middle East and Africa ($5,885,975 or 18% of total consolidated sales) and Asia Pacific ($2,276,791 or 7% of total consolidated sales). Regional consolidated sales from operations for fiscal 2014 were made to customers in the Americas ($30,480,266 or 76% of total consolidated sales), Europe, Middle East and Africa ($5,212,246 or 13% of total consolidated sales) and Asia Pacific ($4,644,856 or 11% of total consolidated sales).

&#160;

Research and Development 

&#160;

The Company currently maintains an engineering staff (twenty-six individuals as of March 18, 2016) whose duties include the improvement of existing products, the design and modification of existing products and custom products with unique specifications to meet customer needs, and the engineering, research and development of new products and applications. Expenses for research and development also involve engineering for improvements and development of new products for commercial markets. Such expenditures for operations include the cost of engineering services and engineering support personnel and were approximately $3,957,000 and $3,380,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The Company competes against many companies, which utilize similar technology to that of the Company, some of which are larger and have substantially greater resources and expertise in financial, technical and marketing areas than the Company. Some of these companies include Agilent Technologies, Inc., Rhode &#38; Schwartz GmbH &#38; Co. KG, Anritsu Corporation, Kathrein, Commscope and Westell Technologies, Inc. The Company competes by having a niche in several product areas where it capitalizes on its expertise in manufacturing products with unique specifications.

&#160;

The Company designs its products with special attention to making them user-friendly, and re-evaluates its products for the purpose of enhancing and improving them. The Company believes that these efforts, along with its willingness to adapt its products to the particular needs of its customers and its intensive efforts in customer and technical support, are factors that add to the competitiveness of its products.

Backlog 

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s consolidated backlog of firm orders shippable in the next twelve months was approximately $2,500,000 at December 31, 2015, compared to approximately $2,600,000 at December 31, 2014. It is anticipated that the majority of the backlog orders at December 31, 2015 will be filled during the current year. The stated backlog is not necessarily indicative of Company sales for any future period nor is a backlog any assurance that the Company will realize a profit from the orders.

&#160;

Inventory, Supplies and Manufacturing 

&#160;

The Company purchases components, devices and subassemblies from a wide variety of sources. The Company&#8217;s inventory policy stresses maintaining substantial raw materials in order to minimize the Company&#8217;s dependency on third-party suppliers and to improve the Company&#8217;s capacity to expedite production in response to customer orders. However, shortages or delays of supplies may, in the future, have a material adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s operations. For the year ended December 31, 2015, two third-party suppliers each accounted for approximately 10% of the Company&#8217;s total consolidated inventory purchases. For the year ended December 31, 2014, two third-party suppliers each accounted for approximately 12% of the Company&#8217;s total consolidated inventory purchases. No other third-party supplier accounted for 10% or more of the Company&#8217;s total consolidated inventory purchases for either of the years ended December 31, 2015 or 2014.

&#160;

The Company is not party to any formal written contract regarding the deliveries of its supplies and components. It generally purchases such items pursuant to written purchase orders of both the individual and blanket variety. Blanket purchase orders usually cover the purchase of a larger amount of items at fixed prices for delivery and payment on specific dates.

&#160;

The Company primarily produces its products by final and some intermediate assembly, calibration and testing. Testing of products is generally accomplished at the end of the manufacturing process and is performed in-house, as are all quality control processes. The Company utilizes modern equipment for the design, engineering, manufacture, assembly and testing of its products.

&#160;

Warranty and Service 

&#160;

The Company typically provides one-year warranties on its instrument products that cover both parts and labor. The Company, at its option, repairs or replaces products that are defective during the warranty period, if the proper preventive maintenance procedures have been followed by its customers. Repairs that are necessitated by misuse of such products or are required outside the warranty period are not covered by the Company&#8217;s warranty.

&#160;

In cases of defective products, the customer typically returns them to the Company&#8217;s facility. The Company&#8217;s service personnel replace or repair the defective items and ships them back to the customer. Generally, all servicing is done at the Company&#8217;s facility, and the Company charges its customers a fee for those service items that are not covered by warranty. The Company&#8217;s Noisecom and Microlab divisions typically don&#8217;t offer their customers any formal written service contracts. However, the Company&#8217;s Boonton division does offer its customers&#8217; formal written service contracts for a fee.

&#160;

Product Liability Coverage 

&#160;

The testing of electronic communications equipment and the accurate transmission of information entail a risk of product liability by customers and others. Claims may be asserted against the Company by end-users of any of the Company&#8217;s products.

&#160;

The Company maintains product liability insurance coverage and no claims have been asserted for product liability due to a defective or malfunctioning device. However, it is possible that the Company may be

subject to such claims in the future and corresponding litigation should one or more of its products fail to perform or meet its specifications.

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

Proprietary information and know-how are important to the Company&#8217;s commercial success. There can be no assurance that others will not either develop independently the same or similar information and know-how or obtain and use proprietary information of the Company. Certain key employees have signed confidentiality and non-competition agreements regarding the Company&#8217;s proprietary information. There can be no assurance that the terms of such agreements will not be breached.

&#160;

The trademarks &#8220;Boonton&#8221; and &#8220;Noise Com&#8221; are registered in the United States Patent and Trademark Office.

&#160;

The Company believes that its products do not infringe the proprietary rights of third parties. There can be no assurance, however, that third parties will not assert infringement claims in the future.

&#160;

REGULATION 

&#160;

Environmental Protection 

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s operations are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws, ordinances and regulations that limit discharges into the environment, establish standards for the handling, generation, use, emission, release, discharge, treatment, storage and disposal of, or exposure to, hazardous materials, substances and waste, and require cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater.

&#160;

The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (the &#8220;NJDEP&#8221;) conducted an investigation in 1982 concerning disposal at a facility previously leased by the Company&#8217;s Boonton operations. The focus of the investigation involved certain materials formerly used by Boonton&#8217;s manufacturing operations at that site and the possible effect of such disposal on the aquifer underlying the property. The disposal practices and the use of the materials in question were discontinued in 1978. The Company has cooperated with the NJDEP investigation and has been diligently pursuing the matter in an attempt to resolve it in accordance with applicable NJDEP operating procedures. The above referenced activities were conducted by Boonton prior to our acquisition of that entity in 2000.

&#160;

In 1982, Boonton and the NJDEP agreed upon a plan to correct ground water contamination at the site, located in the township of Parsippany-Troy Hills, pursuant to which wells have been installed by Boonton. The plan contemplates that the wells will be operated and that soil and water samples will be taken and analyzed until such time that contamination levels are satisfactory to the NJDEP. In 2014, the Company received approval for a groundwater permit from the NJDEP to carry out the final Remedial Action Work Plan and report. Under the final phase of the Remedial Action Work Plan, there will be limited and reduced monitoring and testing as long as concentrations at the site continue on a decreasing trend.

&#160;

Expenditures incurred by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 in connection with the site amounted to approximately $22,000 and $78,000, respectively . While management anticipates that the expenditures in connection with this site will not be substantial in future years, the Company could be subject to significant future liabilities and may incur significant future expenditures if further contaminants from Boonton&#8217;s testing are identified and the NJDEP requires additional remediation activities. Management is unable to estimate future remediation costs, if any, at this time. The Company will continue to be liable under the plan, in all future years, until such time as the NJDEP releases it from all obligations applicable thereto.

&#160;

At this time, the Company believes that it is in material compliance with all environmental laws, does not anticipate any material expenditure to meet current or pending environmental requirements, and generally believes that its processes and products do not present any unusual environmental concerns. Besides the matter

referred to above with the NJDEP, the Company is unaware of any existing, pending or threatened contingent liability that may have a material adverse effect on its ongoing business operations.

&#160;

Workplace Safety 

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s operations are also governed by laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health. The Company believes it is in material compliance with these laws and regulations and does not believe that future compliance with such laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition. The Company also believes that it is in material compliance with all applicable labor regulations.

&#160;

ITAR and Export Controls 

&#160;

The Company is subject to International Traffic in Arms Regulation, or ITAR. ITAR requires export licenses from the U.S. Department of State for products shipped outside the U.S. that have military or strategic applications.

&#160;

The Company is also subject to the Export Administration Regulations, or EAR. The EAR regulates the export of certain &#8220;dual use&#8221; items and technologies and, in some instances, requires a license from the U.S. Department of Commerce.

&#160;

Government Contracting Regulations 

&#160;

Because the Company has contracts with the federal government and its agencies, it is subject to audit from time to time of our compliance with government regulations by various agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency, or DCAA. The DCAA reviews the adequacy of, and a contractor&#8217;s compliance with, its internal control systems and policies, including the contractor&#8217;s purchasing, property, estimating, compensation and management information systems. The DCAA has the right to perform audits on our incurred costs on all contracts on a yearly basis.

&#160;

Other governmental agencies, including the Defense Securities Service and the Defense Logistics Agency, may also, from time to time, conduct inquiries or investigations regarding a broad range of our activities.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s principal products or services do not require any governmental approval, except for the requirement that it obtain export licenses for certain of its products.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of March 18, 2016, the Company had 113 full-time employees, including its officers, 54 of whom are engaged in manufacturing and repair services, 12 in administration and financial control, 26 in engineering and research and development, and 21 in marketing and sales.

&#160;

The Company considers its relationship with its employees to be satisfactory.

&#160;

The design and manufacture of the Company&#8217;s products require substantial technical capabilities in many disparate disciplines, from mechanics and computer science to electronics and mathematics. While the Company believes that the capability and experience of its technical employees compares favorably with other similar manufacturers, there can be no assurance that it can retain existing employees or attract and hire the highly capable technical employees it may need in the future on terms deemed favorable to the Company.

&#160;
