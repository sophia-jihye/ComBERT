 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Business Development Summary 

Smart Server, Inc., is a development stage company incorporated in the State of Nevada in October of 2013. We were formed to engage in the business of designing and developing a computer application software for mobile phones (smart phones) and tablet computers, such as those based on Apple&#174; and Android&#174; platforms, which is intended to provide customers at participating restaurants, bars and clubs the ability to pay their bill with their smartphone &#151; without even having to ask for the check.

We have designed a website which will be a primary source of information for the general public of the nature of our business. Additionally, we have begun our initial writing, design and programming of our mobile payment solution app. During our initial month of formation we concentrated our energies on analyzing the viability of our business plan, and establishing our business model, including researching the items needed to secure a trademark, filing a trademark application, and developing relationships with mobile app retailers. We are using the services of a website and mobile app developer to design our logo and website and develop our mobile application. We do not presently have a market-ready product, and we currently do not have any customers. As such, we have generated no revenues. 

We are attempting to build Smart Server into a successful designer of a mobile payment solution app for smart phones and other mobile devices. In order to generate revenues during the next twelve months, we must:

1. Maintain our website - We believe that the internet is a great marketing tool not only for providing information on our company, but also for providing current information on our upcoming app as well as industry related information regarding new technology and device updates. We recently launched our updated website, which is not yet fully operational, but we have initiated the process of developing a more advanced site where we can provide a more detailed section regarding proprietary app designs and features. We have paid approximately $5,700 towards the development of our website and application.

2. Develop and implement a product development timeline - Smart Server will require the implementation of a detailed timeline to ensure the Company produces a marketable mobile application. These keys areas will need to be addressed to assist in the assurance of the Company &#146; s success:

&#183;

efficient design and programing writing;

&#183;

extensive Beta testing through friends and family network, or eventually through current users;

&#183;

timely and useful downloadable updates;

&#183;

marketable launch through third party retailer or through the Company&#146;s website.

3. Develop and implement a marketing plan - Smart Server&#146;s planned revenue streams will require an extensive list of contacts to allow for the marketing of our mobile apps. Awareness of the revenue potential Smart Server will be able to deliver through its website and app, will be delivered through the implementation of a number of marketing initiatives including search engine optimization, website completion, hosted video demonstrations, third party service contacts, tradeshow attendance, as well as blogging and other forms of social media which are driven by technology and mobile flexibility. These efforts and the resulting awareness will be key drivers behind the success of our revenue producing operations.

Industry Background and Trends 

Apps are designed to help a user perform specific tasks and are generally downloaded by users from an App store directly onto their smartphone or tablet. Apps are becoming increasingly popular. According to International Dare Corporation (&#147;IDC&#148;) in December 2010, worldwide mobile application downloads are forecast to reach 76.9 billion downloads in 2014, an approximate 700% increase from an estimated 10.9 billion downloads in 2010. While the foregoing industry predictions are based on publicly available third party industry reports, there are wide ranging variations in the predictions regarding the size of the future mobile applications market and undue reliance should not be placed on these statistics.

Business Overview 

Smart Server, Inc. has created a business plan built upon designing and selling mobile apps for smart phones and other mobile platforms such as tablets. Smart Server is striving to design and develop applications which will not only improve the efficiency of the restaurant dining experience, as is the case with our initial app, Smart Server, which provides a platform where consumers and restaurant patrons can pay their tabs directly from their smart phones when using a credit or debit card.

Our Product 

Smart Server is a payment program for Windows, Mac, iOS, Android and Windows Mobile operating systems. This application is database driven using an online Cloud database for active live syncing for the user&#146;s data and accounts. Our application allows consumers to eliminate the inconvenience of having to wait for their server to drop off the tab when dining and instead pay your tab directly from your smart phone with our proprietary technology.

Point of sale (also called POS or checkout) is the place where a retail transaction is completed. It is the point at which a customer makes a payment to the merchant in exchange for goods or services. Smart Server, upon full development of our smartphone application, will integrate with all major hospitality POS systems, including but not limited to Harbourtouch, NCR, POSGuys, AccuPOS, Micros, Focus Restaurant Management Software, and FuturePOS. Our cloud based mobile payment solution will not require any additional hardware and our POS integration system will allow information to flow securely and automatically through the system. Additionally, you won&#146;t have to change or modify your existing merchant processor or interrupt your normal work flow.

Some of the benefits that users will receive from our Smart Server application include:

&#183;

Saves time - Have you ever waited patiently for a server to return your debit or credit card and it was not returned in a timely manner? What &#146; s the point in waiting for your check when you can close out your tab at any time from your smartphone? This can be frustrating when you are in a hurry to pay your bill or you have places to be. With Smart Server you can avoid this entirely by simply paying your bill from your smartphone or tablet at participating restaurants.

&#183;

Reviews - As evident by the popularity of Yelp, &#147;reviews are written by people using Yelp to share their everyday local business experiences, giving voice to consumers and bringing &#147;word of mouth&#148; online. The information these reviews provide is valuable for consumers and businesses alike.&#148; With that being said, we believe an important part of having repeat customers in the restaurant and bar industry is knowing what your customers think about the level of customer service, and the overall experience. To that end, we intend to provide reviews from Smart Server users. Upon implementation, users will be able to review and rate participating restaurants and bars through our app. We believe our reviews will provide valuable feedback to our users, as well as offering an incentive to attract new participating establishments.

&#183;

Promotions - We intend to work with participating restaurants and establishments to offer customers who use Smart Server exclusive rewards, promotions, and special offers. When implemented, these discounts will be available directly from your from and automatically redeemable on your bill.

&#183;

Bill Splitting - Another feature we plan on adding to our app, is a function where Smart Server users can split a bill whenever there are two or more individuals paying the bill. This feature avoids the necessity of having the server split the bill into two separate checks which can be make paying your bill even more complicated, and thus time consuming. When implemented, we believe this feature will make our app even more convenient because it will save your time.

&#183;

Tipping - Yet another feature we intend to make available on our app is the ability to tip your server when paying your bill. Currently, we are researching the viability of adding a mandatory tipping feature to our app, unless the user writes a negative review stating why they decided not to include a tip, whether it was for poor service or the food was unpleasant.

&#183;

Lost debit/credit card - Have you ever handed your credit card to a Server to pay your bill and accidentally left your card? With Smart Server you won &#146; t have to worry about this because you never have to pull your card out of your wallet/purse. This reduces the likelihood of losing your card, your card being stolen, or being forced to come back to pick up your card upon realizing that you left it.

Market and Revenue Generation 

In order to generate revenues during the next twelve months, we must: 

1.

Develop and implement a marketing plan - Smart Server&#146;s planned revenue streams will require establishing a web presence and improved visibility within the public and private sectors. Initially, we intend to generate advertising revenue primarily from display, audio and video advertising on our website. We anticipate that such advertising will be included on our website soon after we have a fully operational website which we anticipate will be by the end of the second quarter of 2016. We also intend to build revenue based upon profits realized through our sales through advertising Apps. A major key factor in the Company&#146;s success will be the building of third party relationships within the restaurant industry and mobile technology industry.

2.

Develop and implement a comprehensive consumer information website - For the foreseeable future, the company&#146;s website (www.smart-server.biz) will be a primary asset and a potential key source of revenue generation, as well as company information. Currently, management is formulating its plan on how best to employ its resources to expand and improve the site. We are working to add to the functionality of the site including: listing participating merchants where customers can use Smart Server as a mobile payment method, real time testimonials and reviews from actual customers, feedback from participating merchants on how Smart Server actually impacts their businesses by tracking order history and preferences of users. Additionally, we need to optimize the site for search engine rank, as well as renew the look and feel of the site to coincide with our objectives for the Smart Server. We are also analyzing the viability of adding feature where users are given personalized offers and rewards for being loyal patrons and using Smart Server while they frequent participating merchants. Thus far, we have not yet recognized revenues from the website nor is there any indication that we ever will recognize direct revenues from our website. We do not presently have a fully operational website or a market-ready product, nor do we have any customers; thus have generated no revenues.

Our operations, to date, have been devoted primarily to startup and development activities, which include the following:

&#183;

Formation of the company;

&#183;

Development of Company logo;

&#183;

Development of our business plan;

&#183;

Filing a Trademark application for our logo;

&#183;

Launching of our preliminary website; and 

&#183;

Begin the design and development of our initial mobile application.

Competition 

There are many companies who compete directly with our products. A number of companies who market and a similar concept have recently emerged, including Uber, Tabbedout, Cover, Dash, iwaitless.com. Most of these companies have significantly greater financial and other resources than us and have been developing their products longer than we have been developing ours. Additionally, there are not significant barriers to entry in our industry and new companies may be created that will compete with us and other, more established companies who do not now directly compete with us, may choose to enter our markets and compete with us in the future.

Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights 

Proprietary rights are important to our success and our competitive position. To protect our proprietary rights, we rely on copyright, service marks and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions. We currently have one pending trademark registration.

We cannot assure you that any of our proprietary rights with respect to our products or services will be viable or of value in the future since the validity, enforceability and type of protection of proprietary rights in Internet-related industries are uncertain and still evolving.

Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult, and while we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software products exists, software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States, and effective copyright, trademark and trade secret protection may not be available in those jurisdictions. Our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate to protect us from the infringement or misappropriation of such rights by others.

In recent years, there has been significant litigation in the United States involving patents and other intellectual property rights, particularly in the software and Internet-related industries. We could become subject to intellectual property infringement claims as the number of our competitors grows and our products and services overlap with competitive offerings. These claims, even if not meritorious, could be expensive to defend and could divert management&#146;s attention from operating our company. If we become liable to third parties for infringing their intellectual property rights, we could be required to pay a substantial award of damages and to develop non-infringing technology, obtain a license or cease selling the products that contain the infringing intellectual property. We may be unable to develop non-infringing technology or obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.

Government Regulation 

Our activities are not currently subject to any particular regulations by governmental agencies other than those routinely imposed on corporate businesses. However, we cannot predict the impact of future regulations on either us or advertisers that may advertise with our Apps.

Employees 

We are a development stage company and has only one part-time employee, Pamela Elliott, who is the Company&#146;s sole officer and director.

We plan to use consultants, attorneys, accountants, as necessary and do not plan to engage any additional full-time employees in the near future. We believe the use of non-salaried personnel allows us to expend our capital resources as a variable cost as opposed to a fixed cost of operations. In other words, if we have insufficient revenues or cash available, we are in a better position to only utilize those services required to generate revenues as opposed to having salaried employees. We do not intend to hire any additional employees within the next 12 months. At such time as the Company would deem it appropriate to hire additional staff, a portion of any employee compensation would likely include the right to acquire our stock, which would dilute the ownership interest of holders of existing shares of our common stock. 

Available Information 

We file annual, quarterly and other reports and other information with the SEC. You can read these SEC filings and reports over the Internet at the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. You can also obtain copies of the documents at prescribed rates by writing to the Public Reference Section of the SEC at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549 on official business days between the hours of 10:00 am and 3:00 pm.

We will provide a copy of our annual report to security holders, including audited financial statements, at no charge upon receipt of a written request to us at Smart Server, Inc., 1960 Graegle Lane, Lincoln, CA 95648.
