 Item 1. Business 

Our Company 

Unless the context otherwise indicates or requires, as used in this Annual Report, references to "we," "us," "our," or the "Company" refer to Spirit AeroSystems Holdings, Inc., its subsidiaries and predecessors. References to "Spirit" refer only to our subsidiary, Spirit AeroSystems, Inc., and references to "Spirit Holdings" or "Holdings" refer only to Spirit AeroSystems Holdings, Inc. References to "Boeing" refer to The Boeing Company and references to "Airbus" refer to Airbus S.A.S., a division of Airbus Group SE. References to "OEM" refer to commercial aerospace original equipment manufacturer. 

We are one of the largest independent non-OEM aircraft parts designers and manufacturers of commercial aerostructures in the world, based on annual revenues, as well as the largest independent supplier of aerostructures to Boeing. In addition, we are one of the largest independent suppliers of aerostructures to Airbus. Boeing and Airbus are the two largest aircraft OEMs in the world. Aerostructures are structural components such as fuselages, propulsion systems and wing systems for commercial and military aircraft. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 , we generated net revenues of $6,643.9 million , and had net income of $788.7 million . 

We derive our revenues primarily through long-term supply agreements with Boeing and Airbus. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, approximately 84% &#32;and 11% &#32;of our net revenues were generated from sales to Boeing and Airbus, respectively. We are currently the sole-source supplier for nearly all of the products we sell to Boeing and Airbus. We are a critical partner to our customers due to the broad range of products we currently supply to them and our leading design and manufacturing capabilities using both metallic and composite materials. Under our supply agreements with Boeing and Airbus, we supply products for the life of the aircraft program (other than the A350 XWB and A380), excluding Airbus commercial derivative models. For the A350 XWB and A380, we have long-term requirements contracts with Airbus. 

We manufacture aerostructures for every Boeing commercial aircraft currently in production, including the majority of the airframe content for the Boeing B737, the most popular major commercial aircraft in history. As a result of our unique capabilities both in process design and composite materials, we were awarded a contract that makes us the largest aerostructures content supplier on the Boeing B787, Boeing's next generation twin aisle aircraft. In addition, we are one of the largest content suppliers of wing systems for the Airbus A320 family. We are a significant supplier for the Airbus A380 and the Airbus A350 XWB (Xtra Wide-Body). Sales related to the commercial aircraft market, some of which may be used in military applications, represented approximately 99% of our net revenues for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2015 . 

Since Spirit's incorporation, the Company has expanded its customer base to include Sikorsky, Rolls-Royce, Bombardier, Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation, Bell Helicopter, Southwest Airlines, United Airlines and American Airlines. The Company has its headquarters in Wichita, Kansas, with manufacturing facilities in Tulsa and McAlester, Oklahoma; Prestwick, Scotland; Wichita and Chanute, Kansas; Kinston, North Carolina; Saint-Nazaire, France; and Subang, Malaysia. 

Our History 

Spirit Holdings was incorporated in the state of Delaware on February 7, 2005, and commenced operations on June 17, 2005 through the acquisition of Boeing's operations in Wichita, Kansas; Tulsa, Oklahoma and McAlester, Oklahoma (the "Boeing Acquisition") by an investor group led by Onex Partners LP and Onex Corporation (together with its affiliates, "Onex"). Boeing's commercial aerostructures manufacturing operations in Wichita, Kansas and Tulsa and McAlester, Oklahoma, are referred to in this Report as "Boeing Wichita." Spirit Holdings, Spirit's parent company, has had publicly traded shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker "SPR" since November 2006. 

In connection with the Boeing Acquisition, we entered into long-term supply agreements under which we are Boeing's exclusive supplier for substantially all of the products and services provided by Boeing Wichita to Boeing prior to the Boeing Acquisition, including products for Boeing's B737, B747, B767 and B777 commercial aircraft programs, as well as for certain products for Boeing's B787 program. These supply agreements cover the life of these programs, including any commercial derivative models. 

On April 1, 2006, we became a supplier to Airbus through our acquisition of the aerostructures division of BAE Systems (Operations) Limited, referred to in this Report as "BAE Systems." The acquired division of BAE Systems is referred to in this Report as "BAE Aerostructures," and the acquisition of BAE Aerostructures is referred to as the "BAE Acquisition." BAE Aerostructures was subsequently renamed Spirit AeroSystems (Europe) Limited and is referred to in this report as "Spirit Europe." 

In November 2006, we issued and sold 10,416,667 shares of our class A common stock and certain selling stockholders sold 52,929,167 shares of our class A common stock at a price to the public of $26.00 per share in our initial public offering. In May 2007, certain selling stockholders sold 34,340,484 shares of our class A common stock at a price to the public of $33.50 per share 

in a secondary offering of our class A common stock. In April 2011, certain selling stockholders sold 10,307,375 shares of our class A common stock at a price to the underwriters of $24.49 per share in a secondary offering of our class A common stock. In March, June and August 2014, certain selling stockholders sold 22,915,300 shares of our class A common stock at prices to the public ranging from $28.62 to $35.90 per share in secondary offerings of our class A common stock. Following the August 2014 offering, Onex no longer held any investment in the Company. 

Our Relationship with Boeing 

Supply Agreement with Boeing for B737, B747, B767 and B777 Platforms 

Overview. In connection with the Boeing Acquisition, Spirit entered into long-term supply agreements under which we became Boeing's exclusive supplier for substantially all of the products and services provided by Boeing Wichita to Boeing prior to the closing of the Boeing Acquisition. The main supply contract is primarily comprised of two separate agreements: (1) the Special Business Provisions, or Sustaining SBP, which sets forth the specific terms of the supply arrangement with regard to Boeing's B737, B747, B767 and B777 aircraft and (2) the General Terms Agreement, or GTA, which sets forth other general contractual provisions relating to our various supply arrangements with Boeing, including provisions relating to termination, events of default, assignment, ordering procedures, inspections and quality controls. The summary below describes provisions contained in both the Sustaining SBP and the GTA as both agreements govern the main supply arrangement. We refer to the Sustaining SBP, the GTA and any related purchase order or contract collectively as the "Supply Agreement." The Supply Agreement is a requirements contract which covers certain products, including fuselages, struts/pylons and nacelles (including thrust reversers), wings and wing components, as well as tooling, for Boeing B737, B747, B767 and B777 commercial aircraft programs for the life of these programs, including any commercial derivative models. During the term of the Supply Agreement and absent default by Spirit, Boeing is obligated to purchase from Spirit all of its requirements for products covered by the Supply Agreement. Although Boeing is not required to maintain a minimum production rate, Boeing is subject to a maximum production rate above which it must negotiate with us regarding responsibility for non-recurring expenditures related to a capacity increase. 

Pricing. The initial pricing terms for recurring products under the Supply Agreement expired in May 2013. Under these terms, prices were adjusted each year based on a quantity-based price adjustment formula described in the Supply Agreement whereby average per-unit prices are higher at lower volumes and lower at higher volumes. Prices are subject to adjustment for abnormal inflation (above a specified level in any year) and for certain production, schedule and other changes. See "Changes" below. 

In April 2014, we entered into a Memorandum of Agreement with Boeing that established pricing terms for the B737, B747, B767 and B777 programs for the period commencing on April 1, 2014 and ending on December 31, 2015 under the Company's long-term supply contract with Boeing covering products for such programs. The new pricing terms were not applied to the period prior to April 1, 2014. The new prices do not apply to the 737 MAX, for which recurring pricing has not yet been agreed. Since the parties have been unable to agree upon pricing on the B737, B747, B767 and B777 platforms for the periods beyond 2015, an interim payment mechanism has been triggered for deliveries under the Supply Agreement commencing January 1, 2016. This interim payment mechanism is based upon existing prices, adjusted using a quantity-based price adjustment formula and specified annual escalation. The interim payment mechanism is subject to adjustment when follow-on pricing is agreed upon. Prices for commercial derivative models are to be negotiated in good faith by the parties based on then-prevailing market conditions. If the parties cannot agree on price, then they must engage in dispute resolution pursuant to agreed-upon procedures. 

Tooling. Under the Supply Agreement, Boeing owns all tooling used in production or inspection of products covered by the Supply Agreement. Spirit is responsible for providing all new tooling required for manufacturing and delivering products under the Supply Agreement, and Boeing acquires title to such tooling upon completion of the manufacturing of the tools and payment by Boeing. Because Boeing owns this tooling, Spirit may not sell, lease, dispose of or encumber any of it. Spirit does, however, have the option to procure certain limited tooling needed to manufacture and deliver both Boeing and non-Boeing parts. 

Although Boeing owns the tooling, Spirit has the limited right to use this tooling without any additional charge to perform its obligations to Boeing under the Supply Agreement and also to provide aftermarket services in accordance with the rights granted to Spirit under other related agreements, including royalty-bearing license agreements. Boeing is entitled to use the tooling only under limited circumstances. Spirit is responsible for maintaining and insuring the tooling. Spirit's rights to use the tooling are subject to the termination provisions of the Supply Agreement. 

Changes. Upon written notification to Spirit, Boeing has the right to make changes within the general scope of work performed by Spirit under the Supply Agreement. If any such change increases or decreases the cost or time required to perform, Boeing and Spirit must negotiate an equitable adjustment (based on rates, factors and methodology set forth in the Supply Agreement) to the price or schedule to reflect the change, except that Spirit will be responsible for absorbing the cost of certain changes. The Supply Agreement also provides for equitable adjustments to product prices if there are order accelerations or decelerations, depending on lead times identified in the Supply Agreement. In addition, the Supply Agreement provides for equitable 

adjustments to recurring part prices as well as the price of non-recurring work upon the satisfaction of certain conditions and upon certain minimum dollar thresholds being met. 

Additional Spirit Costs. In the event that Boeing rejects a product manufactured by Spirit, Boeing is entitled to repair or rework such product, and Spirit is required to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Boeing related thereto. In addition, Spirit is required to reimburse Boeing for costs expended in providing Spirit and/or Spirit's contractors the technical or manufacturing assistance with respect to Spirit nonperformance issues. 

Termination for Convenience. Subject to the restrictions prohibiting Boeing from manufacturing certain products supplied by Spirit or purchasing such products from any other supplier, Boeing may, at any time, terminate all or part of any order under the Supply Agreement by written notice to Spirit. If Boeing terminates all or part of an order, Spirit is entitled to compensation for certain costs. 

Termination of Airplane Program. If Boeing decides not to initiate or continue production of a Boeing commercial aircraft model B737, B747, B767 or B777 or commercial derivative because it determines there is insufficient business basis for proceeding, Boeing may terminate such model or derivative, including any order therefor, by written notice to Spirit. In the event of such a termination, Boeing will be liable to Spirit for any orders issued prior to the date of the termination notice and may also be liable for certain termination costs. 

Events of Default and Remedies. It is an "event of default" under the Supply Agreement if Spirit: 

(1) 

fails to deliver products as required by the Supply Agreement; 

(2) 

fails to provide certain "assurances of performance" required by the Supply Agreement; 

(3) 

breaches the provisions of the Supply Agreement relating to intellectual property and proprietary information; 

(4) 

participates in the sale, purchase or manufacture of airplane parts without the required approval of the Federal Aviation Administration, or FAA, or appropriate foreign regulatory agency; 

(5) 

fails under certain requirements to maintain a system of quality assurance; 

(6) 

fails to comply with other obligations under the Supply Agreement (which breach continues for more than 10 days after notice is received from Boeing); 

(7) 

is unable to pay its debts as they become due, dissolves or declares bankruptcy; or 

(8) 

breaches the assignment provisions of the Supply Agreement (which breach continues for more than 10 days after notice is received from Boeing). 

If an event of default occurs, Boeing has the right to exercise various remedies set forth in the Supply Agreement, including the right to manufacture or to otherwise obtain substitute products, cancel any or all outstanding orders under the Supply Agreement, and/or terminate the Supply Agreement. Boeing is limited, however, in its ability to cancel orders or terminate the Supply Agreement for the defaults described in items (1), (2) and (6) above. In such cases, Boeing may not cancel orders unless the event of default is material and has an operational or financial impact on Boeing and may not terminate the Supply Agreement unless there are repeated, material events of default and certain other criteria are satisfied. Boeing may only terminate the Supply Agreement with respect to the aircraft program affected by the event of default. If two or more programs are affected by the event of default, Boeing may terminate the entire Supply Agreement. Boeing may also require Spirit to transfer tooling, raw material, work-in-process and other inventory and certain intellectual property to Boeing in return for reasonable compensation. 

Excusable Delay. If delivery of any product is delayed by circumstances beyond Spirit's reasonable control, and without Spirit's or its suppliers' or subcontractors' error or negligence (including, without limitation, acts of God, war, terrorist acts, fires, floods, epidemics, strikes, unusually severe weather, riots and acts of government), or by any material act or failure to act by Boeing, each being an "excusable delay," then, subject to certain exceptions, Spirit's delivery obligations will be extended. If delivery of any product is delayed by an excusable delay for more than three months, Boeing may cancel all or part of any order for the delayed products. 

If delivery of any product constituting more than 25% of the shipset value for one or more models of program airplanes is delayed by an excusable delay for more than five months, Boeing may cancel the Sustaining SBP as it applies to such models of program airplanes, and neither party will have any liability to the other, other than as described in the above paragraph under the heading "Events of Default and Remedies." 

Assignment. Spirit may not assign its rights under the Supply Agreement other than with Boeing's consent, which Boeing may not unreasonably withhold unless the assignment is to a disqualified person. A disqualified person is one: (1) whose principal business is as an OEM of commercial aircraft, space vehicles, satellites or defense systems; (2) that Boeing reasonably believes will not be able to perform its obligations under the Supply Agreement; (3) that, after giving effect to the transaction, would be a supplier of more than 40% by value of the major structural components of any Boeing program then in production; or (4) who is, or is an affiliate of, a commercial airplane operator or is one of five named corporate groups. Sale of majority voting power or of all or substantially all of Spirit's assets to a disqualified person is considered an assignment. 

B787 Supply Agreement with Boeing 

Overview. Spirit and Boeing also entered into a long-term supply agreement for Boeing's B787 program, or the B787 Supply Agreement, which covers the life of the program and commercial derivatives. The B787 Supply Agreement is a requirements contract pursuant to which Spirit is Boeing's exclusive supplier for the forward fuselage, fixed and moveable leading wing edges, engine pylons and related tooling for the B787. While the B787 Supply Agreement does not provide for a minimum or maximum production rate, the agreement acknowledges that Spirit is responsible for capitalization to support a rate of ten shipsets per month. If Boeing decides to increase production above ten shipsets per month, and if a certain percentage of the profit margin of the additional revenue due to the increase is not projected to recover expenditures required to increase the production rate beyond that level, Spirit will negotiate with Boeing regarding an equitable price adjustment. &#32; In November 2014, Spirit and Boeing entered into a Memorandum of Agreement (the &#8220;November 2014 MOA&#8221;) which includes an agreement to increase production rates to 12 aircraft per month on the B787 program. Under the B787 Supply Agreement, Spirit also provides certain support, development and redesign engineering services to Boeing at an agreed hourly rate. 

Pricing. Pricing for the initial configuration of the B787-8 model is generally established through 2021, with prices decreasing as cumulative volume levels are met over the life of the program. The B787 Supply Agreement provides that initial prices for the B787-9 and B787-10 are to be determined by a procedure set out in the B787 Supply Agreement, and to be documented by amendment once that amendment has been agreed to by the parties. As part of the November MOA, Boeing and Spirit established interim prices for certain B787 shipsets, and the parties agreed to negotiate future rate increases, recurring prices, and other issues across multiple programs during 2015. Since we were unable to reach agreement with Boeing on these issues by the end of 2015, once the parties agree upon appropriate pricing for the B787-9, Boeing will be entitled to a retroactive adjustment on certain B787 payments which were based on the interim pricing. The amount we received that is subject to a retroactive adjustment was recorded as deferred revenue, and was never recognized by us as revenue. The parties have engaged in discussions concerning how to determine the subsequent B787-9 and initial B787-10 prices, and have not yet reached agreement. Prices are subject to adjustment for abnormal inflation (above a specified level in any year) and for certain production, schedule and other specific changes, including design changes from the contract configuration baseline for each B787 model. In addition, the B787 Supply Agreement provides for both parties to participate in an annual price adjustment process for each B787 model, which involves an evaluation of the cost impact to Spirit as a result of Boeing-directed changes and could result in price adjustments in either direction. 

Advance Payments. Boeing has made advance payments to Spirit under the B787 Supply Agreement, which advance payments are required to be repaid to Boeing by way of offset against the purchase price for future shipset deliveries. Advance repayments were scheduled to be spread evenly over the remainder of the first 1,000 B787 shipsets delivered to Boeing, except that advance repayments were suspended from April 1, 2014 through March 31, 2015, and any repayments that otherwise would have become due during such 12-month period will be made by offset against the purchase price for shipset 1,001 through 1,120. 

In the event Boeing does not take delivery of a sufficient number of shipsets to repay the full amount of advances prior to the termination of the B787 program or the B787 Supply Agreement, any advances not then repaid will be applied against any outstanding payments then due by Boeing to us, and any remaining balance will be repaid in annual installments of $42.0 million due on December 15th of each year until the advance payments have been fully recovered by Boeing. The B787 Amendment also changed the treatment of advances paid by Boeing for certain non-recurring work into a nonrefundable payment in full for such work. 

Accordingly, portions of the advance repayment liability are included as current and long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2015 , the amount of advance payments received by us from Boeing not yet repaid was $515.7 &#32;million. 

Termination of Airplane Program. If Boeing decides not to continue production of the B787 airplane program because it determines, after consultation with Spirit, that there is an insufficient business basis for proceeding, Boeing may terminate the B787 airplane program, including any orders, by written notice to Spirit. In the event of such a termination, Boeing will be liable to Spirit for costs incurred in connection with any orders issued prior to the date of the termination notice and may also be liable for certain termination costs and for compensation for any tools, raw materials or work-in-process requested by Boeing in connection with the termination. 

Events of Default and Remedies. It is an "event of default" under the B787 Supply Agreement if Spirit: 

(1) 

fails to deliver products as required by the B787 Supply Agreement; 

(2) 

breaches the provisions of the B787 Supply Agreement relating to intellectual property and proprietary information; 

(3) 

participates in the sale, purchase or manufacture of airplane parts without the required approval of the FAA or appropriate foreign regulatory agency; 

(4) 

fails under certain requirements to maintain a system of quality assurance; 

(5) 

fails to comply with other obligations under the B787 Supply Agreement (which breach continues for more than 15 days after notice is received from Boeing); 

(6) 

is unable to pay its debts as they become due, dissolves or declares bankruptcy; 

(7) 

fails to comply with U.S. export control laws; or 

(8) 

breaches the assignment provisions of the B787 Supply Agreement. 

If an event of default occurs, Boeing has the right to exercise various remedies set forth in the B787 Supply Agreement, including the right to manufacture or to otherwise obtain substitute products, cancel any or all outstanding orders under the B787 Supply Agreement and/or terminate the B787 Supply Agreement. Before terminating any order or the B787 Supply Agreement, Boeing is required to work with Spirit to attempt to agree on a satisfactory recovery plan. Boeing may also require Spirit to transfer tooling, raw material, work-in-process and other inventory and certain intellectual property to Boeing in return for reasonable compensation. 

Assignment. Spirit may not assign its rights under the B787 Supply Agreement or any related order other than with Boeing's consent, which Boeing may not unreasonably withhold unless the assignment is to a disqualified person. A disqualified person is one: (1) whose principal business is as an OEM of commercial aircraft, space vehicles, satellites or defense systems; (2) that Boeing reasonably believes will not be able to perform its obligations under the B787 Supply Agreement; (3) that, after giving effect to the transaction, would be a supplier of more than 40% by value of the major structural components of any Boeing program then in production; or (4) who is, or is an affiliate of, a commercial airplane operator or is one of five named corporate groups. Sale of majority voting power or of all or substantially all of Spirit's assets to a disqualified person is considered an assignment. 

License of Intellectual Property 

Supply Agreement. All technical work product and works of authorship produced by or for Spirit with respect to any work performed by or for Spirit pursuant to the Supply Agreement are the exclusive property of Boeing. All inventions conceived by or for Spirit with respect to any work performed by or for Spirit pursuant to the Supply Agreement and any patents claiming such inventions are the exclusive property of Spirit, except that Boeing will own any such inventions that Boeing reasonably believes are applicable to the B787 platform, and Boeing may seek patent protection for such B787 inventions or hold them as trade secrets, provided that, if Boeing does not seek patent protection, Spirit may do so. 

Except as Boeing otherwise agrees, Spirit may only use Boeing proprietary information and materials (such as tangible and intangible confidential, proprietary and/or trade secret information and tooling) in the performance of its obligations under the Supply Agreement. Spirit is prohibited from selling products manufactured using Boeing proprietary information and materials to any person other than Boeing without Boeing's authorization. 

Spirit has granted to Boeing a license to Spirit proprietary information and materials and software and related products for use in connection with the testing, certification, use, sale or support of a product covered by the Supply Agreement, or the manufacture, testing, certification, use, sale or support of any aircraft including and/or utilizing a product covered by the Supply Agreement. Spirit has also granted to Boeing a license to use Spirit intellectual property to the extent such intellectual property interferes with Boeing's use of products or intellectual property belonging to Boeing under the Supply Agreement. 

To protect Boeing against Spirit's default, Spirit has granted to Boeing a license, exercisable on such default to practice and/or use, and license for others to practice and/or use on Boeing's behalf, Spirit's intellectual property and tooling related to the development, production, maintenance or repair of products in connection with making, using and selling products. As a part of the foregoing license, Spirit must, at the written request of and at no additional cost to Boeing, promptly deliver to Boeing any such licensed property considered by Boeing to be necessary to exercise Boeing's rights under the license. 

B787 Supply Agreement. The B787 Supply Agreement establishes three classifications for patented invention and proprietary information: (1) intellectual property developed by Spirit during activity under the B787 Supply Agreement, or Spirit IP; (2) intellectual property developed jointly by Boeing and Spirit during that activity, or Joint IP; and (3) all other intellectual property developed during activity under the B787 Supply Agreement, or Boeing IP. 

Boeing may use Spirit IP for work on the B787 program and Spirit may license it to third parties for work on such program. Spirit may also not unreasonably withhold consent to the license of such intellectual property to third parties for work on other Boeing programs, provided that it may require a reasonable royalty to be paid and, with respect to commercial airplane programs, that Spirit has been offered an opportunity, to the extent commercially feasible, to work on such programs. 

Each party is free to use Joint IP in connection with work on the B787 and other Boeing programs, but each must obtain the consent of the other to use it for other purposes. If either party wishes to license Joint IP to a third party for work on a Boeing program other than the B787, then the other party may require a reasonable royalty, but may not unreasonably withhold its consent, as long as (if the program in question is another Boeing commercial airplane program) Spirit has been offered an opportunity, to the extent commercially feasible, to perform work for the particular program. 

Spirit is entitled to use Boeing IP for the B787 program, and may require Boeing to license it to subcontractors for the same purpose. 

Additional License From Boeing. Boeing has licensed certain intellectual property rights to Spirit under a Hardware Material Services General Terms Agreement, or HMSGTA, and four initial Supplemental License Agreements, or SLAs, under the HMSGTA. The HMSGTA and the initial SLAs grant Spirit licenses to use Boeing intellectual property to manufacture listed parts for the aftermarket and to perform maintenance, repair and overhaul, or MRO, of aircraft and aircraft components for customers other than Boeing. These agreements also permit Spirit to use knowledge obtained by Spirit personnel prior to the closing of the Boeing Acquisition. Spirit also may obtain additional SLAs from Boeing and those SLAs will also supersede the restrictions on Spirit's use of Boeing's proprietary information and materials described above. Spirit pays Boeing royalties for the use of these licenses. 

Intellectual Property 

We have several patents pertaining to our processes and products. While our patents, in the aggregate, are of material importance to our business, no individual patent or group of patents is of material importance. We also rely on trade secrets, confidentiality agreements, unpatented knowledge, creative products development and continuing technological advancement to maintain our competitive position. 

Our Products 

We are organized into three principal reporting segments: (1) Fuselage Systems, which includes forward, mid and rear fuselage sections; (2) Propulsion Systems, which includes nacelles, struts/pylons and engine structural components; and (3) Wing Systems, which includes wing components, flight control surfaces and other miscellaneous structural parts. The Fuselage Systems segment manufactures products at our facilities in Wichita, Kansas and Kinston, North Carolina, with an assembly plant for the A350 XWB in Saint-Nazaire, France. The Propulsion Systems segment manufactures products at our facilities in Wichita and Chanute, Kansas, and the Wing Systems segment manufactures products at our facilities in Tulsa and McAlester, Oklahoma; Prestwick, Scotland; Subang, Malaysia and Kinston, North Carolina. Fuselage Systems, Propulsion Systems and Wing Systems represented approximately 52% , 26% , and 22% , of our net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 , respectively. All other activities fall within the All Other segment, representing less than 1% of our net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 , principally made up of sundry sales of miscellaneous services, tooling contracts, and sales of natural gas through a tenancy-in-common with other companies that have operations in Wichita, Kansas. 

As the programs we are involved in move through their life cycles, we classify them based on where they fall in the life cycle. The following table summarizes the program phases and programs in each category:

Commercial Aircraft Structures 

We design, engineer and manufacture large commercial aircraft structures such as fuselages, nacelles (including thrust reversers), struts/pylons, wing structures and flight control surfaces. We are the largest independent supplier of aerostructures to Boeing and one of the largest independent suppliers of aerostructures to Airbus. Sales related to the commercial aircraft structures market, some of which may be used in military applications, represented approximately 99% of our net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 . 

Our structural components, in particular the forward fuselage and nacelles, are among the most complex and highly engineered structural components and represent a significant percentage of the costs of each aircraft. We are currently the sole-source supplier for nearly all of the products we sell to Boeing and Airbus. We typically sell a package of aerostructure components, referred to as a shipset, to our customers. 

The following table summarizes the major commercial programs that we currently have under long-term contract by product and aircraft platform.

Our Competitive Strengths 

We believe our key competitive strengths include: 

Leading Position in the Growing Commercial Aerostructures Market. We are one of the largest independent non-OEM commercial aerostructures manufacturers with an estimated 21% market share of the global market. Based on their published aircraft backlog figures, Boeing and Airbus had a combined backlog of 12,582 commercial aircraft as of December 31, 2015 , and 12,175 commercial aircraft as of December 31, 2014 . We are under contract to provide aerostructure products for approximately 97% of the aircraft that comprise this commercial aircraft backlog. We are currently the sole-source supplier for nearly all of the products we sell to Boeing and Airbus. The significant Boeing and Airbus aircraft order backlog for scheduled deliveries, and our strong relationships with Boeing and Airbus, should enable us to continue to grow our profit from our core commercial aerostructures business. 

Participation on High-Volume and Major Growth Platforms. We derive a high proportion of our Boeing revenues from the high-volume B737 program and a high proportion of our Airbus revenues from the high-volume A320 program. Boeing's backlog consists of approximately 4,400 B737s (more than eight years of backlog at current build rates), including the 737 MAX orders, 

and Airbus' backlog consists of approximately 5,500 aircraft in the A320 family (more than ten years of backlog at current build rates), including A320 NEO orders. The B737 and A320 families are Boeing's and Airbus' best-selling commercial airplanes, respectively. We have also been awarded a significant amount of work on major twin-aisle programs, the B777, B787 and A350 XWB. 

Stable Base Business. We have entered into long-term supply agreements with Boeing and Airbus, our two largest customers, making us the exclusive supplier for most of the products covered by these contracts. Our supply agreements with Boeing provide that we will continue to supply essentially all of the products we currently supply to Boeing for the life of the current aircraft programs, including commercial derivative models. The principal supply agreements we have entered into with Boeing make us Boeing's exclusive source for substantially all of the products covered by the agreements. 

Under our supply agreements with Airbus, we supply most of our products for the life of the aircraft program, including commercial derivative models. For the A380 and A350 XWB, we have long-term requirements contracts with Airbus that cover a fixed number of units. 

Strong Incumbent and Competitive Position. We have a strong incumbent position on the products we currently supply to Boeing and Airbus, forged by long-standing relationships and long-term supply agreements. Several members of our management team have a long history of working in the aerospace industry. We believe our management team possesses inherent knowledge of and relationships with Boeing and Airbus that may not be matched to a corresponding degree between other suppliers and these two OEMs. 

We believe that OEMs incur significant costs to change aerostructures suppliers once contracts are awarded. Such changes after contract award require additional testing and certification, which may create production delays and significant costs for both the OEM and the new supplier. We also believe it would be cost prohibitive for other suppliers to duplicate our facilities and the thousands of major pieces of equipment that we own or operate. The combined insurable replacement value of all the buildings and equipment we own or operate is $6.9 billion, including $2.6 billion for buildings, $2.5 billion for equipment that we own and $1.8 billion for other equipment used in the operation of our business. The insurable values represent the estimated replacement cost of buildings and equipment used in our operations and covered by property insurance, and exceed the fair value of assets acquired as determined for financial reporting purposes. As a result, we believe that as long as we continue to meet our customers' requirements, the probability that they change suppliers on our current statement of work is quite low. Our incumbent position also provides us with a competitive advantage with respect to new business from our customers. 

Industry-Leading Technology, Design Capabilities and Manufacturing Expertise. Spirit AeroSystems, independently, and previously as Boeing Wichita, has over 85 years of experience designing and manufacturing large-scale, complex aerostructures. We possess industry-leading engineering capabilities that include significant expertise in structural design, technology development, test, and regulatory certification (FAA and international civil aviation authorities). We specialize in the use of metallic and composite materials, conducting stress analyses to ensure structural integrity, systems engineering to ensure customer and regulatory requirements are clearly identified and managed, and acoustics technology. 

Drawing on talent across the globe, Spirit AeroSystems is an industry leader in aerospace engineering. We possess knowledge and manufacturing know-how that customers depend on and that would be difficult for other suppliers to replicate. In addition to our engineering expertise, we have strong manufacturing and technological capabilities. Our manufacturing processes are highly automated, delivering efficiency and quality, and we have expertise in manufacturing aerostructures using both metallic and composite materials. We have strong technical expertise in bonding and metals fabrication, assembly, tooling and composite manufacturing, including the handling of all composite material grades and fabricating large-scale complex contour composites. We provide aftermarket support for the products we design and build. 

We believe our technological, engineering and manufacturing capabilities separate us from many of our competitors and give us a significant competitive advantage to grow our business and increase our market share. The fact that we are one of the major external suppliers of forward fuselages for large commercial aircraft demonstrates our industry leadership. The forward fuselage is one of the most complex and technologically advanced aerostructures on a commercial aircraft because it must satisfy the aircraft's contour requirements; balance strength, aerodynamics and weight; and house the cockpit and avionics. 

Competitive and Predictable Labor Cost Structure. Our labor contracts provide for established wage levels that are aligned with the local market and a limited number of job categories, resulting in greater flexibility in work assignment programs and increased productivity. We have successfully negotiated long-term labor agreements with each of the five unions representing factory and office workers in our U.S. locations. As a result, we expect our labor costs to be stable and predictable through 2020. 

Experienced Management Team. We have an experienced and proven management team with significant aerospace and defense industry experience. We continue to add new talent to our management team and realign our existing talent pool. Our management team has successfully expanded our business and established the stand-alone operations of our business, and is 

actively working to reduce costs. Many of our executives and senior managers have lengthy experience working with our primary customers, including Boeing and Airbus, which provides us with detailed insight into how we can better serve our customers. 

Operating Segments 

We operate in three principal segments: Fuselage Systems, Propulsion Systems and Wing Systems. Substantially all revenues in the three principal segments are from Boeing, with the exception of Wing Systems, which also includes significant revenues from Airbus. We serve customers in addition to Boeing and Airbus across our three principal segments; however, these customers currently do not represent a significant portion of our revenues, and are not expected to in the near future. All other activities fall within the All Other segment, principally made up of sundry sales of miscellaneous services, tooling contracts, and sales of natural gas through a tenancy-in-common with other companies that have operations in Wichita, Kansas. 

The Fuselage Systems segment includes development, production and marketing of forward, mid and rear fuselage sections and systems, primarily to aircraft OEMs, as well as related spares and MRO. The Fuselage Systems segment manufactures products at our facilities in Wichita, Kansas; Kinston, North Carolina; and Saint-Nazaire, France. 

The Propulsion Systems segment includes development, production and marketing of struts/pylons, nacelles (including thrust reversers) and related engine structural components primarily to aircraft or engine OEMs, as well as related spares and MRO services. The Propulsion Systems segment manufactures products at our facilities in Wichita and Chanute, Kansas. 

The Wing Systems segment includes development, production and marketing of wings and wing components (including flight control surfaces) and other miscellaneous structural parts primarily to aircraft OEMs, as well as related spares and MRO services. These activities take place at the Company's facilities in Tulsa and McAlester, Oklahoma; Kinston, North Carolina; Prestwick, Scotland; and Subang, Malaysia. 

Business Development 

While Spirit&#8217;s core products include fuselages, pylons, nacelles and wing components, we also have expertise in design and advanced manufacturing, large scale skin fabrication and monolithic structures technology using both composites and traditional metals. We invest in new technology to bring the most advanced techniques, manufacturing and automation to our customers. 

While we have an established business base through long-term contracts with Boeing and Airbus, we must maintain and expand our capacity to pursue new business. This new business focus will drive our ability to apply research and development, expand into new addressable markets and customers, and increase our name recognition while also maintaining a focus on our current customer base. We plan to expand our ability to research and analyze market and industry trends, competitor positioning and customers' strategies and growth objectives. 

Customers 

Our primary customers are aircraft OEMs. Boeing and Airbus are our two largest customers. We are the largest independent aerostructures supplier to Boeing and one of the largest independent suppliers to Airbus. We entered into long-term supply agreements with our customers to provide aerostructure products to aircraft programs. 

We have established long-standing relationships with our customers due to our diverse product offerings, leading design and manufacturing capabilities using both metallic and composite materials, and competitive pricing. 

Boeing. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 , approximately 84% &#32;of our revenues were from sales to Boeing. 2015 marked Spirit&#8217;s 10th year anniversary of the company&#8217;s Acquisition from Boeing and establishment as a stand-alone business after a proud 75+ year history as a Boeing division. As part of the Boeing Acquisition, we entered into a long-term supply agreement under which we are Boeing's exclusive supplier for substantially all of the products and services provided by Boeing Wichita prior to the Boeing Acquisition for the life of the programs. In addition, Boeing selected us to be the design leader for the Boeing B787 forward fuselage based in part on our expertise with composite technologies. 

We believe our relationship with Boeing will allow us to continue to be an integral partner with Boeing in the designing, engineering and manufacturing of complex aerostructures. 

Airbus. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 , approximately 11% &#32;of our revenues were from sales to Airbus. As a result of the BAE Acquisition, we became one of the largest independent aerostructures suppliers to Airbus, and we have expanded our relationship through new business wins since the BAE Acquisition. Under our supply agreement with Airbus for the A320, A330 and A340 families, we supply products for the life of the aircraft program. For the A350 XWB and A380 programs, we have long-term requirements contracts with Airbus. We believe we can leverage our relationship with Airbus and our history of delivering high-quality products to further increase our sales to Airbus and continue to partner with Airbus on new programs going forward. 

We are a significant supplier of the composite fuselage structure for the Airbus A350 XWB. To accommodate this and other work, we expanded our operations in 2011 with the opening of a manufacturing facility in Kinston, North Carolina and an assembly plant in Saint-Nazaire, France, which assembles the center fuselage sections it receives from the Kinston, North Carolina facility before transporting the completed assembled unit to Airbus. In addition, we have a contract with Airbus to design and manufacture a major wing structure for the A350 XWB program. Spirit Europe designs and assembles the wing fixed leading edge structure primarily at its facility in Prestwick, Scotland. The composite front spar is built at the facility in Kinston, North Carolina with sub-assemblies being manufactured at the Spirit AeroSystems Malaysia facility in Subang, Malaysia. 

Although most of our revenues are obtained from sales inside the U.S., we generated $934.9 million , $830.9 million and $806.1 million in sales to international customers for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013, respectively, primarily to Airbus.

Revenues are attributable to countries based on the destination where goods are delivered. 

The international revenue is included primarily in the Wing Systems segment. All other segment revenues are primarily from U.S. sales. Approximately 5% &#32;of our long-lived assets based on book value are located in the United Kingdom as part of Spirit Europe with approximately another 5% &#32;of our long-lived assets located in countries outside the United States and the United Kingdom. 

Expected Backlog 

As of December 31, 2015 , our expected backlog associated with large commercial aircraft, business and regional jet, and military equipment deliveries through 2021, calculated based on contractual and historical product prices and expected delivery volumes, was approximately $46.9 billion. This is an increase of $300.0 million &#32;from our corresponding estimate as of the end of 2014 reflecting the fact that Airbus and Boeing new orders exceeded deliveries in 2015. Backlog is calculated based on the number of units Spirit is under contract to produce on our fixed quantity contracts, and Boeing and Airbus announced backlog on our supply agreements. The number of units may be subject to cancellation or delay by the customer prior to shipment, depending on contract terms. The level of unfilled orders at any given date during the year may be materially affected by the timing of our receipt of firm orders and additional airplane orders, and the speed with which those orders are filled. Accordingly, our expected backlog as of December 31, 2015 &#32;may not necessarily represent the actual amount of deliveries or sales for any future period. 

Manufacturing and Engineering 

Manufacturing 

Our expertise is in designing, engineering and manufacturing large-scale, complex aerostructures. We maintain state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities in Wichita, Kansas; Chanute, Kansas; Tulsa, Oklahoma; McAlester, Oklahoma; Kinston, North Carolina; Prestwick, Scotland; Saint-Nazaire, France; and Subang, Malaysia. 

Our core manufacturing competencies include: 

&#8226; 

composites design and manufacturing processes; 

&#8226; 

leading mechanized and automated assembly and fastening techniques; 

&#8226; 

large-scale skin fabrication using both metallic and composite materials; 

&#8226; 

chemical etching and metal bonding expertise; 

&#8226; 

monolithic structures technology; and 

&#8226; 

precision metal forming producing complex contoured shapes in sheet metal and extruded aluminum. 

Our manufacturing expertise is supported by our state-of-the-art equipment. We have thousands of major pieces of equipment installed in our customized manufacturing facilities. For example, for the manufacture of the B787 composite forward fuselage, we installed one of the largest autoclaves in the world. An autoclave is an enclosure device that generates controlled internal heat and pressure conditions used to cure and bond certain resins which is used in the manufacture of composite structures. We installed a comparable autoclave as well as other specialized machines in Kinston, North Carolina to support our work on the A350 XWB. We intend to continue to make the appropriate investments in our facilities to support and maintain our industry-leading manufacturing expertise. 

Engineering 

Spirit AeroSystems is an industry leader in aerospace engineering with access to talent across the globe. The purpose of the engineering organization is to provide continuous support for new and ongoing designs, technology innovation and development for customer advancements, and production-related process improvements. We possess a broad base of engineering skills for design, analysis, test, certification, tooling and support of major fuselage, wing and propulsion assemblies using both metallic and composite materials. In addition, our regulatory certification expertise helps ensure associated designs and design changes are compliant with applicable regulations. 

Our industry-leading engineering capabilities are key strategic factors differentiating us from our competitors. 

Research and Development 

We believe that world-class research and development helps to maintain our position as an advanced partner to our OEM customers' new product development teams. As a result, we spend capital and financial resources on our research and development, including $27.8 million &#32;for the year ended December 31, 2015 , $29.3 million &#32;for the year ended December 31, 2014 , and $34.7 million &#32;for the year ended December 31, 2013 . Through our research, we strive to develop unique intellectual property and technologies that will improve our OEM customers' products and, at the same time, position us to win work on new products. Our development effort primarily focuses on preparing for the initial production of new products and improving manufacturing processes on our current work. It also serves as an ongoing process that helps develop ways to reduce production costs and streamline manufacturing processes. 

Our research and development is geared toward the architectural design of our principal products: fuselage systems, propulsion systems and wing systems. We are currently focused on research in areas such as advanced metallic joining, low-cost composites, acoustic attenuation, efficient structures, systems integration, advanced design and analysis methods, and new material systems. Other items that are expensed relate to research and development that is not funded by the customer. We collaborate with universities, research facilities and technology partners in our research and development. 

Suppliers and Materials 

The principal raw materials used in our manufacturing operations are aluminum, titanium, steel and carbon fiber. We also purchase metallic parts, non-metallic parts, and machined components. In addition, we procure subassemblies from various manufacturers which are used in the final aerostructure assembly. From time to time we also review our make versus buy strategy to determine whether it would be beneficial to us to outsource work which we currently produce in-house or vice versa. 

We have longstanding relationships with thousands of manufacturing suppliers. Our strategy is to enter into long-term contracts with suppliers to secure competitive pricing. Our exposure to rising costs of raw material is limited to some extent through leveraging relationships with our OEM's high-volume contracts. 

We continue to seek and develop sourcing opportunities from North America to Europe and Asia to achieve a competitive global cost structure. Over 25 countries are represented in our international network of suppliers. 

Competition 

Although we are one of the largest independent non-OEM aerostructures suppliers, based on annual revenues, with an estimated 21% share of the global non-OEM aerostructures market, this market remains highly competitive and fragmented. Our primary competition currently comes from either work performed by internal divisions of OEMs or other first-tier suppliers, and direct competition continues to grow. 

Our principal competitors among OEMs include Boeing, Airbus (including its wholly-owned subsidiaries Stelia Aerospace and Premium Aerotec GmbH), Embraer Brazilian Aviation Co., Alenia Aermacchi, and United Technologies Corporation. Our principal competitors among non-OEM aerostructures suppliers are Aernnova, Aircelle S.A., Fuji Heavy Industries, Ltd., GKN Aerospace, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Inc., Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Nordam, Sonaca, Triumph Group, Inc., Latecoere S.A., and Nexcelle. 

Environmental Matters 

Our operations and facilities are subject to various environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including federal, state, local and foreign government requirements, governing, among other matters, the emission, discharge, handling and disposal of regulated materials, the investigation and remediation of contaminated sites, and permits required in connection with our operations. Our operations are designed, maintained and operated to promote protection of human health and the environment. Although we believe that our operations and facilities are in material compliance with applicable environmental and worker protection laws and regulations, management cannot provide assurance that future changes in such laws or their enforcement, or the nature of our operations will not require us to make significant additional expenditures to ensure continued compliance. Further, we could incur substantial costs, including costs to reduce air emissions, clean-up costs, fines and sanctions, and third-party property damage or personal injury claims as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws, relevant common law or the environmental permits required for our operations. 

New regulations or more stringent enforcement of existing requirements could also result in additional compliance costs. For example, various governments have enacted or are considering enactment of laws to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other so-called greenhouse gases ("GHG"). In particular, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the "EPA") has promulgated new regulations that require certain of our facilities to report annual GHG emissions and may require new operating permits to be issued for those facilities. In the absence of a national price for carbon-based air pollutant emissions, new legislation from Congress, or information relative to additional regulation from the EPA, we are not in a position at this time to estimate the costs which may result from these or similar actions. 

United States 

Under some environmental laws in the United States, a current or previous owner or operator of a contaminated site may be held liable for the entire cost of investigation, removal or remediation of regulated materials at such property, whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such regulated materials. Persons who arrange for disposal or treatment of hazardous materials also may be liable for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of those substances at a disposal or treatment site, regardless of whether the affected site is owned or operated by them. Because we own and/or operate a number of facilities that have a history of industrial or commercial use and because we arrange for the disposal of regulated materials at many disposal sites, we may and do incur costs for investigation, removal and remediation. 

The Asset Purchase Agreement for the Boeing Acquisition, referred to herein as the "Asset Purchase Agreement", provides, with limited exceptions, that Boeing is responsible for environmental liabilities relating to conditions existing at the Wichita, Kansas and Tulsa and McAlester, Oklahoma facilities as of the Boeing Acquisition date. For example, Boeing is subject to an administrative consent order issued by the Kansas Department of Health and Environment, or KDHE, to contain and clean up contaminated groundwater, which underlies a majority of the Wichita site. Pursuant to the KDHE order, Boeing has a long-term remediation plan in place, and containment and remediation efforts are underway. We are responsible for any environmental conditions that we cause at these facilities following the Boeing Acquisition. 

United Kingdom 

In the United Kingdom, remediation of contaminated land may be compelled by the government in certain situations. If a property is to be redeveloped, the local authority, in its planning role, may require remediation as a condition to issuing a permit. In addition, in situations in which the contamination is causing harm to human health or polluting the environment, the local authority may use its environmental legislative powers to force remediation so that the impacted areas are "suitable for use." If contamination is polluting the property of a third party or causing loss, injury or damage, the third party may file an action against the owner or operator of the source in common law based on negligence or nuisance to recover the value of the loss, injury or damage sustained. 

Other International Sites 

Our interests in other international sites are subject to foreign government environmental laws and regulations. It is our policy and practice to comply with all requirements, both domestic and international. We believe that our procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and resulting financial liability in connection with our business. 

Employees 

At December 31, 2015, we had approximately 15,200 employees; 13,700 located in our six U.S. facilities, 900 located in our two U.K. facilities, 500 located in our Malaysia facilities and 100 in our French facilities. &#32; 

Our principal U.S. collective bargaining agreements were with the following unions as of December 31, 2015:

The current pay agreements expire December 31, 2022. 

None of our Malaysia or France employees are currently represented by a union. 

We consider our relationships with our employees to be satisfactory. 

Government Contracts 

Companies engaged in supplying defense-related equipment and services to U.S. Government agencies, either directly or by subcontract, are subject to business risks specific to the defense industry. These risks include the ability of the U.S. Government to unilaterally: (1) suspend or debar us from receiving new prime contracts or subcontracts; (2) terminate existing contracts; (3) reduce the value of existing contracts; (4) audit our contract-related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs; and (5) control and potentially prohibit the export of our products. 

Most U.S. Government contracts for which we subcontract can be terminated by the U.S. Government either for its convenience or if the prime contractor defaults by failing to perform under the contract. In addition, the prime contractor typically has the right to terminate our subcontract for its convenience or if we default by failing to perform under the subcontract. Termination for convenience provisions generally provide only for our recovery of costs incurred or committed, settlement expenses and profit on the work completed prior to termination. Termination for default provisions generally provide for the subcontractor to be liable for excess costs incurred by the prime contractor in procuring undelivered items from another source. 

In order to be eligible to perform on U.S. Government classified contracts, Spirit holds a facility security clearance ("FCL") at the "Secret" level. As a cleared entity, Spirit must comply with the requirements of the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual ("NISPOM") and any other applicable U.S. Government industrial security regulations. Failure to follow the requirements of the NISPOM or any other applicable U.S. Government industrial security regulations could, among other things, result in termination of Spirit's FCL, which in turn would preclude us from being awarded classified contracts or, under certain circumstances, performing on our existing classified contracts. 

A portion of our defense business is classified by the U.S. Government and cannot be specifically described. The operating results of these classified contracts are included in our consolidated financial statements. The business risks associated with classified contracts historically have not differed materially from those of our other U.S. Government contracts. Our internal controls addressing the financial reporting of classified contracts are consistent with our internal controls for our non-classified contracts. 

Governmental Regulations 

The commercial aircraft component industry is highly regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration, or FAA, in the United States, the Joint Aviation Authority, or JAA, in Europe and other agencies throughout the world. The military aircraft component 

industry is governed by military quality specifications. We, and the components we manufacture, are required to be certified by one or more of these entities or agencies, and, in some cases, by individual OEMs, to engineer and service parts and components used in specific aircraft models. 

We must also satisfy the requirements of our customers, including OEMs and airlines that are subject to FAA regulations, and provide these customers with products and services that comply with the government regulations applicable to commercial flight operations. In addition, the FAA requires that various maintenance routines be performed on aircraft components. We believe that we currently satisfy or exceed these maintenance standards in our repair and overhaul services. We also maintain several FAA-approved repair stations. 

The technical data and components used in the design and production of our products, as well as many of the products and technical data we export, either as individual items or as components incorporated into aircraft, are subject to compliance with U.S. export control laws. Collaborative agreements that we may have with foreign persons, including manufacturers or suppliers, are also subject to U.S. export control laws. 

Our operations are also subject to a variety of worker and community safety laws. The Occupational Safety and Health Act, or OSHA, mandates general requirements for safe workplaces for all employees. In addition, OSHA provides special procedures and measures for the handling of certain hazardous and toxic substances. Our management believes that our operations are in material compliance with OSHA's health and safety requirements.
