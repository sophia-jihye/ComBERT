 Item 1. Business 

Introduction 

Invesco is one of the world&#8217;s leading independent investment management organizations. With more than 6,000 employees and an on-the-ground presence in more than 20 countries, Invesco is well positioned to meet the needs of investors across the globe. We provide a comprehensive range of investment capabilities and outcomes, delivered through a diverse set of investment vehicles, to help clients achieve their investment objectives. For decades, individuals and institutions have viewed our organization as a trusted partner for a broad range of investment needs. We have a significant presence in the retail and institutional markets within the investment management industry in North America, U.K., Europe, Middle East and Asia-Pacific, serving clients in more than 100 &#32;countries. As of December 31, 2015 , the firm managed $775.6 billion &#32;in assets for investors around the world. 

The key drivers of success for Invesco are long-term investment performance, high-quality client service and effective distribution relationships, delivered across a diverse spectrum of investment management capabilities, distribution channels, geographic areas and market exposures. By achieving success in these areas, we seek to deliver better outcomes for clients and generate competitive investment results, positive net flows, increased assets under management (AUM) and associated revenues. We are affected significantly by market movements, which are beyond our control; however, we endeavor to mitigate the impact of market movements by maintaining broad diversification across asset classes, investment vehicles, client domiciles and geographies. We measure relative investment performance by comparing our investment capabilities to competitors' products, industry benchmarks and client investment objectives. Generally, distributors, investment advisors and consultants take into consideration longer-term investment performance (e.g., three-year and five-year performance) in their selection of investment products and manager recommendations to their clients, although shorter-term performance may also be an important consideration. Third-party ratings may also influence client investment decisions. We monitor quality of client service in a variety of ways, including periodic client satisfaction surveys, analysis of response times and redemption rates, competitive benchmarking of services and feedback from investment consultants. 

Invesco Ltd. is organized under the laws of Bermuda, and our common shares are listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol &#8220;IVZ.&#8221; We maintain a website at www.invesco.com. (Information contained on our website shall not be deemed to be part of, or be incorporated into, this document). 

Strategy 

The company focuses on four key long-term strategic objectives that are designed to sharpen our focus on client needs, further strengthen our business over time and help ensure our long-term success: 

&#8226; 

Achieve strong, long-term investment performance &#32;across distinct investment capabilities with clearly articulated investment philosophies and processes, aligned with client needs; 

&#8226; 

Be instrumental to our clients' success &#32;by delivering our distinctive investment capabilities worldwide to meet their needs; 

&#8226; 

Harness the power of our global platform &#32;by continuously improving execution effectiveness to enhance quality and productivity, and allocating our resources to the opportunities that will best benefit clients and our business; and 

&#8226; 

Perpetuate a high-performance organization &#32;by driving greater transparency, accountability, fact-based decision making and execution at all levels. 

As an integrated global investment manager, we are keenly focused on meeting clients' needs and operating effectively and efficiently as an integrated, global organization. We take a unified approach to our business and present our financial statements 

&#160; 

&#160; 

and other disclosures under the single operating segment &#8220;investment management.&#8221; See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 17 , "Geographic Information,&#8221; for a geographic breakdown of our consolidated operating revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 . 

One of Invesco's great strengths is our separate, distinct investment teams in multiple markets across the globe. A key focus of our business is fostering a strong investment culture and providing the support that enables our investment teams to maintain well-performing investment capabilities. The ability to leverage the capabilities of our investment teams to help clients across the globe achieve their investment objectives is a significant differentiator for our firm. 

2015 Developments 

Throughout 2015, we continued to execute our long-term strategic objectives, which further improved our ability to serve clients, strengthened our investment performance, and helped us deliver competitive levels of operating income and margins, despite volatile financial markets. We also took advantage of opportunities in the market and invested in our products and capabilities, our global platform and our people in ways that strengthened our business and further differentiated us in the marketplace to help ensure our long-term success. &#32; 

Invesco achieved solid growth across our global business during 2015, supported by our strong, long-term investment performance, our comprehensive range of strategies and solutions, and our robust client engagement efforts. Our broadly diversified offering, combined with our strong investment performance, contributed to long-term AUM net inflows of $16.2 billion during 2015. Also during 2015, we launched several new products and further invested in key parts of our business that will benefit our clients and enhance our competitiveness over the long term. We continue to invest in capabilities where we see strong client demand or future opportunities by hiring world-class talent, upgrading our technology platforms, launching new products and providing additional resources where necessary. The ability to leverage the capabilities developed by our investment teams to meet client demand across the globe is a significant differentiator for our firm, and we will continue to bring the best of Invesco to different parts of our business where it makes sense for our clients. More specifically, in 2015 Invesco: 

&#9642; 

Delivered strong, long-term investment performance across our global franchise, with 79% and 85% of measured actively managed ranked assets in the top half of peer groups* on a three- and five-year basis, respectively, as of December 31, 2015; 

&#9642; 

Continued to achieve strong flows from our multi-asset Global Targeted Return (GTR) capability based on strong performance relative to peers and from our efforts to expand its availability globally. Originally launched in the U.K., the strategy is now offered in the U.S., Europe and Asia attracting a wide variety of institutional clients globally. AUM reached $11 billion in 2015, up $8 billion over the prior year; 

&#9642; 

Further enhanced our fixed income product suite, developing talent and strengthening our reputation in the market place, which contributed to more than $12.5 billion in long-term funded wins; 

&#9642; 

Invested in our institutional business - refining our global strategy, bringing on additional highly regarded talent and more effectively aligning ourselves to opportunities in the market. We are seeing some early successes from this work - institutional flows during the fourth quarter were among the strongest in the past several quarters in spite of volatile markets; 

&#9642; 

Invesco PowerShares completed its acquisition of Deutsche Bank&#8217;s U.S. commodity ETF business; 

&#9642; 

Announced the intent to acquire the remaining 51% of Religare Invesco Asset Management, our joint venture in India; 

&#9642; 

Saw continued success from our solutions strategy, which brings together the full capabilities of the firm to help clients meet their investment objectives. One outcome of this strategy was winning the Rhode Island 529 mandate of $7.2 billion that is expected to fund in July 2016; 

&#9642; 

Continued to innovate and expand the range of alternative products to meet global client demand with new retail and institutional capabilities that leverage our strong teams and strategies. As examples, we launched the Global Direct Real Estate Trust in Canada; Unconstrained Bond Fund in EMEA; and Invesco Balanced Risk Allocation Feeder Fund in Japan; 

&#9642; 

Demonstrated strong employee engagement across the firm, with Invesco being named as one of the best places to work in money management by Pensions &#38; Investments magazine; and 

&#9642; 

Improved our financial flexibility with the issuance of $500 million of new long-term debt and the amendment and extension of our credit facility. 

____________ 

* 

As of December 31, 2015 , 79% and 85% of ranked assets were performing top half of peer groups on a 3 and 5-year basis. Of total Invesco AUM, 58% &#32;were ranked at year-end. See Item 7, &#8220;Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Investment Capabilities Performance Overview,&#8221; for more discussion of AUM rankings by investment capability. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Additionally, early in 2016, Invesco announced the acquisition of Jemstep, a market-leading provider of advisor-focused digital solutions. The Invesco Jemstep solution provides wealth management home offices and their advisors with a full suite of technology solutions that are highly flexible, customizable and easily integrated into existing systems. The solution was launched in the U.S. to offer advisors a white-labeled, open architecture platform that includes Invesco&#8217;s high-conviction fundamental and factor-based investment strategies. The acquisition represents an investment in our partnership with the advice community and highlights our efforts to participate in the technology evolution within our industry. 

Combined, these efforts helped us deliver better outcomes for clients while achieving further growth across our global business and further enhanced our competitive position. We continue to believe we are in the early stages of achieving the full potential of our global business. 

Certain Demographic and Industry Trends 

Demographic and economic trends around the world continue to transform the investment management industry and underscore the need to be well diversified with broad capabilities globally and across asset classes: 

&#8226; 

Clients are demanding more from investment managers. While investment performance remains paramount, client engagement and value-added services increasingly differentiate managers. Invesco is working to enhance the client's user experience through digital marketing (web, mobile, social) and improved service. 

&#8226; 

Facing the likelihood of sustained low interest rates, investors are seeking outcome-orientated investment solutions that provide income and manage volatility. The building out of Invesco Solutions is among the firm's top priorities. 

&#8226; 

Investors are continuing to shift to alternative, passive, and smart beta strategies. As a consequence, core equities and fixed income solutions are declining as a share of global AUM. Investment managers are under pressure to justify fees and value. Invesco PowerShares remains the leader in smart beta ETFs and Invesco has a strong lineup of alternative and multi-asset strategies supported by ongoing product development. 

&#8226; 

Regulatory activity remains at increased levels since the 2008 - 2009 financial crisis and is influencing competitive dynamics. Increased regulatory scrutiny of managers has focused on many areas including transparency /unbundling of fees, inducements, conflicts of interest, capital, liquidity, solvency, operational risk management, controls and compensation. Invesco continued to pro-actively work with regulators around the world. Efforts to further modernize and strengthen our operating platform will enhance our ability to compete effectively across markets while complying with the variety of applicable regulatory regimes. 

&#8226; 

Although the developed markets in the U.S. and Europe are currently the two largest markets for financial assets by a wide margin, other key emerging markets in the world, such as China and India, are positioned for future growth despite near-term headwinds. As these population-heavy markets mature, we believe investment managers that are truly global will be in the best position to capture this growth. Additionally, population age differences between emerging and developed markets will result in differing investment needs and horizons among countries. Asset allocation and retirement savings schemes also differ substantially among countries. We believe firms such as Invesco, with diversified investment capabilities and product types, are best positioned to meet clients' needs in this global competitive landscape. Invesco has a meaningful and expanding market presence in many of the world's most attractive regions, including the U.S., Canada, Western Europe and the U.K., the Middle East and Asia-Pacific. We believe our strong and growing presence in established and emerging markets provides significant long-term growth potential for our business. 

&#8226; 

Technology advances are impacting core elements of the investment management industry which lags other industries in its use of technology. Clients increasingly seek to interact digitally with their investment portfolios. This is leading to established managers investing in and/or acquiring "robo" platforms. As the investment management business becomes more complex, automation will become increasingly important to serve clients effectively and efficiently. Invesco is leveraging technology in all aspects of its business and exploring opportunities to work with third-party technology firms to enhance our clients' investment experience. 

We believe Invesco is poised to take advantage of opportunities created by global demographic and industry trends. Our comprehensive range of investment capabilities and broad diversification enable us to continue meeting client needs and strengthening our competitive position through a variety of economic and market environments. Our multi-year strategic objectives are designed to leverage our global presence, our distinctive investment capabilities and our talented people to help us meet client needs. We believe firmly that if we help clients achieve their investment objectives and manage our business effectively and efficiently, we can further grow our business and deliver strong results to shareholders over the long term. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Investment Management Capabilities 

Supported by a global platform, Invesco delivers a comprehensive array of investment capabilities and services to retail and institutional investors. We have a significant presence in the retail and institutional markets within the investment management industry in North America, U.K., Europe, Middle East and Asia-Pacific, serving clients in more than 100 &#32;countries. 

We believe that the proven strength of our distinct and globally located investment teams and their well-defined investment disciplines and risk management provide us with a robust competitive advantage. There are few independent investment managers with teams as globally diverse as Invesco's and with the same breadth and depth of investment capabilities and vehicles. We offer multiple investment objectives within the various asset classes and products that we manage. Our asset classes, broadly defined, include money market, balanced, equity, fixed income, and alternatives. As of December 31, 2015 , 47.8% &#32;of our AUM were invested in equity securities and 52.2% &#32;in fixed income and other investments ( December 31, 2014 : 48.5% &#32;in equity and 51.5% &#32;in fixed income and other investments).

Distribution Channels 

Retail AUM originates from clients investing into funds available to the public in the form of shares or units. Institutional AUM originates from individual corporate clients, endowments, foundations, government authorities, universities, or charities. AUM disclosure by distribution channel represents consolidated AUM distributed by type of sales team (the company's internal distribution channels). AUM amounts disclosed as retail channel AUM represents AUM distributed by the company's retail sales team; whereas AUM amounts disclosed as institutional channel AUM represents AUM distributed by the company's institutional sales team. 

The company operates as an integrated global investment manager, presenting itself as a single firm to clients around the world. This is supported with the cross-selling of investment capabilities globally and an integrated internal sales force. As a result, the company's retail and institutional sales forces are able to sell products that cross over traditional delineations of retail or institutional vehicle types. Therefore, not all products sold in the disclosed retail distribution channel are "retail" products, and not all products sold in the disclosed institutional channel are "institutional" products. This aggregation, however, is viewed as a proxy for presenting AUM in the retail and institutional markets in which we operate. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Retail 

Invesco is a significant provider of retail investment solutions to clients in all major markets including the U.S., U.K., Canada, Continental Europe and Asia. Retail AUM was $514.8 billion &#32;at December 31, 2015 . We offer retail products within all of the major asset classes. Our retail products are primarily distributed through third-party financial intermediaries, including major wire houses, fund supermarkets, regional broker-dealers, insurance companies, banks and financial planners in North America, and independent brokers and financial advisors, banks and supermarket platforms in Europe and Asia. 

The U.K., U.S., Canadian and Continental European retail operations rank among the largest by AUM in their respective markets. As of December 31, 2015 , Invesco Perpetual was the largest retail fund provider in the U.K.; Invesco's U.S. retail business was among the 10 largest non-proprietary fund complexes in the U.S. by long-term assets, including the Invesco PowerShares franchise; and Invesco in Continental Europe was among the largest non-proprietary investment managers in the retail channel. Invesco Great Wall, our joint venture in China, was one of the largest Sino-foreign managers of equity products in China, with AUM of approximately $14.7 billion &#32;as of December 31, 2015 . We provide our retail clients with one of the industry's most robust and comprehensive product lines. 

Institutional 

We provide investment solutions to institutional investors globally, with a major presence in the U.S., U.K., Continental Europe and Asia with $260.8 billion &#32;in AUM as of December 31, 2015 . We offer a broad suite of domestic and global strategies, including traditional and quantitative equities, fixed income (including money market funds for institutional clients), real estate, private equity, financial structures and absolute return strategies. Regional sales forces distribute our products and provide services to clients and intermediaries around the world. We have a diversified client base that includes major public entities, corporations, unions, non-profit organizations, endowments, foundations, pension funds, financial institutions and sovereign wealth funds. Invesco's institutional money market funds serve some of the largest financial institutions, government entities and corporations in the world. 

AUM Diversification 

One of Invesco's greatest competitive strengths is the diversification in its AUM by client domicile, distribution channel and asset class. Our distribution network has attracted assets of 66% &#32;retail and 34% &#32;institutional as of December 31, 2015 . By client domicile, 34% &#32;of client AUM are outside the U.S., and we serve clients in more than 100 &#32;countries. The following tables present a breakdown of AUM by client domicile, distribution channel and asset class as of December 31, 2015 . Additionally, the fourth table below illustrates the split of our AUM as Passive and Active. Passive AUM includes ETFs, unit investment trusts (UITs), leveraged fund balances upon which we do not earn a fee, and other passive mandates. Active AUM is total AUM less Passive AUM.

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , the company had 6,490 &#32;employees across the globe. As of December 31, 2014 &#32;and 2013 , we had 6,264 &#32;and 5,932 &#32;employees, respectively. The majority of the headcount increase is attributable to growth in our global shared service centers. None of our employees is covered under collective bargaining agreements. 

Competition 

The investment management business is highly competitive, with points of differentiation including investment performance, the range of products offered, brand recognition, business reputation, financial strength, the depth and continuity of relationships, quality of service and the level of fees charged for services. We compete with a large number of investment management firms, commercial banks, investment banks, broker dealers, hedge funds, insurance companies and other financial institutions. We believe that the quality and diversity of our investment capabilities, product types and channels of distribution enable us to compete effectively in the investment management business. We also believe being an independent investment manager is a competitive advantage, as our business model avoids conflicts that are inherent within institutions that both manage and distribute and/or service those products. Lastly, we believe continued execution against our multi-year strategic objectives will further strengthen our long-term competitive position. 

Management Contracts 

We derive substantially all of our revenues from investment management contracts with funds and other clients. Fees vary with the type of assets being managed, with higher fees earned on actively managed equity and balanced accounts, along with real estate and other alternative asset products, and lower fees earned on fixed income, money market and stable value accounts, as well as certain ETFs. Investment management contracts are generally terminable upon thirty or fewer days' notice. Typically, retail investors may withdraw their funds at any time without prior notice. Institutional clients may elect to terminate their relationship with us or reduce the aggregate amount of assets under management with very short notice periods. 

Risk Management 

Invesco is committed to continually strengthening and refining our risk management approach. We believe a key factor in Invesco's ability to manage through the economic uncertainty of recent years was our integrated approach to risk management. Invesco's enterprise risk management approach is embedded in its management processes across the organization. Broadly, our approach includes two governance structures - one for investments and another for business risk. 

&#8226; 

Investment risk oversight is supported by the Global Performance Measurement and Risk group, which provides senior management and the Board with insight into core investment risks. 

&#8226; 

Business risk oversight is supported by the Corporate Risk Management Committee, which facilitates a focus on strategic, operational and other key business risks, and related committees. 

Further, functional and geographic risk management committees maintain an ongoing risk assessment process that provides a bottom-up perspective on the specific risk areas existing in various domains of our business. As a result of our efforts in this area, Standard &#38; Poor's Ratings Services has designated our enterprise risk management rating as "strong." (S&#38;P rates companies' enterprise risk management capabilities on a scale of Fair, Adequate, Strong and Excellent).
