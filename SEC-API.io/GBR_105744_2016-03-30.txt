Oil and Gas Operations

The Company, through its wholly owned subsidiaries Mountaineer State Energy, Inc. and Mountaineer State Operations, LLC, owns and operates oil and gas wells and mineral leases in Athens and Meigs Counties in Ohio and in Calhoun, Jackson and Roane Counties in West Virginia. The majority of our oil &#38; gas operation was acquired through the acquisition of the Carl E. Smith Companies in 2008. 

As of December 31, 2015 the Company has 153 producing gas wells, 31 non-producing wells and related equipment and mineral leases covering approximately 20,000 acres.

Retirement Community

The Company leases and operates Pacific Pointe Retirement Inn ("Pacific Pointe") in King City, Oregon. Pacific Pointe, a retirement center, has a capacity of 114 residents and provides community living with basic services such as meals, housekeeping, laundry, 24/7 staffing, transportation and social and recreational activities. Our residents do not yet need assistance or support with activities of daily living but prefer the physical and psychological comfort of a residential community of like-minded people and access to senior-oriented services.

Business Strategy

The Company is a Nevada corporation which owns and operates oil and gas wells in Ohio and West Virginia.

The Company intends to continue to pursue acquisition of undervalued or distressed oil and gas related businesses, as well as additional acquisitions of oil and gas leases. The Company may choose to develop or resell the acquired acreage as management deems most beneficial to the Company. The Company's strategy is dependent on available financing as well as the market price for oil and gas.

The Company intends to maintain its interest in the retirement center it currently operates, however, management has no current intentions to own or operate any additional retirement facilities.

Insurance

The Company currently maintains property and liability insurance intended to cover claims in its oil and gas operations, retirement community and corporate operations. The provision of personal services entails an inherent risk of liability compared to more institutional long-term care communities. The Company also carries property insurance on each of its owned and leased properties, as appropriate.

&#160;

&#160;

Employees

At December 31, 2015, the Company employed, in all segments, 46 people (26 full-time and 20 part-time). The Company believes it maintains good relationships with its employees. None of the Company's employees are represented by a collective bargaining group.

The Company's operations are subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act. Many of the Company's employees are paid at rates related to the minimum wage and any increase in the minimum wage will result in an increase in labor costs.

Management is not aware of any non-compliance by the Company as regards applicable regulatory requirements that would have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.

Quality Assurance

Energy Philosophy &#8211; The Company is committed to the preservation and enhancement of the environment in which we operate. We are philosophically and operationally focused to continually prioritize the sensitivity of our ecological system in which we develop resources for our generation as well as our children's. Management's legacy is to prove that the energy industry can develop the earth's natural resources with clean and efficient technologies while preserving its fragile beauty. Our technologies directly and significantly reduce the impact of our operations on nature and wildlife by minimizing surface disturbance.

Retirement Center Philosophy &#8211; The Company's philosophy of management is to demonstrate by its actions and require from its employees high standards of personal integrity, to develop a climate of openness and trust, to demonstrate respect for human dignity in every circumstance, to be supportive in all relationships, to promote teamwork by involving employees in the management of their own work and to promote the free expression of ideas and opinions. In operating a retirement community, our commitment to quality assurance is designed to achieve a high degree of resident and family member satisfaction with the care and services the Company provides.

&#160;

Regular Property Inspections &#8211; Property inspections are conducted by corporate personnel. These inspections cover the appearance of the exterior and grounds, the appearance and cleanliness of the interior, the professionalism and friendliness of staff and notes on maintenance.

Marketing

The Company's sell its oil and natural gas production to a limited number of purchasers. While there is an available market for crude oil and natural gas production, we cannot be assured that the loss of these purchasers would not have a material impact on the Company. Further a reduction in the market price for oil and gas will have a negative effect on the Company's financial position.

At Pacific Pointe, the Company's marketing and sales efforts are undertaken at the local level. These are intended to create awareness of our property and its services among prospective residents, their families and other key referral sources. The property engages in traditional types of marketing activities such as special events, radio spots, direct mailings, print advertising, signs and yellow page advertising. These marketing activities and media advertisements are directed to potential customers.

Government Regulation

Management is not aware of any non-compliance by the Company of applicable regulatory requirements that would have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.

Competition

The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive. We encounter strong competition from other independent operators and from major oil companies in acquiring properties, contracting for drilling equipment and securing trained personnel. Many of these competitors have financial and technical resources and personnel substantially larger than ours. As a result, our competitors may be able to pay more for desirable leases, or to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties or prospects than our financial or personnel resources will permit.

We are also affected by competition for drilling rigs and the availability of related equipment. In the past, the oil and natural gas industry has experienced shortages of drilling rigs, equipment, pipe and personnel, which has delayed development drilling and other exploitation activities and has caused significant price increases. We are unable to predict when, or if, such shortages may again occur or how they would affect our development and exploitation program.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Competition is also strong for attractive oil and natural gas producing properties, undeveloped leases and drilling rights, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete satisfactorily. Many large oil companies have been actively marketing some of their existing producing properties for sale to independent producers. We regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities and submit bids as part of our growth strategy.

&#160;

Our retirement community is in a highly competitive environment which and will continue to become increasingly competitive in the future. The Company competes with other retirement companies and numerous other companies providing similar long-term care alternatives, such as home healthcare agencies, community-based service programs and convalescent centers (nursing homes).
