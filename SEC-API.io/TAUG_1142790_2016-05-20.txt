 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

General Overview 

&#160; 

We are a Florida corporation formed on April 8, 2001. We were originally organized to be a blank check company. 

&#160; 

On June 8, 2009, the Board of Directors approved the change of name to &#8220;Novo Energies Corporation&#8221;. As described in a report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 26, 2009, a majority of shareholders executed a written consent in lieu of an Annual Meeting (the &#8220;Written Consent&#8221;) effecting the change of the name of our business from &#8220;Atlantic Wine Agencies, Inc.&#8221; to &#8220;Novo Energies Corporation&#8221; on June 8, 2009 to better reflect what we then intended to be our future operations. We filed an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation on June 8, 2009 with the Florida Secretary of State to affect this name change after receiving the requisite corporate approval. 

&#160; 

On June 23, 2009, the Board of Directors approved a 3-for-1 forward stock split. Accordingly, all share and per share amounts have been retroactively adjusted in the accompanying financial statements. 

&#160; 

On July 30, 2009, Novo Energies Corporation (&#8220;Novo&#8221;) formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, WTL Renewable Energy, Inc. (&#8220;WTL&#8221;). WTL was established as a Canadian Federal Corporation whose business is to initially research available technologies capable of transforming plastic and tires into useful energy commodities. Simultaneously, WTL also intended to plan, build, own, and operate renewable energy plants throughout Canada utilizing a third party technology and using plastic and tire waste as feedstock. On May 8, 2012, the name was changed to Immunovative Canada, Inc. 

&#160; 

On May 17, 2011, Novo entered into an exclusive memorandum of understanding with Immunovative Clinical Research, Inc. (&#8220;ICRI&#8221;), a Nevada corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Immunovative Therapies, Ltd. (&#8220;ITL&#8221;), an Israeli corporation pursuant to which the Company and ICRI intended to pursue a merger resulting in Novo owning ICRI. 

&#160; 

In April 2012, the Board of Directors approved the change of name to &#8220;Immunovative, Inc.&#8221; As described in a report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 30, 2012, a majority of shareholders executed a written consent in lieu of an Annual Meeting (the &#8220;Written Consent&#8221;) effecting the change of the name of our business from &#8220;Novo Energies Corporation&#8221; to &#8220;Immunovative, Inc.&#8221; on April 2, 2012 to better reflect what we then intended to be our future operations. We filed an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation on April 30, 2012 with the Florida Secretary of State to affect this name change after receiving the requisite corporate approval.

&#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

On January 8, 2013, the Company received from ITL, a notice by which ITL purported to terminate the License Agreement dated December 9, 2011 between the Company and ITL (the &#8220;ITL Notice&#8221;), along with alleged damages. It is the Company&#8217;s position that ITL breached the License Agreement by delivering the ITL Notice and, that prior to the ITL Notice, the License Agreement was in full force and, on January 17, 2013 and that the Company had complied in all material respect with the License Agreement therefore the Company believes that there are no damages to ITL. As such, on January 17, 2013, the Company filed a lawsuit against ITL, which included the request for various injunctive relief against ITL for damages stemming from this breach. 

&#160; 

On February 19, 2013, the Company and ITL entered into a settlement agreement whereby the parties have agreed to the following: (1) the Company will submit a letter to the Court advising the Court that the parties have reached a settlement and that the Company is withdrawing its motion, (2) ITL will pay the Company $20,000, (3) ITL will issue to the Company, ITL&#8217;s share capital equivalent to 9% of the issued and outstanding shares of ITL, (4) the Company will change its name and (5) the settling parties agree that the license agreement will be terminated. 

&#160; 

On March 13, 2013, the Board of Directors approved the change of name to &#8220;Tauriga Sciences, Inc.&#8221; from &#8220;Immunovative, Inc.&#8221; We filed an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation on March 13, 2013 with the Florida Secretary of State to affect this name change after receiving the requisite corporate approval. The Company&#8217;s symbol change to &#8220;TAUG&#8221; was approved by FINRA effective April 9, 2013. 

&#160; 

On May 31, 2013, the Company signed an exclusive North American license agreement with Green Innovations, Inc. (&#8220;Green Innovations&#8221;) for the commercialization of Bamboo-Based &#8220;100% Tree Free&#8221; products including hospital grade biodegradable disinfectant wipes. This 5 year license agreement functioned such that profits were to be split equally between Tauriga and Green Innovations. In consideration for such agreement Tauriga agreed to pay Green Innovations $250,000 USD and 4,347,826 shares of TAUG common stock. Tauriga received 625,000 shares of Green Innovations common stock as well. The agreement was later amended and completed for the following consideration: Tauriga paid Green Innovations a total of $143,730 USD and an additional 2,500,000 shares of TAUG common stock (for an aggregate share issuance of 6,847,826 shares). As of Year End March 31, 2014, Tauriga has not generated any revenues from the license agreement. And this agreement expires on June 1, 2018. 

&#160; 

On October 29, 2013 the Company entered into a Strategic Alliance with Synthetic Biology Pioneer Bacterial Robotics LLC to Develop and Commercialize Industry Specific Bacterial Robots &#8220;BactoBots&#8221;. Under terms of the Agreement the companies will jointly develop a nuclear industry-specific Bacterial Robot (&#8220;BactoBots(TM)&#8221;). BactoBots are ubiquitous microscopic robots applicable to therapeutics, wastewater, and chemicals. Specifically, Bacterial Robotics owns a family of intellectual property beginning with U.S Patent # 8,354,267 B2 that relates generally to genetically enhanced bacteria that conduct specific functions. Bacterial Robotics initial focus with Tauriga is developing a proprietary BactoBot to remediate wastewater generated by nuclear energy production. 

&#160; 

On November 25, 2013, the Company entered a definitive agreement to acquire Cincinnati, Ohio based Pilus Energy LLC (&#8220;Pilus Energy&#8221;), a developer of alternative cleantech energy platforms using proprietary microbial solutions that creates electricity while consuming polluting molecules from wastewater. Upon consummation of the proposed transaction, which has been unanimously ratified by Tauriga&#8217;s board of directors, Pilus Energy will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tauriga. In addition certain advisors of Pilus Energy will be incorporated into the existing management team of Tauriga and will report directly to the Company&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Stella M. Sung. A total of $100,000 was paid by Tauriga to Bacterial Robotics in connection with the execution of this November 2013 definitive agreement for the acquisition of Pilus Energy. 

&#160; 

On January 28, 2014, the Company completed the acquisition of Cincinnati, Ohio based synthetic biology pioneer Pilus Energy LLC (&#8220;Pilus Energy&#8221;). Structurally Pilus Energy will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Tauriga (pursuant to the terms of the definitive agreement) and will maintain its headquarters location in the State of Ohio. The management of Pilus Energy will report directly to both the Chief Executive Officer (&#8220;CEO&#8221;) and Chief Operating Officer (&#8220;COO&#8221;) of Tauriga with the expectation that at least one board seat of Tauriga will be allocated to a Pilus Energy affiliate. The Board of Directors of Tauriga Sciences unanimously approved both the previously announced definitive merger agreement on October 25, 2013 as well as the completion of the acquisition inclusive of amended closing terms. In consideration for early closing of this acquisition, shareholders of Pilus Energy received 100,000,000 shares of Tauriga Sciences, Inc. common stock. 

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

Both management teams are highly confident that the capital and liquidity needs will be sufficiently met through commitments from existing institutional investors and progress in non-dilutive funding initiatives (i.e., grants, low interest loans). The main benefits in accelerating the closing of this acquisition are to enhance Tauriga&#8217;s access to capital markets and enable the intrinsic value of Pilus Energy&#8217;s technology to be realized sooner through demonstrable progress in the commercialization process. Pilus Energy utilizes a proprietary clean technology to convert industrial customer &#8220;wastewater&#8221; into value. This wastewater-to-value (&#8220;WTV&#8221;) proposition provides customers with substantial revenue-generating and cost-saving opportunities. Pilus Energy is converging digester, fermenter, scrubber, and other proven legacy technologies into a single scalable Electrogenic Bioreactor (&#8220;EBR&#8221;) platform. This transformative microbial fuel cell technology is the basis of the Pilus Cell(TM). The EBR harnesses genetically enhanced bacteria, also known as bacterial robots, or BactoBots(TM), that remediate water, harvest direct current (DC) electricity, and produce economically important gases and chemicals. The EBR accomplishes this through bacterial metabolism, specifically cellular respiration of nearly four hundred carbon and nitrogen molecules typically called pollutants in wastewater. Pilus Energy&#8217;s highly metabolic bacteria are non-pathogenic. Because of the mediated biofilm formation, these wastewater-to-value BactoBots(TM) resist heavy metal poisoning, swings of pH, and survive in a 4-to-45 degree Celsius temperature range. Additionally, the BactoBots(TM) are anaerobically and aerobically active, even with low biological oxygen demand (&#8220;BOD&#8221;) and chemical oxygen demand (&#8220;COD&#8221;). 

&#160; 

On March 26, 2014, the Company announced that its wholly owned subsidiary Pilus Energy LLC (&#8220;Pilus Energy&#8221;) has commenced a five-phase, $1,700,000 USD commercial pilot test (&#8220;commercial pilot&#8221;) with the Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;), utilizing Chicago Bridge &#38; Iron Co. (NYSE:CBI) (&#8220;CB&#38;I&#8221;) Federal Services serving as the third-party-contractor through the EPA&#8217;s Test and Evaluation (&#8220;T&#38;E&#8221;) facility. This five phase commercial pilot will include significant testing of the Pilus Energy Electrogenic Bioreactor (&#8220;EBR&#8221;) synthetic biology platform for generating value from wastewater. This commercial pilot is of great importance to the Company, because it represents the scale up from the benchtop (laboratory) scale to commercial (industrial) scale. The Metropolitan Sewer District of Greater Cincinnati (&#8220;MSDGR&#8221;), which is co-located with EPA&#8217;s T&#38;E facility, will host the commercial scale EBR prototype at its main treatment plant in Cincinnati.

Non-convertible Debt Financing &#8211; Alternative Strategy Partners PTE Ltd. 

&#160; 

On September 30, 2015, the Company entered into a debt facility of $180,000 in non-convertible debt financing from Singapore-based institutional investor Alternative Strategy Partners PTE Ltd. (&#8220;ASP&#8221;). The debt carries a fixed interest rate per annum of 11.50% (&#8220;the Designated Rate&#8221;) payable in full by December 23, 2015 (&#8220;the Maturity Date&#8221;). Both parties have discussed the possibility of amending terms, if necessary, under the assumption that both parties mutually agree to such amendment. The Company received cash from the note of $90,000 ($75,000 wired directly to the Company and $15,000 wired directly from ASP to compensate a consultant). 

&#160; 

The balance of this $180,000 or the other $90,000 was wired directly to a Japanese based consumer product firm called Eishin, Inc. 

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

The Company had entered into an agreement to acquire common shares equivalent to 20.1% of Eishin Co., Ltd. (&#8220;Eishin&#8221;), a high growth Japan-based company focusing on providing solutions to improve automobile combustion efficiency. &#8220;Eco-Spray&#8221;, Eishin&#8217;s key product made from 100% natural ingredients, is distributed in numerous Asian markets including China, Japan, Korea, India, UAE, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Philippines and Myanmar, and is currently being tested for expansion in North America. The Company has agreed to make an investment in Eishin for a total of $180,000, of which half was paid on October 1, 2015 and the remainder to be paid by the end of October 31, 2015. 

&#160; 

The Company has not received any type of default notice with respect to this $180,000 non-convertible debenture. Additionally, the Company has not received any shares in Eishin Co., Ltd. up to this point. The Company is currently in discussions with ASP to amend the original terms of this non-convertible debenture, specifically to reduce the face value of this note from $180,000 to $90,000 and forgo receipt of any shares of Eishin Co., Ltd.

&#160;

Lastly on October 9, 2015, ASP Managing Director (Yuhi Horiguchi) notified the Company via email that any and all warrants that had been previously mentioned in the $180,000 note were fully cancelled. So there are no warrants in existence, in accordance with this $180,000 non-convertible debenture. Nor have there been any defaults that ASP has notified the Company.

Lawsuit Filed Against Cowan Gunteski &#38; Co. PA 

&#160; 

On November 4, 2015, the Company filed a lawsuit against its predecessor audit firm Cowan Gunteski &#38; Co. PA in Federal Court &#8212; Southern District Florida (Miami, Florida). The case alleges, among other things, that Cowan Gunteski committed malpractice with respect to the audit of the Company&#8217;s FY 2014 financial statements (as illustrated in the PCAOB Public Censure of July 23, 2015) and then misrepresented to the Company with respect about its ability to re-issue an independent opinion for FY 2014 financial statements. On July 31, 2015, the Company was delisted from the OTCQB Exchange to the OTC Pink Limited Information Tier due to its inability to file its FY 2015 Form 10K. The lawsuit was expected by the Company and its counsel to take up to 18 months to complete, from the date it was filed (November 4, 2015). 

&#160; 

The Company in its lawsuit seeks damages against Cowan Gunteski (and its malpractice insurance policy) exceeding $3,000,000. There is no guarantee that the Company will be successful in this lawsuit. 

&#160; 

Subsequent to the filing of the lawsuit, the Company was notified that the lawsuit was temporarily suspended so that the Company and Cowan can attempt to mediate this case. On December 30, 2015, the Company was notified that Daniel F. Kolb was appointed as the mediator. 

&#160; 

Mediation commenced on February 3, 2016. During these efforts, the Company had been offered settlement amounts, but none that have been satisfactory. 

&#160; 

On March 22, 2016 the Company decided that its good faith efforts to settle its ongoing litigation with Cowan Gunteski &#38; Co. P.A. have proven unsuccessful. Therefore, the Board of Directors of the Company unanimously agreed to proceed to trial. The case is expected to proceed in Federal District Court &#8212; Southern District Florida (Miami, Florida) with an expectation that the venue will be challenged. The Company is continuing to seek the assistance of independent experts, to help ascribe dollar amounts for certain damages suffered by the Company (&#8220;provable damages&#8221;). At this point in time, the Company has realized out of pocket cash losses and debts (inclusive of liquidated damages) that exceed $850,000. Additional potential damages include but are not limited to: inability to properly maintain Pilus Energy&#8217;s Intellectual Property (&#8220;Pilus IP&#8221;), the July 31, 2015 delisting of the Company shares from OTCQB to Pink Sheets, loss of market capitalization (&#8220;market cap&#8221;), loss of trading liquidity (&#8220;trading volume&#8221;), and loss of substantial business opportunities. In aggregate the Company intends to seek monetary award(s), during trial, in excess of $3,000,000. That figure is expected to continually increase as additional time lapses.

Arbitration &#8211; Cherry Baekert LLP 

&#160; 

On November 23, 2015, the Company had its arbitration date in Miami, Florida at the law office of Pollack, Pollack and Kogan against Cherry Baekert LLP (a consultant of the Company). This arbitration was concerning outstanding invoices of $31,280 that Cherry Baekert believed was owed from the Company pursuant to two separate engagement letters entered into in 2014. Prior to November 23, 2015, the Company had already paid $25,000 to Cherry Baekert pursuant to these above mentioned agreements. 

&#160; 

The arbitrator, Lawrence Saichek, ruled against the Company on December 29, 2015 awarding Cherry Baekert the full $31,280 plus legal fee reimbursement, and court costs reimbursed. The total award was $47,568. Since that time, the number has grown to $51,387. On April 25, 2016, the Company made a $15,000 payment to Cherry Baekert towards this outstanding amount. Therefore, the remaining balance is now $36,387. In addition, Cherry Baekert, as a good faith measure, granted the Company until June 30, 2016 to pay the balance. There can be no guarantees that the Company will be able to meet that deadline.
