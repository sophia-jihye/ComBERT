 Item 1. Business. 

&#160; 

Description of Business 

&#160;

We are a medical device company, specializing in the designing, developing and commercializing of cost-effective physical rehabilitation technologies, prosthetics, and assisted robotic products. We strive to innovate and build devices that improve an individual&#8217;s health, comfort, accessibility and quality of life through the use of advanced algorithms and sensing technologies that anticipate a user&#8217;s every move.

&#160;

Our first product is the ARKE lower body exoskeleton. We plan to develop other biomechatronic solutions through internal research and development and we may further augment our product portfolio through strategic and accretive acquisition opportunities in the future.

&#160;

We also have two early stage development technologies: APOLLO, an intelligent prosthetic knee; and Chronos, a cloud-based intelligent patient queuing system. We are continuing development and exploring markets and pricing for Chronos to determine if the market justifies further investment. We currently do not have the financial capability or personnel to develop APOLLO and the ARKE at the same time, so our investment in APOLLO is on hold in order to focus on the ARKE. We intend to continue to revisit developing our technologies and the markets for our technologies as we grow.

&#160;

Since our founding, we have partnered with industry partners in manufacturing and design and have also expanded our development team through partnerships with researchers and academia. From inception to immediately prior to the First Closing, we have secured cash funding of approximately $5.5 million, which includes grants as well as Scientific Research and Experimental Development tax refunds provided through the Canadian government that support our creation of technologies that could lower the costs of medical devices and medical care.

&#160;

We currently hold an intellectual property portfolio that includes 5 U.S. and international patents pending, 13 U.S. provisional patents, and other patents under development. The provisional patents may not be filed as full patents and new provisional patents may be filed as the technology evolves or changes.

&#160;

Through December 31, 2015, we have not generated any revenue and have a history of net losses.

&#160; 

Recent Developments 

&#160; 

Merger Agreement with Interactive Motion Technologies, Inc. 

&#160;

On March 1, 2016, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the &#8220;Merger Agreement&#8221;) with Interactive Motion Technologies, Inc. (&#8220;Interactive Motion&#8221; or &#8220;IMT&#8221;), a Massachusetts corporation, and Bionik Mergerco Inc., a Massachusetts corporation, our wholly owned subsidiary, providing for the merger of Bionik Mergerco with and into Interactive Motion, with Interactive Motion surviving as our wholly-owned subsidiary. Interactive Motion is a Massachusetts-based private company that provides robotic tools for neurorehabilitation professionals.

&#160;

Subject to the indemnification and escrow arrangements described in the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the merger, we will issue (or reserve for issuance) an aggregate of 23,650,000 shares of our common stock in exchange for all shares of Interactive Motion common stock and Interactive Motion preferred stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than shares (i) held in treasury or (ii) held by persons who properly exercise appraisal rights under Massachusetts law).

&#160;

4&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Because the consummation of the merger will constitute a sale event under the terms of the Articles of Organization, as amended, of Interactive Motion, at the effective time of the merger, first holders of the Interactive Motion preferred stock will receive payment of their liquidation preference out of the merger consideration prior to any payment or allocation of merger consideration to holders of Interactive Motion common stock. Following payment of the liquidation preference to the holders of Interactive Motion preferred stock, the remaining merger consideration, subject to the indemnification and escrow arrangements described in the Merger Agreement, will be paid to the holders of Interactive Motion common stock.

&#160;

Additionally, we will assume each of the 3,897,500 options to acquire Interactive Motion common stock granted under its equity incentive plan or otherwise issued by Interactive Motion. At the effective time of the merger, these options will represent the right to purchase an aggregate of 3,000,000 shares of our common stock, of which 1,000,000 will have an exercise price of $0.25, 1,000,000 will have an exercise price of $0.95 and 1,000,000 will have an exercise price of $1.05.

&#160;

Consummation of the merger is subject to customary conditions, including without limitation, the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Interactive Motion preferred stock voting as a separate class, and a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Interactive Motion preferred stock and common stock voting together as a single class. If the law permits, we or Interactive Motion may each waive conditions for their benefit and their stockholders&#8217; benefit and complete the merger even though one or more of these conditions has not been met.

&#160;

The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights, including that upon termination of the Merger Agreement for any reason except our breach, Interactive Motion must pay us a fee of $80,000, all other amounts we may have advanced to Interactive Motion subsequent to March 1, 2016 through the termination date (including the loan as described below), and all amounts loaned to Interactive Motion by us prior to the date of the Merger Agreement of $300,000 plus interest, shall be immediately due and payable.

&#160;

As of March 14, 2015, we entered into a Waiver and Amendment Agreement with Bionik Mergerco Inc., Hermano Igo Krebs, and IMT. The Amendment amends the Merger Agreement and waives any and all potential or actual breaches and/or defaults by the Company of its representations, warranties and/or covenants in the Merger Agreement as a result of the restatements referred to below under &#8220;-Restatement of Unaudited Financial Statements.&#8221;

&#160;

The foregoing summary of the Merger Agreement and the Amendment does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the Merger Agreement and the Amendment, which are attached hereto as Exhibit 2.2 and 2.3 and incorporated herein by reference.

&#160; 

Loan Agreement with Interactive Motion 

&#160;

On March 7, 2016, we loaned $68,750 to Interactive Motion, pursuant to a Loan and Security Agreement, to fund certain Interactive Motion expenses in contemplation of the closing of the merger. The loan matures upon the earlier to occur of (a) the termination date of the Merger Agreement and (b) the effective date of the Merger.

&#160;

Interest on the loan is 6% per annum. The loan is secured by a lien on the asset of Interactive Motion, subject to our company having a second position on all accounts and inventory of Interactive Motion. Bionik may call an event of default upon the failure of Interactive Motion to make a payment when due of any principal or interest on the loan.

&#160;

This loan is in addition to a May 5, 2015 loan to Interactive Motion of $150,000 and an August 25, 2015 loan to Interactive Motion of $150,000.

&#160;

Restatement of Unaudited Financial Statements 

&#160; 

On March 11, 2016, we announced that, during the preparation of our financial statements for the year-end December 31, 2015, we were advised by MNP LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, to re-evaluate our accounting relating to the common stock purchase warrants issued in 2015 as part of the Offering, and to consider restating our previously issued reviewed, unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2015, June 30, 2015 and September 30, 2015.

&#160;

Management promptly engaged outside advisors to consult on this matter, including a Big 4 accounting firm, and on March 9, 2016, management, with and upon advice of such advisors and further discussions with its auditors, determined that the financial statements included in such Quarterly Reports should no longer be relied upon and would be restated due to non-cash errors identified in the accounting for the warrants.

&#160;

As a result, we filed restated Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2015, June 30, 2015 and September 30, 2015.

&#160;

Please see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,&#8221; &#8220;Controls and Procedures&#8221; and our audited financial statements later in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

&#160;

The Acquisition Transaction and Offering 

&#160;

On February 26, 2015, we entered into an Investment Agreement with Bionik Acquisition Inc., a company existing under the laws of Canada and our wholly owned subsidiary (&#8220;Acquireco&#8221;), and Bionik Laboratories, Inc. (&#8220;Bionik Canada&#8221;) (the &#8220;Investment Agreement&#8221;), whereby we acquired 100 Class 1 common shares of Bionik Canada representing 100% of the outstanding Class 1 common shares of Bionik Canada, taking into account the Exchangeable Share Transaction (as defined below) (the &#8220;Acquisition Transaction&#8221;). After giving effect to the Acquisition Transaction, we commenced operations through Bionik Canada.

&#160;

Bionik Canada was incorporated on March 24, 2011 under the Canada Business Corporations Act. Bionik Canada&#8217;s principal executive office is located at 483 Bay Street, N105, Toronto, ON Canada M5G 2C9 and its telephone number is (416) 640-7887. Our website address is www.bioniklabs.com.

&#160;

Immediately prior to the closing of the Acquisition Transaction and the First Closing (as defined below), we transferred all of the business, properties, assets, operations and goodwill of the Company (other than cash and cash equivalents), and liabilities as of March 6, 2013, to our then-existing wholly owned subsidiary, Strategic Dental Alliance, Inc., a Colorado corporation (&#8220;Strategic Dental Alliance&#8221;), and then transferred all of the capital stock of Strategic Dental Alliance to Brian E. Ray, a former officer and existing director (through March 20, 2015) and Jon Lundgreen, a former officer and director, pursuant to a Spin-Off Agreement (the &#8220;Spin-Off Agreement&#8221;). Also as of immediately prior to the closing of the Acquisition Transaction and the First Closing, we entered into an Assignment and Assumption Agreement with Tungsten 74 LLC, pursuant to which Tungsten 74 LLC assumed all of our remaining liabilities through the closing of the Acquisition Transaction (the &#8220;Assignment and Assumption Agreement&#8221;). Accordingly, as of the closing of the Acquisition Transaction and the First Closing, we had no assets or liabilities.

&#160;

As a condition of the closing of the Acquisition Transaction, Bionik Canada created a new class of exchangeable shares (the &#8220;Exchangeable Shares&#8221;), which were issued to the existing common shareholders of Bionik Canada in exchange for all of their outstanding common shares, all of which were cancelled (the &#8220;Exchangeable Share Transaction&#8221;).

&#160;

Pursuant to the rights and privileges of the Exchangeable Shares, the holders of such Exchangeable Shares maintain the right to (i) receive dividends equal to, and paid concurrently with, dividends paid by the Company to the holders of Common Stock; (ii) vote, through the Trustee&#8217;s voting of the Special Voting Preferred Stock (as defined herein) on all matters that the holders of Common Stock are entitled to vote upon; and (iii) receive shares of Common Stock upon the liquidation or insolvency of the Company upon the redemption of such Exchangeable Shares by Acquireco. The Exchangeable Shares do not give the holders any economic, voting or other control rights over Bionik Canada.

&#160;

As part of the Exchangeable Share Transaction, we entered into the following agreements, each dated February 26, 2015:

&#160;

&#8226; Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement (the &#8220;Trust Agreement&#8221;) with Bionik Canada and Computershare Trust Company of Canada (the &#8220;Trustee&#8221;); and &#160;

&#8226; Support Agreement (the &#8220;Support Agreement&#8221;) with Acquireco and Bionik Canada. &#160;

Pursuant to the terms of the Trust Agreement, the parties created a trust for the benefit of its beneficiaries, which are the holders of the Exchangeable Shares, enabling the Trustee to exercise the voting rights of such holders until such time as they choose to redeem their Exchangeable Shares for shares of the common stock of the Company, and allowing the Trustee to hold certain exchange rights in respect of the Exchangeable Shares.

&#160;

6&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

As a condition of the Trust Agreement and prior to the execution thereof, we filed a Certificate of Designation with the Delaware Secretary of State, effective February 20, 2015, designating a class of our preferred shares as The Special Voting Preferred Stock (the &#8220;Special Voting Preferred Stock&#8221;) and issued one share of The Special Voting Preferred Stock to the Trustee.

&#160;

The Special Voting Preferred Stock entitles the Trustee to exercise the number of votes equal to the number of Exchangeable Shares outstanding on a one-for-one basis during the term of the Trust Agreement. The Trust Agreement further sets out the terms and conditions under which holders of the Exchangeable Shares are entitled to instruct the Trustee as to how to vote during any stockholder meetings of our company.

&#160;

Pursuant to the terms of the Trust Agreement, we granted the Trustee the right to require our Company to purchase the Exchangeable Shares from any beneficiary upon the occurrence of certain events including in the event that we are bankrupt, insolvent or our business is wound up. The Trust Agreement continues to remain in force until the earliest of the following events: (i) no outstanding Exchangeable Shares are held by any beneficiary under the Trust Agreement; and (ii) each of Bionik Canada and us elects to terminate the Trust Agreement in writing and the termination is approved by the beneficiaries.

&#160;

Pursuant to the terms of the Support Agreement, we agreed to certain covenants while the Exchangeable Shares were outstanding, including: (i) not to declare or pay any dividends on our common stock unless simultaneously declaring the equivalent dividend for the holders of the Exchangeable Shares, (ii) advising Bionik Canada in advance of any dividend declaration by our company, (iii) ensure that the record date for any dividend or other distribution declared on the shares of the Company is not less than seven days after the declaration date of such dividend or other distribution; (iv) taking all actions reasonably necessary to enable Bionik Canada to pay and otherwise perform its obligations with respect to the issued and outstanding Exchangeable Shares, (iv) to ensure that shares of the Company are delivered to holders of Exchangeable Shares upon exercise of certain redemption rights set out in the agreement and in the rights and restrictions of the Exchangeable Shares, and (v) reserving for issuance and keeping available from our authorized common stock such number of shares as may be equal to: (A) the number of Exchangeable Shares issued and outstanding from time to time; and (B) the number of Exchangeable Shares issuable upon the exercise of all rights to acquire Exchangeable Shares from time to time.

&#160;

The Support Agreement also outlines certain restrictions on our ability to issue any dividends, rights, options or warrants to all or substantially all of our stockholders during the term of the agreement unless the economic equivalent is provided to the holders of Exchangeable Shares. The Support Agreement is governed by the laws of the Province of Ontario.

&#160;

Concurrently with the closing of the Acquisition Transaction and in contemplation of the Acquisition Transaction, we sold 7,735,750 units (the &#8220;Units&#8221;) for gross proceeds of $6,188,600 (including $500,000 of outstanding bridge loans converted into Units at the offering price) at a purchase price of $0.80 per Unit (the &#8220;Purchase Price&#8221;) in a private placement offering (the &#8220;Offering&#8221;). Each Unit consists of one share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the &#8220;Common Stock&#8221;) and a warrant (the &#8220;Warrant&#8221;) to purchase one share of Common Stock at an initial exercise price of $1.40 per share (the &#8220;Warrant Shares&#8221;).

&#160;

7&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The Offering was being offered with a minimum offering amount of $6,000,000 (the &#8220;Minimum Offering Amount&#8221;) and up to a maximum offering amount of $12,800,000 (subject to an up-to $2,600,000 overallotment option). Once the Minimum Offering amount was reached and held in escrow and other conditions to closing were satisfied (including the simultaneous closing of the Acquisition Transaction), the Company and the placement agent were able to conduct a first closing (the &#8220;First Closing&#8221;). Pursuant to the terms of a Registration Rights Agreement, we filed a registration statement on Form S-1 (or any other applicable form exclusively for the Offering) (the &#8220;Registration Statement&#8221;) registering for resale under the Securities Act all of the shares of Common Stock sold in the Offering and Warrant Shares underlying the Warrants. As a result of the Offering, after payment of placement agent fees and expenses but before the payment of other offering expenses such as legal and accounting expenses, we received net proceeds of approximately $5,339,778 at the First Closing, including the $500,000 in bridge loans we previously received that were taken into account as part of the Minimum Offering Amount. In addition, the placement agent is entitled to 10% warrant coverage for all Units sold in the Offering, which we intend to issue upon the last closing of the Offering for all Units sold in the Offering. The warrants will be exercisable at $0.80 per share for a period of 4 years.

&#160;

As of the Acquisition Transaction and the First Closing, an aggregate of 90,575,126 shares of our Common Stock were deemed cancelled, of which 90,207,241 were held by our former Chief Executive Officer and current Senior Vice President.

&#160;

Immediately following the Acquisition Transaction, the Exchangeable Share Transaction and the First Closing, there were approximately 63,735,813 shares of our common stock and equivalents issued and outstanding of which approximately 6,000,063 were held by existing stockholders, 7,735,750 were held by the investors in the Offering and Bionik Canada shareholders held an equivalent of 50,000,000 shares of our common stock through their ownership of 100% of the Exchangeable Shares.

&#160;

On March 27, 2015, we sold to accredited investors in a second closing, 1,212,500 Units for gross proceeds of $970,000 at the Purchase Price. After payment of placement agent fees and expenses but before the payment of other Offering expenses such as legal and accounting expenses, we received net proceeds of $828,900.

&#160;

On March 31, 2015, we sold to accredited investors in a third closing of the Offering, 891,250 Units for gross proceeds of $713,000 at the Purchase Price. After payment of placement agent fees and expenses but before the payment of other offering expenses such as legal and accounting expenses, we received net proceeds of $615,901.

&#160;

On April 21, 2015, we sold to accredited investors in a fourth closing of the Offering, 3,115,000 Units for gross proceeds of $2,492,000 at the Purchase Price. After payment of placement agent fees and expenses but before the payment of other offering expenses such as legal and accounting expenses, we received net proceeds of $2,153,040.

&#160;

On May 27, 2015, we sold to accredited investors in a fifth closing of the Offering, 1,418,750 Units for gross proceeds of $1,135,000 at the Purchase Price. After payment of placement agent fees and expenses but before the payment of other offering expenses such as legal and accounting expenses, we received net proceeds of $987,434.

&#160;

On June 30, 2015, we sold to accredited investors in a sixth and final closing of the Offering, 2,035,000 Units for gross proceeds of $1,628,000 at the Purchase Price. After payment of placement agent fees and expenses but before the payment of other offering expenses such as legal and accounting expenses, we received net proceeds of approximately $1,416,344.

&#160;

Through the final closing of the Offering on June 30, 2015, we raised in the Offering aggregate gross proceeds of $13,126,600. As a result, assuming there are no transfers of our common stock by the holder thereof, our pre-Acquisition Transaction stockholders hold approximately 8.3% of our issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock, the former stockholders of Bionik Canada hold the right to approximately 69.0% of our issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock through their ownership of 100% of the Exchangeable Shares, and the investors in the Offering hold approximately 22.7% of our issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock.

Product Pipeline 

&#160; 

ARKE 

&#160;

The ARKE is a robotic lower body exoskeleton designed for wheelchair bound individuals suffering from spinal cord injuries, stroke and other mobility disabilities which could allow patients to restore proper walking gait, rehabilitate more efficiently and finally could improve current methods of manual rehabilitation and its future results. ARKE is expected to complement or replace existing rehabilitation methods by enabling a patient full motion control and increasing feedback for physicians and care providers during the rehabilitation process. Further, the ability to walk during rehabilitation has the potential to reduce bone density loss, muscle atrophy, secondary illness and the frequency of re-hospitalization, while potentially helping to increase blood flow and nutrient delivery throughout the body. It is also believed that additional potential improvements in patients is expected to include but are not limited to: better bowel control, better bladder control and medication reduction.

&#160;

We have achieved significant progression in the ARKE development. We completed clinical testing of the generation 1 product. The clinical feedback from this testing, directed the development for ARKE&#8217;s generation 2. Generation 2 of the ARKE exoskeleton development was completed in the second quarter of 2015 as planned and currently the manufacturing phase of the entire system is underway. We plan to begin clinical tests of ARKE in Canada in 2016 at a research institute in Montreal, Quebec and at a hospital group in Toronto, Ontario. We are currently focused on the Canadian market due to lower clinical costs and faster possible approval from Health Canada. We are also investigating the possibility of clinical tests of ARKE in Europe later in 2016 in cooperation with the clinical trials in Canada.

&#160;

There are significant improvements in generation 2 of the ARKE over our previous generations of ARKE, including:

&#160;

&#8226; Significantly slimmer than the first clinical tested version and much lighter; &#160;

&#8226; Incorporates a built-in removable data interface that will give the physiotherapist full control of the product but also will allow the patient to visually see their own progress; &#160;

&#8226; Significantly improved control system with adaptive walking and step recovery; and &#160;

&#8226; A system that collects data from all sensors on the device. &#160;

The next step of the data collection system is to save patient data from the exoskeleton in the data interface and send the data to the cloud where the data can be processed. In the future this system will allow optimization of various rehabilitation programs and individualization of expected goals for each patient.

&#160;

We believe that the ideal candidate for the ARKE rehabilitation and ambilion therapy is a level T6 spinal cord injury patient with paralysis below the chest but maintains some or all upper body strength and mobility, although we believe any incomplete paraplegic (meaning a paraplegic with some healthy nerves remaining after the spinal cord damage that allows for no more than partial paralysis of hands, arms and upper torso) can benefit from the rehabilitation that the ARKE is expected to provide.

&#160;

The ARKE uses sensory technology to determine at all times a user&#8217;s movements, such as bending forward and weight shifts from side to side. This sensory system allows the exoskeleton to determine precisely the movement required by the user, including when the user wants to walk, stop, sit down or stop.

&#160;

9&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

We have developed the ARKE to be electronically adjustable by a clinician or a rehabilitation specialist to attend to a patient&#8217;s specific needs and provide for customized rehabilitation or ambilion plans. Additionally, the ARKE will have the capability to interface with the provided tablet computer to allow the clinician or a rehabilitation specialist to program, change, edit and select different features within the ARKE system platform, such as selecting or saving a patient&#8217;s profile, adjusting the rehabilitation movement speed or walking gait. The tablet interface is designed to allow for the staff to be in close proximity to the user, allowing for them to closely monitor the ARKE at all times during use, making the process safer and more reliable and facilitating post session data analysis.

&#160;

Stroke rehabilitation and other similar disability rehabilitation programs deal with patients that do not necessarily have spinal cord damage and that may possess the ability to generate some sort of lower-body motion. Accordingly, we intend in the future on developing a version of the ARKE for stroke patients with partial assist, that is expected to allow stroke patients that have restricted or no motion in one or both legs to wear the product and experience normal weight bearing rehabilitation to walk. We anticipate that the ARKE software platform will also be programmed to assist with the rehabilitation of other disabilities in the future such as cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis and spinal bifida.

&#160;

We also intend on developing additional accessories for the ARKE that can improve the rehabilitation process along with the clinician&#8217;s or rehabilitation specialist&#8217;s interaction with the patient. We feel that improving the staff interaction with the patient is an important step forward for the industry and incorporating a tablet interface to the ARKE was our first innovative step in this regard. We intend on improving real time interactions between the staff and the patient that can simulate resistance experienced during the rehabilitation process, as well as improving product controls.

&#160;

On February 1, 2016, we announced that we are working with IBM to develop a unique analytics system and apply sophisticated machine learning algorithms to improve the outcomes of neurological rehabilitation. Use of IBM&#8217;s cognitive computing infrastructure would enable access to the exoskeleton&#8217;s performance, patient data, and results of ARKE rehabilitation from multiple sites, including rehabilitation centers, physicians&#8217; offices, physiotherapists&#8217; offices, patients&#8217; homes, research centers or any other location at any time. Phase one of the IBM development project for ARKE is expected to be completed in 2016. Phase one will include the full backend required to capture the information needed for future use. As part of phases two and three of the project, Bionik engineers together with data scientists at IBM are expected to develop machine-learning algorithms designed to analyze large volumes of sensor data generated by ARKE. The analytical program is expected to be an important tool in identifying the correlation between different rehabilitation regimens using the ARKE exoskeleton and understanding the therapeutic results from these physio-protocol programs over certain measures of time.

&#160;

Mobility impairment affects an estimated 10 million people in developed countries, of which there is an estimated 5 million potential ARKE users in those markets. We believe that the ARKE can be used to assist in the rehabilitation of those patients who have mobility in their arms for stability.

&#160; 

Other Prospective Products 

&#160;

We intend to expand our product offerings and enhance the strength of our Company through, not only internal development, but also strategic and accretive partnerships or acquisitions from time to time.

&#160; 

Competition and Competitive Advantage 

&#160;

The medical technology equipment industry is characterized by strong competition and rapid technological change. There are a number of companies developing technologies that are competitive to our existing and proposed products, many of them, when compared to our Company, having significantly longer operational history and greater financial and other resources.

&#160;

10&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The ARKE faces competition from companies that are focused on technologies for rehabilitation of patients suffering from spinal cord injuries, stroke and related neurological disabilities. Our competitors that we expect to compete with the ARKE in spinal cord rehabilitation therapies include Rewalk Robotics, Ekso Bionics, and Rex Bionics, each of which sell over-ground, weight bearing exoskeletons. Additionally, Parker Hannifin has announced plans to sell over-ground exoskeletons beginning in 2015. For the stroke market, we are developing an assisted version of the ARKE, which we expect will compete with Cyberdyne&#8217;s over-ground exoskeletons and Hocoma, AlterG, Aretech, Ekso Bionics, Parker Hannifin and Reha Technology, who are each selling treadmill-based walking gait therapies.

&#160;

We believe that the ARKE&#8217;s primary advantage over the aforementioned products is that it has been designed to facilitate a selling price, which we believe is more affordable to the market than competing products. When comparing the ARKE to treadmill-based products available to the rehabilitation market, the ARKE has a smaller footprint, uses standard power sources, does not need any special infrastructure and is expected to be more affordable. Importantly, the ARKE is able to mobilize pre or non-ambulatory patients as it is a full weight-bearing product. The ARKE is also expected to be less expensive than competitors in the spinal cord rehabilitation market for over-ground exoskeleton products. Additional advantages include our patented patient profiling system, and 3D trigger point system.

&#160;

From inception, our developments and proposed products were focused on the medical market. We believe that we are the company among our competitors with the shortest time to market strategy. For example, Rewalk Robotics was founded in 2001 and launched its product into the home market in 2014, 13 years later. We were founded approximately 5 years ago and have products in pre-clinical testing. We expect our innovative approach to result in a high quality product at a lower cost.

&#160;

Our challenge will be achieving rapid market awareness and adoption of our emerging technology in rehabilitation and mobility centers throughout the U.S., Canada and any other market we may enter. Our proposed acquisition of IMT is expected to significantly help with our clinical trials and ability to launch ARKE into the market, as IMT has clinical data on its FDA&#8211;approved rehabilitative products and IMT has distributorships and relationships with rehabilitation centers around the world which we intend to leverage.

&#160;

Robotic exoskeleton technology and its use in clinical settings is a new and emerging industry and is regulated by medical device regulatory agencies (such as the US Food and Drug Administration). We believe that we will face challenges of increased regulatory scrutiny, possible changes in regulator&#8217;s requirements, meeting quality control standards of various government regulators, increased competition in the future based on other new technologies, additional features and customizability, reduced pricing, clinical outcomes and other factors. Our strength in this market will depend on our ability to achieve market acceptance, develop new technologies, develop new products, implement production plans, develop marketing strategies, secure regulatory approvals, secure necessary data for reimbursement, protect our intellectual property and have sufficient funding to meet all these challenges.

&#160;

The market for the Company&#8217;s other prospective products also has competition and is subject to rapid technological change and regulatory requirements. There can be no assurance that the Company will be in a strong position to respond quickly to potential acquisitions and other market opportunities, new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. Failure to maintain and enhance our competitive position could materially affect the business and our prospects.

&#160; 

11&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Market Strategy 

&#160; 

The ARKE is designed to be a rehabilitation tool for hospitals and clinics and potentially a personal rehabilitation tool so paraplegics and other mobility disabled individuals could benefit from using ARKE at home. We consider the exoskeleton robotic market to consist of two sub-markets:

&#160;

&#8226; The rehabilitation market for hospitals and clinics; and &#160;

&#8226; The home market for personal use. &#160;

We are currently completing the safety testing and general proof of concept testing. We have also prepared clinical trial protocols, which will test the product on paraplegic patients and gauge the medical benefits and other parameters. We anticipate receiving clearance from Health Canada and the European Authorities within approximately 6 months of completing the clinical trials, and later pursue approval with the FDA. We plan to focus initially on clinical trials in Canada and Europe before the U.S. due to the lower cost of trials in Canada and Europe.

&#160;

Our initial go-to-market strategy will be the development of hospital and clinic relationships that will allow us to gain acceptance of the technology among experts and patients. We are also seeking a number of government grants in collaboration with various hospitals and clinics to allow us to partially fund trials, research projects and upgrade the ARKE&#8217;s technology. We expect to gain traction among the doctors and experts involved in the distribution and buying groups that are established within those selected partner hospitals. We expect to also conduct clinical trials in other countries for the purpose of gaining traction in those markets.

&#160;

During the first market phase, we may sell or lease at a monthly or other fee structure the ARKE product to hospitals, clinics, distribution companies and/or buying groups that supply those rehabilitation facilities. We are also considering other revenue models.

&#160;

We intend on developing, licensing or acquiring other related vertical products to introduce to the market. We intend on using a similar commercialization approach for these products as planned for the ARKE.

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

We use intellectual property developed or acquired, including patents, trade secrets and technical innovations to provide our future growth and to build our competitive position. We have 5 U.S. and international patents pending and 13 U.S. provisional patents. As we continue to expand our intellectual property portfolio, it is critical for us to continue to invest in filing patent applications to protect our technology, inventions, and improvements. However, we can give no assurance that competitors will not infringe on our patent rights or otherwise create similar or non infringing competing products that are technically patentable in their own right.

&#160;

Our patents pending, all of which are expected to expire in 2033 or 2034, are as follows:

&#160;

Algorithms &#38; Control Systems Filed US &#38; International Sensory Technology Filed US &#38; International Robotics Filed US &#38; International Robotics Filed US &#38; International Robotics Filed US &#38; International &#160;

Bionik has also filed 13 provisional patents in the areas of Robotics, Algorithms &#38; Controls Systems, Sensory Technology and Cloud Computing. The provisional patents may not be filed as full patents and new provisional patents may be filed as the technology evolves or changes.

&#160;

12&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

We have to date and generally plan to continue to enter into non-disclosure, confidentially and intellectual property assignment agreements with all new employees as a condition of employment. In addition, we intend to also generally enter into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with consultants, manufacturers&#8217; representatives, distributors, suppliers and others to attempt to limit access to, use and disclosure of our proprietary information.

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160;

Our research and development programs are pursued by engineers and scientists employed by us in Toronto on a full-time basis or hired as per diem consultants. We also work with advisors who are industry leaders in manufacturing and design and researchers and academia. These include Dr. Dany Gagnon of the University of Montreal Interdisciplinary Research Centre, Dr. Edward Lemaire of the University of Ottawa, Dr. Isadore Lieberman of the Texas Back Institute, Dr. Kaamran Raahemifar of Ryerson University and Gary Henley, a former CEO of medical device and technology companies. We are also working with subcontractors in developing specific components of our technologies. The primary objective of our research and development program is to advance the development of our existing and proposed products, to enhance the commercial value of such products. Furthermore, our proposed acquisition of IMT is expected to significantly strengthen our robotics knowledge and access to additional products and know-how, as it is expected that Dr. Hermano Igo Krebs will join the Company as Chief Science Officer and Dr. Neville Hogan will be an adviser to the Company. Both individuals are currently professors with MIT&#8217;s Robotics Engineering Department

&#160;

For the year ended December 31, 2015 and the transitional period ended December 31, 2014 we incurred $1,489,483 and $1,101,820 respectively, in research and development costs.

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

General 

&#160;

Our medical technology products and operations are subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;) and various other federal and state agencies, as well as foreign governmental agencies in Canada, Europe, South America and Asia. These agencies enforce laws and regulations that govern the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, advertising, marketing and distribution, and market surveillance of our medical device products.

&#160;

In addition to the below, the only regulations we encounter are the regulations that are common to all businesses, such as employment legislation, implied warranty laws, and environmental, health and safety standards, to the extent applicable. We will also encounter in the future industry-specific government regulations that would govern our products, if and when developed for commercial use. It may become the case that other regulatory approvals will be required for the design and manufacture of our products and proposed products.

&#160; 

U.S. Regulation 

&#160;

Under the U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, medical devices are classified into one of three classes &#8212; Class I, Class II or Class III &#8212; depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness. The ARKE is expected to be a Class II product (products similar to the ARKE are currently designated as Class II for supervised use). Class II devices require a 510(k) premarket submission to the US FDA. Equivalent agencies in other countries also require similar submissions prior to the device being marketed.

&#160;

13&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

We also are required to establish a suitable and effective quality management system, which establishes controlled processes for our product design, manufacturing, and distribution. We are doing this in compliance with the internationally recognized standard ISO 13485:2013 Quality Management Systems. Following the introduction of a product, the FDA and foreign agencies engage in periodic reviews of our quality systems, as well as product performance and advertising and promotional materials. These regulatory controls, as well as any changes in FDA or other foreign agencies&#8217; policies, can affect the time and cost associated with the development, introduction and continued availability of new products. Where possible, we anticipate these factors in our product development processes. These agencies possess the authority to take various administrative and legal actions against us, such as product recalls, product seizures and other civil and criminal sanctions.

&#160; 

Foreign Regulation 

&#160;

In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products in foreign countries. The ARKE has been designated as the equivalent to a Class I device with Health Canada. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.

&#160;

The policies of the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities may change and additional government regulations may be enacted which could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our products and could also increase the cost of regulatory compliance. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad.

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015 we had 14 full-time employees, 1 part-time employee and 3 consultants who are based in our principal executive office located in Toronto, Canada. These employees oversee day-to-day operations of the Company supporting management, engineering, manufacturing, and administration functions of the Company. As required, we also engage consultants to provide services to the Company, including quality assurance and corporate services. We have no unionized employees.

&#160;

We have hired a software engineer and quality manager in the first quarter and plan to hire approximately 5 additional full-time employees within the next 12 months whose principal responsibilities will be the support of our research and development, clinical development, production, sales and marketing and commercialization/ business development activities.

&#160;

We consider relations with our employees to be satisfactory.
