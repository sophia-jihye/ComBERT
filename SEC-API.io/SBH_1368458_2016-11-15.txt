 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Introduction 

Sally Beauty Holdings, Inc. is an international specialty retailer and distributor of professional beauty supplies with operations primarily in North America, South America and Europe. We believe the Company is the largest distributor of professional beauty supplies in the U.S. based on store count. At September 30, 2016, we operated primarily through two business units, Sally Beauty Supply and Beauty Systems Group (BSG), and, through Sally Beauty Supply and BSG, we operated a multi-channel platform of 4,937 company-operated stores and supplied 182 franchised stores. Within BSG, we also have one of the largest networks of professional distributor sales consultants in North America, with approximately 936 professional distributor sales consultants who sell directly to salons and salon professionals. Sally Beauty Supply targets retail consumers and salon professionals, while BSG exclusively targets salons and salon professionals. Through Sally Beauty Supply and BSG, we have store locations in the United States (including Puerto Rico), Canada, Mexico, Chile, Colombia, Peru, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain. We provide our customers with a wide variety of leading third-party branded and exclusive-label professional beauty supplies, including hair color products, hair care products, styling appliances, skin and nail care products and other beauty items. For each of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, over 80% of our consolidated net sales were from customers located in the U.S. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, our consolidated net sales and operating earnings were $3,952.6 million and $498.3 million, respectively. 

Professional Beauty Supply Industry Distribution Channels 

The professional beauty supply industry serves end-users through four distribution channels: full-service/exclusive distribution, open-line distribution, direct and mega-salon stores. 

Full-Service/Exclusive 

This channel exclusively serves salons and salon professionals and distributes "professional-only" products for use in salons and resale to consumers in salons. Many brands are distributed through exclusive arrangements with suppliers by geographic territory. We believe that BSG is a leading full-service distributor in the U.S. In addition, we offer our BSG products for sale to salons and salon professionals through the Company's websites (including www.cosmoprofbeauty.com, www.cosmoprofequipment.com and www.loxabeauty.com ). 

Open-Line 

This channel serves retail consumers and salon professionals through retail stores and the internet. This channel is served by a large number of localized retailers and distributors, with only a few having a regional presence and significant channel share. We believe that Sally Beauty Supply is the largest open-line distributor in the U.S. with its nationwide network of retail stores. In addition, the Company's websites (including www.sallybeauty.com ) and other e-commerce platforms provide retail consumers and salon professionals access to product offerings and information beyond our retail stores. 

Direct 

This channel focuses on direct sales to salons and salon professionals by large manufacturers. This is the dominant form of distribution in Europe, but represents a smaller channel in the U.S. due to the highly fragmented nature of the U.S. salon industry, which makes direct distribution cost prohibitive for many manufacturers. 

Mega-Salon Stores 

In this channel, large-format salons are supplied directly by manufacturers due to their large scale. 

Key Industry and Business Trends 

We operate within the large and growing professional beauty supply industry primarily in the U.S., but also in 12 additional countries across North America, South America and Europe. We believe the following key industry and business trends and characteristics will influence our business and our financial results going forward: 

High level of marketplace fragmentation. The U.S. salon industry is highly fragmented with approximately 295,000 salons and barbershops. Given the fragmented and small-scale nature of the salon industry, we believe that salon operators will continue to depend on full-service/exclusive distributors and open-line channels for a majority of their beauty supply purchases. 

Growth in chair renting and frequent stocking needs. Salon professionals primarily rely on just-in-time inventory due to capital constraints and a lack of warehouse and shelf space at salons. In addition, chair renters (formerly referred to as booth renters) and suite renters, who now comprise a significant percentage of total U.S. salon professionals, are often responsible for purchasing their own supplies. Historically, the number of chair renters and suite renters has significantly increased as a percentage of total salon professionals, and we expect this trend to continue. Given their smaller individual purchases and relative lack of financial resources, chair renters and suite renters are likely to be dependent on frequent trips to professional beauty supply stores, like BSG and Sally Beauty Supply. We expect that these factors will continue to drive demand for conveniently located professional beauty supply stores. 

Increasing use of exclusive-label products. We offer an extensive range of exclusive-label professional beauty products, predominantly in our Sally Beauty Supply segment. As our lines of exclusive-label products have matured and become better known in our retail stores, we have seen an increase in sales of these products. Generally, our exclusive-label products have higher gross margins for us than the leading third-party branded products and, accordingly, we believe that growth in our sales of these products will likely enhance our overall gross margins. Furthermore, we believe that we provide our customers with a unique value proposition by offering compelling exclusive-label brands that we believe to be of the same quality as leading third-party branded products at an attractive price. Please see "Risk Factors &#151;We may be unable to anticipate and effectively respond to changes in consumer preferences and buying trends in a timely manner " and " We depend upon manufacturers who may be unable to provide products of adequate quality or who may be unwilling to continue to supply products to us. " 

Favorable consumer trends. Our industry is characterized by continuously changing fashion-related trends that drive new styles, including hair and nail styles, and continuing demand for beauty products. In addition, we expect the aging baby-boomer population in the U.S. to continue to drive sales growth in certain professional beauty product categories, including through an increase in the usage of hair color and hair loss products. Our continued success depends largely on our ability to anticipate, gauge and react in a timely and effective manner to changes in consumer spending patterns and preferences for beauty products. We continuously adapt our marketing and merchandising initiatives in an effort to expand our market reach or to respond to changing consumer preferences. If we are unable to anticipate and respond to trends in the marketplace for beauty products and changing consumer demands, our business could suffer. Please see "Risk Factors &#151;We may be unable to anticipate and effectively respond to changes in consumer preferences and buying trends in a timely manner. " 

International growth strategies. A key element of our growth strategy is to capitalize on international growth opportunities and to grow our current level of non-U.S. operations. For example, our number of international company-operated stores increased from 679 stores to 946 stores during the last five years. In addition, we have completed a number of international acquisitions over the past several years that 

increased our European and South American footprint. We intend to continue to identify and evaluate non-U.S. acquisition and/or organic international growth opportunities. Our ability to grow our non-U.S. operations, integrate our new non-U.S. acquisitions and successfully pursue additional non-U.S. acquisition and/or organic international growth opportunities may be affected by business, legal, regulatory and economic risks. Please see "Risk Factors &#151;We may not be able to successfully identify acquisition candidates or successfully complete desirable acquisitions ," " If we acquire any businesses in the future, they could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business or have an adverse effect on our results of operations " and " Our ability to conduct business in international marketplaces may be affected by legal, regulatory and economic risks. " 

Continuing consolidation. There is continuing consolidation among professional beauty product distributors and professional beauty product manufacturers. We plan to continue to examine ways in which we can benefit from this trend, including the evaluation of opportunities to shift business from competing distributors to the BSG network as well as seeking opportunistic, value-added acquisitions which complement our long-term growth strategy. We believe that suppliers are increasingly likely to focus on larger distributors and retailers with a broader scale and retail footprint and that we are well positioned to capitalize on this trend as well as participate in the ongoing consolidation at the distributor/retail level. However, changes often occur in our relationships with suppliers that may materially affect the net sales and operating earnings of our business segments. Consolidation among suppliers could exacerbate the effects of these relationship changes and could increase pricing pressures. For example, if L'Oreal or any of our other suppliers acquired other distributors or suppliers that conduct significant business with BSG, we could lose related revenue. There can be no assurance that BSG will not lose revenue over time (including within its franchise-based business) due to potential losses of product lines as well as from the increased competition from distribution networks affiliated with any of our suppliers. Please see "Risk Factors &#151;The beauty products distribution industry is highly competitive and is consolidating " and " We depend upon manufacturers who may be unable to provide products of adequate quality or who may be unwilling to continue to supply products to us. " 

Relationships with suppliers. Sally Beauty Supply and BSG, and their respective suppliers are dependent on each other for the distribution of beauty products. We do not manufacture any of the products we sell, including our exclusive-label products, and purchase these products from a limited number of manufacturers. As is typical in distribution businesses (particularly in our industry), these relationships are subject to change from time to time (which often results in the expansion or loss of distribution rights, including exclusive rights, in various geographies and the addition or loss of product lines). Since we purchase products from many of those manufacturers on an at-will basis, under contracts which can generally be terminated without cause upon 90 days' notice or less or which expire without express rights of renewal, such manufacturers could discontinue sales to us at any time or upon the expiration of the distribution period. Some of our contracts with manufacturers may be terminated by such manufacturers if we fail to meet specified minimum purchase requirements. In such cases, vendors may change the terms upon which they sell to us, as we do not have contractual assurances for the continued supply of products, pricing terms or access to the vendor's new products. Infrequently, a supplier will seek to terminate a distribution relationship through legal action. Changes in our relationships with suppliers occur often and could positively or negatively impact our net sales and operating earnings. We expect to continue to expand our product line offerings and to gain additional distribution rights over time through either further negotiation with current and prospective suppliers or by acquisitions of existing distributors. Although we focus on developing new revenue and cost management initiatives to mitigate the negative effects resulting from any unfavorable changes in our supplier relationships, there can be no assurance that our efforts will continue to completely offset the loss of these or other distribution rights. Please see "Risk Factors &#151;We depend upon manufacturers who may be unable to provide products of adequate quality or who may be unwilling to continue to supply products to us. " 

High level of competition. Sally Beauty Supply competes with other domestic and international beauty product wholesale and retail outlets, including local and regional open-line beauty supply stores, professional-only beauty supply stores, mass merchandisers, on-line retailers, drug stores and supermarkets, as well as salons retailing hair care items. Although Sally Beauty Supply positions itself to be competitive on price, its primary focus is to be a source of professional advice, solutions and salon-quality products, rather than a discount leader. BSG competes with other domestic and international beauty product wholesale and retail suppliers and manufacturers selling professional beauty products directly to salons and individual salon professionals. Although we believe BSG positions itself to be competitive on price, its primary focus is to provide a comprehensive selection of branded products to the salon professional. We also face competition from authorized and unauthorized retailers and internet sites offering professional salon-only products. The increasing availability of unauthorized professional salon products in large-format retail stores such as drug stores, grocery stores and others could also have a negative impact on our business. We primarily compete with these competitors on price, selection, convenience and customer service. Our continued success is dependent on our ability to successfully compete with our competitors and the success of our strategic initiatives to enhance the customer experience, drive brand awareness and improve customer loyalty. Please see "Risk Factors &#151;The beauty products distribution industry is highly competitive and is consolidating. " 

Economic conditions. We appeal to a wide demographic consumer profile and offer an extensive selection of professional beauty products sold directly to retail consumers, and salons and salon professionals. Historically, these factors have provided us with reduced exposure to downturns in economic conditions in the countries in which we operate. However, a downturn in the economy, especially for an extended period of time, could adversely impact consumer demand of discretionary items such as beauty products and salon services, particularly affecting our styling tools product category and our full-service sales business. In addition, higher freight costs including those resulting from increases in the cost of fuel, especially for an extended period of time, may impact our expenses at levels that we cannot pass through to our customers. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Please see "Risk Factors &#151;The health of the economy in the geographies we serve may affect consumer purchases of discretionary items such as beauty products and salon services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. " 

Controlling expenses. An important aspect of our business is our ability to control costs by right-sizing and maximizing the efficiency of our business, particularly in an environment of increasing labor and real estate costs. We currently expect significant labor and rental cost increases to continue for the foreseeable future as we compete for talent and attractive retail locations with other retailers. Please see "Risk Factors &#151;We are not certain that our ongoing cost control plans will continue to be successful. " 

Opening new stores. The success of our growth strategy in the future depends in part on our ability to open and profitably operate new stores in existing and additional geographic areas and, more specifically, in international geographies as international growth becomes an increasing driver of our future growth and the U.S. marketplace becomes more saturated. While the capital requirements to open a Sally Beauty Supply or BSG store, excluding inventory, vary from geography to geography, such capital requirements have historically been relatively low in the U.S. and Canada. We may not be able to open all of the new stores we plan to open and any new stores we open may not be profitable, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Please see "Risk Factors &#151;If we are unable to profitably open and operate new stores, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. " 

Changes to our information technology systems. As our operations have grown in both size and scope and as cyber-attacks and security intrusions involving retailers have become more frequent, we have improved and upgraded our information systems and infrastructure while maintaining the reliability and integrity of those systems and infrastructure. These improvements have included putting in place a standardized 

enterprise resource planning ("ERP") system for both our domestic and international operations, upgrading our e-commerce platforms and our customer relationship management (CRM) technology and the adoption of payment terminals with encryption technology in order to enhance the security of our credit card payment systems. As we continue to grow and the prevalence and sophistication of cyber-attacks continues to increase, we will continuously need to improve and upgrade our information technology systems and, as a result, we anticipate incurring additional costs in the future in connection with these continuous upgrades and improvements. Please see "Risk Factors &#151;We may be adversely affected by any disruption in our information technology systems " and " Unauthorized access to confidential information and data on our information technology systems and security and data breaches could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. " 

Business Segments, Geographic Area Information and Seasonality 

We operate in two business segments: (i) Sally Beauty Supply, an open-line and exclusive-label retailer of professional beauty supplies offering professional beauty supplies to both retail consumers and salon professionals primarily in North America, South America and Europe, and (ii) BSG, including its franchise-based business Armstrong McCall, a full-service beauty supply distributor offering professional brands directly to salons and salon professionals through our own sales force and professional-only stores, many in exclusive geographical territories, primarily in North America, the United Kingdom and certain other European countries. For each of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, Sally Beauty Supply accounted for approximately 60% and BSG accounted for approximately 40% of the Company's consolidated net sales. 

Financial information about business segments and geographic area information is incorporated herein by reference to the "Business Segments and Geographic Area Information," Note 18 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" in "Item 8&#151;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" contained elsewhere in this Annual Report. 

Neither the sales nor the product assortment for Sally Beauty Supply or BSG are generally seasonal in nature. 

Sally Beauty Supply 

As of September 30, 2016, Sally Beauty Supply operated 3,763 company-operated retail stores (generally under the Sally Beauty banner), 2,917 of which are located in the U.S., with the remaining 846 company-operated retail stores located in Canada, Mexico, Chile, Colombia, Peru, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain. Sally Beauty Supply also supplied 18 franchised stores located in the United Kingdom, Belgium and certain other European countries. Our Sally Beauty stores carry an extensive selection of professional beauty supplies for both retail customers and salon professionals, featuring an average of 8,000 stock keeping units, or SKUs, of beauty products across product categories including hair color, hair care, skin and nail care, beauty sundries and styling tools. Our Sally Beauty stores carry leading third-party brands such as Clairol&#174;, CHI&#174;, China Glaze&#174;, OPI&#174; and Conair&#174;, as well as an extensive selection of exclusive-label merchandise. We believe that Sally Beauty Supply has differentiated itself from its competitors through its customer value proposition based on delivering an extensive selection of leading third-party branded and exclusive-label professional beauty products at attractive prices through knowledgeable sales associates and convenient store locations. 

&#160; Store Design and Operations 

Our Sally Beauty stores are designed to create an appealing shopping environment that embraces the retail consumer and salon professional and highlights its extensive product offering. In the U.S. and Canada, our Sally Beauty stores average approximately 1,700 square feet in size, are located primarily in strip shopping centers and generally follow a consistent format, allowing customers familiarity between Sally Beauty 

locations. Store formats, including average size and product selection, for our Sally Beauty stores outside the U.S. and Canada vary by marketplace. 

Our Sally Beauty stores are organized by product type in ways that allow its customers to easily navigate through its stores and that encourage cross-selling and impulse buying through the use of strategic product placement and displays that highlight new products and key promotional items. 

During the past two years, we implemented store refresh initiatives designed to enhance the consumer experience at our Sally Beauty stores, primarily in the U.S, by upgrading the look, feel and "shopability" of our stores. As part of these initiatives we have added a "nail studio" display and a hair color education center, and have recently reset key merchandising sections across our Sally Beauty stores in the U.S., including the hair care and the brushes and combs categories, in order to improve the visibility of these products. In addition, we have recently installed new floors, LED lighting and updated signage at a number of our U.S. Sally Beauty stores. Our store refresh initiatives are intended to provide our customers with a brighter and more engaging store that is easier to navigate than before the refreshes. At September 30, 2016, we have refreshed approximately 1,450 of our stores and expect to continue our initiatives to update the look and feel of our U.S. stores. At September 30, 2016, we have 2,917 company-operated Sally Beauty stores in the U.S., including approximately 300 newer company-operated stores that will not undergo refreshing in the near future. The average capital requirement to complete our store refreshes is approximately $20,000 to $25,000 per store. 

Merchandise 

Our Sally Beauty stores carry an extensive selection of third-party branded and exclusive-label professional beauty supplies. Sally Beauty Supply manages each category by product and by SKU and uses centrally developed plan-o-guides to maintain a consistent merchandise presentation across its store base (primarily in the U.S. and Canada). Through its information systems, Sally Beauty Supply actively monitors each store's performance by category. We believe Sally Beauty Supply's tailored merchandise strategy enables it to meet local demands and helps drive customer traffic into its stores. Additionally, Sally Beauty Supply's information systems (implemented in its North American and in substantially all its European locations) enable it to track and automatically replenish inventory levels, generally on a weekly basis, allowing it to maintain high levels of in-stock, in-demand merchandise, including both regular-priced and promotional items. Please see Liquidity and Capital Resources in "Item 7&#151;Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" contained elsewhere in this Annual Report. 

Sally Beauty Supply's pricing strategy is differentiated by customer segment. Professional salon customers are generally entitled to a price lower than that received by retail customers. However, Sally Beauty Supply does offer discounts to retail customers through its customer loyalty program (please see " Marketing and Advertising" below). 

The following table sets forth the approximate percentage of Sally Beauty Supply's sales by major product category: 

&#160; &#160; Fiscal Year Ended September 30, &#160; &#160; &#160; 2016 &#160; 2015 &#160; 2014 &#160; Hair color &#160; &#160; 25.3 % &#160; 24.7 % &#160; 23.4 % Hair care &#160; &#160; 21.5 % &#160; 22.1 % &#160; 22.2 % Skin and nail care &#160; &#160; 15.5 % &#160; 15.8 % &#160; 16.5 % Styling tools &#160; &#160; 15.1 % &#160; 14.7 % &#160; 15.5 % Salon supplies and accessories &#160; &#160; 7.1 % &#160; 8.0 % &#160; 8.0 % Multicultural products &#160; &#160; 7.6 % &#160; 7.0 % &#160; 7.1 % Other beauty items &#160; &#160; 7.9 % &#160; 7.7 % &#160; 7.3 % &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Total &#160; &#160; 100.0 % &#160; 100.0 % &#160; 100.0 % &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; 

Note: Certain amounts for the prior fiscal years presented in the table above have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year's presentation. In addition, certain product categories have been updated to reflect current business practices. 

Leading Third-Party Branded Products 

Sally Beauty Supply offers an extensive selection of hair care products, nail care products, beauty sundries and appliances, featuring leading third-party brands such as Clairol&#174;, CHI&#174;, China Glaze&#174;, OPI&#174; and Conair&#174;. In addition, Sally Beauty Supply offers an extensive selection of exclusive-label merchandise. We believe that carrying an extensive selection of the latest premier branded merchandise is critical to maintaining long-term relationships with our customers. The merchandise Sally Beauty Supply carries includes products from one or more of the leading manufacturers in each category. Sally Beauty Supply's objective is not only to carry leading brands, but also to carry a full range of third-party branded and exclusive-label products within each category. As beauty trends continue to evolve, we expect to offer the changing professional beauty product assortment necessary to meet the needs of retail consumers and salon professionals. 

Exclusive-Label Products 

Sally Beauty Supply offers an extensive selection of exclusive-label professional beauty products. We believe that our exclusive-label products are of equal quality as higher-priced leading third-party brands and provide customers with an attractive alternative to these higher-priced products, further strengthening our value proposition. Exclusive-label products accounted for approximately 46% of Sally Beauty Supply's product sales in the U.S. during the fiscal year 2016. Generally, our exclusive-label products have higher gross margins for us than the leading third-party branded products, and we believe this area offers continued growth potential. Sally Beauty Supply maintains exclusive-label products in substantially all its product categories. Sally Beauty Supply intends to continue to invest in the growth of its exclusive-label brands and to actively promote these products in an effort to strengthen this category of products, while also making these brands more distinctive and well-known. For example, in the fiscal year 2016, we have completed the repackaging of a substantial portion of our exclusive-label products in an effort to further enhance the appeal of these products to our customers. 

Marketing and Advertising 

Sally Beauty Supply's marketing programs are designed to drive customer traffic on the short-term and, on the long-term, brand preference by differentiating the Company as a source of professional advice, solutions and salon-quality products at competitive prices, all backed by our "Love It or Return It" 

guarantee. Our marketing programs differentiate between our two distinct customer groups: retail customers and salon professionals. 

We continuously adapt our marketing initiatives and adjust our media mix and messaging with the goal of achieving the highest possible return on our marketing and advertising dollars. We target existing and potential customers through an integrated marketing approach designed to touch the customer through every medium he or she engages in, including direct mail, email, social media, text, digital advertising, print advertising (including full page ads in fashion magazines) and television (primarily in the U.S.), through our Project Runway partnership. 

During the past year, we transformed our sallybeauty.com website from a largely transactional-based website to a content rich experience that offers customers the ability to research styles, trends and products, which we believe has significantly increased the number of visitors to our site and improved our online sales. We currently offer an average of 9,500 SKUs of our Sally Beauty Supply products for sale through our website ( www.sallybeauty.com ) and believe that our website enhances our other efforts intended to promote consumer awareness of Sally Beauty Supply's products, including through the use of educational videos and the presentation of relevant beauty tips and extensive product information. We frequently update the design of our website in an effort to enhance its appeal to our existing and prospective customers. In addition to generating e-commerce sales, we believe our website is an important vehicle to reach consumers researching beauty products online who could potentially visit our stores as a result of their experience with our website. Please see "Risk Factors&#151; Our e-commerce businesses may be unsuccessful or, if successful, may divert sales from our stores ." 

Sally Beauty Supply's customer loyalty and CRM programs, primarily in the U.S. and Canada, allow Sally Beauty Supply the opportunity to collect valuable point-of-sale customer data in order to increase its understanding of customers' needs and enhance our ability to market to them in more personalized and relevant ways. The Sally "Beauty Club" is a loyalty program for customers who are not salon professionals. Beauty Club members, generally after paying a nominal annual fee, are eligible to receive a discounted price on almost every non-sale item. Members can also earn rewards and are eligible to receive direct mail, text messages and e-mail communications that contain special offers, beauty tips and new product information. We have recently improved the sophistication of our CRM capabilities to better respond to our customers' behavior in an effort to drive the customer experience and increase sales. 

In addition, Sally Beauty Supply's "ProCard" is a loyalty program for licensed salon professionals. ProCard members are eligible to receive discounts on all beauty products sold at Sally Beauty Supply's stores and website, as well as special offerings available only to salon professionals. Outside the U.S. and Canada, our customer loyalty and marketing programs vary by marketplace. 

&#160; Store Locations 

Sally Beauty Supply selects geographic areas and store sites on the basis of demographic information, the quality and nature of neighboring tenants, store visibility and location accessibility. Sally Beauty Supply seeks to locate stores primarily in strip malls, which are occupied by other high traffic retailers including grocery stores, mass merchants and home centers. 

Sally Beauty Supply balances its store expansion between new and existing marketplaces, with future store growth expected primarily in non-U.S. geographies. In its existing marketplaces, Sally Beauty Supply adds stores as necessary to provide additional coverage. In new marketplaces, Sally Beauty Supply generally seeks to expand in geographically contiguous areas to leverage its experience. We believe that Sally Beauty Supply's knowledge of local marketplaces is an important part of its success. 

The following table provides a history of Sally Beauty Supply's store count (including franchised stores) during the last three fiscal years: 

&#160; &#160; Fiscal Year Ended September 30, &#160; &#160; &#160; 2016 &#160; 2015 &#160; 2014 &#160; Stores open at beginning of period &#160; &#160; 3,673 &#160; &#160; 3,563 &#160; &#160; 3,424 &#160; Net store openings during period(a) &#160; &#160; 108 &#160; &#160; 110 &#160; &#160; 135 &#160; Stores acquired during period &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; 4 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Stores open at end of period &#160; &#160; 3,781 &#160; &#160; 3,673 &#160; &#160; 3,563 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; 

(a) For the fiscal year 2015, net store openings reflect the closure of 15 underperforming stores in Germany. 

Beauty Systems Group 

As of September 30, 2016, BSG operated 1,174 company-operated retail stores (generally under the CosmoProf banner) with 1,074 located in the U.S. and the remaining 100 company-operated retail stores located in Canada. In addition, as of September 30, 2016, BSG supplied 164 franchised stores and had a sales force of approximately 936 professional distributor sales consultants in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and certain European countries. We believe BSG is the largest full-service distributor of professional beauty supplies in North America, exclusively targeting salons and salon professionals. Through BSG's large store base and sales force, including its franchise-based business Armstrong McCall, BSG is able to access a significant portion of the highly fragmented U.S. professional beauty salon services industry. BSG and Armstrong McCall stores provide a comprehensive selection of professional beauty products, featuring an average of 9,500 SKUs of merchandise, that include hair color, hair care, skin and nail care, beauty sundries and styling tools. BSG is also the exclusive source for certain well-known third-party branded products pursuant to BSG's exclusive distribution agreements with certain suppliers within specified geographic territories. 

Store Design and Operations 

BSG stores, including its franchise-based Armstrong McCall stores, are designed to create a professional shopping environment that embraces the salon professional and highlights its extensive product offering. Company-operated BSG stores, average approximately 2,600 square feet and are primarily located in secondary strip shopping centers. BSG store layouts are designed to provide optimal variety and options to the salon professional. Stores are segmented into distinctive areas arranged by product type with certain areas dedicated to leading third-party brands; such as Paul Mitchell&#174;, Wella&#174;, Sebastian&#174;, Goldwell&#174;, Joico&#174; and Aquage&#174;. The selection of these and other brands varies by territory. 

Professional Distributor Sales Consultants 

As of September 30, 2016, BSG had a network of approximately 936 professional distributor sales consultants ("DSC" or "DSCs"), which exclusively served salons and salon professionals. 

In order to provide a knowledgeable sales consultant team, BSG actively recruits individuals with industry knowledge or sales experience, as we believe that sales consultants with broad product knowledge and direct sales experience will be more successful in driving sales. In addition, BSG provides training to new sales consultants beginning with a two-week training program, followed by a program of continuing media-based training delivered through audio, video and web-based e-learning. The program is designed to develop product knowledge as well as techniques on how best to serve salon professionals. In addition to selling professional beauty products, our sales consultants offer in-salon training for professionals and 

salon owners in areas such as new styles, techniques and business practices. An important component of sales consultants' compensation is sales commissions. BSG's commission system is designed to drive sales, as well as focus consultants on selling products that are best suited to individual salons and salon professionals. 

We believe that our emphasis on recruitment, training, and sales-based compensation results in a sales force that distinguishes itself from other full-service/exclusive-channel distributors and the employment of sales consultants is an effective way to serve salons and salon professionals. 

The following table sets forth the approximate percentage of BSG sales attributable to each major distribution channel: 

&#160; &#160; Fiscal Year Ended September 30, &#160; &#160; &#160; 2016 &#160; 2015 &#160; 2014 &#160; Company-operated stores &#160; &#160; 67.1 % &#160; 66.4 % &#160; 65.6 % Professional distributor sales consultants (full-service) &#160; &#160; 24.9 % &#160; 25.1 % &#160; 25.6 % Franchise stores &#160; &#160; 8.0 % &#160; 8.5 % &#160; 8.8 % &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Total &#160; &#160; 100.0 % &#160; 100.0 % &#160; 100.0 % &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; 

Merchandise 

BSG stores carry an extensive selection of third-party branded products, featuring an average of 9,500 SKUs of beauty products, including hair color and care, skin and nail care, styling tools and other beauty items. Some products are available in bulk packaging for higher volume salon needs. Through BSG's information systems, each store's product sales performance is actively monitored, allowing maintenance of an optimal merchandise mix. Additionally, BSG's information systems track and automatically replenish inventory levels on a weekly basis, enabling BSG to maintain sufficient levels of product in stock. BSG's primary focus is to provide a comprehensive selection of branded products to the salon professional at competitive prices. BSG is also the exclusive source for certain well-known third-party branded products pursuant to BSG's exclusive arrangements with certain suppliers within specified geographic territories. Increasing our distribution of well-known brands is an important aspect of our growth strategy for BSG, and BSG has recently acquired distribution rights for important brands in new geographies and extended contracts with several key existing vendors. We believe that carrying an extensive selection of branded merchandise is critical to maintaining relationships with our professional customers. Please see Liquidity and Capital Resources in "Item 7&#151;Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" contained elsewhere in this Annual Report. 

The following table sets forth the approximate percentage of BSG's sales attributable by major product category: 

&#160; &#160; Fiscal Year Ended September 30, &#160; &#160; &#160; 2016 &#160; 2015 &#160; 2014 &#160; Hair color &#160; &#160; 35.4 % &#160; 32.7 % &#160; 30.8 % Hair care &#160; &#160; 34.3 % &#160; 34.5 % &#160; 35.0 % Skin and nail care &#160; &#160; 8.9 % &#160; 9.5 % &#160; 9.9 % Styling tools &#160; &#160; 4.5 % &#160; 5.0 % &#160; 5.5 % Promotional items(a) &#160; &#160; 10.1 % &#160; 10.7 % &#160; 11.8 % Other beauty items &#160; &#160; 6.8 % &#160; 7.6 % &#160; 7.0 % &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Total &#160; &#160; 100.0 % &#160; 100.0 % &#160; 100.0 % &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; 

(a) Promotional items consist of sales from other categories that are sold on a value-priced basis. 

Marketing and Advertising 

BSG's marketing program is designed primarily to promote its extensive selection of brand name products at competitive prices and to educate, motivate and empower its customers to grow professionally. BSG communicates on a frequent basis with its customers and potential customers, and distributes promotional material through multiple communication channels, including trade shows, educational events, store personnel, professional distributor sales consultants, print mail, e-mail, text and social media. In addition, we offer an average of 15,000 SKUs (primarily in the U.S. and excluding Loxa Beauty) of professional beauty products for sale through our websites ( www.cosmoprofequipment.com and www.cosmoprofbeauty.com ). We believe that our websites enhance our other efforts intended to promote awareness of BSG's products by salons, salon professionals and retail customers, as appropriate. Please see "Risk Factors&#151; Our e-commerce businesses may be unsuccessful or, if successful, may divert sales from our stores ." Some BSG stores also host monthly manufacturer-sponsored classes for salon professionals. These classes are held at BSG stores and led by manufacturer-employed educators. Salon professionals, after paying a small fee to attend, can learn about new products and beauty trends. We believe these classes also increase brand awareness and potentially drive sales in BSG stores. Furthermore, our recent improvements to our CRM capabilities have enabled us to more effectively communicate with our BSG customers. 

Loxa Beauty 

BSG's www.loxabeauty.com is a website designed to connect salon professionals with their customers and offers approximately 5,000 SKUs of manufacturer-authorized professional beauty products (including leading third-party brands such as Paul Mitchell&#174;, Rusk&#174;, Sebastian&#174;, CHI&#174;, and Joico&#174;). Loxa Beauty enables consumers to receive expert advice online from salon professionals of their choice while crediting the chosen salon professional with any resulting product sale. The salon professionals are able to assist their client in the selection of the best salon products for their clients' particular needs while earning sales commissions when their clients order products using the Loxa Beauty website. We believe that this sales channel has good growth potential for BSG over the next several years. Please see "Risk Factors&#151; Our e-commerce businesses may be unsuccessful or, if successful, may divert sales from our stores ." 

&#160; Store Locations 

BSG stores are primarily located in secondary strip shopping centers resulting in relatively lower operational costs per square foot than our retail stores. Although BSG stores are located in visible and convenient locations, we believe salon professionals are generally less sensitive about store location than our retail customers. 

The following table provides a history of BSG's store count (including franchised stores) during the last three fiscal years: 

&#160; &#160; Fiscal Year Ended September 30, &#160; &#160; &#160; 2016 &#160; 2015 &#160; 2014 &#160; Stores open at beginning of period &#160; &#160; 1,294 &#160; &#160; 1,265 &#160; &#160; 1,245 &#160; Net store openings during period &#160; &#160; 29 &#160; &#160; 29 &#160; &#160; 17 &#160; Stores acquired during period &#160; &#160; 15 &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; 3 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Stores open at end of period &#160; &#160; 1,338 &#160; &#160; 1,294 &#160; &#160; 1,265 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; 

(1) Stores acquired in the fiscal year 2016 represents 15 stores owned by Peerless Beauty and Barber Supply Company ("Peerless Beauty") prior to the Company's acquisition of certain assets from Peerless Beauty in September 2016. 

Competitive Strengths 

We believe the following competitive strengths differentiate us from our competitors and will help drive our future growth: 

The Largest Professional Beauty Supply Distributor in the U.S. with Multi-Channel Platform 

We believe that Sally Beauty Supply and BSG together comprise the largest distributor of professional beauty products in the U.S. by store count. Our leading channel positions and multi-channel platform afford us several advantages, including strong positioning with suppliers, the ability to better service the highly fragmented beauty supply marketplace, economies of scale and the ability to capitalize on the ongoing consolidation in our sector. Through our multi-channel platform, we are able to generate and grow revenues across broad, diversified geographies, and customer segments using varying product assortments. In the U.S., we offer from 8,000 SKUs (at a typical Sally Beauty store) to 15,000 SKUs (at a BSG website, excluding Loxa Beauty) of professional beauty products through Sally Beauty Supply and BSG, respectively, to a broad potential customer base that includes retail consumers, salons and barbershops in the U.S. 

Differentiated Customer Value Proposition 

We believe that we offer our customers a strong value proposition based on providing salon-quality products and solutions at attractive prices that is unique from our competitors. Our stores are conveniently located and offer a wide selection of professional beauty products (including leading third-party branded and exclusive-label merchandise), high levels of in-stock merchandise, beauty solutions and know-how delivered by our knowledgeable salespeople and competitive pricing. We also offer a comprehensive selection of ethnic products, which is tailored by store, based on market demographics and category performance. We believe that the wide selection of these products at our stores further differentiates Sally Beauty Supply from its competitors. In addition, as discussed above, Sally Beauty Supply also offers a customer loyalty program, the Beauty Club, whereby generally for a nominal annual fee members receive discounts on products, earn rewards and are eligible to receive direct mail and email communications that contain special offers, beauty tips, and new product information. Our BSG professional distributor sales consultants benefit from their customers having access to the BSG store systems as customers have the ability to pick up the products they need between visits from our professional distributor sales consultants. We believe that our differentiated customer value proposition and strong brands drive customer loyalty and high repeat traffic, contributing to our success and growth. 

Attractive Store Economics 

We believe that our stores generate attractive returns on invested capital. In the U.S. and Canada, the capital requirements to open a Sally Beauty Supply or BSG store, excluding inventory, average approximately $75,000 to $80,000. Our Sally Beauty stores average approximately 1,700 square feet and BSG stores average approximately 2,600 square feet in size in the U.S. and Canada. Strong average sales per square foot combined with minimal staffing requirements, lower rent and other occupancy costs and expenses and limited initial capital outlay typically result in positive contribution margins within a few months to a year of opening, and cash payback on investment within approximately two to three years. Due to such attractive investment returns and relatively high operating profit contributions per store, during the past five fiscal years Sally Beauty Supply and BSG have opened an aggregate of 595 and 157 net new stores, respectively, excluding the effect of acquisitions. In addition, each Sally Beauty Supply and BSG store (in the U.S. and Canada) contains an average of $70,000 and $135,000, respectively, of merchandise inventory. Outside the U.S. and Canada, our store format, sizes, inventory levels and capital requirements vary by marketplace, but we believe these stores also generate compelling unit economics. In addition, over the past two years, we have refreshed approximately 1,450 Sally Beauty stores in the U.S. at an average cost of approximately $20,000 to $25,000 per store, and believe these stores are well-positioned to benefit from these recent improvements. 

Our Strategy 

We believe there are significant opportunities to increase our sales and profitability through the further implementation of our operating strategy and by growing our store base in existing and additional geographic areas, both organically and through strategic acquisitions. Key elements of our growth strategy are to: 

Increase Overall Traffic and Sales Productivity at Our Existing Stores 

Over the past year, we have implemented a number of initiatives designed to significantly improve the customer experience at Sally Beauty Supply and BSG in an effort to attract new customers to our stores and improve sales productivity at our existing stores. For example, as part of these initiatives we upgraded key merchandising sections across our U.S. Sally Beauty stores, including by installing an interactive "nail studios" display and a color education center. We have recently reset key merchandising sections across our Sally Beauty stores in the U.S., including the brushes, cutlery and accessories category, in order to improve the visibility of these products. In addition, we have installed new hardwood floors, LED lighting and updated signage at approximately 1,450 of our U.S. Sally Beauty stores. In addition to these physical store improvements, we also focused our marketing efforts on a consistent marketing campaign designed to touch our customer through every medium they engage in and by, among other things, leveraging our CRM programs to more effectively communicate with our customers, including by tailoring our marketing efforts to reach a wider selection of prospective customers and otherwise promoting recognition of the "Sally" brand among consumers. We believe that these initiatives will help drive increased customer traffic to our stores and increase their sales productivity. 

In addition to these strategic initiatives, we also plan to grow same store sales by improving our merchandise mix, introducing new products (including third-party brands and exclusive-label products), growing our sales of exclusive-label products and enhancing our customer loyalty programs. To grow sales and increase customer loyalty in Sally Beauty Supply, we intend to continue to develop and introduce exclusive-label products through product innovation, to continue to introduce new third-party products and to promote our wide selection of product offerings at a value. We believe the enhancements to our customer loyalty programs at Sally Beauty Supply and BSG, will allow us to further collect valuable point-of-sale customer data and to increase our understanding of customers' needs, in an effort to grow sales to existing customers. 

Expand Our Store Base 

During the past five fiscal years, Sally Beauty Supply and BSG have opened an aggregate of 595 and 157 net new stores, respectively, excluding the effect of acquisitions. Because of the limited initial capital outlay, rapid payback and attractive return on capital, we intend to continue to expand our store base. We believe there are growth opportunities for us to open or acquire additional stores in North America, Europe, and Central and South America. We believe such opportunities are especially strong in Europe, and Central and South America. We expect new store openings in existing and new areas to be an important aspect of our future growth opportunities, and intend to continue our annual organic store growth at approximately 2.0% to 3.0% of our total stores for at least the next few years including, in our Sally Beauty Supply segment, growth in store count of approximately 2.0% in the U.S. and higher growth outside the U.S. Despite the relatively low opening costs, we may not be able to open all of the new stores we plan to open and any new stores we open may not be profitable, either of which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations. There are several factors that could affect our ability to open and profitably operate new stores, including proximity to existing stores that may reduce the new store's sales or the sales of existing stores. 

Grow Internationally 

International sales represent approximately 24% of Sally Beauty Supply's net sales and we believe there is a significant opportunity for future growth internationally. As of September 30, 2016, we had 946 Sally Beauty Supply and BSG company-operated stores and supplied 41 franchise stores across 12 countries outside the United States: Canada, Mexico, Chile, Colombia, Peru, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain. We believe our platform provides us with the foundation to continue to expand internationally. In particular, we are currently focused on profitably growing our business in Europe and in Central and South America. We are also focused on improving our business in each of our non-U.S. geographies, and have made a series of recent leadership changes in these countries to improve our operating discipline and growth strategy. 

Increase Operating Efficiency and Profitability 

We believe there are opportunities to increase the profitability of our operations by growing our exclusive-label brands, improving sourcing, shifting customer mix, continuing our cost-cutting initiatives and by further expanding our e-commerce channel. We continue to develop and promote our higher margin exclusive-label products and increase exclusive-label product sales, which we believe will enhance our overall gross margins and operating results. In addition, we have undertaken a full review of our merchandise procurement strategy and continue to focus on our procurement practices. This initiative has helped identify lower-cost alternative sources of supply in certain product categories from countries with lower manufacturing costs. We continue to focus on changing our customer mix by increasing the number of retail customers, as a percentage of total customers, within our stores at Sally Beauty Supply. Sales to retail customers generally result in higher gross margin for us. 

We are also focused on growing our online sales. We currently offer approximately 9,500 SKUs of our Sally Beauty Supply products for sale through our website ( www.sallybeauty.com ) and offer approximately 15,000 SKUs of our BSG products for sale principally through BSG's websites for beauty professionals ( www.cosmoprofbeauty.com and www.cosmoprofequipment.com ), in addition to approximately 5,000 SKUs of BSG product through our website for retail customers ( www.loxabeauty.com ). We have upgraded our e-commerce platforms over the past year to transform these platforms from largely transactional-based sites to more content-rich sites to drive traffic to these sites and improve sales from these sites. We believe that electronic commerce, or e-commerce, will help drive improved operating earnings over the long term, as a percentage of net sales, for both business segments since e-commerce generally lacks the incremental operating expenses (including rent and other occupancy expenses, payroll, and certain shipping and 

handling expenses) associated with traditional brick-and-mortar stores. Please see "Risk Factors &#151;Our e-commerce businesses may be unsuccessful or, if successful, may divert sales from our stores. " 

Pursue Strategic Acquisitions and New Territories for Organic Growth 

We have completed more than 40 acquisitions during our last 10 full fiscal years. We believe that our experience in identifying attractive acquisition targets, our proven acquisition integration process and our highly scalable infrastructure have created a strong platform for potential future acquisitions. Recent acquisitions have included: 

&#149; In the fiscal year 2016, we acquired certain assets and business operations of Peerless Beauty and Barber Supply Company, distributors of professional beauty products with 15 stores located in Utah and Idaho; &#149; In the fiscal year 2015, we acquired certain assets and the business of a former exclusive distributor of John Paul Mitchell Systems beauty products with sales primarily in Iowa; &#149; In the fiscal year 2014, we acquired certain assets and business operations of Arctic Beauty, Inc., a professional-only distributor of beauty products operating in the state of Alaska; &#149; In the fiscal year 2013, we acquired certain assets and business operations of Essential Salon, a professional-only distributor of beauty products operating in the northeastern region of the United States; and &#149; In the fiscal year 2012, we acquired the Floral Group, a distributor of professional beauty products then with 19 stores located in the Netherlands and certain assets and the business of a former exclusive distributor of John Paul Mitchell Systems beauty products with sales primarily in Ohio and West Virginia. We intend to continue to identify and evaluate acquisition targets and organic growth opportunities both domestically and internationally, with a focus on expanding our exclusive BSG territories and allowing Sally Beauty Supply to enter new geographic areas, principally outside the U.S. Please see "Risk Factors&#151; We may not be able to successfully identify acquisition candidates or successfully complete desirable acquisitions ." 

Competition 

Although there are a limited number of direct competitors to our business, the beauty industry is highly competitive. In each geographic area in which we operate, we experience competition from domestic and international businesses often with more resources, including mass merchandisers, on-line retailers, drug stores, supermarkets and other chains offering similar or substitute beauty products at comparable prices. Our business also faces competition from department stores, as well as from authorized and unauthorized retailers and internet sites offering professional beauty products. In addition, our business competes with local and regional open-line beauty supply stores and full-service distributors selling directly to salons and salon professionals through both professional distributor sales consultants and outlets open only to salons and salon professionals. Our business also faces increasing competition from certain manufacturers that use their own sales forces to distribute their professional beauty products directly or that align themselves with our competitors. Some of these manufacturers are vertically integrating through the acquisition of distributors and stores. In addition, these manufacturers may acquire additional brands that we currently distribute and attempt to shift these products to their own distribution channels. Please see "Risk Factors&#151; The beauty products distribution industry is highly competitive and is consolidating " for additional information about our competition. 

Customer Service 

We strive to complement our extensive merchandise selection and innovative store design with superior customer service. We actively recruit individuals with cosmetology experience that are not only knowledgeable about the products we sell, but are able to deliver practical beauty advice and solutions to our customers, which we believe strengthens customer loyalty. Additionally, Sally Beauty Supply recruits individuals with retail experience because we believe their general retail knowledge can be leveraged in the beauty supply industry. We believe that employees' knowledge of the products and ability to demonstrate and explain the advantages of the products increases sales and that their prompt, knowledgeable service fosters the confidence and loyalty of customers and differentiates our business from other professional beauty supply distributors. 

Most of our stores are staffed with a store manager, and two or three full-time or part-time sales associates. BSG stores are generally also staffed with an assistant manager. The operations of each store are supervised by a district manager, who reports to a territory manager. A significant number of our store managers and assistant store managers are licensed in the cosmetology field. Additionally, in certain geographic areas in the U.S., a significant number of our store personnel, including store managers and assistant store managers, speak Spanish as a second language. We believe that these skills enhance our store personnel's ability to serve our customers. 

Relationships with Suppliers 

We purchase our merchandise directly from manufacturers through supply contracts and by purchase orders. For the fiscal year 2016, our five largest suppliers, Coty, Inc. (including certain business units formerly owned by The Procter &#38; Gamble Company, or P&#38;G), the Professional Products Division of L'Oreal USA S/D, Inc., or L'Oreal, John Paul Mitchell Systems, Conair Corporation and Shiseido Cosmetics (America) Limited, accounted for approximately 38% of our consolidated merchandise purchases. Products are purchased from these and many other manufacturers on an at-will basis or under contracts which can be terminated without cause upon 90 days' notice or less or expire without express rights of renewal. Such manufacturers could discontinue sales to us at any time or upon short notice. If any of these suppliers discontinued selling or were unable to continue selling to us, there could be a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 

As is typical in the distribution businesses, relationships with suppliers are subject to change from time to time (including the expansion or loss of distribution rights in various geographies and the addition or loss of product lines). For example, in 2016, Coty Inc., a leading supplier of fragrances, color cosmetics, and skin and body products, acquired the fragrances, color cosmetics, and hair color divisions of P&#38;G and Coty, Inc. was our largest supplier. In each of the fiscal years 2014 and 2015, P&#38;G was our largest supplier. There can be no assurances as to the impact, if any, that this acquisition will have on our ability to continue to source products from these divisions at current prices and volumes. Changes in our relationships with suppliers occur often, and could positively or negatively impact our net sales and operating earnings. Please see "Risk Factors&#151; We depend upon manufacturers who may be unable to provide products of adequate quality or who may be unwilling to continue to supply products to us ." However, we believe that we can be successful in mitigating negative effects resulting from unfavorable changes in the relationships between us and our suppliers through, among other things, the development of new or expanded supplier relationships. 

Distribution 

As of September 30, 2016, we operated mainly through 17 distribution centers, eight of which predominantly serviced Sally Beauty Supply and nine of which predominantly serviced BSG. 

Our purchasing and distribution system is designed to minimize the delivered cost of merchandise and maximize the level of merchandise in-stock in stores. This distribution system also allows for monitoring of 

delivery times and maintenance of appropriate inventory levels. Product deliveries are typically made to our stores on a weekly basis, primarily in the U.S. and Canada. Each distribution center has a quality control department that monitors products received from suppliers. We utilize proprietary software systems to provide computerized warehouse locator and inventory support. 

Information Technology Systems 

Our information technology systems are essential to our efforts to process customer sales transactions, manage inventory levels, conduct business with our suppliers and other business partners, and record, summarize and analyze the results of our operations. These systems contain, among other things, material operational, financial and administrative information related to the marketing, distribution and store operations functions of our business. The information contained in our information technology systems, among other things, supports processing of customer payments and automatic replenishment of in-store inventory, and provides support for product purchase decisions. A significant portion of these systems have been developed internally, and as a result our options are limited in seeking third-party assistance with the operation and upgrade of these systems. The expansion of our systems and infrastructure will require us to commit substantial financial, operational and technical resources in advance of any increase in the volume of our business, with no assurance that the volume of business will increase. For example, we are in the process of implementing a standardized enterprise resource planning ("ERP") system for both our domestic and international operations over the next few years, which will integrate legacy systems and provide enhanced functionality. In addition, we recently implemented a point-of-sale system upgrade in our Sally Beauty Supply operations in the U.S. and have begun to implement a point-of-sale system upgrade in our BSG operations in the U.S. which we believe will provide significant benefits, including enhanced tracking of customer sales and store inventory activity. Further, following the previously disclosed data security incidents, we have taken and are continuing to take actions to further strengthen the security of our information technology systems, including a recent initiative to adopt payment terminals with end-to-end encryption technology in order to enhance the security of our credit card payment systems. We have also taken steps to upgrade our e-commerce platforms and improve the sophistication of our CRM technology. These and any other required upgrades to our information systems and information technology (or new technology), now or in the future, may require significant costs and divert our management's attention and other resources from our core business to assist in completion of these projects. There can be no assurance that the time and resources our management will need to devote to these upgrades, service outages or delays due to the installation of any new or upgraded technology (and customer issues therewith), or the impact on the reliability or security of our data from any new or upgraded technology will not have a material adverse effect on our financial reporting, business, financial condition or results of operations. Please see "Risk Factors&#151; We may be adversely affected by any disruption in our information technology systems. " 

In addition, as part of our operations, we receive and maintain information about our customers, employees and other third parties. We have physical, technical and procedural safeguards in place that are designed to protect information and protect against security and data breaches as well as fraudulent transactions and other activities. Despite these safeguards and our other security processes and protections, we have been a victim of cyber-attacks and data security breaches, including breaches that resulted in the unauthorized installation of malware on our information technology systems that may have placed at risk certain payment card data for some transactions. Furthermore, there can be no assurances that we will not suffer another cyber-attack or data security breach in the future and, if we do, whether our physical, technical and procedural safeguards will adequately protect us against such attacks and breaches. Please see "Risk Factors&#151; Unauthorized access to confidential information and data on our information technology systems and security and data breaches could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results ."

(a) Part-time employees enable us to supplement store staffing schedules, particularly in North America. 

Certain subsidiaries in Mexico have collective bargaining agreements covering warehouse and store personnel which expire at various times over the next several years. We believe that we have good relationships with our employees worldwide. 

Management 

For information concerning our directors and executive officers, please see "Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance" in Item 10 of this Annual Report. 

Regulation 

We are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations, which historically have not had a material effect on our business. For example, in the U.S., most of the products sold and the content and methods of advertising and marketing utilized are subject to both federal and state regulations administered by a host of federal and state agencies, including, in each case, one or more of the following: the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, and the Consumer Products Safety Commission. The transportation and disposal of many of our products are also subject to federal and state regulation. State and local agencies regulate many aspects of our business. In marketplaces outside of the U.S., regulation is also comprehensive and focused upon product labeling and safety issues. Please see "Risk Factors&#151; We could be adversely affected if we do not comply with current laws and regulations or if we become subject to additional or more stringent laws and regulations." 

As of September 30, 2016, Sally Beauty Supply supplied 18 and BSG supplied 164 franchised stores located in the U.S., Mexico and certain countries in Europe. As a result of these franchisor-franchisee relationships, we are subject to regulation when offering and selling franchises in the applicable countries. The applicable laws and regulations affect our business practices, as franchisor, in a number of ways, including restrictions placed upon the offering, renewal, termination and disapproval of assignment of franchises. To date, these laws and regulations have not had a material effect upon our operations. 

Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property Rights 

Our trademarks, certain of which are material to our business, are registered or legally protected in the U.S., Canada and other countries in which we operate. Together with our subsidiaries, we own approximately 215 trademark registrations in the U.S., and approximately 925 trademark registrations outside the U.S. We also rely upon trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. We protect intellectual property rights through a variety of methods, including reliance upon trademark, patent and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements with many vendors, employees, consultants and others who have access to our proprietary information. The duration of our trademark 

registrations is generally 10 or 15 years, depending on the country in which a mark is registered, and generally the registrations can be renewed. The scope and duration of intellectual property protection varies by jurisdiction and by individual product. Please see "Risk Factors&#151; If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, specifically our trademarks and service marks, our ability to compete could be negatively impacted" and "We may have to defend our rights in intellectual property that we use in certain of our products, and we could be found to infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which could be disruptive and expensive to our business."
