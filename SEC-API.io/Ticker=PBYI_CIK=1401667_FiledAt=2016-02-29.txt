BUSINESS 

Company Overview 

Unless otherwise provided in this Annual Report, references to the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221; refer to Puma Biotechnology, Inc., a Delaware corporation formed on April 27, 2007 and formerly known as Innovative Acquisitions Corp., together with its wholly-owned subsidiary, Puma Biotechnology Ltd., and all references to &#8220;Former Puma&#8221; refer to Puma Biotechnology, Inc., a privately-held Delaware corporation formed on September 15, 2010, that merged with and into us in October 2011. We refer to this transaction as the &#8220;Merger.&#8221; 

We are a biopharmaceutical company with a focus on the development and commercialization of innovative products to enhance cancer care. We in-license the global development and commercialization rights to three drug candidates&#8212;PB272 (neratinib (oral)), PB272 (neratinib (intravenous)) and PB357. Neratinib is a potent irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor, or TKI, that blocks signal transduction through the epidermal growth factor receptors, HER1, HER2 and HER4. Currently, we are primarily focused on the development of the oral version of neratinib, and our most advanced drug candidates are directed at the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer. We believe neratinib has clinical application in the treatment of several other cancers as well, including non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, and other tumor types that over-express or have a mutation in HER2. 

Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide. Studies show that approximately 20% to 25% of breast cancer tumors have an over-expression of the HER2 protein. Women with breast cancer that over-expresses HER2, referred to as HER2-positive breast cancer, are at greater risk for disease progression and death than women whose tumors do not over-express HER2. Therapeutic strategies, such as the use of trastuzumab (marketed as Herceptin), pertuzumab (marketed as Perjeta) and T-DM1 (marketed as Kadcyla), each produced by Genentech, and lapatinib (marketed as Tykerb) produced by Novartis, given either alone or in combination with chemotherapy, have been developed to improve the treatment of this cancer by binding to the HER2 protein. There are also a number of trials ongoing that involve various combinations of these drugs (for example, Perjeta plus Kadcyla). Based on pre-clinical studies and clinical trials to date, we believe that neratinib may offer an advantage over existing treatments by more potently inhibiting HER2 at a different site and using a different mechanism than these other drugs. 

We recently completed a Phase III clinical trial of neratinib for the extended adjuvant treatment of women with early stage HER2-positive breast cancer, which we refer to as the ExteNET trial. Based on the results from the ExteNET trial, we expect to file for regulatory approval of neratinib in the extended adjuvant setting in the United States in the first quarter of 2016 and in the European Union in the first half of 2016. 

Separately, in February 2013, we reached agreement with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, under a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, for a planned Phase III clinical trial of PB272 in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who have failed two or more prior treatments (third-line disease). The European Medicines Agency, or EMA, has also provided follow-on scientific advice, or SA, consistent with that of the FDA regarding our ability to use the trial to support regulatory approval in the European Union. We refer to this trial as PUMA-NER-1301. We initiated this trial in June 2013. 

In addition to continuing to follow the patients from the ExteNET trial and continuing the PUMA-NER-1301 trial, we are actively conducting the following trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of neratinib in various indications:

&#160;

&#9679; 

Phase II clinical trials in the neoadjuvant treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

a Phase II clinical trial in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer that has metastasized to the brain;

&#160;

&#9679; 

a Phase II trial in the treatment of HER2-mutated non-small cell lung cancer; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

a Phase II trial in the treatment of patients with HER2-negative breast cancer that have a HER2 mutation; and

&#160;

&#9679; 

a Phase II trial in the treatment of solid tumors that have an activating HER2 mutation.

During the next 12 to 18 months, we expect to commence a Phase III trial of neratinib for the neoadjuvant treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer and a Phase II clinical trial for the neoadjuvant treatment of a subset of patients with HER2-negative breast cancer. We also plan to continue to evaluate the application of neratinib in the treatment of other forms of HER2-positive or HER2-mutated cancers where there may be unmet medical needs.

We license the commercial rights to our current drug candidates from Pfizer, Inc., which had previously been responsible for the clinical trials regarding neratinib. Going forward, we expect to augment our product pipeline by acquiring, through license or otherwise, additional drug candidates for research and development and potential commercialization. In evaluating potential drug candidates, we employ disciplined decision criteria that favor drug candidates that have undergone at least some clinical study. Our 

&#160;

decision to acquire a drug candidate will also depend on our evaluation of the scientific merits of the underlying technology, the costs of the transaction and other economic terms of any proposed license, the amount of capital that we anticipate will be required to develop the drug candidate and the economic potent ial of the drug candidate if approved for commercialization. We believe this strategy minimizes our clinical development risk and allows us to accelerate the development and potential commercialization of current and future drug candidates. 

Strategy 

Our strategy is to become a leading oncology-focused biopharmaceutical company. The key elements of our strategy are as follows: 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Seek regulatory approval and commence commercialization of neratinib in our lead indication . We recently completed our ExteNET trial, a Phase III clinical trial of neratinib for the extended adjuvant treatment of women with early stage HER2-positive breast cancer. Based on the results from the ExteNET trial, we expect to file for regulatory approval of neratinib in the extended adjuvant setting in the United States in the first quarter of 2016 and in the European Union in the first half of 2016. We are continuing to evaluate potential commercialization options for the extended adjuvant setting, including developing a direct sales force, contracting with third parties to provide sales and marketing capabilities, some combination of these two options or other strategic options. Additionally, we believe we currently have sufficient inventory on hand to support at least the first year of commercialization in the extended adjuvant setting and will continue to monitor and evaluate our third party manufacturers&#8217; ability to provide commercial supply of the product. 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Continue to advance the development of neratinib for the treatment of other HER2-positive breast cancer indications. We are primarily focused on developing neratinib for the treatment of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer, HER2-negative breast cancer who have a HER2 mutation and other solid tumors with an activating mutation in HER2, and HER2-mutated non-small cell lung cancer. In addition to our recently completed ExteNET trial, we have several ongoing clinical trials focused on the treatment of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. In June 2013, we commenced a Phase III clinical trial of neratinib in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who have failed two or more prior treatments (third-line disease), and in the next 12 to 18 months we expect to commence another Phase III clinical trial of neratinib in combination with chemotherapy for the neoadjuvant treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer. We also have several ongoing Phase II clinical trials evaluating the use of neratinib in combination with various other drugs, including Xeloda, Paclitaxel and Torisel, to treat patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer and HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer that has metastasized to the brain.

&#160;

&#9679; 

Expand our product pipeline by pursuing additional applications of neratinib. We believe there are additional applications for neratinib in the treatment of HER2-mutated non-small cell lung cancer, which we also believe may be underserved by current treatment alternatives; in the treatment of patients with HER2-negative breast cancer who have a HER2 mutation; and in tumor types where HER2 is over-expressed or mutated. We intend to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of neratinib for treating these cancers. 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Build a sustainable product pipeline by employing multiple therapeutic approaches and disciplined decision criteria based on clearly defined proof of principal goals. We seek to build a sustainable product pipeline by employing multiple therapeutic approaches and by acquiring drug candidates belonging to known drug classes. In addition, we employ disciplined decision criteria to assess drug candidates, favoring drug candidates that have undergone at least some clinical study. Our decision to license a drug candidate will also depend on the scientific merits of the technology; the costs of the transaction and other economic terms of the proposed license; the amount of capital required to develop the technology; and the economic potential of the drug candidate, should it be commercialized. We believe this strategy minimizes our clinical development risk and allows us to accelerate the development and potential commercialization of current and future drug candidates. We intend to pursue regulatory approval for a majority of our drug candidates in multiple indications. 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Evaluate the commercialization strategies on a product-by-product basis in order to maximize the value of each. As we move our drug candidates through development toward regulatory approval, we plan to evaluate several options for each drug candidate&#8217;s commercialization strategy. These options include building our own internal sales force; entering into a joint marketing partnership with another pharmaceutical or biotechnology company, whereby we jointly sell and market the product; and out-licensing our product, whereby another pharmaceutical or biotechnology company sells and markets our product and pays us a royalty on sales. Our decision may be different for each product that reaches commercialization and will be based on a number of factors including capital necessary to execute on each option, size of the market to be addressed and terms of potential offers from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.

Breast Cancer Overview 

Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide, with approximately 1 million new cases reported each year and more than 400,000 deaths per year. Approximately 20% to 25% of breast cancer tumors show over-expression of the HER2 protein. Women with breast cancer that over-expresses HER2 are at greater risk for disease progression and death than women whose tumors do not over-express HER2. Therapeutic strategies have been developed to block HER2 in order to improve the treatment of this cancer. 

Trastuzumab, pertuzumab, lapatinib and T-DM1 are all drugs that bind to the HER2 protein and thereby cause the cells to cease reproducing. Today, these drugs are used as single agents, in combination with other drugs and in combination with chemotherapy to treat patients with HER2-positive breast cancer at various stages. 

Currently, the only treatment approved by the FDA for the treatment of neoadjuvant (newly diagnosed) HER2-positive breast cancer is the combination of pertuzumab plus trastuzumab and taxane chemotherapy. The FDA-approved therapy for the adjuvant treatment of HER2-positive early stage breast cancer is the combination of trastuzumab and paclitaxel (Taxol) following anthracyclines, trastuzumab following chemotherapy and the combination of docetaxel (Taxotere) and trastuzumab following anthracyclines. In addition, we are aware of the ongoing APHINITY trial, which is comparing pertuzumab plus trastuzumab and chemotherapy versus placebo plus trastuzumab and chemotherapy as an adjuvant therapy, and the KAITLIN trial, which is comparing trastuzumab plus pertuzumab plus taxane following anthracyclines versus T-DM1 plus pertuzumab following anthracyclines as an adjuvant therapy.

Trastuzumab and pertuzumab given in combination with taxane chemotherapy is the current first-line standard of care for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. Lapatinib (Tykerb), given in combination with the chemotherapy drug capecitabine, is also FDA-approved for the treatment of patients who have failed prior treatments. In a Phase III clinical trial, patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who received the combination of lapatinib plus capecitabine demonstrated a median progression free survival of 27.1 weeks and a response rate of 23.7%. T-DM1 is approved by the FDA for the treatment of patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who previously received trastuzumab and a taxane chemotherapy, separately or in combination. Unfortunately, most patients with HER2-positive breast cancer eventually develop resistance to these treatments, resulting in disease progression. For these reasons, there is a need for alternatives to block HER2 signaling in patients who fail treatment with prior HER2 directed treatments. Neratinib is an orally active small molecule that inhibits HER2 at a different site and uses a different mechanism than trastuzumab. As a result, we believe that neratinib may have utility in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who have failed treatment with trastuzumab.

We believe that there are approximately 36,000 patients in the United States and 34,000 patients in the European Union, or EU, with newly diagnosed HER2-positive breast cancer, representing an estimated total market opportunity for neoadjuvant HER2-positive breast cancer between $1 billion and $2 billion. We believe that the worldwide Herceptin adjuvant revenue was approximately $4.3 billion in 2013. We also believe that there are between 5,000 and 6,000 patients in the United States with third-line or later HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. In 2013, worldwide sales of Tykerb for this indication were approximately $325 million.

Product Developm ent Pipeline 

The following chart shows each of our current drug candidates and their clinical development stage. 

Neratinib

Neratinib is a potent irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor, or TKI, that blocks signal transduction through the epidermal growth factor receptors, HER1, HER2 and HER4. Based on pre-clinical studies and clinical trials to date, we believe that neratinib may offer an advantage over existing treatments that are used in the treatment of patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who have failed prior treatments, including treatment with trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and T-DM1. Currently, the treatment of metastatic breast cancer patients involves treatment with these agents either alone or in combination with chemotherapy. We believe that by more potently inhibiting HER2 at a different site and acting via a mechanism different from other agents, neratinib may have therapeutic benefits in patients who have failed these existing treatments, most notably due to its increased selectivity and irreversible inhibition of the HER2 target enzyme.

In addition, we believe neratinib has clinical application in the treatment of other cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer and other tumor types that over-express or have a mutation in HER2. 

Our initial focus is on the development of the oral formulation of neratinib. We are also evaluating for potential development an intravenous formulation of neratinib and PB357, a back-up compound to neratinib.

PB272 (neratinib (oral))&#8212;Early Stage Breast Cancer 

Extended Adjuvant Breast Cancer

Two-Year ExteNET Data. In July 2014, we announced top line results from the Phase III clinical trial of neratinib for the extended adjuvant treatment of early stage HER2-positive breast cancer (ExteNET Trial). The data from this trial was presented in an oral presentation at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2015 Annual Meeting in June 2015 and was recently published online in the journal The Lancet Oncology and will be published in a future print issue of the journal. The ExteNET trial is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase III trial of neratinib versus placebo after adjuvant treatment with Herceptin in women with early stage HER2-positive breast cancer. More specifically, the ExteNET trial enrolled 2,840 patients in 41 countries with early stage HER2-positive breast cancer who had undergone surgery and adjuvant treatment with trastuzumab. After completion of adjuvant treatment with trastuzumab, patients were randomized to receive extended adjuvant treatment with either neratinib or placebo for a period of one year. Patients were then followed for recurrent disease, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), or death for a period of two years after randomization in the trial. 

The safety results of the study showed that the most frequently observed adverse event for the neratinib-treated patients was diarrhea, with approximately 39.9% of the neratinib-treated patients experiencing grade 3 or higher diarrhea (1 (0.1%) patient had 

&#160;

grade 4 diarrhea). Pati ents who received neratinib in this trial did not receive any prophylaxis with antidiarrheal agents to prevent the neratinib-related diarrhea. Puma&#8217;s recently reported clinical data from several trials have demonstrated that the use of high dose prophylact ic loperamide greatly reduces the rate of grade 3 diarrhea with neratinib, with grade 3 diarrhea rates ranging from 0-17% in studies in which high dose loperamide prophylaxis was used. In all of its current ongoing studies Puma is instituting the use of hi gh dose loperamide for the first cycle of treatment in order to continue to reduce the neratinib-related diarrhea. 

The primary endpoint of the trial was invasive disease free survival (DFS). The results of the trial demonstrated that treatment with neratinib resulted in a 33% reduction of risk of invasive disease recurrence or death versus placebo (hazard ratio = 0.67, p = 0.009). The 2-year DFS rate for the neratinib arm was 93.9% and the 2-year DFS rate for the placebo arm was 91.6%. The secondary endpoint of the trial was disease-free survival including ductal carcinoma in situ (DFS-DCIS). The results of the trial demonstrated that treatment with neratinib resulted in a 37% reduction of risk of disease recurrence including DCIS or death versus placebo (hazard ratio = 0.63, p = 0.002). The 2-year DFS-DCIS rate for the neratinib arm was 93.9% and the 2-year DFS-DCIS rate for the placebo arm was 91.0%.

As an inclusion criteria for the ExteNET trial, patients needed to have tumors that were HER2 positive using local assessment. In addition, as a pre-defined subgroup in the trial, patients had centralized HER2 testing performed on their tumor as well. At the time the 2-year data was compiled, centralized HER2 testing had been performed on 1,704 (60%) of the patients in the ExteNET trial and further central testing on available samples was currently ongoing. For the 1,463 patients whose tumors were HER2 positive by central confirmation, the results of the trial demonstrated that treatment with neratinib resulted in a 49% reduction of risk of invasive disease recurrence or death versus placebo (hazard ratio = 0.51, p = 0.002). The 2-year DFS rate for the centrally confirmed patients in the neratinib arm was 94.7% and the 2-year DFS rate for the centrally confirmed patients in the placebo arm was 90.6%. For the patients in the trial whose tumors were HER2 positive by central confirmation, the results of the trial demonstrated that treatment with neratinib resulted in a 51% reduction of risk of disease recurrence including DCIS or death versus placebo (hazard ratio = 0.49, p &#60; 0.001). The 2-year DFS-DCIS rate for the centrally confirmed patients in the neratinib arm was 94.7% and the 2-year DFS rate for centrally confirmed patients in the placebo arm was 90.2%. 

For the pre-defined subgroup of patients with hormone receptor positive disease, the results of the trial demonstrated that treatment with neratinib resulted in a 49% reduction of risk of invasive disease recurrence or death versus placebo (hazard ratio = 0.51, p = 0.001). The 2-year DFS rate for the neratinib arm was 95.4% and the 2-year DFS rate for the placebo arm was 91.2%. For the patients in the trial whose tumors were HER2 positive by central confirmation, the results of the trial demonstrated that treatment with neratinib resulted in a 75% reduction of risk of invasive disease recurrence or death (hazard ratio = 0.25, p &#60; 0.001). The 2-year DFS rate for the centrally confirmed patients in the neratinib arm was 97.0% and the 2-year DFS rate for centrally confirmed patients in the placebo arm was 88.4%.

We intend to use the 2-year data from the ExteNET trial to file for regulatory approval of neratinib in the extended adjuvant setting in the United States during the first quarter of 2016 and in the European Union in the first half of 2016.

Three-Year ExteNET Data. In December 2015, updated results from the ExteNET trial were presented at the 2015 CTRC-AACR San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. This presentation involved an exploratory sensitivity analysis of the 3-year disease free survival data to examine the durability of treatment effect beyond the 2-year data included in the primary analysis. This analysis was not a pre-planned analysis in the statistical analysis plan for the trial. For the primary endpoint of the trial, DFS, the results of the trial demonstrated that treatment with neratinib resulted in a 26% reduction of risk of invasive disease recurrence or death versus placebo (hazard ratio = 0.74, two sided p = 0.023). The 3-year DFS rate for the neratinib arm was 92.0% and the 3-year DFS rate for the placebo arm was 89.9%. 

For the 2,297 patients in the ExteNET trial who were treated in ExteNET less than one year from the completion of their adjuvant treatment with trastuzumab, the results of the trial demonstrated that treatment with neratinib resulted in a 28% reduction of risk of invasive disease recurrence or death versus placebo (hazard ratio = 0.72, two sided p = 0.02). For this group of patients, the 3-year DFS rate for the neratinib arm was 91.5% and the 3-year DFS rate for the placebo arm was 88.9%.

At the time the 3-year data was compiled , centralized HER2 testing had been performed on 2,041 (72%) of the patients in the ExteNET trial and further central testing on available samples was currently ongoing. For the 1,709 patients whose tumors were HER2 positive by central confirmation, the results of the trial demonstrated that treatment with neratinib resulted in a 30% reduction of risk of invasive disease recurrence or death versus placebo (hazard ratio = 0.70, two sided p = 0.037). The 3-year DFS rate for the centrally confirmed patients in the neratinib arm was 91.8% and the 3-year DFS rate for the centrally confirmed patients in the placebo arm was 89.6%. For the 1,392 patients in the ExteNET trial with centrally confirmed HER2 positive disease who were treated in ExteNET less than one year from the completion of their adjuvant treatment with trastuzumab, the results of the trial demonstrated that treatment with neratinib resulted in a 37% reduction of risk of invasive disease recurrence or death versus placebo (hazard ratio = 0.63, two sided p = 0.009). For this group of patients, the 3-year DFS rate for the neratinib arm was 91.7% and the 3-year DFS rate for the placebo arm was 88.2%. 

&#160;

For the pre-defined subgroup of 1,631 patients with hormone receptor positive disease, the results of the trial demonstrated that treatment with neratinib resulted in a 43% reduction of risk of invasive disease recurrence or death versus placebo (hazard ratio = 0.57, two sided p = 0.003). The 3-year DFS rate for the neratinib arm was 93.6% and the 3-year DFS rate for the placebo arm was 89.3%. For the 1,334 hormone receptor positive patients in the ExteNET trial who were treated in ExteNET less than one year from the completion of their adjuvant treatment with trastuzumab, the results of the trial demonstrated that treatment with neratinib resulted in a 43% reduction of risk of invasive disease recurrence or death versus placebo (hazard ratio = 0.57, two sided p = 0.004). For this group of patients, the 3-year DFS rate for the neratinib arm was 93.3% and the 3-year DFS rate for the placebo arm was 88.6%. For the 903 patients in the trial whose tumors were hormone receptor positive and HER2 positive by cent ral confirmation, the results of the trial demonstrated that treatment with neratinib resulted in a 57% reduction of risk of invasive disease recurrence or death versus placebo (hazard ratio = 0.43, two sided p &#60; 0.001). The 3-year DFS rate for the hormone receptor positive patients who also had HER2 centrally confirmed disease in the neratinib arm was 94.4% and the 3-year DFS rate for centrally confirmed patients in the placebo arm was 88.0%. &#160; 

Neoadjuvant Breast Cancer

At the 2010 CTRC-AACR San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, the results of the Neoadjuvant Lapatinib and/or Trastuzumab Treatment Optimisation Study, or the Neo-ALTTO study, were presented. In this trial, patients with HER2-positive breast cancer were randomized to receive either the combination of paclitaxel plus trastuzumab, the combination of paclitaxel plus lapatinib or the combination of paclitaxel plus trastuzumab plus lapatinib, as a neoadjuvant (preoperative) therapy. The results of the trial demonstrated that patients who received the combination of paclitaxel plus trastuzumab demonstrated a pathological complete response rate, or pCR, in the breast and lymph nodes of 27.6%, the patients who received paclitaxel plus lapatinib had a pCR of 20.0% and the patients who received the combination of paclitaxel plus trastuzumab plus lapatinib had a pCR of 46.8%. 

Also at the 2010 CTRC-AACR San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, the results of the Neo-Sphere study were presented. In this trial, patients with HER2-positive breast cancer were randomized to receive either the combination of docetaxel plus trastuzumab, the combination of docetaxel plus pertuzumab, the combination of trastuzumab plus pertuzumab or the combination of docetaxel plus trastuzumab plus pertuzumab, as a neoadjuvant (preoperative) therapy. The results of the trial demonstrated that the patients who received the combination of docetaxel plus trastuzumab demonstrated a pCR in the breast and lymph nodes of 21.5%, the patients who received docetaxel plus pertuzumab had a pCR of 17.7%, the patients who received pertuzumab plus trastuzumab had a pCR of 11.2% and the patients who received the combination of docetaxel plus trastuzumab plus pertuzumab had a pCR of 39.3%. 

I-SPY 2 Trial. In 2010, the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health initiated the I-SPY 2 TRIAL (Investigation of Serial Studies to Predict Your Therapeutic Response with Imaging And moLecular Analysis 2). The I-SPY 2 TRIAL is a randomized Phase II clinical trial for women with newly diagnosed Stage 2 or higher (tumor size at least 2.5 cm) breast cancer that addresses whether adding investigational drugs to standard chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting is better than standard chemotherapy. The primary endpoint is pCR in the breast and the lymph nodes at the time of surgery. The goal of the trial is to match investigational regimens with patient subsets on the basis of molecular characteristics, referred to as biomarker signatures that benefit from the regimen. 

The I-SPY 2 TRIAL involved an adaptive trial design based on Bayesian predictive probability that a regimen will be shown to be statistically superior to standard therapy in an equally randomized 300-patient confirmatory trial. Regimens that have a high Bayesian predictive probability of showing superiority in at least one of 10 predefined signatures graduate from the trial. Regimens are dropped for futility if they show a low predictive probability of showing superiority over standard therapy in all 10 signatures. A maximum total of 120 patients can be assigned to each experimental regimen. A regimen can graduate early and at any time after having 60 patients assigned to it.

In April 2014, we announced the results for the neratinib-containing regimen of the I-SPY 2 TRIAL. The neratinib-containing regimen (neratinib plus paclitaxel followed by doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide) graduated from the I-SPY 2 TRIAL based on having a high probability of success in Phase III with a signature of HER2 positive/HR negative. In this group, treatment with the neratinib-containing regimen resulted in an estimated pCR rate of 55.6% compared to the control arm (standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy: paclitaxel in combination with trastuzumab followed by doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide), which had an estimated pCR rate of 32.6%. The Bayesian probability of superiority for the neratinib-containing regimen (compared to standard therapy) is 94.9%, which is analogous to a p-value of 0.051. In addition, the Bayesian predictive probability of showing statistical superiority in a 300-patient Phase III randomized trial of paclitaxel plus neratinib versus paclitaxel plus trastuzumab, both followed by doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide, is 79.1%.

For the 65 patients in the trial who were HER2 positive (including those who were either hormone receptor positive or negative), treatment with the neratinib-containing regimen resulted in an estimated pCR rate of 39.4% compared to the control arm, which demonstrated an estimated pCR rate of 22.8%. The Bayesian probability of superiority for the neratinib-containing regimen is 95.4%, which is analogous to a p-value of 0.046. In addition, the Bayesian predictive probability of showing statistical superiority in a 300-patient Phase III randomized trial of paclitaxel plus neratinib versus paclitaxel plus trastuzumab is 72.7%.

&#160;

Patients in the I-SPY 2 TRIAL were screened using the MammaPrint 70-gene signature test to determine if they had a heightened risk of breast cancer recurrence. The median MammaPrint score from the patients in the previous I-SPY 1 TRIAL who fit the eligibility criteria for I-SPY2 was used as a predefined stratification factor for the I-SPY 2 TRIAL. Patients in I-SPY 2 were stratified as either MammaPrint High (below the median from I-SPY 1) or MammaPrint Ultra High (above the median from I-SPY 1). For the 41 neratinib treated patients in the trial who were MammaPrint Ultra High (80.5% of which were HER2 negative), treatment with the neratinib-containing regimen resulted in an estimated pCR rate of 47.5% compared to the control arm, which d emonstrated an estimated pCR rate of 29.4%. The Bayesian probability of superiority for the neratinib-containing regimen is 93.3%, which is analogous to a p-value of 0.067. In addition, the Bayesian predictive probability of showing statistical superiority in a 300-patient Phase III randomized trial of paclitaxel plus neratinib versus paclitaxel, alone for HER2-negative patients or in combination with trastuzumab for the HER2-positive patients, is 71.8%. 

We anticipate that the results of the I-SPY2 TRIAL with neratinib will be published in a medical journal in 2016. Based on the graduation of neratinib from the I-SPY2 TRIAL, neratinib is now eligible to proceed into the I-SPY3 Phase III clinical trial, which is currently being planned. We anticipate that the I-SPY3 trial with neratinib will be initiated in 2016.

FB-7 Trial. In 2010, Pfizer, in collaboration with the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project, or NSABP, a clinical trials cooperative group supported by the National Cancer Institute, or NCI, initiated the FB-7 study to investigate the use of neratinib as a neoadjuvant (preoperative) therapy for newly diagnosed HER2-positive breast cancer. In this trial, a total of 126 patients are randomized to receive neratinib plus the chemotherapy drug paclitaxel or trastuzumab plus paclitaxel prior to having surgery to remove their tumors. The purpose of this study is to test whether adding neratinib to paclitaxel chemotherapy is better than trastuzumab plus paclitaxel chemotherapy before having surgery. This trial was modified in 2012 to include a third treatment arm where patients will receive the combination of neratinib plus trastuzumab plus paclitaxel prior to having surgery to remove their tumors. 

Data from this trial were presented at the 2015 CTRC-AACR San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. Patients were randomly assigned to trastuzumab (T) or neratinib (N) or the combination (T+N) with weekly paclitaxel (P) followed by standard doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide chemotherapy (AC) administered prior to surgery. 126 U.S., Canadian, and European patients were randomly assigned to Arm 1 (T+P followed by AC), Arm 2 (N+P followed by AC) or Arm 3 (T+N+P followed by AC). The primary endpoint of the trial was pathological complete response rate (pCR) in the breast and lymph nodes. Tumor tissue was collected on patients at the time of diagnosis. This tissue will be analyzed for several biomarkers including AKT, cMET, EGFR, ESR-alpha, HER2, HER3, HER4, p95 HER2 and PI3K and intrinsic subtypes. A key secondary endpoint of this trial is the molecular and genetic correlates of response for each of these biomarkers. The analysis of these biomarkers is ongoing and will be presented at a medical meeting in 2016.

For the intent-to-treat patient population (hormone receptor positive (HR+) and hormone receptor negative (HR-)), the pCR rate for Arm 1 was 38.1%, for Arm 2 was 33.3% and for Arm 3 was 50.0%. For the HR+ patients, the pCR rate for Arm 1 was 29.6%, for Arm 2 was 27.6% and for Arm 3 was 30.4%. For the HR- patients, the pCR rate for Arm 1 was 57.1%, for Arm 2 was 46.2% and for Arm 3 was 73.7%.

The most frequently observed severe adverse event in the two neratinib treated arms of the trial (Arm 2 and Arm 3) was diarrhea. In the first 19 patients treated in Arm 2 of the trial, high dose loperamide (16 mg per day initially) as primary prophylaxis was not given to prevent the neratinib-related diarrhea. In this subset of patients the grade 3 diarrhea rate was 42% (8/19). In the next 10 patients treated in Arm 2 and the first 20 patients treated in Arm 3, high dose primary prophylaxis (16 mg per day initially) with loperamide was given during the initial two weeks of the first cycle of treatment. Using two weeks of intensive loperamide prophylactically, the grade 3 diarrhea rate in Arm 2 was 30% (3/10) and the grade 3 diarrhea rate in Arm 3 was 35% (7/20). In the next 13 patients in Arm 2 and 22 patients in Arm 3, high dose prophylaxis (16 mg per day initially) was given for the entire first cycle of treatment (4 weeks). The grade 3 diarrhea rate was 15% (2/13) in Arm 2 and 23% (5/22) in Arm 3.

PB272 (neratinib (oral))&#8212;Metastatic Breast Cancer 

Trials of Neratinib as a Single Agent . In 2009, Pfizer presented data at the CTRC-AACR San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium from a Phase II trial of neratinib administered as a single agent to patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. Final results from this trial were published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in March 2010. 

The trial involved a total of 136 patients, 66 of whom had received prior treatment with trastuzumab and 70 of whom had not received prior treatment with trastuzumab. The results of the study showed that neratinib was reasonably well-tolerated among both the pretreated patients and the patients who had not received prior treatment with trastuzumab. Diarrhea was the most common side effect, but was manageable with antidiarrheal agents and dose modification. Efficacy results from the trial showed that the objective response rate was 24% for patients who had received prior trastuzumab treatment and 56% for patients with no prior trastuzumab 

&#160;

treatment. Furthermore, the median PFS was 22.3 weeks for the patients w ho had received prior trastuzumab and 39.6 weeks for the patients who had not received prior trastuzumab. 

Trials of Neratinib in Combination with Other Anti-Cancer Drugs . In November 2014, we announced top line results from a Phase II clinical trial of neratinib for the treatment of first-line HER2-positive locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer (NEfERTT trial). Data from this trial was presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2015 Annual Meeting in June 2015. The NEfERTT trial was a randomized, two-arm Phase II trial of neratinib plus the anticancer drug paclitaxel versus trastuzumab (Herceptin) plus paclitaxel as a first-line treatment for HER2-positive locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer. The trial enrolled 479 patients in 33 countries with locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer who had not received prior anticancer therapy for locally recurrent or metastatic disease. Patients were randomized to receive first-line treatment with either paclitaxel plus neratinib or paclitaxel plus trastuzumab. The primary endpoint of the trial was progression free survival. The secondary endpoints of the study included objective response rate and the incidence of central nervous system (CNS) metastases, including brain metastases. 

The results of the trial demonstrated that the progression free survival for the patients who received the combination of paclitaxel plus neratinib was 12.9 months and the progression free survival for the patients who received the combination of paclitaxel plus trastuzumab was 12.9 months (p=0.777). The objective response rate in the trial for the patients who received the combination of paclitaxel plus neratinib was 74.8% and the objective response rate for the patients who received the combination of paclitaxel plus trastuzumab was 77.6% (p=0.522). With respect to the incidence of central nervous system metastases (e.g., brain metastases), treatment with the combination of paclitaxel plus neratinib resulted in a 52% reduction in the incidence of CNS metastases compared to the incidence of CNS metastases in patients who received the combination of paclitaxel plus trastuzumab. The incidence of CNS metastases was 8.3% in the patients who received paclitaxel plus neratinib, while the incidence of CNS metastases in the patients who received the combination of paclitaxel plus trastuzumab was 17.3% (p=0.002). These results reflect a statistically significant difference between the two treatment arms. We believe that this represents the first randomized trial with a HER2 targeted agent that has shown a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of CNS metastases. We anticipate publishing the Phase II trial results in 2016. 

Pfizer presented data from a Phase II trial at the 2010 CTRC-AACR San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, which evaluated the safety and efficacy of neratinib when given in combination with the anti-cancer drug vinorelbine in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. In the 56 patients who had not been previously treated with the anti-HER2 therapy lapatinib, treatment with the combination of vinorelbine plus neratinib resulted in an overall response rate of 57% and PFS was 44.1 weeks. For those patients who had received prior treatment with lapatinib, the overall response rate was 50%. The combination of vinorelbine and neratinib was generally well tolerated. 

Data from a third Phase II study, in which patients with confirmed HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who had failed treatment with trastuzumab and taxane chemotherapy were given neratinib in combination with capecitabine, was presented at the 2011 CTRC-AACR San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. The results of the study showed that the combination of PB272 and capecitabine had acceptable tolerability. The efficacy results from the trial showed that for the 61 patients in the trial who had not been previously treated with the HER2 targeted anti-cancer drug lapatinib, there was an overall response rate of 64% and a clinical benefit rate of 72%. In addition, for the seven patients in the trial who had previously been treated with lapatinib, there was an overall response rate of 57% and a clinical benefit rate of 71%. The median PFS for patients who had not received prior treatment with lapatinib was 40.3 weeks and the median PFS for the patients who had received prior lapatinib treatment was 35.9 weeks. 

In February 2013, we reached agreement with the FDA under an SPA, for our planned Phase III clinical trial of neratinib in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who have failed two or more prior treatments (third-line disease). The SPA is a written agreement between us, as the trial&#8217;s sponsor, and the FDA regarding the design, endpoints, and planned statistical analysis of the Phase III trial with respect to the effectiveness of PB272 for the indication to be studied to support a New Drug Application, or NDA. The EMA has also provided follow-on SA, consistent with that of the FDA regarding our Phase III trial design and endpoints to be used and ability of such design to support the submission of a Market Authorization Application, or MAA, in the EU. 

Pursuant to the SPA and SA, the Phase III trial is designed as a randomized study of neratinib plus capecitabine versus lapatinib plus capecitabine in patients with third-line HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. The trial is expected to enroll approximately 600 patients who will be randomized (1:1) to receive either PB272 plus capecitabine or lapatinib plus capecitabine. The trial will be conducted at approximately 250 sites in North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. The agreed upon co-primary endpoints of the trial are PFS and overall survival. Our plan is to use the PFS data from the trial as the basis for submission of an NDA, and its foreign equivalents for Accelerated/Conditional Approval for PB272 from the regulatory agencies. We commenced patient enrollment in this Phase III trial in the second quarter of 2013. &#160; 

In 2010, Pfizer also initiated a Phase I/II trial of neratinib in combination with the anti-cancer drug temsirolimus, or Torisel, in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who have failed multiple prior treatments. The trial was conducted as a Phase I/II trial of PB272 given in combination with the anticancer drug temsirolimus in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. 

&#160;

The Phase I portion of the trial, which was reported previously, determined that the maximum tolerated dose was 240 mg of neratinib daily with 8 mg of temsirolimus weekly and the dose limiting toxicity was diarrhea. The interim Phase II data was presented at the 2014 CTRC-AACR San Antonio Breast Ca ncer Symposium. The Phase II portion of the study was conducted in two cohorts. The first cohort, referred to as the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) cohort, received 240 mg of neratinib daily with 8 mg of temsirolimus weekly. This cohort of patients received low dose loperamide (4 mg per day) prophylactically i n order to reduce the neratinib- related diarrhea. The second cohort of patients, referred to as the Dose Escalation cohort (DE cohort), received 240 mg of neratinib daily and initially received 8 mg of temsirolimus weekly. This cohort of patients received high dose loperamide (16 mg per day initially) prophylactically i n order to reduce the neratinib- related diarrhea. If patients in the DE cohort had no tolerability issues with the combination of neratin ib and temsirolimus given at 8 mg per week during the first cycle of treatment, patients in this DE cohort were allowed to dose escalate the temsirolimus to 15 mg per week for the remainder of the study. Patients in both cohorts in the study received a med ian of 3 prior regimens in the metastatic setting (range 1-8 prior regimens) before entering the trial. The 37 patients in the MTD cohort were enrolled at 3 centers in the United States and the 45 patients in the DE cohort were enrolled at 8 centers in the United States, Europe and Asia. &#8232;&#8232; The interim safety results of the study showed that the most frequently observed adverse event for the patients who received the combination of neratinib plus temsirolimus was diarrhea. For the 37 patients in the MTD cohor t, who received low dose loperamide prophylactically, 12 patients (32%) experienced grade 3 diarrhea. For the 41 patients in the DE cohort, who received high dose loperamide prophylactically and were allowed to dose escalate the temsirolimus dose, 7 patien ts (17%) reported grade 3 diarrhea. 4 (57%) of the 7 patients in the DE cohort who experienced grade 3 diarrhea were not compliant with the high dose loperamide prophylaxis. There were 4 patients in the DE cohort who did not yet have safety data reported a nd are therefore not included in the safety population. For the patients in the DE cohort, thus far 47% of the patients have been able to dose escalate from 8 mg per week of temsirolimus to 15 mg per week of temsirolimus. &#8232;&#8232; The interim efficacy results from the trial showed that for the 37 patients in the MTD cohort, 11 patients (30%) experienced a partial response (PR). The median duration of response for this cohort of patients was 3.0 months and the median progression - free survival was 4.8 months. For the 37 evaluable patients in the DE cohort, the efficacy results from the trial demonstrated that 11 patients (30%) experienced a partial response (PR). The median duration of response for this cohort of patients was 7.4 months and the median progression free survival is not yet mature. As of December 2014 , there were a total of 18 patients currently on active treatment in the trial. 8 of the 17 active patients in the DE cohort have not yet had tumor assessments. 

Metastatic Breast Cancer with Brain Metastases

Approximately one-third of the patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer develop metastases that spread to their brain. The current antibody-based treatments, including trastuzumab, pertuzumab and T-DM1, do not enter the brain and therefore are not believed to be effective in treating these patients. In a Phase II trial with lapatinib given as a single agent, lapatinib demonstrated a 6% objective response rate in the patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer whose disease spread to their brain. In January 2012, a Phase II trial of neratinib as a single agent and in combination with the anticancer drug capecitabine in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer that has spread to their brain was initiated in conjunction with the Dana Farber Translational Breast Cancer Research Consortium. In June 2014, at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2014 Annual Meeting, results from the first cohort (n=40) who were administered neratinib monotherapy was presented. The efficacy results from the first cohort of the trial showed that for the 40 evaluable patients, 3 (8%) patients experienced a partial response (PR), 4 (10%) patients experienced prolonged stable disease (SD) for greater than or equal to 6 months and 12 (30%) patients experienced stable disease (SD) for less than 6 months. The median progression-free survival of the 40 evaluable patients was seen to be 1.9 months and the median overall survival was seen to be 8.7 months. We anticipate that additional results from this trial will be presented in 2016. 

Safety Database . Our safety database includes over 3,000 patients who have been treated with neratinib. To date, the most significant grade 3 or higher adverse event associated with neratinib has been diarrhea, which occurs in approximately 30% of patients receiving the drug. Historically, once diarrhea occurred, patients were treated with loperamide and/or a reduction in the dose of neratinib. We have evaluated a prophylactic protocol pursuant to which a high dose of loperamide, approximately 16 mg, is given together with the initial dose of neratinib and then tapered down during the first cycle of treatment. We plan to continue evaluating this protocol as the preliminary data has suggested that this prophylactic regimen significantly reduces the incidence of diarrhea with neratinib. 

In February 2015, Puma initiated a Phase II open-label trial of neratinib monotherapy for one year in 120 patients with early HER2-positive breast cancer who have completed one year of adjuvant trastuzumab. This study population is analogous to the patient population from the ExteNET trial. The purpose of the Phase II trial is to investigate the effect of 2 cycles of high-dose loperamide on diarrhea incidence and severity. In the original protocol, 4 mg loperamide is self-administered with the first dose of neratinib, followed by 2 mg loperamide every 4 hours for the first 3 days, reducing to 2 mg loperamide every 6 to 8 hours through the first 2 cycles of therapy. With Amendment 1, the loperamide dosing schedule was modified to simplify the regimen. Following Amendment 1 of the protocol, 4 mg loperamide is self-administered with the first dose of neratinib, followed by 4 mg loperamide three times a day for 2 weeks, followed by 4 mg loperamide twice daily through the first 2 cycles of therapy. After two cycles, patients do not take loperamide prophylactically but take it as needed throughout the remainder of the treatment duration if diarrhea occurs.

&#160;

In December 2015, we announced the interim results of this Phase II trial. In the 27 patients who were treated using the loperamide regimen outlined in the original protocol, 5 (18.5%) patients experienced grade 3 diarrhea. In the 23 patients treated using the loperamide regimen in Amendment 1, 3 (13%) patients had grade 3 diarrhea. We anticipate presenting updated data from this Phase II trial during 2016. 

PB272 (neratinib (oral))&#8212;Other Potential Applications 

Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer

Approximately 2% to 4% of patients with NSCLC have a HER2 mutation in the kinase domain. This mutation is believed to narrow the ATP binding cleft which results in increased tyrosine kinase activity. The mutation is also believed to result in increased PI3K activity and mTOR activation. Published data suggests that patients with HER2-mutated non-small cell lung cancer do not respond to platinum chemotherapy and do not respond to epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors. 

In September 2014, we reported initial data from the ongoing, open label Phase II clinical trial of PB272 (neratinib) for the treatment of patients with NSCLC with HER2 mutations as a late-breaking oral presentation at the European Society for Medical Oncology 2014 Congress. &#8232;&#8232; In the trial, patients with confirmed Stage IIIB or Stage IV NSCLC with documented somatic HER2 mutations were randomized to receive either oral neratinib monotherapy at a dose of 240 mg per day or the combination of oral neratinib (at a dose of 240 mg daily) with intravenous temsirolimus administered at a dose of 8 mg per week. In order to attempt to reduce the neratinib-related diarrhea, high-dose loperamide prophylaxis (Imodium) was given to all patients in both arms of the study beginning on day 1 of neratinib dosing. The data presented in the oral presentation involved a total of 27 patients who completed the first stage of the trial; 13 of these patients received neratinib monotherapy and 14 of these patients received the combination of neratinib plus temsirolimus. &#8232;&#8232; The results of the study showed that the combination of PB272 and temsirolimus had acceptable tolerability. Historically the most frequently seen adverse event associated with neratinib has been diarrhea. In the previous Phase I trial of neratinib plus temsirolimus (published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in 2014) the diarrhea with neratinib was seen to be dose dependent and its incidence increased with increasing neratinib dosage. In that Phase I trial, grade 3 or higher diarrhea was seen in approximately 30% of the patients treated with doses of neratinib that were 200 mg or higher. &#8232;&#8232; In the Phase II study, all patients received high-dose loperamide in order to attempt to prevent or reduce the neratinib-related diarrhea. For the 13 patients enrolled in the neratinib monotherapy arm, 1 patient (8%) experienced grade 3 diarrhea, and for the 14 patients enrolled in the combination of neratinib plus temsirolimus arm, 2 patients (14%) experienced grade 3 diarrhea. There were no grade 4 diarrhea events seen in the trial. For the 3 patients in the study (1 in the monotherapy arm, 2 in the combination arm) who experienced grade 3 diarrhea, 2 of the 3 patients were not compliant with the loperamide prophylaxis regimen and were not taking loperamide at the onset of grade 3 diarrhea.

The efficacy results from the trial showed that for the 13 patients in the trial who received neratinib monotherapy, no patient experienced a partial response, 7 patients (54%) achieved stable disease and 4 patients (31%) achieved clinical benefit (defined as a partial response or stable disease for 12 or more weeks). For the 14 patients who received the combination of neratinib plus temsirolimus, 3 patients (21%) experienced a partial response, 11 patients (79%) experienced stable disease and 9 patients (64%) achieved clinical benefit. The median progression free survival of the neratinib monotherapy arm was 2.9 months and the median progression-free survival of the arm that received neratinib plus temsirolimus was 4.0 months. Patients continue to be enrolled in the arm of the trial that is receiving the combination of neratinib plus temsirolimus. We anticipate that additional data from this trial will be presented in 2016. &#160; 

HER2 Mutation-Positive Solid Tumors 

A new HER2 mutation in patients with HER2-negative breast cancer was identified as part of a study performed by the Cancer Genome Atlas Network and published in Cancer Discovery in December 2012. We believe this mutation may occur in an estimated 2% of patients with breast cancer. Pre-clinical data from this publication demonstrated that neratinib was active in pre-clinical models of HER2-negative breast cancer that have this HER2 mutation and that neratinib has more anti-cancer activity than either trastuzumab or lapatinib in cells with this mutation. A Phase II trial of neratinib in HER2-negative breast cancer patients who have a HER2 mutation opened for enrollment in December 2012. We anticipate that data from this trial will be reported in 2016. 

Based on the results from the Cancer Genome Atlas Study, we estimate that between 2% and 11% of each solid tumor has a mutation in HER2. In the United States, this includes new diagnoses of an estimated 7,000 - 7,500 patients with bladder cancer; 4,000 - 4,500 patients with colorectal cancer; 1,500 - 2,000 patients with glioblastoma; 1,000 patients with melanoma; 4,000 - 5,000 patients with prostate cancer; 1,000 patients with stomach cancer; and 1,000 - 2,000 patients with uterine cancer. 

Basket Trial for HER2 Mutation-Positive Solid Tumors. In October 2013, we announced that we had initiated a Phase II clinical trial of neratinib as a single agent in patients with solid tumors that have an activating HER2 mutation (SUMMIT basket trial). The Phase II basket trial is an open-label, multicenter, multinational study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PB272 administered daily to patients who have solid tumors with activating HER2 mutations. The study initially included six cohorts (baskets) of patients, each 

&#160;

of which will include one of the following cancers: (i) bladder/urinary tract cancer; (ii) colorectal cancer; (iii) endometrial cancer; (iv) gastric/esophageal cancer; (v) ovarian cancer; and (vi) all other solid tumors (including prostate, melanoma and pancreatic cancer). Each basket will initially consist of seven patients. If a certain predetermined objective response rate is seen in the initial cohort of seven patients, the basket will be expanded to include a larger number of patients. 

In May 2014, we announced that we expanded the first cohort from the Phase II clinical trial of PB272 in patients with solid tumors who have an activating HER2 mutation (basket trial). The cohort that has been expanded includes patients with metastatic breast cancer that is not HER2 amplified or overexpressed (HER2 negative) and has a HER2 mutation. 

Interim results from this ongoing Phase II trial were presented at the 2015 CTRC-AACR San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in December 2015. In the cohort, patients with HER2-mutant metastatic breast cancer were enrolled and received 240 mg of neratinib daily. Patients received loperamide (16 mg per day initially) prophylactically for the first cycle of treatment in order to reduce the neratinib-related diarrhea. For the 20 patients in the cohort presented, 20 patients (100%) had HER2-negative disease, 17 patients (85%) were hormone receptor positive (estrogen receptor or progesterone receptor positive), and patients had received a median of 4 prior regimens in the metastatic setting (range 0-11 prior regimens) before entering the trial.

The primary endpoint of the trial was objective response at week 8 assessed by anatomic or metabolic imaging. The interim efficacy results from the trial showed that for the 19 efficacy evaluable patients in the breast cancer cohort, 6 patients (32%) experienced a response at week 8. This included one patient with a complete response and five patients with partial responses. The secondary endpoints of the trial included confirmed objective response (complete response or partial response), clinical benefit rate and progression-free survival (PFS). The results of the trial showed that 3 patients (16%) had a confirmed objective response, 8 patients (42%) demonstrated clinical benefit and the median progression-free survival was 4.0 months.

The presentation also discussed that a bidirectional cross-talk between hormone receptor and HER2 signaling pathways can lead to endocrine resistance due to activated HER2 signaling and ER-mediated tumor proliferation as a potential resistance mechanism to sustained HER2 inhibition. Preclinical data has demonstrated that the combination of an anti-estrogen with a HER2 inhibitor results in enhanced anti-tumor activity in preclinical models of estrogen receptor positive/HER2-positive breast tumors. Based on this, the SUMMIT study was amended to allow for the combination of neratinib plus fulvestrant in eligible postmenopausal hormone receptor positive breast cancer patients. For the 3 response-evaluable patients who have been enrolled and received the combination of neratinib plus fulvestrant, 3 (100%) of 3 patients have shown a response, including one patient with a complete response and two patients with partial responses. There have also been two patients enrolled on the combination of neratinib plus fulvestrant after progressing on neratinib monotherapy. One (50%) of these two patients has demonstrated a partial response.

The interim safety results of the study showed that the most frequently observed adverse event was diarrhea. For the 130 patients enrolled across all solid tumor cohorts in the SUMMIT study, 25 patients (19%) reported grade 3 diarrhea. The median duration of grade 3 diarrhea for the patients in the entire SUMMIT study was 2 days. 2 patients (2%) in the SUMMIT study have permanently discontinued neratinib due to diarrhea and 20 patients (15%) have temporarily discontinued neratinib due to diarrhea and then restarted after the diarrhea subsided. For the breast cancer mutation cohort, 7 of 20 patients (35%) experienced grade 3 diarrhea. The median duration of grade 3 diarrhea was 1 day. No patient (0%) in the breast cancer cohort permanently discontinued neratinib due to diarrhea and 4 patients (20%) temporarily discontinued neratinib due to diarrhea and then restarted after the diarrhea subsided.

In April 2015, we announced that we expanded the cohort from the Phase II clinical trial of PB272 in patients with metastatic NSCLC that is not HER2 amplified or overexpressed (HER2 negative) and has a HER2 mutation. In December 2015, we announced that we expanded the cohort that includes patients with metastatic biliary duct (bile duct) cancer that is not HER2 amplified or overexpressed (HER2 negative) and has a HER2 mutation. We anticipate that additional clinical data from this trial will be presented in 2016. 

PB272 (neratinib (intravenous)) 

We also plan to develop neratinib as an intravenously administered agent. The intravenous version of neratinib resulted in higher exposure levels of neratinib in pre-clinical models. We believe this may result in higher blood levels of neratinib in patients, and may translate into enhanced efficacy. We are evaluating the intravenous formulation of neratinib and considering options relative to its development. 

PB357 

PB357 is an orally administered agent that is an irreversible TKI that blocks signal transduction through the epidermal growth factor receptors, HER1, HER2 and HER4. PB357 is structurally similar to PB272. Pfizer completed single-dose Phase I trials of PB357. We are evaluating PB357 and considering options relative to its development. 

&#160;

Clinical Testing of Our Products in Development 

Each of our products in development, and likely all future drug candidates we in-license, will require extensive pre-clinical and clinical testing to determine the safety and efficacy of the product applications prior to seeking and obtaining regulatory approval. This process is expensive and time consuming. In completing these trials, we are dependent upon third-party consultants, consisting mainly of investigators and collaborators, who will conduct such trials. 

We and our third-party consultants conduct pre-clinical testing in accordance with Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, and clinical testing in accordance with Good Clinical Practice standards, or GCP, which are international ethical and scientific quality standards utilized for pre-clinical and clinical testing, respectively. GCP is the standard for the design, conduct, performance, monitoring, auditing, recording, analysis and reporting of clinical trials and the FDA requires compliance with GCP regulations in the conduct of clinical trials. Additionally, our pre-clinical and clinical testing completed in the EU is conducted in accordance with applicable EU standards, such as the EU Clinical Trials Directive (Directive 2001/20/EC of April 4, 2001), or the EU Clinical Trials Directive, and the national laws of the Member Estates of the EU implementing its provisions. 

We have entered into, and may enter into in the future, master service agreements with clinical research organizations, or CROs, with respect to initiating, managing and conducting the clinical trials of our products. These contracts contain standard terms for the type of services provided that contain cancellation clauses requiring between 30 and 45 days written notice and that obligate us to pay for any services previously rendered with prepaid, unused funds being returned to us. &#160; 

Competition 

The development and commercialization of new products to treat cancer is highly competitive and we expect considerable competition from major pharmaceutical, biotechnology and specialty cancer companies. As a result, there are and will likely continue to be extensive research and substantial financial resources invested in the discovery and development of new cancer products. Our potential competitors include, but are not limited to, Genentech, Novartis, Roche, Boehringer Ingelheim, Takeda, Array Biopharma and Ambit Biosciences. We are an early stage company with a limited history of operations and no experience with sales, marketing or commercial manufacturing. Many of our competitors have substantially more financial and technical resources than we do. In addition, many of our competitors have more experience than we have in pre-clinical and clinical development, manufacturing, regulatory and global commercialization. We are also competing with academic institutions, governmental agencies and private organizations that are conducting research in the field of cancer. We anticipate that we will face intense competition. 

We expect that our products under development and in clinical trials will address major markets within the cancer sector. Our competition will be determined in part by the potential indications for which drugs are developed and ultimately approved by regulatory authorities. Additionally, the timing of market introduction of some of our potential products or of competitors&#8217; products may be an important competitive factor. Accordingly, the speed with which we can develop products, complete pre-clinical testing, clinical trials and approval processes, and supply commercial quantities to market are expected to be important competitive factors. We expect that competition among products approved for sale will be based on various factors, including product efficacy, safety, reliability, availability, price, reimbursement and patent position. 

Sales and Marketing

We currently have no sales, marketing or distribution capabilities and only a limited number of our employees have experience in marketing or selling pharmaceutical products. To achieve commercial success for any of our proposed products, if approved, we must either develop a direct sales, marketing and distribution organization or enter into arrangements with third parties to market, sell and distribute such products. We anticipate filing for regulatory approval of PB272 for the extended adjuvant treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer in the United States and Europe in the first quarter and first half of 2016, respectively. We are continuing to evaluate potential commercialization options for the extended adjuvant setting, including developing a direct sales force, contracting with third parties to provide sales and marketing support, some combination of these two options or other strategic options.

&#160;

Intellectual Property and License Agreements 

We hold a worldwide exclusive license under our license agreement with Pfizer to four granted U.S. patents and nine pending U.S. patent applications, as well as foreign counterparts thereof, and other patent applications and patents claiming priority therefrom. 

In the United States, we have a license to an issued patent, which currently will expire in 2025, for the composition of matter of neratinib, our lead compound. We have a license to an issued U.S. patent covering a family of compounds including neratinib, as well as equivalent patents in the EU and Japan, that currently expire in 2019. We also have a license to an issued U.S. patent for the use of neratinib in the treatment of breast cancer, which currently expires in 2025, and an issued U.S. polymorph patent for neratinib, which currently expires in 2028. In jurisdictions which permit such, we will seek patent term extensions where possible for certain of our patents. We plan to pursue additional patents in and outside the United States covering additional therapeutic uses and polymorphs of neratinib from these existing applications. In addition, we will pursue patent protection for any new discoveries or inventions made in the course of our development of neratinib. 

If we obtain marketing approval for neratinib or other drug candidates in the United States or in certain jurisdictions outside the United States, we may be eligible for regulatory protection, such as five years of new chemical entity exclusivity and, as mentioned above, up to five years of patent term extension potentially available in the United States under the Hatch-Waxman Act. In addition, eight to 11 years of data and marketing exclusivity potentially are available for new drugs in the European Union; up to five years of patent extension are potentially available in Europe (Supplemental Protection Certificate), and eight years of data exclusivity are potentially available in Japan. There can be no assurance that we will qualify for any such regulatory exclusivity, or that any such exclusivity will prevent competitors from seeking approval solely on the basis of their own studies. See &#8220;Government Regulation&#8221; below. 

The intellectual property portfolio that was licensed from Pfizer in 2011 when we licensed neratinib included issued patents in a number of countries, including in Europe (EP 1848414), as well as pending patent applications in several countries, including the United States, relating to methods of treating gefitinib-and/or erlotinib-resistant cancer by administering an irreversible epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor. More specifically, the patent that was issued in Europe in April 2011 included specific claims that included a pharmaceutical composition for use in treating cancer in a subject with a cancer having a mutation in epidermal growth factor receptor with a T790M mutation. On November 28, 2011, Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH filed an opposition to this patent asking for this patent to be revoked. The Oral Proceedings of the European Patent Office were held in Munich, Germany on February 4, 2014. The decision of the European Patent Office was to uphold the granted claims of the European patent that relate to the T790M mutation without any modification. This included specific claims that include claims for the pharmaceutical composition comprising an irreversible epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor for use in treating cancer in a subject having a T790M mutation, and claims for the pharmaceutical composition for use in the treatment of numerous cancers, including lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. &#160; In September 2015, we were advised of the issuance by the United States Patent and Trademark Office of a Notice of Allowance for U.S. Patent Application 11/883,474 titled &#8220;Method for Treating Gefitinib Resistant Cancer.&#8221;

Our goal is to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our products, formulations, processes, methods and other proprietary technologies, preserve our trade secrets, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties, both in the United States and in other countries. Our policy is to actively seek to obtain, where appropriate, the broadest intellectual property protection possible for our current product candidates and any future product candidates, proprietary information and proprietary technology through a combination of contractual arrangements and patents, both in the United States and abroad. However, even patent protection may not always provide us with complete protection against competitors who seek to circumvent our patents. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property&#8212;Our proprietary rights may not adequately protect our intellectual property and potential products, and if we cannot obtain adequate protection of our intellectual property and potential products, we may not be able to successfully market our potential products.&#8221; 

We depend upon the skills, knowledge and experience of our scientific and technical personnel, as well as that of our advisors, consultants and other contractors, none of which is patentable. To help protect our proprietary know-how, which is not patentable, and inventions for which patents may be difficult to obtain or enforce, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. To this end, we require all of our employees, consultants, advisors and other contractors to enter into confidentiality agreements that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business. 

License Agreements 

In August 2011, Former Puma entered into an agreement pursuant to which Pfizer agreed to grant to Former Puma a worldwide license for the development, manufacture and commercialization of neratinib (oral), neratinib (intravenous), PB357, and certain related compounds. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the license would not become effective until Former Puma closed a capital 

&#160;

raising transaction in which it raised at least $25 million in aggregate net proceeds and had a net worth of at least $22.5 million. Upon the closing of the financing that preceded the Merger, this condition was satisfied. 

We assumed the license agreement, in accordance with its terms, in the Merger. The license is exclusive with respect to certain patent rights owned or licensed by Pfizer, or the Licensor. Under the license agreement, the Licensor is obligated to transfer to us certain information, records, regulatory filings, materials and inventory controlled by the Licensor and relating to or useful for developing these compounds and to continue to conduct certain ongoing clinical studies until a certain time. After that time, we are obligated to continue such studies pursuant to an approved development plan, including after the license agreement terminates for reasons unrelated to the Licensor&#8217;s breach of the license agreement, subject to certain specified exceptions. We are also obligated to commence a new clinical trial for a product containing one of these compounds within a specified period of time and use commercially reasonable efforts to complete such trial and achieve certain milestones as provided in a development plan. If certain of our out-of-pocket costs in completing such studies exceed a mutually agreed amount, the Licensor will pay for certain additional out-of-pocket costs to complete such studies. We must use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize products containing these compounds in specified major-market countries and other countries in which we believe it is commercially reasonable to develop and commercialize such products. 

As consideration for the license, we are required to make payments totaling $187.5 million upon the achievement of certain milestones if all such milestones are achieved. In addition, the license agreement originally stipulated that should we commercialize any of the compounds licensed from the Licensor or any products containing any of these compounds, we will be obligated to pay to the Licensor incremental annual royalties between approximately 10% and 20% of net sales of all such products, subject, in some circumstances, to certain reductions. 

In July 2014, the Company signed an amendment to the license agreement with the Licensor. The amendment to the license agreement provides that the Company would be solely responsible for the expenses incurred or accrued in conducting the ongoing legacy clinical trials after December 31, 2013. These costs were previously the responsibility of the Licensor.

In addition, under the amended agreement, annual royalties to be paid on net sales of licensed products were reduced from a tiered royalty rate structure ranging between 10% to 20% to a fixed rate in the low to mid-teens. The Licensor and the Company have agreed to continue to cooperate to effect the transfer to the Company of certain records, regulatory filings, materials and inventory controlled by the Licensor as promptly as reasonably practicable.

Our royalty obligation continues, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, until the later of (i) the last to expire valid claim of a licensed patent covering the applicable licensed product in such country, or (ii) the earlier of generic competition for such licensed product reaching a certain level of sales in such country or expiration of a certain time period after first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country. In the event that we sublicense the rights granted to us under the license agreement with the Licensor to a third party, the same milestone and royalty payments are required. We can terminate the license agreement at will at any time after April 4, 2013, or for safety concerns, in each case upon specified advance notice. Each party may terminate the license agreement if the other party fails to cure any breach of a material obligation by such other party within a specified time period. The Licensor may terminate the license agreement in the event of our bankruptcy, receivership, insolvency or similar proceeding. The license agreement contains other customary clauses and terms as are common in similar agreements in the industry. &#160; 

Government Regulation 

United States&#8212;FDA Process 

The research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution and marketing, among other things, of drug products are extensively regulated by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and its implementing regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements may subject us to administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs, warning letters, fines, civil penalties, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions and/or criminal prosecution. 

Drug Approval Process . None of our drug product candidates may be marketed in the United States until the drug has received FDA approval. The steps required before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally include the following: 

&#160;

&#9679; 

completion of extensive pre-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies in accordance with the FDA&#8217;s GLP regulations; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#9679; 

performance o f adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with GCP requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each proposed indication; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

submission to the FDA of an NDA after completion of all pivotal clinical trials; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, and finished drug product are produced and tested to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs; and 

&#160;

&#9679; 

FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States. 

The development and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. 

Pre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. The conduct of the pre-clinical tests and formulation of the compounds for testing must comply with federal regulations and requirements. The results of the pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the trial, such as whether human research subjects will be exposed to an unreasonable health risk. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed. We cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin. 

Clinical trials involve administration of the investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be provided to the FDA as part of a separate submission to the IND. Further, an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, for each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the study protocol and informed consent information for study subjects for any clinical trial before it commences at that center, and the IRB must monitor the study until it is completed. There are also requirements governing reporting of ongoing clinical trials and clinical trial results to public registries. Study subjects must sign an informed consent form before participating in a clinical trial. Clinical trials necessary for product approval typically are conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. Phase I usually involves the initial introduction of the investigational drug into a limited population, typically healthy humans, to evaluate its short-term safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism, pharmacokinetics and pharmacologic actions, and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. Phase II usually involves trials in a limited patient population to (i) evaluate dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage; (ii) identify possible adverse effects and safety risks; and (iii) evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the drug for specific targeted indications. Multiple Phase II clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase III clinical trials. Phase III trials, commonly referred to as pivotal studies, are undertaken in an expanded patient population at multiple, geographically dispersed clinical trial centers to further evaluate clinical efficacy and test further for safety by using the drug in its final form. There can be no assurance that Phase I, Phase II or Phase III testing will be completed successfully within any specified period of time, if at all. Furthermore, we, the FDA or an IRB may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Moreover, the FDA may approve an NDA for a product candidate, but require that the sponsor conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the drug after NDA approval under a post-approval commitment. Post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase IV clinical trials. &#160; 

During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given an opportunity to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase II, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach an agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the end of Phase II meeting to discuss their Phase II clinical results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase III clinical trial that they believe will support approval of the new drug. A sponsor may request an SPA to reach an agreement with the FDA that the protocol design, clinical endpoints, and statistical analyses are acceptable to support regulatory approval of the product candidate with respect to effectiveness in the indication studied. If such an agreement is reached, it will be documented and made part of the administrative record, and it will be binding on the FDA except in limited circumstances, such as if the FDA identifies a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or effectiveness of the product after clinical studies begin, or if the sponsor fails to follow the protocol that was agreed upon with the FDA. There is no guarantee that a study will ultimately be adequate to support an approval, even if the study is subject to an SPA. 

Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal safety studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the 

&#160;

drug candid ate and the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the quality, purity and potency of the final drugs. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate doe s not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 

Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of pre-clinical studies and of clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including information on the manufacture and composition of the drug, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. An NDA must be accompanied by a significant user fee, which is waived for the first NDA submitted by a qualifying small business. In July 2012, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, was signed into law. Among other things, FDASIA reauthorizes the FDA&#8217;s authority to collect user fees from industry participants to fund reviews of innovator drugs. 

The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources. The FDA will review the NDA and may deem it to be inadequate to support approval, and we cannot be sure that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. The FDA may also refer the application to the appropriate advisory committee, typically a panel of clinicians, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of the advisory committee, but it typically follows such recommendations. 

Before approving an NDA, the FDA inspects the facility or the facilities at which the drug and/or its active pharmaceutical ingredient is manufactured and will not approve the product unless the manufacturing is in compliance with cGMPs. If the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities are deemed acceptable, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or in some cases a Complete Response Letter. The approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the drug&#8217;s safety or efficacy, or impose other conditions. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or additional pivotal Phase III clinical trial(s), and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, pre-clinical studies or manufacturing. Even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data from clinical trials is not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we or our collaborators interpret data. Alternatively, the FDA could also approve the NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy to mitigate risks of the drug, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools. Once the FDA approves a drug, the FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems occur after the product reaches the market. In addition, the FDA may require testing, including Phase IV clinical trials, and surveillance programs to monitor the safety effects of approved products that have been commercialized. The FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs or other information. &#160; 

Expedited Review and Approval . The FDA has various programs, including fast track designation, priority review, accelerated approval, and breakthrough therapy designation, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing drugs and/or provide for approval on the basis of surrogate endpoints. Even if a drug qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the drug no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. Generally, drugs that may be eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs, and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. For example, fast track designation is designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and which demonstrate the potential to address an unmet medical need. Priority review is designed to give drugs for serious conditions that offer significant improvement in safety or effectiveness an initial review within six months as compared to a standard review time of 10 months. Although fast track designation and priority review do not affect the standards for approval, the FDA will attempt to facilitate early and frequent meetings with a sponsor of a fast track designated drug and expedite review of the application for a drug designated for priority review. The FDA may also initiate review of sections of an NDA before the application is complete for drugs with fast track designation. This &#8220;rolling review&#8221; is available if the applicant provides and the FDA approves a schedule for submission of portions of the application. Drugs for serious conditions are also eligible for accelerated approval, which provides an earlier approval of drugs, including fast track products, upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint, which is a laboratory measurement or physical sign used as an indirect or substitute measurement representing a clinically meaningful outcome, or an effect on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform post-marketing clinical trials. Finally, breakthrough therapy designation, which was enacted in FDASIA, is for drugs intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies receive all the benefits of a fast track designation, as well as intensive guidance on efficient drug development and organizational commitment 

&#160;

involving senior managers in the FDA. In June 2013, the FDA i ssued draft guidance on these expedited review and approval programs, providing the first available guidance for industry regarding the FDA&#8217;s implementation of the breakthrough therapy designation framework. We may seek to utilize one or more of these expe dited programs for our product candidates in the future, but even if we were to obtain fast track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and/or breakthrough therapy designation, there is no guarantee that it would result in a quicker review or approval of our products, if any. 

Post-Approval Requirements . After a drug has been approved by the FDA for sale, the FDA may require that certain post-approval requirements be satisfied, including the conduct of additional clinical studies. In addition, certain changes to an approved product, such as adding new indications, making certain manufacturing changes, or making certain additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. Before a company can market products for additional indications, it must obtain additional approvals from the FDA. Obtaining approval for a new indication generally requires that additional clinical studies be conducted. A company cannot be sure that any additional approval for new indications for any product candidate will be approved on a timely basis, or at all. 

If post-approval conditions are not satisfied, the FDA may withdraw its approval of the drug. In addition, holders of an approved NDA are required to (i) report certain adverse reactions to the FDA and maintain pharmacovigilance programs to proactively look for these adverse events; (ii) comply with certain requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for their products; and (iii) continue to have quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMPs after approval. The FDA periodically inspects the sponsor&#8217;s records related to safety reporting and/or manufacturing facilities; this latter effort includes assessment of ongoing compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. We intend to use third-party manufacturers to produce our products in clinical and commercial quantities, and future FDA inspections may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, including, among other things: 

&#160;

&#9679; 

restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;

&#160;

&#9679; 

fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;

&#160;

&#9679; 

refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of existing product approvals;

&#160;

&#9679; 

product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or

&#160;

&#9679; 

injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.

Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity . Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our drugs, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product&#8217;s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the extension must be requested prior to expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we intend to apply for restorations of patent term for some of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond their current expiration date, depending on the expected length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the submission of the relevant NDA. 

Data and market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent data exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or an NDA submitted under section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting 

&#160;

a full NDA would be required to conduct, or obtain a right of reference to a ll of the pre-clinical studies, adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. 

Foreign Regulation 

In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials and approval of foreign countries or economic areas, such as the EU, before we may market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. 

In the European Economic Area, or EEA, which is comprised of the 28 member states of the EU, or Member States, plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA. There are two types of MAs: 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Community MAs &#8211; These are issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the EMA, and are valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, and medicinal products indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA; for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation; or for products that are in the interest of public health in the EU. 

&#160;

&#9679; 

National MAs &#8211; These are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, and are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member State through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure, an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State. The competent authority of the Reference Member State prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics, or SmPC, and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Member States Concerned) for their approval. If the Member States Concerned raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SmPC, labeling or packaging proposed by the Reference Member State, the product is subsequently granted a National MA in all the Member States, i.e., in the Reference Member State and the Member States Concerned. 

Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA assess the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy. 

As in the United States, it may be possible in foreign countries to obtain a period of market and/or data exclusivity that would have the effect of postponing the entry into the marketplace of a competitor&#8217;s generic product. For example, if any of our products receive marketing approval in the EEA, we expect they will benefit from eight years of data exclusivity and 10 years of marketing exclusivity. An additional non-cumulative one-year period of marketing exclusivity is possible if during the data exclusivity period (the first eight years of the 10-year marketing exclusivity period), we obtain an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications that are deemed to bring a significant clinical benefit compared to existing therapies. The data exclusivity period begins on the date of the product&#8217;s first marketing authorization in the EEA and prevents generics from relying on the marketing authorization holder&#8217;s pharmacological, toxicological and clinical data for a period of eight years. After eight years, a generic product application may be submitted and generic companies may rely on the marketing authorization holder&#8217;s data. However, a generic cannot launch until two years later (or a total of 10 years after the first marketing authorization in the EU of the innovator product), or three years later (or a total of 11 years after the first marketing authorization in the EU of the innovator product) if the marketing authorization holder obtains marketing authorization for a new indication with significant clinical benefit within the eight-year data exclusivity period. In Japan, our products may be eligible for eight years of data exclusivity. There can be no assurance that we will qualify for such regulatory exclusivity, or that such exclusivity will prevent competitors from seeking approval solely on the basis of their own studies. 

When conducting clinical trials in the EU, we must adhere to the provisions of the European Union Clinical Trials Directive and the laws and regulations of the EU Member States implementing them. These provisions require, among other things, that the prior authorization of an Ethics Committee and the competent Member State authority is obtained before commencing the clinical trial. 

&#160;

Coverage and Reimbursement 

In the United States and internationally, sales of products that we market in the future, and our ability to generate revenues on such sales, are dependent, in significant part, on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, such as state and federal governments, managed care providers and private insurance plans. Private insurers, such as health maintenance organizations and managed care providers, have implemented cost-cutting and reimbursement initiatives and likely will continue to do so in the future. These include establishing formularies that govern the drugs and biologics that will be offered and the out-of-pocket obligations of member patients for such products. We may need to conduct pharmacoeconomic studies to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products for formulary coverage and reimbursement. Even with such studies, our products may be considered less safe, less effective or less cost-effective than existing products, and third-party payors may not provide coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates, in whole or in part. 

In addition, particularly in the United States and increasingly in other countries, we are required to provide discounts and pay rebates to state and federal governments and agencies in connection with purchases of our products that are reimbursed by such entities. It is possible that future legislation in the United States and other jurisdictions could be enacted to potentially impact reimbursement rates for the products we are developing and may develop in the future and could further impact the levels of discounts and rebates paid to federal and state government entities. Any legislation that impacts these areas could impact, in a significant way, our ability to generate revenues from sales of products that, if successfully developed, we bring to market. &#160; 

Political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry in the United States to fundamental changes. There have been, and we expect there will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could significantly affect our future business. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the ACA, enacted in March 2010, substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among other cost containment measures, ACA establishes: 

&#160;

&#9679; 

an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents;

In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation&#8217;s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, or the ATRA, which among other things, also reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 

In the future, there may continue to be additional proposals relating to the reform of the U.S. healthcare system. Future legislation, or regulatory actions implementing recent or future legislation may have a significant effect on our business. Our ability to successfully commercialize products depends in part on the extent to which reimbursement for the costs of our products and related treatments will be available in the United States and worldwide from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. The adoption of certain proposals could limit the prices we are able to charge for our products, the amounts of reimbursement available for our products, and limit the acceptance and availability of our products. Therefore, substantial uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products by third-party payors. 

Sales and Marketing 

The FDA regulates all advertising and promotion activities for products under its jurisdiction prior to and after approval, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, dissemination of off-label information, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, we may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new or supplemental NDA, which may require us to collect additional data or conduct additional pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. 

&#160;

Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements may subject a company to adverse publicity, enforcement action by the FDA, corrective advertising, consent decrees and the full range of civil and criminal penalties available to the FDA. 

Physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for uses that are not described in the drug&#8217;s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties, and often reflect a physician&#8217;s belief that the off-label use is the best treatment for the patient. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments, but FDA regulations do impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers&#8217; communications regarding off-label uses. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements may subject a company to adverse publicity, enforcement action by the FDA, corrective advertising, consent decrees and the full range of civil and criminal penalties available to the FDA. 

Outside the United States, our ability to market a product is contingent upon obtaining marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities. The requirements governing marketing authorization, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. &#160; 

Manufacturing 

We do not currently have our own manufacturing facilities. We intend to continue to use our financial resources to accelerate development of our drug candidates rather than diverting resources to establish our own manufacturing facilities. We intend to meet our pre-clinical and clinical trial manufacturing requirements by establishing relationships with third-party manufacturers and other service providers to perform these services for us. While our drug candidates were being developed by Pfizer, both the drug substance and drug product were manufactured by third-party contractors. We are currently using the same third-party contractors to manufacture, supply, store and distribute drug supplies for our clinical trials. We believe that we have manufactured sufficient quantities of the drug to support at least the first year of launch in the extended adjuvant breast cancer indication and plan to continue to manufacture the drug in 2016 to further support the commercial launch of the drug. 

Should any of our drug candidates obtain marketing approval, we anticipate establishing relationships with third-party manufacturers and other service providers in connection with commercial production of our products. We have some flexibility in securing other manufacturers to produce our drug candidates; however, our alternatives may be limited due to proprietary technologies or methods used in the manufacture of some of our drug candidates. 

Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws 

We may also be subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to health care &#8220;fraud and abuse,&#8221; including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. Anti-kickback laws make it illegal for a prescription drug manufacturer to solicit, offer, receive, or pay any remuneration in exchange for, or to induce, the referral of business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug. Due to the breadth of the statutory provisions and the absence of guidance in the form of regulations and very few court decisions addressing industry practices, it is possible that our practices might be challenged under anti-kickback or similar laws. False claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to third-party payors (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. In addition, some state prohibitions apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Our activities relating to the sales and marketing of our products may be subject to scrutiny under any of these laws. 

Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, the possibility of exclusion from federal health care programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) and corporate integrity agreements, which impose, among other things, rigorous operational and monitoring requirements on companies. Similar sanctions and penalties also may be imposed upon executive officers and employees, including criminal sanctions against executive officers under the so-called &#8220;responsible corporate officer&#8221; doctrine, even in situations where the executive officer did not intend to violate the law and was unaware of any wrongdoing. Given the penalties that may be imposed on companies and individuals if convicted, allegations of such violations often result in settlements even if the company or individual being investigated admits no wrongdoing. Settlements often include significant civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, and corporate integrity agreements. If the government were to allege or determine that we or our executive officers had violated these laws, our business could be harmed. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring similar actions. 

Further, there are new federal requirements under ACA and an increasing number of state laws that require manufacturers to disclose and make reports to the government of any &#8220;transfer of value&#8221; made or distributed to physicians, teaching hospitals and other healthcare providers. Many of these laws contain ambiguities as to what is required to comply with the laws. Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, our future reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the applicable state and/or federal authorities. 

&#160;

Our activities could be subject to challenge for the reasons discussed above due to the breadth of these laws and the increasing attention being given to them by law enforcement authorities. The costs of defending such claims, as wel l as any sanctions imposed or negative public perceptions resulting therefrom, could require us to restructure our operations and have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. 

Other Laws and Regulatory Processes 

We are subject to a variety of financial disclosure and securities trading regulations as a public company in the United States with securities traded on the New York Stock Exchange, or the NYSE, including laws relating to the oversight activities of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, and the rules and regulations of the NYSE. In addition, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, the SEC, and other bodies that have jurisdiction over the form and content of our accounts, our financial statements and other public disclosure are constantly discussing and interpreting proposals and existing pronouncements designed to ensure that companies best display relevant and transparent information relating to their respective businesses. &#160; 

Our present and future business has been and will continue to be subject to various other laws and regulations. Various laws, regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory practices, experimental use of animals, and the purchase, storage, movement, import and export, and use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances used in connection with our research work are or may be applicable to our activities. Certain agreements entered into by us involving exclusive license rights or acquisitions may be subject to national or supranational antitrust regulatory control, the effect of which cannot be predicted. The extent of government regulation that might result from future legislation or administrative action cannot accurately be predicted. 

Research and Development Expenses 

Research and development activities, which include personnel costs, research supplies, clinical and pre-clinical study costs, are the primary source of our overall expenses. Such expenses related to the research and development of our product candidates totaled $208.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, $122.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $45.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 156 employees, all of whom are full-time employees. We believe our relations with our employees are good. Over the course of the next year, we anticipate hiring up to 14 additional full-time employees devoted to clinical activities, seven additional full-time employees for the regulatory and quality assurance function, five additional full-time employees for logistics and distribution and one additional full-time employee for general and administrative activities. In addition, we intend to continue to use CROs and third parties to perform our clinical studies and manufacturing.

We were originally incorporated in the State of Delaware in April 2007 under the name Innovative Acquisitions Corp. We were a &#8220;shell&#8221; company registered under the Exchange Act with no specific business plan or purpose until we acquired Former Puma in the Merger. As a result of this transaction, Former Puma become our wholly-owned subsidiary and subsequently merged with and into us, at which time we adopted Former Puma&#8217;s business plan and changed our name to &#8220;Puma Biotechnology, Inc.&#8221; 

The Merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition whereby Former Puma was deemed to be the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes and we were deemed to be the acquired party. Consequently, our financial statements prior to the Merger reflect the assets and liabilities and the historical operations of Former Puma from its inception on September 15, 2010, through the closing of the Merger on October 4, 2011. Our financial statements after completion of the Merger include the assets and liabilities of us and Former Puma, the historical operations of Former Puma, and the operations of us following the closing date of the Merger. 

&#160;

The merger of a private operating company into a non-operating public shell corporation with nominal net a ssets is considered to be a capital transaction, in substance, rather than a business combination, for accounting purposes. Accordingly, we treated this transaction as a capital transaction without recording goodwill or adjusting any of our other assets or liabilities. 

In November 2012, we established and incorporated Puma Biotechnology Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary, for the sole purpose of serving as our legal representative in the United Kingdom and the European Union in connection with our clinical trial activity in those countries.
