Crown Equity Holdings Inc. formerly known as Micro Bio-Medical Waste Systems, Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated on August 31, 1995 as "Visioneering Corporation" under the laws of the State of Nevada. 

&#160;

In 2007, the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, Crown Trading Systems, Inc. ("CTS"), a Nevada corporation, began to develop, sell and produce computer systems which are capable of running multiple monitors from one computer. 

&#160;

In 2009, Crown Trading Systems was dissolved as a corporation and its business was absorbed into the Company. The Company still uses the trade name "Crown Trading Systems." CTS has reseller and distribution agreements with many wholesale and retail computer and components companies but is not presenting engaged in this business due to the lack of demand at the present time. The Company may re-enter this field once the economy rebounds. 

&#160;

In December, 2010, the Company formed two wholly owned subsidiaries Crown Tele Services, Inc. and CRWE Direct Inc. Crown Tele Services Inc. was formed to provide voice over internet services to clients at a competitive price, CRWE Direct Inc. was formed to provide direct sales to customers. Both entities had minimum sales during the year. 

&#160;

The Company markets its services to companies seeking market awareness of them and the services or goods that they offer.
