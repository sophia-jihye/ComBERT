Company Overview 

We are a renewable chemicals and next generation biofuels company. We have developed proprietary technology that uses a combination of synthetic biology, metabolic engineering, chemistry and chemical engineering to focus primarily on the production of isobutanol, as well as related products from renewable feedstocks. Isobutanol is a four-carbon alcohol that can be sold directly for use as a specialty chemical in the production of solvents, paints and coatings or as a value-added gasoline blendstock. Isobutanol can also be converted into butenes using dehydration chemistry deployed in the refining and petrochemicals industries today. The convertibility of isobutanol into butenes is important because butenes are primary hydrocarbon building blocks used in the production of hydrocarbon fuels, lubricants, polyester, rubber, plastics, fibers and other polymers. We believe that the products derived from isobutanol have potential applications in substantially all of the global hydrocarbon fuels markets and in approximately 40% of the global petrochemicals markets. 

In order to produce and sell isobutanol made from renewable sources, we have developed the Gevo Integrated Fermentation Technology &#174; (&#8220;GIFT &#174; &#8221;), an integrated technology platform for the efficient production and separation of renewable isobutanol. GIFT &#174; consists of two components, proprietary biocatalysts that convert sugars derived from multiple renewable feedstocks into isobutanol through fermentation, and a proprietary separation unit that is designed to continuously separate isobutanol during the fermentation process. We developed our technology platform to be compatible with the existing approximately 25 billion gallons per year (&#8220;BGPY&#8221;) of global operating ethanol production capacity, as estimated by the Renewable Fuels Association.

GIFT &#174; is designed to permit (i) the retrofit of existing ethanol capacity to produce isobutanol, ethanol or both products simultaneously or (ii) the addition of renewable isobutanol or ethanol production capabilities to a facility&#8217;s existing ethanol production by adding additional fermentation capacity side-by-side with the facility&#8217;s existing ethanol fermentation capacity (collectively referred to as &#8220;Retrofit&#8221;). Having the flexibility to switch between the production of isobutanol and ethanol, or produce both products simultaneously, should allow us to optimize asset utilization and cash flows at a facility by taking advantage of fluctuations in market conditions. GIFT &#174; is also designed to allow relatively low capital expenditure Retrofits of existing ethanol facilities, enabling a relatively rapid route to isobutanol production from the fermentation of renewable feedstocks. We believe that our production route will be cost-efficient, will enable relatively rapid deployment of our technology platform and allow our isobutanol and related renewable products to be economically competitive with many of the petroleum-based products used in the chemicals and fuels markets today. 

Our Strategy 

Our strategy is to commercialize our isobutanol for use directly as a specialty chemical and fuel blendstock and for conversion into plastics, fibers, polyester, rubber, other polymers and hydrocarbon fuels. Key elements of our strategy include: 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Successfully deploy our isobutanol technology at commercial scale at our production facility in Luverne, Minnesota. 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Build on existing agreements with customers to support capacity growth . 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Expand our production capacity via Retrofit of additional existing ethanol facilities with an emphasis on licensing . 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Expand adoption of our isobutanol across multiple applications and markets . 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Align the value chain for our isobutanol by collaborating with large brand owners and customers in particular as it relates to hydrocarbon fuels and chemicals. 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Incorporate additional feedstocks into our isobutanol production facilities . 

Our Retrofit Strategy

We plan to commercialize our isobutanol through a strategy of Retrofitting existing ethanol production facilities to produce isobutanol and related renewable products and have developed our technology platform to be compatible with the existing approximately 25 BGPY of global operating ethanol production capacity. We believe that our design will enable a switch between the production of isobutanol and ethanol, or the ability to produce both products simultaneously, which will allow optimization of asset utilization and cash flows at a facility by taking advantage of fluctuations in market conditions.

&#160;

The Retrofit approach allows us to project potentiall y lower capital outlays and a faster commercial deployment schedule than the construction of new plants. We believe the ability of GIFT &#174; to convert sugars from multiple renewable feedstocks into isobutanol will enable us to leverage the abundant domestic s ources of historically low cost grain feedstocks (e.g., corn) currently used for ethanol production and will potentially enable the expansion of our production capacity into international markets that use sugar cane or other feedstocks that are prevalent o utside of the U.S. 

We plan to secure access to existing ethanol production facilities through joint ventures, licensing arrangements, tolling partnerships and direct acquisitions. We then plan to work with design, engineering, and construction partners to deploy GIFT &#174; through Retrofit of these production facilities. 

Our Retrofit at the Agri-Energy Facility

In September 2010, we acquired a 22 million gallon per year (&#8220;MGPY&#8221;) ethanol production facility in Luverne, Minnesota (the &#8220;Agri-Energy Facility&#8221;). The Agri-Energy Facility is a traditional dry-mill facility, which means that it uses dry-milled corn as a feedstock. In partnership with ICM, Inc. (&#8220;ICM&#8221;), we developed a detailed Retrofit design for this facility and began the Retrofit in 2011. In May 2012, we commenced initial startup operations for the production of isobutanol at the Agri-Energy Facility. In September 2012, as a result of a lower than planned production rate of isobutanol, we made the strategic decision to pause isobutanol production at the Agri-Energy Facility at the conclusion of startup operations to focus on optimizing specific parts of the process to further enhance isobutanol production rates. 

In 2013, we made modifications to our Agri-Energy Facility designed to increase the isobutanol production rate. In June 2013, we resumed the limited production of isobutanol, operating one fermenter and one GIFT &#174; separation system in order to (i) verify that the modifications had significantly reduced the previously identified infections, (ii) demonstrate that our biocatalyst performs in the one million liter fermenters at the Agri-Energy Facility, and (iii) confirm GIFT &#174; efficacy at commercial scale at the Agri-Energy Facility. In August 2013, we expanded production capacity at the Agri-Energy Facility by adding a second fermenter and second GIFT &#174; system to further verify our results with a second configuration of equipment. For these initial production runs, we demonstrated fermentation operations at commercial scale combined with the use of our GIFT &#174; separation system using a dextrose (sugar) feedstock. Based on the results of these initial production runs, in October 2013 we began commissioning the Agri-Energy Facility on corn mash to test isobutanol production run rates and to optimize biocatalyst production, fermentation separation and water management systems. 

In March 2014, we decided to leverage the flexibility of our GIFT &#174; technology and further modify the Agri-Energy Facility in order to enable the simultaneous production of isobutanol and ethanol. In July 2014, we began more consistent co-production of isobutanol and ethanol at the Agri-Energy Facility, with one fermenter utilized for isobutanol production and three fermenters utilized for ethanol production.

In September 2015, we began deploying additional capital at our Agri-Energy Facility, primarily designed to decrease the cost of production for isobutanol by bringing parts of the process to the facility that have previously been done off-site by third parties. Key equipment being installed at the plant include a distillation system to purify isobutanol on site, an addition to our seed train to improve our ability to grow our yeast on site and a stainless steel fermenter to replace one of the existing carbon steel fermenters that had reached the end of its useful life. The installation of this equipment is expected to decrease our cost of production of isobutanol, with a goal of producing isobutanol at our Agri-Energy Facility at a positive contribution margin in 2016. These capital projects are anticipated to be completed in the first or second quarter of 2016.

Through December 31, 2015, we have incurred capital costs of approximately $65.5 million on the Retrofit of the Agri-Energy Facility. The Retrofit of the Agri-Energy Facility includes a number of additional capital costs that are unique to the design of the facility, including additional equipment that we believe will allow us to switch between ethanol and isobutanol production, modifications to increase the potential production capacity of GIFT &#174; at this facility and the establishment of an enhanced yeast seed train to accelerate the adoption of improved yeast strains at this facility and at future plants. Capital expenditures at the Agri-Energy Facility also include upfront design and engineering costs, plant modifications identified as necessary during initial startup operations for the production of isobutanol and capitalized interest. 

Until May 2012, when we commenced initial Retrofit startup operations for the production of isobutanol at the Agri-Energy Facility, we derived revenue from the sale of ethanol, distiller&#8217;s grains and other related products produced as part of the ethanol production process at the Agri-Energy Facility. Continued ethanol production during the Retrofit process allowed us to retain local staff for the future operation of the plant, maintain the equipment and generate cash flow. Our Retrofit strategy includes the ability to switch between the production of isobutanol and ethanol, or produce both products simultaneously, with an emphasis on maximizing cash flows at a site. In the past we have been able to switch between the production of isobutanol and ethanol at the Agri-Energy Facility. In the future, we believe that we will be able to transition between the production and sale of ethanol and related products at the Agri-Energy Facility, in whole or in part, if we were to project positive cash flows from ethanol operations versus maintaining the 

&#160;

facility at idle or producing isobutanol, including any costs related to the transition, but there is no guarantee that this will be the case. As a result, the historical operating results of our subsidiary, Agri-Energy, LLC (&#8220;Agri-Energy&#8221;), and the operating results reported during the Retrofit to isobutanol production may not be indicative of future operating results for Agri-Energy or Gevo&#8217;s consolidated resu lts. The future return on our invested capital depends on our ability to maximize cash flows from the Retrofit of the Agri-Energy Facility. 

Third Party Retrofit and Construction Activities

We have commenced a licensing strategy whereby a licensee would invest the capital for the Retrofit of its own ethanol plant or for a new greenfield build out of an isobutanol-producing plant. In return, we, as the licensor, would expect to receive an up-front license fee and ongoing royalty payments from the project, as well as other potential revenue streams such as yeast sales.

In January 2016, we entered into a license agreement and joint development agreement with Porta Hnos. S.A. (&#8220;Porta&#8221;) to construct multiple isobutanol plants in Argentina using corn as a feedstock, the first of which is expected to be wholly owned by Porta and is anticipated to begin producing isobutanol in 2017. The plant is expected to have a production capacity of up to five million gallons of isobutanol per year. Once the plant is operational, we expect to generate revenues from this licensing arrangement, through royalties, sales and marketing fees, and other revenue streams such as yeast sales. The agreements also contemplate Porta constructing at least three additional isobutanol plants for certain of their existing ethanol plant customers. For these projects, we would be the direct licensor of our technology and the marketer for any isobutanol produced, and would expect to receive all royalties and sales and marketing fees generated from these projects. Porta would provide the engineering, procurement and construction (&#8220;EPC&#8221;) services for the projects. The production capacity of these additional plants is still to be determined. Porta is a leading supplier of EPC services to the ethanol industry in South America. As a result, we believe that our alliance with Porta will allow us to more quickly achieve commercial-scale production of isobutanol in Argentina and potentially elsewhere in South America.

In November 2015, we entered into a joint development agreement with Praj Industries Limited (&#8220;Praj&#8221;), which establishes a strategic relationship to: (i) jointly develop our technology for use in certain ethanol plants that utilize certain non-corn based feedstocks (the &#8220;Feedstock&#8221;); (ii) jointly develop an engineering package for greenfield isobutanol plants and Retrofitting ethanol plants to produce renewable isobutanol from the Feedstock; and (iii) license our technology to build greenfield isobutanol plants and Retrofit certain ethanol plants to produce isobutanol. We and Praj will jointly develop and optimize the parameters to produce isobutanol from the Feedstock. After the development work is completed, we will negotiate commercial license agreements with Praj and third party licensees. Praj has the exclusive right to supply equipment and process engineering services for (i) certain greenfield isobutanol plants covered by the joint development agreement and (ii) the addition of isobutanol capacity for certain ethanol plants that utilize the Feedstock and Praj technology. Praj agreed to meet certain milestones to maintain its exclusive rights. We will negotiate and license our technology for producing isobutanol directly with the ethanol plants covered by the joint development agreement and will also have the right to supply biocatalysts, nutrient packages, and support services to such plants. Praj will be the EPC services supplier for the ethanol plants covered by the joint development agreement and we will be the exclusive seller of all isobutanol produced by such plants. We believe that our alliance with Praj will allow us to more quickly achieve commercial-scale production of isobutanol derived from the Feedstock outside of the United States. 

In addition, in October 2013, we signed a letter of intent with IGPC Ethanol Inc. to Retrofit its approximately 40 MGPY ethanol plant, and in November 2014, we signed a letter of intent with Highlands EnviroFuels, LLC which contemplates Highlands EnviroFuels, LLC obtaining a license from us to produce renewable isobutanol at a plant that would be bolted on to the back-end of a sugar cane and sweet sorghum syrup mill and have a nameplate capacity of approximately 20 to 25 MGPY of isobutanol. 

In June 2011, we entered into an isobutanol joint venture agreement with Redfield Energy, LLC, a South Dakota limited liability company (&#8220;Redfield&#8221;), under which we have agreed to work with Redfield to Retrofit Redfield&#8217;s approximately 50 MGPY ethanol production facility located near Redfield, South Dakota (the &#8220;Redfield Facility&#8221;) for the commercial production of isobutanol. Under the terms of the joint venture agreement, we are responsible for all costs associated with the Retrofit of the Redfield Facility. We are entitled to a percentage of Redfield&#8217;s profits, losses and distributions after commercial production of isobutanol has begun. As of December 31, 2015, we have incurred $0.4 million in planning-related costs, such as project engineering and permitting costs, for the future Retrofit of the Redfield Facility. Based on our preliminary engineering estimates, we will need to raise additional debt or equity capital to Retrofit the Redfield Facility, but are not obligated to do so under the Joint Venture Agreement. There are no assurances that we will move forward with the Retrofit of the Redfield Facility. We do not expect to advance this project during 2016.

Butamax Advanced Biofuels LLC

Cross License Agreement

On August 22, 2015, we entered into a Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release (the &#8220;Settlement Agreement&#8221;) with Butamax Advanced Biofuels LLC (&#8220;Butamax&#8221;), E.I. du Pont de Nemours &#38; Company (&#8220;DuPont&#8221;) and BP Biofuels North America LLC (&#8220;BP&#8221; 

&#160;

and, together wi th Butamax and DuPont, the &#8220;Butamax Parties&#8221;), that resolves the various disputes, lawsuits and other proceedings between one or more of the Butamax Parties and us, as previously disclosed and as specifically identified in the Settlement Agreement (the &#8220;Su bject Litigation&#8221;), and creates a new business relationship pursuant to which Butamax and we have granted rights to each other under certain patents and patent applications in accordance with the terms of a Patent Cross-License Agreement (the &#8220;License Agre ement&#8221;) which was entered into by us and Butamax concurrently with the Settlement Agreement, as described in detail below. For more information concerning the Settlement Agreement, please see Item 3. Legal Proceedings . 

Pursuant to the terms of the License Agreement, each party receives a non-exclusive license under certain patents and patent applications owned or licensed (and sublicensable) by the other party for the production and use of biocatalysts in the manufacture of isobutanol using certain production process technology for the separation of isobutanol, and to manufacture and sell such isobutanol in any fields relating to the production or use of isobutanol and isobutanol derivatives, subject to the customer-facing field restrictions described below. Each party also receives a non-exclusive license to perform research and development on biocatalysts for the production, recovery and use of isobutanol.

Each party may produce and sell up to 30 million gallons of isobutanol per year in any field on a royalty-free basis. Butamax will be the primary customer-facing seller of isobutanol in the field of fuel blending (subject to certain exceptions, the &#8220;Direct Fuel Blending&#8221; field) and we will be the primary customer-facing seller of isobutanol in the field of jet fuel for use in aviation gas turbines (the &#8220;Jet&#8221; field, also subject to certain exceptions). As such, subject to each party&#8217;s right to sell up to 30 million gallons of isobutanol per year in any field on a royalty-free basis, other than with Butamax&#8217;s written consent, we will only sell isobutanol through Butamax in the Direct Fuel Blending field subject to a royalty based on the net sales price for each gallon of isobutanol sold or transferred by us, our affiliates or sublicensees within the Direct Fuel Blending field (whether through Butamax or not) and on commercially reasonable terms to be negotiated between the parties and Butamax will only sell isobutanol through us in the Jet field subject to a royalty based on the net sales price for each gallon of isobutanol sold or transferred by Butamax, its affiliates or sublicensees within the Jet field (whether through us or not) and on commercially reasonable terms to be negotiated between the parties; provided, that each party may sell up to fifteen million gallons of isobutanol in a given year directly to customers in the other party&#8217;s customer-facing field on a royalty-free basis so long as the isobutanol volumes are within the permitted 30 million gallons of isobutanol sold or otherwise transferred per year in any field described above and, in certain instances, each party may then sell up to the total permitted 30 million gallons per year in the other party&#8217;s customer-facing field on a royalty-free basis. In addition, in order to maintain its status as the primary customer-facing seller in these specific fields, each party must meet certain milestones within the first five years of the License Agreement. If such milestones are not met as determined by an arbitration panel, then a party will have the right to sell directly to customers in the other party&#8217;s customer-facing field subject to the payment of certain royalties to the other party on such sales.

In addition to the royalties discussed above for sales of isobutanol in the Direct Fuel Blending field, and subject to our right to sell up to 30 million gallons of isobutanol per year in any field on a royalty-free basis, we will pay to Butamax a royalty per gallon of isobutanol sold or transferred by us, our affiliates or sublicensees within the field of isobutylene (a derivative of isobutanol) applications (other than isobutylene for paraxylene, isooctane, Jet, diesel and oligomerized isobutylene applications). Likewise, in addition to the royalties discussed above for sales of isobutanol in the Jet field, and subject to Butamax&#8217;s right to sell up to 30 million gallons of isobutanol per year in any field on a royalty-free basis, Butamax will pay to us a royalty per gallon of isobutanol sold or transferred by Butamax, its affiliates or sublicensees within the fields of marine gasoline, retail packaged fuels and paraxylene (except for gasoline blending that results in use in marine or other fuel applications). The royalties described above will be due only once for any volume of isobutanol sold or transferred under the License Agreement, and such royalties accrue when such volume of isobutanol is distributed for end use in the particular royalty-bearing field. All sales of isobutanol in other fields will be royalty-free, subject to the potential technology fee described below. 

In the event that we, our affiliates or sublicensees choose to employ a certain solids separation technology for the production of isobutanol at one of their respective plants (&#8220;Solids Separation Technology&#8221;), we are granted an option to license such technology from Butamax on a non-exclusive basis subject to the payment of a one-time technology license fee based on the rated isobutanol capacity for each such plant (subject to additional fees upon expansion of such capacity). We also receive the option to obtain an engineering package from Butamax to implement the Solids Separation Technology on commercially reasonable terms to be negotiated between the parties and subject to the technology fee described above and an additional technology licensing fee for use of the Solids Separation Technology applicable to ethanol capacity as provided in such engineering package from Butamax (which capacity is not duplicative of the rated isobutanol capacity referenced above) in instances where Butamax provides an engineering package for use at a particular plant that will run isobutanol and ethanol production side-by-side using the licensed Solids Separation Technology at such plant.

The License Agreement encompasses both parties&#8217; patents for producing isobutanol, including biocatalysts and separation technologies, as well as for producing hydrocarbon products derived from isobutanol, including certain improvements and new patent applications filed within seven years of the date of the License Agreement. While the parties have cross-licensed their patents for making and using isobutanol, the parties will not share their own proprietary biocatalysts with each other. The parties may use third 

&#160;

parties to manufacture biocatalysts on their behalf and may licen se their respective technology packages for the production of isobutanol to third parties, subject to certain restrictions. A third party licensee would be granted a sub-license, and would be subject to terms and conditions that are consistent with those u nder the License Agreement. 

Under the License Agreement, the parties have also agreed to certain limitations on the making or participating in a challenge of the other party&#8217;s patents that are at issue in the Subject Litigation. The parties have also made certain representations, warranties and covenants to each other including, without limitation, with respect to obtaining certain consents, indebtedness, rights in the licensed patents, and relationships with certain other ethanol plant process technology providers.

The License Agreement will continue in effect until the expiration of the licensed patents, unless earlier terminated by a party as provided in the License Agreement. The parties also have certain termination rights with respect to the term of the license granted to the other party under the License Agreement upon the occurrence of, among other things, a material uncured breach by the other party. In the event that a party&#8217;s license is terminated under the License Agreement, such party&#8217;s sublicense agreements may be assigned to the other party, subject to certain restrictions.

The parties may not assign the License Agreement or any right or obligation thereunder without the prior written consent of the other party. However, the parties may assign the License Agreement to an affiliate or a person that acquires all of the business or assets of such party, subject to certain restrictions.

Isobutanol Direct Use Markets 

Without modification, isobutanol has applications in the specialty chemical and gasoline blendstock markets. Since our potential customers in these markets would not be required to develop any additional infrastructure to use our isobutanol, we believe that selling into these markets will result in a relatively low risk profile and produce attractive margins. 

Specialty Chemicals 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Isobutanol has direct applications as a specialty chemical. High-purity and chemical-grade isobutanol can be used as a solvent and chemical intermediate. We plan to produce high-purity and chemical-grade isobutanol that can be used in the existing butanol markets as a cost-effective, environmentally sensitive alternative to petroleum-based products. 

&#160;

&#9679; 

We believe that our production route will be cost-efficient and will allow for significant expansion of the historical isobutanol markets within existing butanol markets through displacing n-butanol, a related compound to isobutanol that is currently sold into butanol markets. 

&#160;

&#9679; 

We estimate the total addressable worldwide market for isobutanol as a specialty chemical to be approximately 1.2 BGPY. 

Gasoline Blendstocks 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Isobutanol has direct applications as a gasoline blendstock. Fuel-grade isobutanol may be used as a high energy content, low Reid Vapor Pressure (&#8220;RVP&#8221;), gasoline blendstock and oxygenate. Based on isobutanol&#8217;s low water solubility, in contrast with ethanol, we believe that isobutanol will be compatible with existing refinery infrastructure, allowing for blending at the refinery rather than blending at the terminal. 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Further, based on isobutanol&#8217;s high energy content and low water solubility, as well as testing completed by the National Marine Manufacturers Association, the Outdoor Power Equipment Institute and Briggs &#38; Stratton, we believe that isobutanol has direct applications as a blendstock in high value specialty fuels markets serving marine, off-road vehicles, small engine and sports vehicle markets. 

&#160;

&#9679; 

We estimate the total addressable worldwide market for isobutanol as a gasoline blendstock to be approximately 41 BGPY. 

Butene and Hydrocarbon Markets Derived from Isobutanol

Beyond direct use as a specialty chemical and gasoline blendstock, isobutanol can be dehydrated to produce butenes which can then be converted into other products such as para-xylene, jet fuel and many other hydrocarbon fuels and specialty blendstocks, offering substantial potential for additional demand. The conversion of isobutanol into butenes is a fundamentally important process that enables isobutanol to be used as a building block chemical in multiple markets. 

&#160;

Jet Fuel 

&#160;

&#9679; 

We have demonstrated the conversion of our isobutanol into a renewable jet fuel blendstock that meets current ASTM International (&#8220;ASTM&#8221;) and U.S. military synthetic jet fuel blendstock performance and purity requirements. We have successfully delivered to the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Army and the U.S. Navy a combined total of approximately 90,000 gallons of jet fuel made from isobutanol. We are working to obtain an ASTM standard specification for the use of such jet fuel blendstock in commercial aviation. We have completed a comprehensive research report and had it reviewed by the ASTM Alternative Jet Fuel Task Force and OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturers) in the Airframe and Jet Engine Industries. From this data set we have drafted an annex to ASTM specification D7566 for alternative jet fuel and are seeking approval from ASTM. We expect to receive ASTM approval in 2016. If such approval is received this would allow our renewable jet fuel to be used as a blending component in standard Jet A-1 for commercial airline use in the United States and around the globe.

&#160;

&#9679; 

Military and commercial airlines are currently looking to form strategic alliances with biofuels companies to meet their renewable fuel needs. 

&#160;

&#9679; 

We estimate the global market for jet fuel to be approximately 83 BGPY.

Para-xylene (&#8220;PX&#8221;) and Polyethylene Terephthalate (&#8220;PET&#8221;) 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Isobutanol can be used to produce PX, polyester and their derivatives, which are used in the beverage, food packaging, textile and fibers markets. PX is a key raw material in PET production. 

&#160;

&#9679; 

We estimate the global market for PET to be approximately 50 million metric tons per year of which approximately 30% is used for plastic bottles and containers. We have demonstrated the conversion of our isobutanol into renewable PX at the demonstration plant in Silsbee, TX. This demonstration plant produced renewable PX from October 2013 through March 2014, and, in May 2014, we shipped renewable PX to Toray Industries, Inc. (&#8220;Toray Industries&#8221;) under the terms of a supply agreement.

Butenes 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Traditionally butenes have been produced as co-products from the process of cracking naphtha in the production of ethylene. Historically, lower natural gas prices and reported reductions in the use of naphtha as the feedstock for the production of ethylene have resulted in a projected reduction in the volume of available butenes . This structural shift in feedstocks increases the potential market opportunity for our isobutanol in the production of butenes. 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Isobutanol can be sold to isobutylene and n-butene (butenes) chemicals users for conversion into lubricants, methyl methacrylate and rubber applications. 

&#160;

&#9679; 

We estimate the total addressable worldwide market for butenes to be approximately 2.1 BGPY.

Other Hydrocarbon Fuels 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Diesel fuel, gasoline, isooctane, isooctene and bunker fuel may also be produced from our isobutanol. We have demonstrated the conversion of isobutanol to isooctane, isooctene and renewable gasoline. Renewable hydrocarbons such as isooctane, isooctene and renewable gasoline can directly replace petroleum-based hydrocarbons without any compromise of performance. The use of these renewable hydrocarbons enables companies to meet regulatory requirements for renewable content in fuels while satisfying the performance requirements of their customers. We have also converted isobutanol to kerosene with properties that we expect may be fit for diesel blending applications. 

Our Production Technology Platform 

We have used tools from synthetic biology, biotechnology and process engineering to develop a proprietary fermentation and separation process to cost effectively produce isobutanol from renewable feedstocks. GIFT &#174; is designed to allow for relatively low capital expenditure Retrofits of existing ethanol facilities, enabling a rapid route to isobutanol production from the fermentation of renewable feedstocks, while maintaining the flexibility to revert to the production of ethanol or the simultaneous production of isobutanol and ethanol. GIFT &#174; isobutanol production is very similar to existing ethanol production, except that we replace the ethanol producing biocatalyst with our isobutanol producing biocatalyst and we incorporate well-known equipment into the production process to separate and collect the isobutanol during the fermentation process. We believe that reusing large parts of the ethanol plant without modification is beneficial because the unchanged parts will stay in place and continue to operate after the Retrofit as they did when ethanol was produced. This means that the existing operating staff can continue to manage the production of isobutanol because they will already have experience with the base equipment. We believe this continuity will reduce the risks associated with the 

&#160;

production startup following the Retrofit as most of the process is unchanged and the existing operating staff is available to monitor and manage the production process. In addition, we believe that our GIFT &#174; design will enable us to switch between the production of isobutanol and ethanol, or produce both products simultaneously, which will allow us to optimize asset utilization and cash flows at a facility by taking advantage of fluctuations in market conditions. 

We intend to process the spent grain mash from our fermenters to produce isobutanol distiller&#8217;s grains (&#8220;iDGs&#8482;&#8221;), relying on established processes in the current ethanol industry. We plan to market our iDGs&#8482; to the dairy, beef, swine and poultry industries as a high-protein, high-energy animal feed. To support these efforts, in December 2011 we entered into an exclusive off-take and marketing agreement with Land O&#8217;Lakes Purina Feed for the sale of iDGs&#8482; produced at the Agri-Energy Facility. We believe that our sales of our iDGs&#8482; will allow us and our partners to offset a significant portion of our grain feedstock costs, in the same manner as is practiced by the corn-based ethanol industry today through the sale of dry distiller&#8217;s grains. 

Biocatalyst Overview 

Our biocatalysts are microorganisms that have been designed to metabolize sugars to produce isobutanol. Our technology team developed these proprietary biocatalysts to efficiently convert fermentable sugars of all types into isobutanol by engineering isobutanol pathways into the biocatalysts. We designed our biocatalysts to equal or exceed the performance of the yeast currently used in commercial ethanol production in yield (percentage of the theoretical maximum percentage of isobutanol that can be made from a given amount of feedstock) and rate (how fast the sugar fed to the fermentation is converted to isobutanol). We initially achieved our target fermentation performance goals with our research biocatalyst at our GIFT &#174; mini-plant and then replicated this performance in a retrofitted one MGPY ethanol demonstration facility located at ICM&#8217;s St. Joseph, Missouri site. We select biocatalysts for their projected performance in the GIFT &#174; process, targeting lower cost isobutanol production. We continue to seek to improve the performance parameters of our biocatalyst with a goal of reducing projected capital and operating costs, increasing operating reliability and increasing the volume of isobutanol production. 

Continuous improvement of biocatalyst performance is achieved using a variety of synthetic biology and conventional biotechnology tools to minimize the production of unwanted by-products to improve isobutanol yield and rate, thereby reducing capital and operating costs. With our biocatalysts, we have demonstrated that we can produce isobutanol at commercial scale with rates and yields which we believe validate our biotechnology pathways and efficiencies. Our commercial biocatalyst is designed to produce isobutanol from common commercial fermentation ethanol feedstocks, including grains (e.g., corn, wheat, sorghum and barley), sugar cane, and molasses. This feedstock flexibility supports our initial deployment in the U.S. and is designed to enable our future expansion into international markets for production of isobutanol. 

Although development work continues, we have shown at laboratory scale and at our one MGPY demonstration facility located at ICM&#8217;s St. Joseph, Missouri facility that we can convert hydrolyzed wood feedstocks into isobutanol. We are further improving biocatalysts to efficiently produce isobutanol from cellulosic feedstocks, including crops that are specifically cultivated to be converted into fuels (e.g., switchgrass), forest residues (e.g., waste wood, pulp and sustainable wood), agricultural residues (e.g., corn stalks, leaves, straw and grasses) and municipal green waste (e.g., grass clippings and yard waste). We carefully select our biocatalyst platforms based on their tolerance to isobutanol and other conditions present during an industrial fermentation process, as well as their known utility in large-scale commercial production processes. 

Feedstocks

We have designed our biocatalyst platform to be capable of producing isobutanol from any fuel ethanol feedstock currently in commercial use, which we believe, in conjunction with our proprietary isobutanol separation unit, will permit us to Retrofit any existing fuel ethanol facility. We have demonstrated that our biocatalysts are capable of converting the types of sugars in grains and sugar cane to isobutanol at our commercial targets for fermentation time and yield and we believe that they will have the ability to convert these sugars into isobutanol at a commercial scale. The vast majority of fuel ethanol currently produced in the U.S. is produced from corn feedstock, which is abundant according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Renewable Fuels Association. Although development work continues to be done, we have shown at laboratory scale and at our one MGPY demonstration facility located at ICM&#8217;s St. Joseph, Missouri site that we can convert certain cellulosic sugars into isobutanol. 

We expect that our feedstock flexibility will allow our technology to be deployed worldwide and will enable us to offer our customers protection from the raw material cost volatility historically associated with petroleum-based products. 

In June 2015, Agri-Energy, our wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into a Price Risk Management, Origination and Merchandising Agreement (the &#8220;Origination Agreement&#8221;) with FCStone Merchant Services, LLC (&#8220;FCStone&#8221;) and a Grain Bin Lease Agreement with FCStone (the &#8220;Lease Agreement&#8221;). Pursuant to the Origination Agreement, FCStone will originate and sell to Agri-Energy, and Agri-Energy will purchase from FCStone, the entire volume of corn grain used by our plant in Luverne, Minnesota. The initial term of the Origination Agreement will continue for a period of eighteen months and will automatically renew for additional 

&#160;

terms of one year unless Agri-Energy gives no tice of non-renewal to FCStone. FCStone will receive an origination fee for purchasing and supplying Agri-Energy with all of the corn used by Agri-Energy&#8217;s plant in Luverne, Minnesota. As security for the payment and performance of all indebtedness, liabil ities and obligations of Agri-Energy to FCStone, Agri-Energy granted to FCStone a security interest in the corn grain stored in grain storage bins owned and operated by Agri-Energy (&#8220;Storage Bins&#8221;) and leased to FCStone pursuant to the Lease Agreement. Pur suant to the Lease Agreement, FCStone will lease Storage Bins from Agri-Energy to store the corn grain prior to title of the corn grain transferring to Agri-Energy upon Agri-Energy&#8217;s purchase of the corn grain. FCStone agrees to lease Storage Bins sufficie nt to store 700,000 bushels of corn grain and agrees to pay to Agri-Energy $175,000 per year. The term of the Lease Agreement will run concurrently with the Origination Agreement, and will be extended, terminated, or expire in accordance with the Originati on Agreement. The Company also entered into an unsecured guaranty (the &#8220;Guaranty&#8221;) in favor of FCStone whereby the Company guaranteed the obligations of Agri-Energy to FCStone under the Origination Agreement. The Guaranty shall terminate on the earlier to occur of (i) April 15, 2020 or (ii) termination of the Origination Agreement. 

GIFT &#174; Improves Fermentation Performance 

Our experiments show that the GIFT &#174; fermentation and recovery system provides enhanced fermentation performance as well as efficient recovery of isobutanol and other alcohols. The GIFT &#174; system enables continuous separation of isobutanol from the fermentation tanks while fermentation is in process. Isobutanol is removed from the fermentation broth using a low temperature distillation to continuously remove the isobutanol as it is formed without the biocatalyst being affected. Since biocatalysts have a low tolerance for high isobutanol concentrations in fermentation, the ability of our process to continuously remove isobutanol as it is produced allows our biocatalyst to continue processing sugar into isobutanol at a high rate without being suppressed by rising levels of isobutanol in the fermenter, reducing the time to complete the fermentation. Using our biocatalysts, we have demonstrated that GIFT &#174; enables isobutanol fermentation times equal to, or less than, those achieved in the current conventional production of ethanol, which allows us to fit our technology into existing ethanol fermenters reducing capital expenditures. We have designed a proprietary engineering package to carry out our isobutanol fermentation and recovery process. 

GIFT &#174; requires limited change to existing ethanol production infrastructure. As with ethanol production, feedstock is ground, cooked, treated with enzymes and fermented. Just like ethanol production, after fermentation, a primary product (isobutanol) and a co-product (iDGs&#8482;) are recovered for sale. The main modifications of the GIFT &#174; system are replacing the ethanol producing yeast with Gevo&#8217;s proprietary isobutanol producing biocatalyst, and adding low temperature distillation equipment for continuous removal and separation of isobutanol. 

Conversion of Isobutanol into Hydrocarbons 

We have demonstrated conversion of our isobutanol into a wide variety of hydrocarbon products which are currently used to produce plastics, fibers, polyester, rubber and other polymers and hydrocarbon fuels. Hydrocarbon products consist entirely of hydrogen and carbon and are currently derived almost exclusively from petroleum, natural gas and coal. Importantly, isobutanol can be dehydrated to produce butenes, which are an intermediate product in the production of hydrocarbon products with many industrial uses. The straightforward conversion of our isobutanol into butenes is a fundamentally important process that enables isobutanol to be used as a building block chemical. Much of the technology necessary to convert isobutanol into butenes and subsequently into these hydrocarbon products is commonly known and practiced in the chemicals industry today. For example, the dehydration of ethanol to ethylene, which uses a similar process and technology to the dehydration of isobutanol, is practiced commercially today to serve the ethylene market. The dehydration of isobutanol into butenes is not commercially practiced today because isobutanol produced from petroleum is not cost-competitive with other petrochemical processes for generation of butenes. We believe that our efficient fermentation technology for producing isobutanol will promote commercial isobutanol dehydration and provide us with the opportunity to access hydrocarbon markets. To assist in accessing these markets, we have developed a hydrocarbon processing demonstration plant (&#8220;Hydrocarbons Demo Plant&#8221;) near Houston, Texas, in partnership with South Hampton Resources, Inc. (&#8220;South Hampton&#8221;). The Hydrocarbon Demo Plant can process 6,000 to 7,000 gallons of our isobutanol per month into a variety of renewable hydrocarbons for use as fuels and chemicals. 

Our ETO Technology

We have also developed new technologies using ethanol as a feedstock for the production of hydrocarbons, renewable hydrogen, and other chemical intermediates, which we describe as our ethanol-to-olefins (&#8220;ETO&#8221;) technologies. The process produces tailored mixes of isobutylene, propylene, hydrogen and acetone, which are valuable as standalone molecules, or as feedstocks to produce other chemical products and longer chain alcohols. This technology has the potential to address additional markets in the chemicals and plastics fields, such as renewable polypropylene for automobiles and packaging and renewable hydrogen for use in chemical and fuel cell markets. At this time, this technology has only been operated at a laboratory scale, but if successfully scaled up to commercial level, this technology may provide the estimated 25BGPY global ethanol industry a broader set of end-product market and margin opportunities.

&#160;

Underpinning the ETO technology is our development of proprietary mixed metal oxide catalysts that produce eith er polymer grade propylene, high purity isobutylene or acetone in high yields in a single processing step. One of the benefits of the technology is that we can use conventional fuel grade specification ethanol that can be sourced from a variety of feedstoc ks with no apparent adverse impact on end product yields. Water, which is co-fed with the ethanol, is able to be recycled resulting in a process which generates minimal waste. The ethanol and water mixture is vaporized and fed across a fixed catalyst bed r esulting in a gaseous product mix consisting of the propylene, isobutylene or acetone, in addition to hydrogen and carbon dioxide, along with lesser amounts of methane and ethylene. Separation of gaseous products can be achieved via conventional process te chnologies and unit operations within the petroleum industry. 

Competition 

Our isobutanol is targeted for use in the following markets: direct use as a solvent and gasoline blendstock, use in the chemicals industry for producing rubber, plastics, fibers, polyester and other polymers and use in the production of hydrocarbon fuels. We face competitors in each market, some of which are limited to individual markets, and some of which will compete with us across all of our target markets. Many of our competitors have greater financial resources than we do.

Renewable isobutanol. We are a leader in the development of renewable isobutanol via fermentation of renewable plant biomass. While the competitive landscape in renewable isobutanol production is limited at this time, we are aware of other companies that are seeking to develop isobutanol production capabilities, including Butamax with whom we have entered into the License Agreement described above. See Item 1. Business&#8212;Butamax Advanced Biofuels LLC&#8212;Cross License Agreement. 

Solvent markets. We also face competition from companies that are focused on the development of n-butanol, a related compound to isobutanol. These companies include Cathay Industrial Biotech Ltd., METabolic EXplorer S.A., Eastman Chemicals Company, and Green Biologics Ltd. We understand that these companies produce n-butanol from an acetone-butanol-ethanol (&#8220;ABE&#8221;) fermentation process primarily for the small chemicals markets. ABE fermentation using a Clostridia biocatalyst has been used in industrial settings since 1919. As discussed in several academic papers analyzing the ABE process, such fermentation is handicapped in competitiveness by high energy costs due to low concentrations of butanol produced and significant volumes of water processed. It requires high capital and operating costs to support industrial scale production due to the low rates of the Clostridia fermentation, and results in a lower butanol yield because it produces ethanol and acetone as by-products. We believe our proprietary process has many significant advantages over the ABE process because of its limited requirements for new capital expenditures, its production output of only isobutanol as a primary product and its limited water usage in production. We believe these advantages will produce a lower cost isobutanol compared to n-butanol produced by ABE fermentation. N-butanol&#8217;s lower octane rating compared to isobutanol gives it a lower value in the gasoline blendstock market, but n-butanol can compete directly in many solvent markets where n-butanol and isobutanol have similar performance characteristics. 

Gasoline blendstocks . In the gasoline blendstock market isobutanol competes with non-renewable alkylate and renewable ethanol. We estimate the total potential global market for isobutanol as a gasoline blendstock to be approximately 40 BGPY. Alkylate is a premium value gasoline blendstock typically derived from petroleum. However, petroleum feeds for alkylate manufacture are pressured by continued increases in the use of natural gas to generate olefins for the production of alkylate, due to the low relative cost of natural gas compared to petroleum. Isobutanol has fuel properties similar to alkylate and, as such, we expect that isobutanol could be used as a substitute for some alkylate in fuel applications. Ethanol is renewable and has a high octane rating, and although it has a high RVP, ethanol receives a one pound RVP waiver in a large portion of the U.S. gasoline market. Renewability is important in the U.S. because the Renewable Fuels Standard program mandates that a minimum volume of renewable blendstocks be used in gasoline each year. A high octane rating is important for engine performance and is a valuable characteristic because many inexpensive gasoline blendstocks have lower octane ratings. Low RVP is important because the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;) sets maximum permissible RVP levels for gasoline. In markets where low RVP is important, isobutanol can enable refiners to meet fuel specifications at lower cost. Ethanol&#8217;s vapor pressure waiver is valuable because it offsets much of the negative value of ethanol&#8217;s high RVP. We believe that our isobutanol will be valued for its combination of low RVP, low water solubility, relatively high octane and renewability. 

Many production and technology supply companies are working to develop ethanol production from cellulosic feedstocks, including Shell Oil Company, DuPont-Danisco Cellulosic Ethanol LLC, Abengoa Bioenergy, S.A., POET, LLC, ICM, Mascoma Corporation, Inbicon A/S, INEOS New Planet BioEnergy LLC, Archer Daniels Midland Company, BlueFire Ethanol, IncZeaChem Inc., Iogen Corporation, Qteros, Inc., and many smaller startup companies. Successful commercialization by some or all of these companies will increase the supply of renewable gasoline blendstocks worldwide, potentially reducing the market size or margins available to isobutanol. 

Plastics, fibers, polyester, rubber and other polymers. Isobutanol can be dehydrated to produce butenes, hydrocarbon intermediates currently used in the production of plastics, fibers, polyester, rubber and other polymers. The straightforward conversion of our isobutanol into butenes is a fundamentally important process that enables isobutanol to be used as a building block chemical in 

&#160;

multiple markets. These markets include butyl rubber, lubricants and additives derived from butenes such as isobutylene, poly methyl methacrylate from isobutanol, propylene for p olypropylene from isobutylene, polyesters made via PX from isobutylene and polystyrene made via styrene. 

In these markets, we compete with the renewable isobutanol companies and renewable n-butanol producers described previously, and face similar competitive challenges. Our competitive position versus petroleum-derived plastics, fibers, rubber and other polymers varies, but we believe that the high volatility of petroleum prices, often tight supply markets for petroleum-based petrochemical feedstocks and the desire of many consumers for goods made from more renewable sources will enable us to compete effectively. However, petrochemical companies may develop alternative pathways to produce petrochemical-based hydrocarbon products that may be less expensive than our isobutanol or more readily available or developed in conjunction with major petrochemical, refiner or end user companies. These products may have economic or other advantages over the plastics, fibers, polyester, rubber and other polymers developed from our isobutanol. Further, some of these companies have access to significantly more resources than we do to develop products. 

Additionally, Global Bioenergies, S.A. is pursuing the direct production of isobutylene from renewable carbohydrates. Through analysis of the fermentation pathway, we believe that the direct production of butenes such as isobutylene via fermentation will have higher capital and operating costs than production of butenes derived from our isobutanol. 

Hydrocarbon fuels. Beyond direct use as a fuel additive, isobutanol can be converted into many hydrocarbon fuels and specialty blendstocks, offering substantial potential for additional demand in the fuels markets. We will compete with the incumbent petroleum-based fuels industry, as well as biofuels companies. The incumbent petroleum-based fuels industry makes the vast majority of the world&#8217;s gasoline, jet and diesel fuels and blendstocks. The petroleum-based fuels industry is mature, and includes a substantial base of infrastructure for the production and distribution of petroleum-derived products. However, the industry faces challenges from its dependence on petroleum. High and volatile oil prices will provide an opportunity for renewable producers relying on biobased feedstocks like corn, which in recent years have had lower price volatility than oil, to compete. 

Biofuels companies will provide substantial competition in the gasoline market. These biofuels competitors are numerous and include both large established companies and numerous startups. Government tax incentives for renewable fuel producers and regulations such as the RFS2 help provide opportunities for renewable fuels producers to compete. In particular, in the gasoline and gasoline blendstock markets, Virent Energy Systems, Inc. (&#8220;Virent&#8221;) offers a competitive process for making gasoline and gasoline blendstocks. However, we have the advantage of being able to target conversion of isobutanol into specific high-value molecules such as isooctane, which can be used to make gasoline blendstocks with a higher value than whole gasoline, which we do not believe Virent&#8217;s process can match. In the jet fuel market, we may face competition from companies such as Synthetic Genomics, Inc., Solazyme, Inc., Sapphire Energy, Inc. and Exxon-Mobil Corporation, which are pursuing production of jet fuel from algae-based technology. Renewable Energy Group, Inc. and others are also targeting production of jet fuels from vegetable oils and animal fats. Red Rock Biofuels LLC and others are planning to produce jet fuel from renewable biomass. In the diesel fuels market, competitors such as Amyris Biotechnologies, Inc. (&#8220;Amyris&#8221;) provide alternative hydrocarbon diesel fuel. We believe our technology provides a higher yield on feedstock than the isoprenoid fermentation pathway developed by Amyris, which we believe will yield a production cost advantage. 

Ethanol. We compete with numerous ethanol producers located throughout the U.S., many of which have much greater resources than we do, including Archer-Daniels-Midland Company, POET, LLC and Valero Energy Corporation. Competition for corn supply from other ethanol plants and other corn consumers will likely exist in all areas and regions in which our current and future plants will operate. We also face competition from foreign producers of ethanol and such competition may increase significantly in the future. Large international companies have developed, or are developing, increased foreign ethanol production capacities. Brazil is the world&#8217;s second largest ethanol producing country. Brazil&#8217;s ethanol production is sugarcane-based, as opposed to corn-based, and has historically been less expensive to produce. 

Intellectual Property 

Our success depends in large part on our proprietary products and technology for which we seek protection under patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws. Such protection is also maintained in part using confidential disclosure agreements. Protection of our technologies is important so that we may offer our customers and partners proprietary services and products unavailable from our competitors, and so that we may exclude our competitors from using technology that we have developed or exclusively licensed. If competitors in our industry have access to the same technology, our competitive position may be adversely affected. As of December 31, 2015, we exclusively licensed rights to approximately 92 issued patents and filed patent applications in the U.S. and in various foreign jurisdictions. These licensed patents and patent applications are owned by Cargill and exclusively licensed to us for use in certain fields. These licensed patents and patent applications cover both enabling technologies and products or methods of producing products. Our license to such patents and applications allows us to freely practice the licensed inventions, subject only to the terms of this license. Effective March 28, 2016, we terminated the License Agreement with Cargill Incorporated, 

&#160;

dated February 19, 2009. We elected to terminate this agreement because we determined that we no longer needed the Cargill technology for our business. We do not expect the termination to have an adverse effect on our business. 

As of December 31, 2015, we have submitted approximately 418 patent applications in the U.S. and in various foreign jurisdictions. These patent applications are directed to our technologies and specific methods and products that support our business in the biofuel and bioindustrial markets. We continue to file new patent applications, for which terms extend up to 20 years from the filing date in the U.S. 

As of December 31, 2015, we have been issued 26 U.S. patents and 13 international patents.

In addition to the patents and applications described above, we have a global cross-license to certain patents and applications relating to the production, recovery, and use of isobutanol that are owned or licensed by Butamax. The global cross-license allows us to freely practice the licensed inventions, subject to the terms of the cross-license. For information regarding this license, see Item 1. Business&#8212;Butamax Advanced Biofuels LLC&#8212;Cross License Agreement. 

We will continue to file and prosecute patent applications and maintain trade secrets, as is consistent with our business plan, in an ongoing effort to protect our intellectual property. It is possible that our licensors&#8217; current patents, or patents which we may later acquire or license, may be successfully challenged or invalidated in whole or in part. It is also possible that we may not obtain issued patents from our filed applications, and may not be able to obtain patents regarding other inventions we seek to protect. We also may not file patents in each country in which we plan to do business or actually conduct business. Under appropriate circumstances, we may sometimes permit certain intellectual property to lapse or go abandoned. Due to uncertainties inherent in prosecuting patent applications, sometimes patent applications are rejected and we may subsequently abandon them. It is also possible that we will develop products or technologies that will not be patentable or that the patents of others will limit or preclude our ability to do business. In addition, any patent issued to us may provide us with little or no competitive advantage, in which case we may abandon such patent or license it to another entity. 

We have obtained registered trademarks for Gevo Integrated Fermentation Technology &#174; , GIFT &#174; , and Gevo &#174; in the U.S. These registered and pending U.S. trademarks are also registered or pending in certain foreign countries.

Our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate and our competitors may independently develop technology or products that are similar to or compete with ours. Patent, trademark and trade secret laws afford only limited protection for our technology platform and products. The laws of many countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the U.S. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties have in the past attempted, and may in the future attempt, to operate using aspects of our intellectual property or products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Third parties may also design around our proprietary rights, which may render our protected technology and products less valuable. In addition, if any of our products or technologies is covered by third-party patents or other intellectual property rights, we could be subject to various legal actions. We cannot assure you that our technology platform and products do not infringe patents held by others or that they will not in the future. 

Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement, invalidity, misappropriation or other allegations. Any such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources. Any settlement of or adverse judgment resulting from such litigation could require us to obtain a license to continue to make, use or sell the products or technology that is the subject of the claim, or otherwise restrict or prohibit our use of the technology. 

Customers, Partnerships and Collaborations 

We commenced a limited commercial scale campaign for the production of isobutanol in 2014 at our Agri-Energy Facility to demonstrate commercial scale capacity and sell the resulting product. We expect initial commercial production to be directed to serve the high-purity and chemical-grade markets, to provide introductory volumes to the specialty fuel blendstock markets in the U.S. and to be further processed at a demonstration plant near Houston, Texas, to fulfill contracts for various hydrocarbons applications such as alcohol-to-jet fuel (&#8220;ATJ&#8221;) and PX. In 2014, we also began producing and selling isobutanol distiller&#8217;s grains, or iDGs&#8482;, as an animal feed co-product, in a similar manner as distiller&#8217;s grains are sold in the ethanol industry today. 

As of December 31, 2015, we had entered into the following key arrangements: 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Mansfield Oil Company of Gainesville, Inc. In August 2011, we entered into a commercial off-take agreement with Mansfield Oil Company of Gainesville, Inc. (&#8220;Mansfield&#8221;) to distribute isobutanol-based fuel into the petroleum market. Mansfield markets and distributes fuel to thousands of commercial customers across the U.S. and has over 900 supply points across the U.S. The agreement allows Mansfield to blend our isobutanol for its own use and to be a distributor of 

&#160;

&#160;

our isobutanol for a term of five years. We also entered into a three-year supply services agreement, with automatic one-year renewals thereafter, with C&#38;N, a Mansfield subsidiary (&#8220; C&#38;N&#8221;), which will provide supply chain services including logistics management, customer service support, invoicing and billing services. Substantially all ethanol sold by Agri-Energy since its acquisition in September 2010 was sold to C&#38;N pursuant to a se parate ethanol purchase and marketing agreement. &#160;

&#160;

&#9679; 

Land O&#8217;Lakes Purina Feed LLC. In December 2011, we entered into a commercial off-take and marketing agreement with Land O&#8217;Lakes Purina Feed LLC (&#8220;Land O&#8217;Lakes Purina Feed&#8221;) for the sale of iDGs&#8482; produced by the Agri-Energy Facility. Land O&#8217; Lakes Purina Feed provides farmers and ranchers with an extensive line of agricultural supplies (feed, seed, and crop protection products) and services. Pursuant to the agreement, Land O&#8217;Lakes Purina Feed will be the exclusive marketer of our iDGs&#8482; and modified wet distiller&#8217;s grains for the animal feed market. The agreement has an initial three-year term following the first commercial sales of iDGs&#8482; with automatic one-year renewals thereafter unless terminated by one of the parties. Further, we plan to work with Land O&#8217;Lakes Purina Feed to explore opportunities to upgrade the iDGs&#8482; for special value-added applications in feed markets. Land O&#8217; Lakes Purina Feed also provides marketing services for the sale of our ethanol distiller grains.

&#160;

&#9679; 

Alaska Airlines. In May 2015, we entered into a strategic alliance agreement with Alaska Airlines. Pursuant to the terms of this agreement, Alaska Airlines agreed to purchase an initial quantity of our ATJ when and if we secure D7566 certification. In the event that we do not secure ASTM certification by December 31, 2016, the agreement will automatically terminate unless we and Alaska Airlines agree in writing to an extension. In February 2016, we entered into a purchase agreement with Alaska Airlines to supply an additional 20,000 gallons of ATJ. It is anticipated that Gevo will deliver the 20,000 gallons to Alaska Airlines within 90 days of the ASTM D7566 certification being received. All of the ATJ to be supplied under these agreements is expected to be produced from isobutanol at the Hydrocarbons Demo Plant we developed with our partner South Hampton located near Houston, Texas. 

&#160;

&#9679; 

BCD Chemie. In April 2015, we entered into a first purchase order to supply isooctene to BCD Chemie, a subsidiary of Brenntag AG, a leading chemical distributor based in Germany. BCD Chemie is targeting applications in Europe to replace petroleum-based hydrocarbons to enable companies to meet regulatory requirements for renewable content in fuels while satisfying the performance requirements of their customers. We subsequently entered into additional purchase orders to supply isooctene to BCD Chemie into 2016. To date, the total value of the purchase orders to BCD Chemie is over $1 million. 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Total Additives &#38; Special Fuels. In September 2014, we entered into an agreement with Total Additifs Et Carburants Speciaux SAS (&#8221;Total ACS&#8221;) to supply isooctane for formulation into Formula 1 &#174; racing fuel. Total ACS is a subsidiary of Total S.A., the French multinational integrated oil and gas company. The contract provided Total ACS with exclusivity for use of our isooctane for Formula 1 &#174; racing. The contract expired on December 31, 2015; however, we anticipate continuing to supply isooctane, and potentially other hydrocarbon fuels, to Total ACS in the future. 

&#160;

&#9679; 

U.S. Military. In September 2011, we were awarded a contract by the Defense Logistics Agency (the &#8220;DLA&#8221;), to supply ATJ to the U.S. Air Force. The DLA sources and provides nearly 100% of the consumable items the U.S. military needs to operate. Under the contract, we provided the U.S. Air Force with 11,000 gallons of ATJ which was used to support engine testing and a demonstration flight in an A-10 aircraft. The term of the agreement was through December 30, 2012. The demonstration flight was successfully completed in June 2012. In September 2012, we were awarded an additional contract for the procurement of up to 45,000 gallons of ATJ. In March 2013, we entered into a contract with the DLA to supply the U.S. Army with 3,650 gallons of biojet fuel and in May 2013 this initial order was increased by 12,500 gallons. In September 2013, we entered into a contract with the DLA to supply the U.S. Navy with 20,000 gallons of biojet fuel. All of the ATJ supplied under these contracts was produced from isobutanol at the Hydrocarbons Demo Plant.

&#160;

&#9679; 

Toray Industries. In June 2011, we announced that we had successfully produced fully renewable and recyclable PET in cooperation with Toray. Working directly with Toray Industries, we employed prototypes of commercial operations from the petrochemical and refining industries to make PX from isobutanol. Toray Industries used our bio-para-xylene (&#8220;bio-PX&#8221;) and commercially available renewable mono ethylene glycol to produce fully renewable PET films and fibers. In June 2012, we entered into a definitive agreement with Toray Industries, as amended in October 2013, for the joint development of an integrated supply chain for the production of bio-PET. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement with Toray Industries, we received $1.0 million which we used for the design and construction of a demonstration plant. Toray Industries was obligated to purchase initial volumes of bio-PX produced at the demonstration plant. In May 2014, we successfully shipped these initial volumes of bio-PX.

&#160;

&#160;

&#9679; 

The Coca Cola Company . We have established a working relationship with Coca-Cola to create bio-PX from our isobutanol in an effort to accelerate the development of Coca-Cola&#8217;s second generation PlantBottle&#8482; packaging made from 100% plant-based materials. In November 2011, we entered into a joint research, development, license and commercialization agreement with Coca-Cola. Pursuant to this agreement, we have agreed to conduct research and development activities, including engineering to produce bio-PX from isobutanol, with the ultimate goal of producing bio-PET for food-grade bottling. Our work is targeted to take the technology from laboratory-scale to commercial-scale and support Coca- Cola&#8217;s efforts to lead the beverage industry away from fossil-fuel based packaging by offer ing an alternative made completely from renewable raw materials. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Coca-Cola paid us a fixed fee for the research program during the first two years of the agreement. The research and development activities under the i nitial agreement were successfully completed and an amendment was entered into in March 2014 that extended the agreement through the end of 2014. We are in ongoing discussions with Coca-Cola to determine the next steps of the collaboration to scale-up the bio-PX technology. &#160;

Northwest Advanced Renewables Alliance. We are a member of the Northwest Advanced Renewables Alliance (&#8220;NARA&#8221;) and are providing NARA with technology to enable the commercial scale processing of cellulosic sugars from wood waste into valuable products. The cellulosic jet fuel made using our technologies will be used in a 1,000-gallon renewable fuel demonstration test flight. Our isobutanol and ATJ-SPK technologies are both licensed by NARA as part of this project. NARA is a five-year project supported by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, National Institute of Food and Agriculture, and is comprised of 22 member organizations from industry, academia and government laboratories. Its mission is to facilitate development of biojet and bioproduct industries in the Pacific Northwest using forest residuals that would otherwise become waste products.

These agreements demonstrate the demand for isobutanol from the Agri-Energy Facility and Hydrocarbons Demo Plant. However, certain of the commitments that we have received are non-binding. There can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate final terms with these or other companies in a timely manner, or at all, or attract customers based on our arrangements with the petrochemical companies and large brand owners discussed above. 

In 2015, C&#38;N and Land O&#8217;Lakes Purina Feed LLC accounted for approximately 70% and 19% of our consolidated revenue, respectively. Given our production capacity compared to the overall size of the North American market and the demand for our products, we do not believe that a decline in a specific customer's purchases would have a material adverse long-term effect upon our financial results.

Research and Development 

Our strategy depends on continued improvement of our technologies for the production of isobutanol, as well as next generation chemicals and biofuels based on our isobutanol technology. Accordingly, we annually devote significant funds to research and development. The following table shows our research and development costs by function (in thousands).

During 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recorded revenue from government grants and cooperative agreements in the amounts of $1.2 million, $0.8 million and $2.7 million, respectively, which primarily related to research and development activities performed in our biocatalyst, chemistry, and applications development groups. 

Our research and development activities are currently being performed primarily in our corporate headquarters located in Englewood, Colorado and the Hydrocarbons Demo Plant near Houston, Texas. 

Government Regulation - Environmental Compliance Costs

Regulation by governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries is a significant factor in the development, manufacture and marketing of second-generation biofuels. Our isobutanol and the next generation products isobutanol will be used to produce may require regulatory approval by governmental agencies prior to commercialization. In particular, biofuels are subject to rigorous testing and premarket approval requirements by the EPA&#8217;s Office of Transportation and Air Quality, and regulatory authorities in other countries. In the U.S., various federal, and, in some cases, state statutes and regulations also govern or impact the manufacturing, 

&#160;

safety, storage and use of biofuels. The process of seeking required approvals and the continuing need for compliance with applicable statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial resources. Regulatory approval, if and when obtained for any of the next generation products i sobutanol is used to produce, may be limited in scope, which may significantly limit the uses for which our isobutanol and these next generation products may be marketed. 

When built at a dry-mill facility, our GIFT &#174; fermentation process creates iDGs&#8482;, a potential animal feed component, as a co-product. We have undertaken a self-assessed Generally Regarded As Safe process via third party scientific review to support the sale of our iDGs&#8482; as animal feed. While we believe we can rely on this review, as we update our biocatalysts to increase isobutanol production, for further customer assurance, we also intend to pursue approval upon a completed biocatalyst from the Center for Veterinary Medicine of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the &#8220;FDA&#8221;). Even if we receive such approval, the FDA&#8217;s policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, delay or require regulatory approval of our co-products. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse governmental regulations that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the U.S. or abroad. 

Our process contains a genetically engineered organism which, when used in an industrial process, is considered a new chemical under the EPA&#8217;s Toxic Substances Control Act program (&#8220;TSCA&#8221;). EPA&#8217;s Biotechnology Program under TSCA requires the submission of certain information of the Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxic Substances. Due to the nature of our microorganism we can utilize the TSCA Biotechnology Program Tier I and Tier II exemption criteria at our Luverne, Minnesota manufacturing location. As we expand our business activities, we will pursue the EPA&#8217;s Microbial Commercial Activity Notice process for future plants. We do not anticipate a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition as a result of our efforts to comply with these requirements. However, the TSCA new chemical submission policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our products. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse governmental regulations that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the U.S. or abroad. 

There are various third-party certification organizations, such as ASTM and Underwriters&#8217; Laboratories, Inc. (&#8220;UL&#8221;), involved in certifying the transportation, dispensing and use of liquid fuel in the U.S. and internationally. In 2013, a specification for fuel grade isobutanol titled ASTM D7862 &#8220;Standard Specification for Butanol for Blending with Gasoline for Use as Automotive Spark-Ignition Engine Fuel&#8221; was published. In addition, UL has published guidance on the use of isobutanol-gasoline blends in its UL87A fuel dispensers. Voluntary standards development organizations may change and additional requirements may be enacted that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our products. The process of seeking required approvals and the continuing need for compliance with applicable statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources. We do not anticipate a material adverse effect on our business or financial conditions as a result of our efforts to comply with these requirements, but we cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse third-party requirements that might arise from future action, either in the U.S. or abroad. 

We are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the air, water and ground, the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials and the health and safety of our employees. These laws and regulations require us to obtain environmental permits and comply with numerous environmental restrictions as we construct and operate isobutanol assets. They may require expensive pollution control equipment or operation changes to limit actual or potential impacts to the environment. A violation of these laws, regulations or permit conditions can result in substantial fines, natural resource damage, criminal sanctions, permit revocations and facility shutdowns. 

There is a risk of liability for the investigation and cleanup of environmental contamination at each of the properties that we own or operate and at off-site locations where we arrange for the disposal of hazardous substances. If these substances are or have been disposed of or released at sites that undergo investigation or remediation by regulatory agencies, we may be responsible under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act or other environmental laws for all or part of the costs of investigation and remediation. We may also be subject to related claims by private parties alleging property damage and personal injury due to exposure to hazardous or other materials at or from the properties. Some of these matters may require us to expend significant amounts for investigation and cleanup or other costs. We are not aware of any material environmental liabilities relating to contamination at or from our facilities or at off-site locations where we have transported or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances. 

In addition, new laws, new interpretations of existing laws, increased governmental enforcement of environmental laws or other developments could require us to make significant additional expenditures. Continued government and public emphasis on environmental issues can be expected to result in increased future investments in environmental controls at our facilities which cannot be estimated at this time. Present and future environmental laws and regulations applicable to our operations, more vigorous enforcement policies and discovery of currently unknown conditions could all require us to make substantial expenditures. For example, our air emissions are subject to the Clean Air Act, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 and similar state and local laws and associated regulations. Under the Clean Air Act, the EPA has promulgated National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air 

&#160;

Pollutants (&#8220;NESHAP&#8221;), which could apply to facilities that we own or operate if the emissions of hazardous air pollutants exceed certain thresholds. If a facility we operate is authoriz ed to emit hazardous air pollutants above the threshold level, then we might still be required to come into compliance with another NESHAP at some future time. New or expanded facilities might be required to comply with both standards upon startup if they exceed the hazardous air pollutant threshold. In addition to costs for achieving and maintaining compliance with these laws, more stringent standards may also limit our operating flexibility. 

As a condition to granting the permits necessary for operating our facilities, regulators could make demands that increase our construction and operations costs, which might force us to obtain additional financing. For example, unanticipated water discharge limits could sharply increase construction costs for our projects. Permit conditions could also restrict or limit the extent of our operations. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain or comply with the terms of all necessary permits to complete the Retrofit of an ethanol plant. Failure to obtain and comply with all applicable permits and licenses could halt our construction and could subject us to future claims. 

Segments and Geographic Information 

We have determined that we have two operating segments: (i) the Gevo, Inc. segment; and (ii) the Gevo Development/Agri-Energy segment. We organize our business segments based on the nature of the products and services offered through each of our consolidated legal entities. Transactions between segments are eliminated in consolidation. For additional financial information related to our segments, see Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements. 

Gevo, Inc. Segment . Our Gevo, Inc. segment is responsible for all research and development activities related to the future production of isobutanol, including the development of our proprietary biocatalysts, the production and sale of biojet fuel, our Retrofit process and the next generation of chemicals and biofuels that will be based on our isobutanol technology. Our Gevo, Inc. segment also develops, maintains and protects our intellectual property portfolio, develops future markets for our isobutanol and provides corporate oversight services. 

Gevo Development/Agri-Energy Segment . Our Gevo Development/Agri-Energy segment is currently responsible for the operation of our Agri-Energy Facility and the production of ethanol, isobutanol and related products. Substantially all of the ethanol produced from the date of the acquisition of the Agri-Energy Facility through December 31, 2015 was sold through an ethanol marketing company. Sales of ethanol and related products from our Gevo Development/Agri-Energy segment comprised approximately 90% of our consolidated revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. 

The following table sets forth our revenue by reportable segment (in thousands).
