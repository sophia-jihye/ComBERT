Recent Developments 

&#160; 

Bottling Agreement with Niagara Bottling 

On October 9, 2015, we entered into an agreement (the &#8220; Niagara Agreement &#8221;) with Niagara Bottling, LLC (&#8220; Niagara &#8221;), wherein Niagara will become the exclusive manufacturer of AquaBall&#8482; Naturally Flavored Water for the next five years. With Niagara, we have produced an improved &#8220;clean label&#8221; formulation of AquaBall&#8482;, which remains sugar and calorie free but has eliminated all preservatives. 

&#160; 

The Niagara Agreement requires the Company to deliver to Niagara its minimum volume requirements for the upcoming 12-month period on or before February 1st of each year (the &#8220; Annual Commitment &#8221;), which Annual Commitment may not be less than 3.2 million Cases (defined in the Niagara Agreement as a pack of 24 bottles of AquaBall&#8482; Naturally Flavored Water). Subject to the terms and conditions of the Niagara Agreement, the Company will pay Niagara $6.35 per Case manufactured, for an annual financial liability of approximately $20.3 million per year. We expect to begin delivering Cases manufactured by Niagara in second quarter of fiscal 2016. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#160; Our largest shareholder, Mr. Vincent C. Smith, executed a personal guaranty of our obligations under the Niagara Agreement (the &#8220; Personal Guaranty &#8221;). In order to offset any financial obligation Mr. Smith may incur as a result of the Personal Guaranty, the Company issued to Red Beard Holdings, LLC, an entity affiliated with Mr. Smith (&#8220; Red Beard &#8221;), a senior secured promissory note (the &#8220; Note &#8221;) pursuant to which the Company will borrow any amounts paid to Niagara by Mr. Smith as a result of the Personal Guaranty. Any amounts borrowed under the Note will be secured by a continuing security interest in substantially all of the Company&#8217;s assets, will accrue interest at 2.0%, plus the Maximum Rate (as such term is defined in the Note) and, subject to certain terms and conditions of the Note, will be due and payable within 10 years. As consideration for Mr. Smith&#8217;s execution of the Personal Guaranty, the Company issued to Mr. Smith a five-year warrant (the &#8220; Personal Guaranty Warrant &#8221;), to purchase 17.5 million shares of the Company&#8217;s Common Stock for $0.188 per share. 

Extension of Licensing Agreements 

During the quarter ended September 30, 2015, we entered into renewed Licensing Agreements with both Marvel Characters B.V. (&#8220; Marvel &#8221;) and Disney Consumer Products, Inc. (&#8220; Disney &#8221;), pursuant to which we secured licenses to feature certain Marvel and Disney characters on bottles of AquaBall&#8482; Naturally Flavored Water through 2017. Our agreement with Marvel expires on December 31, 2017, and requires payment of a 5% royalty rate on sales of AquaBall&#8482; Naturally Flavored Water adorned with Marvel characters, paid quarterly, with a total guarantee of $200,000. Our agreement with Disney expires on March 31, 2017, and requires payment of a 5% royalty rate on sales of AquaBall&#8482; Naturally Flavored Water adorned with Disney characters, paid quarterly, with a total guarantee of $450,870. We are also required to make an annual &#8216;common marketing fund&#8217; contribution equal to 1% of our sales, and must spend a total of $820,000 on advertising and promotional opportunities over the term of the agreement with Disney.

&#160; 

&#160; 

Note Payments and March Note Exchange . On March 27, 2015, we entered into an amendment to the February Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which we sold to one of the Investors an additional 27,000 shares of Series C Preferred (the &#8220; Additional Shares &#8221;), for gross proceeds of $2.7 million, which the Company subsequently used to satisfy approximately $2.7 million of the Company&#8217;s $3.8 million in outstanding secured promissory notes (the &#8220; Notes &#8221;) (the &#8220; Note Payments &#8221;). As additional consideration for the purchase of the Additional Shares, the Investor received warrants on substantially similar terms to those offered in the February Offering, exercisable for $0.15 per share. 

&#160; 

Following the Note Payments, the Company and each of the holders (the &#8220; Holders &#8221;) of the Notes remaining after the Note Payments entered into Note Exchange Agreements (the &#8220; March Exchange Agreements &#8221;), wherein the Holders agreed to exchange all remaining principal and accrued interest of any such Notes into shares of Series C Preferred on terms substantially similar to those offered in the February Purchase Agreement (the &#8220; March Note Exchange &#8221;). As a result of the execution of the March Exchange Agreements and the consummation of the March Note Exchange, the Company issued to the Holders an aggregate total of 12,148 shares of Series C Preferred and Warrants to purchase approximately 2.8 million shares of Common Stock. 

August Offering . On August 13, 2015, the Company and Red Beard entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the &#8220; August Purchase Agreement &#8221;), pursuant to which Red Beard purchased 17,648 shares of Series C Preferred for $113.33 per share over the course of three separate closings between August 13, 2015 and September 15, 2015.

As additional consideration, Red Beard received five-year warrants, exercisable for $0.17 per share (the &#8220; Exercise Price &#8221;), to purchase a total of 3,633,411 shares of Common Stock, an amount equal to 35% of (i) the Stated Value (as such term is defined in the Series C Certificate of Designation) of the shares of Series C preferred issued to Red Beard, divided by (ii) the Exercise Price. 

On October 16, 2015, the Company and Red Beard executed an amendment to the August Purchase Agreement (the &#8220; Amendment &#8221;), pursuant to which the Company sold to Red Beard an additional 8,823 shares of Series C Preferred for gross proceeds of approximately $1.0 million. As additional consideration for the purchase of the shares of Series C Preferred under the Amendment, Red Beard received additional warrants to purchase approximately 1.81 million shares of the Company&#8217;s Common Stock for $0.17 per share. 

&#160; 

Note Financing . On September 9, 2015, the Company began a private offering, to certain accredited investors (the &#8220; Note Investors &#8221;), of: (i) senior subordinated secured promissory notes (the &#8220; Secured Notes &#8221;) in the aggregate principal amount of up to $2.5 million; and (ii) and five-year warrants to purchase that number of shares equal to 15% of the principal amount of the Secured Note purchased by each Note Investor (&#8220; Note Warrants &#8221;), divided by the ten-day average closing price of the Company&#8217;s Common Stock (the &#8220; Note Financing &#8221;). Each Secured Note issued accrues interest at a rate of 12% per annum, and matures one year from the date of issuance. The Company has issued an aggregate total of $855,000 Secured Notes and Note Warrants to purchase an aggregate total of 280,265 shares of Common Stock. 

&#160; 

November Series C Offering and Adjustment of Exercise Price of the Warrants and Personal Guaranty Warrant. On November 25, 2015, the Company and Red Beard entered into a securities purchase agreement, pursuant to which Red Beard agreed to purchase up to 30,000 shares of Series C Preferred for $100 per share over the course of three separate closings between November 2015 and January 2016 (the &#8220; November Purchase Agreement &#8221;).

&#160; 

&#160; 

Due to certain adjustment provisions in previously issued warrants, including the warrants issued in connection with the February Purchase Agreement, as amended, the August Purchase Agreement, as amended, and the Personal Guaranty Warrant, the issuance of the warrants pursuant to the November Purchase Agreement caused a decrease in the exercise price of the warrants issued between August 2015 and October 2015 and the Personal Guaranty Warrant to $0.15 per share. 

January Note Exchange . On January 20, 2016, the Company and Note Investors holding Secured Notes in the principal amount of $500,000 entered into Note Exchange Agreements pursuant to which the Note Investors agreed to convert the outstanding principal balance of their Secured Notes into an aggregate total of 4,413 shares of Series C Preferred and five-year warrants to purchase up to an agate total of 1,029,701 shares of Common Stock for $0.17 per share.

&#160;

Our History 

&#160;

Bazi Intl. Prior to Merger with True Drinks, Inc. 

&#160;

Bazi International, Inc. (" Bazi Intl .") was formed in 2001, under the name &#8220;Instanet, Inc.&#8221; In August 2010, we changed our name to Bazi International, Inc. Until January 18, 2010, our principal channel of distribution was through a multilevel distributor network, which we terminated in January 2010 in favor of a retail and direct-to-consumer, online sales model. Bazi Intl. continued to distribute Bazi&#174; online and through our existing database of customers, but as a result of the termination of our multilevel distributor model, most of our top distributors ended their relationship with the Company during the first quarter of 2010, causing sales of Bazi&#174; to decrease throughout 2011 and into 2012. As a result, Bazi Intl. began suffering from a lack of sufficient capital necessary to adequately market Bazi&#174; and support the Company&#8217;s existing retail and distribution partners. 

&#160;

True Drinks, Inc. Prior to Merger with the Bazi Intl. 

&#160;

True Drinks (formerly GT Beverage Company, Inc.) was formed on January 19, 2012 to develop, market and sell AquaBall&#8482; Naturally Flavored Water. In February and March of 2012, True Drinks acquired GT Beverage Company, LLC. GT Beverage Company, LLC was formed in May 2008 to create and commercialize its Sportastic&#174; brand sports drink, sold in round plastic bottles with registered trade dresses such as baseball and soccer designs. However, in January 2012, GT Beverage Company, LLC ceased its sports drink operations. In April 2012, True Drinks began packaging and selling AquaBall&#8482; Naturally Flavored Water in its patented interlocking round plastic bottles, with depictions of characters from major entertainment companies, as permitted by licensing agreements with these companies. 

True Drinks, Inc. Merges into Bazi Intl. 

On June 7, 2012, True Drinks, Inc., Bazi Acquisition Sub Inc. (" Merger Sub "), a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bazi Intl., and Bazi Intl. entered into an agreement and tax-free plan of merger (the &#8220; Merger Agreement &#8221;), wherein Merger Sub merged with and into the Company and True Drinks continued as the surviving corporation (the &#8220; Merger &#8221;). As a result of the Merger, True Drinks became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The Merger closed on October 15, 2012. As a result of Merger, True Drinks, Inc.&#8217;s former shareholders owned approximately 95.5% of the combined post-Merger entity via shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock issued as part of the Merger. The Company subsequently changed its name from &#8220;Bazi International, Inc.&#8221; to &#8220;True Drinks Holdings, Inc.&#8221; The Merger was accounted for as a public shell company &#8220;reverse merger,&#8221; and, as such, the consolidated financial statements reported herein reflect the operations of True Drinks, Inc. within the capital structure of Bazi Intl.

&#160; 

Our Products 

We market and distribute products that move away from high sugar, high calorie and nutritionally deficient beverages to healthful, natural alternatives. Our mission is to bring integrity back to the beverage industry and that honesty applies to every drop in every bottle. Our goal is to create and deliver beverages for families that encourage improved health, while being clear about what our products contain (and what they don&#8217;t). 

AquaBall TM Naturally Flavored Water 

Our flagship product, AquaBall TM Naturally Flavored Water, is a naturally flavored water beverage, enhanced with vitamins B3, B5, B6, B12 and C. AquaBall TM does not contain high fructose corn syrup, artificial flavors, or artificial colors. Unlike high sugar and high calorie beverages marketed toward children, AquaBall TM is sweetened with stevia, an all-natural sweetener, allowing the AquaBall TM to provide a zero-sugar, zero-calorie alternative to juice and soda for kids. The main component of the marketing vision behind the AquaBall TM brand is our licensing agreements with Disney Consumer Products, Inc. and Marvel Entertainment, allowing each AquaBall TM to prominently feature various Disney and Marvel characters. Both Disney and Marvel characters have an established reputation of high retail sales of licensed products, giving each AquaBall TM &#160; the presence associated with these brands. 

&#160;

Each AquaBall TM is packaged in our patented 12 ounce stackable, spherical PET bottle, and wrapped with colorful, eye-catching labels featuring popular Disney characters and various Marvel Superheroes. AquaBall TM currently comes in fruit punch, grape, orange and berry flavors and is sold in mass-market retailers throughout the United States. AquaBall TM is available for purchase online at http://www.aquaballdrink.com . During the year ended December 31, 2015, AquaBall TM &#160; sales accounted for approximately 97% of the Company&#8217;s total revenues. 

&#160;

Bazi &#174; 

&#160;

Bazi&#174; All Natural Energy, is a liquid nutritional drink packed with eight different super fruits, including the Chinese jujube and seven other superfruits, plus 12 vitamins. The proprietary formula contains the following fruits: jujube fruit, blueberry, pomegranate, goji berry, chokeberry, raspberry, acai and sea buckthorn. Additionally, Bazi&#174; contains 12 vitamins including vitamins A, C, E and B-complex. In August, 2011, BioEnergy Ribose was added to Bazi&#174; enhancing the products energy delivery system. During the year ended December 31, 2015, Bazi&#174; sales accounted for approximately 3% of the Company&#8217;s total revenues. 

Manufacturing and Distribution 

Manufacturing 

&#160;

We use a limited number of third parties to supply and manufacture our products. We have co-packing agreements with 7-Up Bottling in Modesto, California, Mountain Pure in Palestine, Texas, and Adirondack Beverages in Scotia, New York to package up to 4.0 million cases of AquaBall TM Naturally Flavored Water per year. Bazi&#174; has been manufactured by Arizona Packaging and Production since 2007. 

Beginning in May 2016, all production of AquaBall TM will be completed by Niagara Bottling, LLC pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Niagara Agreement, as described under " Recent Developments " above. Niagara will handle all aspects of production, including the procurement of all raw materials necessary to produce AquaBall TM . In accordance with the terms of the Niagara Agreement, True Drinks will pay Niagara for each case within 15 days of the shipment of product to our customers. 

Retail Distribution 

&#160;

For much of 2015, we utilized a direct-to-retailer distribution strategy to key national accounts for sales of AquaBall&#8482; Naturally Flavored Water, including distribution to Sam&#8217;s Club, Rite-Aid, Harris Teeter Supermarkets, Value Merchandisers, and stores under the Safeway, Inc. and The Kroger Company brands nationwide. We also distributed AquaBall&#8482; through regional distributors throughout the United States, such as Drink King in New York City and Polar Beverages in New England. Additionally, our licensing agreement with Disney Consumer Products, Inc. and Marvel Entertainment allows us to work with Disney and Marvel&#8217;s dedicated sales teams who, in turn, work with top retailers to assist us with securing shelf-space for AquaBall&#8482; and to accomplish our long-term sales objectives. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

In November 2015, we began shifting our retail distribution strategy towards a nationwide network of regional distributors to handle all grocery, drug and convenience accounts. This shift was the result of successes with regional distributors related primarily to the increased same store sales associated with placing AquaBall TM representatives at the store level. We will continue to ship directly to customers in the club and mass channels, such as Sam&#8217;s Club, Costco, Restaurant Depot, Target and Walmart, while building upon our distribution network throughout 2016. 

&#160;

Online Sales 

Our ecommerce platform allows current and future consumers to purchase AquaBall&#8482; Naturally Flavored Water and Bazi&#174; Energy Shot through our webpages, http://www.aquaballdrink.com and http://www.drinkbazi.com . We drive traffic to relevant landing pages and micro sites through digital marketing campaigns and promotions, as well as a variety of social media marketing efforts. 

Sales and Marketing 

Our sales and marketing efforts are directed from our corporate offices in Irvine, California, utilizing our own staff, as well as outside resources retained to build market awareness and shelf placement of our products, including dedicated sales teams from Disney Consumer Products, Inc. and Marvel Entertainment. The Company manages key national accounts through our in-house national sales team. Our sales teams work to secure national distribution with these customers through multiple avenues including joint sales meetings with Disney and Marvel sales personnel. 

In November 2015, we began building a nationwide network of direct store distributors to handle the distribution of AquaBall&#8482; to the grocery, drug and convenience channels. We will continue to ship directly to customers in the mass channel, such as Walmart and Target, and the club channel, such as Sam&#8217;s Club and Costco. All other accounts will be distributed to via our distribution network. Our sales team will continue to secure distribution with both national and regional accounts. We expect to continue building out our distribution network throughout 2016. 

Source and Availability of Raw Materials 

We utilized a variety of suppliers to purchase raw materials for the AquaBall&#8482; Naturally Flavored Water during the year ended December 31, 2015. Beginning in May 2016, all production of AquaBall TM will be completed by Niagara Bottling, LLC through our 5-year bottling agreement. Niagara will handle all aspects of production, including the procurement of all raw materials necessary to produce AquaBall TM . 

During 2015, we relied significantly on one supplier for 100% of our purchases of certain raw materials for Bazi&#174;. Bazi, Inc. has sourced these raw materials from this supplier since 2007 and does not anticipate any issues with the supply of these raw materials. 

We own the formulas for both AquaBall&#8482; Naturally Flavored Water and Bazi&#174; Energy Shot, and we believe that our purchasing requirements can be readily met from alternative sources, if necessary. 

Competition 

The industries in which we operate are highly competitive. AquaBall&#8482; Naturally Flavored Water competes most directly with other beverages marketed directly to children. We also compete with other manufacturers of functional beverages, and with manufacturers of more traditional beverages, such as juice and soda. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Our primary competition for AquaBall&#8482; is in the estimated $2.0 billion market for products marketed directly to children, including CapriSun&#174;, Honest Kids, Good to Grow, Tummy Ticklers, Kool-aid and others. General competition in the beverage industry includes products owned by multinational corporations with significant financial resources, including Vitamin Water, owned by Coca-Cola, and Sobe and Propel, both owned by Pepsi Co. Bazi&#174; competitors include Steaz&#174;, Guayaki Yerba Mate, POM Wonderful&#174;, as well as sports and energy drinks including Gatorade&#174;, Red Bull&#174;, 5-Hour Energy&#174;, RockStar&#174;, Monster&#174;, Powerade&#174;, Accelerade&#174; and All Sport&#174;. Indirect competition for the AquaBall&#8482; and Bazi&#174; includes soft drinks and juice products, such as Sunny Delight&#174; and other fruit drinks. These competitors can use their resources and scale to rapidly respond to competitive pressures and changes in consumer preferences by introducing new products, reducing prices or increasing promotional activities. Many of our competitors have longer operating histories and have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. They, therefore, have the advantage of established reputations, brand names, track records, back office and managerial support systems and other advantages that we cannot duplicate in the near future. Moreover, many competitors, by virtue of their longevity and capital resources, have established lines of distribution to which we do not have access, and are not likely to duplicate in the near term, if ever. 

Intellectual Property 

We rely on the AquaBall&#8482; patent, AquaBall&#8482; &#160; and Bazi&#174; trademarks and licensing agreements to market our products and make them stand out among our competitors. 

Patents and Trademarks 

We were granted the patent for AquaBall&#8482;&#8217;s stackable, spherical drink container in 2009, via GT Beverage Company, LLC, who we purchased on March 31, 2012. We maintain trademark protection for AquaBall&#8482; and have federal trademark registration for Bazi&#174;. This trademark registration is protected for a period of ten years and then is renewable thereafter if still in use. 

Licensing Agreements 

We entered into a three-year licensing agreement with Disney Consumer Products, Inc. and an 18-month licensing agreement with Marvel Characters, B.V. (collectively, the &#8220; Licensing Agreements &#8221;) in 2012. Each Licensing Agreement allows us to feature popular Disney and Marvel characters on AquaBall&#8482; Naturally Flavored Water, allowing AquaBall&#8482; to stand out among other beverages marketed towards children. Under the terms and conditions of the Licensing Agreements, we work with the Disney and Marvel teams to create colorful, eye-catching labels that surround the entire spherical shape of each AquaBall&#8482;. Once the label designs are approved, we work with Disney and Marvel to set retail calendars, rotating the placement of different AquaBall&#8482; designs over the course of the year. 

In 2015, the Company and Disney entered into a renewed Licensing Agreement, which extended the Company&#8217;s license with Disney through March 31, 2017 (the &#8220; Disney Agreement &#8221;). The terms of the Disney Agreement entitle Disney to receive a royalty rate of 5% on sales of AquaBall&#8482; Naturally Flavored Water adorned with Disney characters, paid quarterly, with a total guarantee of $450,870 over the period from April 1, 2015 through March 31, 2017. In addition, the Company is required to make a &#8216;common marketing fund&#8217; contribution equal to 1% of sales due annually during the agreement. The Company is required to spend a total of $820,000 on advertising and promotional opportunities over the term of the Disney Agreement. 

&#160;

The former Marvel Licensing Agreement (&#8220; Marvel Agreement &#8221;) stipulated a royalty rate of 5% on sales of AquaBall&#8482; Naturally Flavored Water adorned with Marvel characters, paid quarterly. The total royalty guarantee paid during the period from July 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015 was $37,500. 

On August 22, 2015, the Company and Marvel entered into a renewed Licensing Agreement to extend the Company's license t o feature certain Marvel characters on bottles of AquaBall&#8482; Naturally Flavored Water through December 31, 2017 . The Marvel Agreement requires the Company to pay to Marvel a 5% royalty rate on sales of AquaBall&#8482; Naturally Flavored Water adorned with Marvel characters, paid quarterly, through December 31, 2017, with a total guarantee of $200,000. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Government Regulations 

The production, distribution and sale in the United States of our products are subject to various U.S. federal and state regulations, including but not limited to: the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, including as amended by the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994; the Occupational Safety and Health Act; various environmental statutes; and a number of other federal, state and local statutes and regulations applicable to the production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising, marketing, labeling and ingredients of such products. 

Certain states and localities prohibit the sale of certain beverages unless a deposit or tax is charged for containers. These requirements vary by each jurisdiction. Similar legislation has been proposed in certain other states and localities, as well as by Congress. We are unable to predict whether such legislation will be enacted or what impact its enactment would have on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

All of our facilities in the United States are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Although compliance with these provisions has not had any material adverse effect on our financial or competitive position, compliance with or violation of any current or future regulations and legislation could require material expenditures or have a material adverse effect on our financial results. 

&#160;

We believe that current and reasonably foreseeable governmental regulation will have minimal impact on our business. 

&#160;

Research and Development 

No expenses were recorded on research and development for the year ended December 31, 2015. We are working with certain third parties on the development of possible future products, but these projects are funded by the respective third parties. During 2012, we developed our AquaBall&#8482; proprietary formula along with Wild Flavors, Inc., an independent third party contracted by the Company. We launched distribution and sales of the AquaBall&#8482; in June 2012. The AquaBall&#8482; did not require FDA or other regulatory approval. Following the initial launch of the AquaBall&#8482;, we continued research and development efforts to add more flavors to the AquaBall&#8482; line, and modify the AquaBall&#8482; into a zero sugar, zero calorie product. We launched the zero sugar, zero calorie line in early 2013, as well as new flavors, such as strawberry lemonade and berry.

Upon execution of the Niagara Agreement in October 2015, we completed the development of an improved &#8220;clean label&#8221; formulation of AquaBall&#8482;, which remains sugar and calorie free but has eliminated all preservatives, and will be produced by Niagara using a hot-fill process. We expect to complete the transition of AquaBall&#8482; to the new, preservative-free formulation and begin distribution from Niagara facilities in May 2016.

During 2006, Bazi&#174; was developed and was launched in January 2007. This product did not require FDA or other regulatory approval. During 2009, new ingredients and productions methods were researched to integrate into existing products or new products. Since 2012, Bazi&#174; has been and is now being sold solely online in 12, 24, 36, 48 and 144 packs.
