 Item 1. Business. 

Overview 

Agilysys is a leading technology company that provides innovative software for point-of-sale (POS), property management (PMS), inventory and procurement, workforce management, analytics, document management and mobile and wireless solutions and services to the hospitality industry. Our solutions and services allow property managers to better connect, interact and transact with their customers and enhance their customer relationships by streamlining operations, improving efficiency, increasing guest recruitment and wallet share, and enhancing the overall guest experience. We serve four major market sectors: Gaming, both corporate and tribal; Hotels, Resorts and Cruise; Foodservice Management; and Restaurants, Universities, Stadia and Healthcare. A significant portion of our consolidated revenue is derived from contract support, maintenance and subscription services. 

We operate throughout North America, Europe and Asia, with corporate services located in Alpharetta, GA, and offices in Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia and the Philippines. 

The sales of our Retail Solutions Group (RSG) business and United Kingdom business entity (UK entity) each represented a disposal of a component of an entity. As such, the operating results of RSG and the UK entity have been reported as a component of discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the twelve months ended March 31, 2014. 

Our principal executive offices are located at 425 Walnut Street, Suite 1800, Cincinnati, Ohio, 45202 and our corporate services are located at 1000 Windward Concourse, Suite 250, Alpharetta, Georgia, 30005. 

Reference herein to any particular year or quarter refers to periods within our fiscal year ended March 31. For example, fiscal 2016 refers to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016. 

History and Significant Events 

Organized in 1963 as Pioneer-Standard Electronics, Inc., an Ohio corporation, we began operations as a distributor of electronic components and, later, enterprise computer solutions. Exiting the former in fiscal 2003 with the sale of our Industrial Electronic Division, we used the proceeds to reduce debt, fund growth of our enterprise solutions business and acquire businesses focused on higher-margin and more specialized solutions for the hospitality and retail industries. At the same time, we changed our name to Agilysys, Inc. 

In fiscal 2004, we acquired Kyrus Corporation and became the leading provider of IBM retail solutions and services in the supermarket, chain drug, general retail, and hospitality segments. In that same year, the acquisition of Inter-American Data, Inc. allowed us to become the leading developer and provider of technology solutions for property and inventory management in the casino and resort industries. 

In calendar 2007, we divested KeyLink Systems and exited the enterprise computer distribution business. We used the proceeds from that sale to return cash to shareholders and fund a number of acquisitions that broadened our solutions and capabilities portfolios. We acquired InfoGenesis and Visual One Systems Corp. in calendar 2007, significantly expanding our specialized offerings to the hospitality industry through enterprise-class, POS and software solutions tailored for a variety of applications in cruise, golf, spa, gaming, lodging, resort, and catering. These offerings feature highly intuitive, secure and robust solutions, easily scalable across multiple departments or property locations. In fiscal 2008, we began reporting three primary operating segments: Hospitality Solutions Group (HSG), Retail Solutions Group (RSG) and Technology Solutions Group (TSG). 

In fiscal 2012, we sold our TSG segment and restructured our business model to focus on higher-margin, profitable growth opportunities in the hospitality and retail sectors. We also reduced our real-estate footprint and lowered overhead costs by relocating corporate services from Solon, Ohio to Alpharetta, Georgia, thus moving our senior management team closer to our operating units. 

On June 10, 2013, we acquired the assets of TimeManagement Corporation, a privately-owned Minneapolis-based provider of enterprise-wide software and service solutions that streamline workforce management environments for hospitality operators. 

On July 1, 2013, we completed the sale of our RSG business to Kyrus Solutions, Inc. (Kyrus), an affiliate of Clearlake Capital Group, L.P. Following completion of the transaction, our business focused exclusively on hospitality solutions and the growth opportunities in the hospitality market. 

On March 31, 2014, we completed the sale of our United Kingdom business entity (UK entity) to Verteda Limited (Verteda), led by the Company&#8217;s former European management team. In connection with the sale, we have entered into a multi-year distribution agreement, whereby Verteda distributes certain Agilysys products within the U.K. marketplace. We continue to manage all property management system accounts as well as key global accounts in the EMEA market. 

Today, we are focused on providing state-of-the-art, end-to-end solutions that enhance guest experiences and allow our customers to promote their respective brands. We help our customers win the guest recruitment battle and, in turn, grow revenue, reduce costs and increase efficiency. This is accomplished by developing and deploying intuitive solutions that increase speed and accuracy, thereby enabling more effective management, intelligent upselling, reduced shrinkage, improved brand recognition and better control of the customer relationship. Our strategy is to increase the proportion of revenue we derive from ongoing support and maintenance agreements, software as a subscription services, cloud applications and professional services.

Industry and Markets 

We offer specific solutions for customers of varying sizes across four major market sectors: Gaming, both corporate and tribal; Hotels, Resorts and Cruise; Foodservice Management; and Restaurants, Universities, Stadia and Healthcare. 

The hospitality industry encompasses a wide variety of market sectors and customers. We operate throughout North America, Europe and Asia, with corporate services located in Alpharetta, GA, and offices in Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia and the Philippines. Sales to customers outside of the United States represent approximately 5% of total sales. 

The hospitality industry is highly fragmented and composed by a number of defined markets including lodging, casinos, cruise ships, resorts and spas, franchise operators, restaurant chains, stadiums, and arenas, among others. For example, in the lodging segment, no single hotel brand accounts for more than 4% of all hotel rooms in the United States. According to American Hotel &#38; Lodging Association , the U.S. lodging industry generated approximately $176 billion in lodging revenue in calendar 2014, while PwC's, Hospitality Directions US 2016, reports an average of approximately 65.5% of approximately 4.9 million available rooms occupied at an average daily rate (ADR) of $120.04. This compares with 64.4% in 2014 at an ADR of $114.95. US lodging revenue further grew by 8% in 2015 (Travel Weekly). 

The hospitality business is sensitive to the strength of domestic and global economic and credit conditions. Business and destination resort travel are highly correlated with the economic conditions in their respective markets. Competition is intense for consumer spending, and hospitality industry participants are seeking ways to increase their visibility and appeal as well as enhance the experience of their guests. Our products and solutions are meant to leverage the opportunity these challenges create by providing our customers with higher degree of guest connectivity and added engagement tools that will enable them to capitalize on their brand equity better and more profitably manage their operations, and grow their business. In addition to bespoke product solutions that are designed and customized to meet unique facility or multi-facility needs, we also provide an array of support and subscription options geared towards maintaining systems and professional services for implementation and rollouts. 

We have a significant customer base in the commercial casino and gaming sector. According to Statista, US Gaming industry annual revenues surpassed $71 billion in 2015, as compared to approximately $68.7 billion in 2014. Amenities in contemporary casinos extend well beyond gaming to include a variety of entertainment and leisure options as well as modern convention centers and meeting facilities to attract the corporate market. International gaming markets are growing rapidly both in size and new jurisdictions. Asian gaming markets continue to generate robust growth. Gross gaming revenue in Macau exceeds that of the Las Vegas Strip, with a number of the current and planned properties in the region operated by U.S.-based companies. As the market share leader in providing PMS systems to casinos on the Las Vegas Strip, we are well positioned to benefit from these strong and long-standing relationships as our customer base expands into international markets. Additionally, as gaming operators migrate toward cashless operations and digital track-and-log of unique guest behavior, we are able to provide the requisite technologies and expertise to satisfy their needs. 

We also have expertise in serving the unique needs of Cruise ship operators. Guests and potential customers are expecting an experience that reflects their unique tastes, preferences and travel habits and cruise operators have seen the need to adequately support the increasing level of personalization and detail required to capture the highest level of guest satisfaction. Our products and services can best help them to deliver on this critical part of their business. According to the Cruise Lines International Association and Cruise 

Market Watch , cruise lines continued the growth trends of recent years in 2015 with Total worldwide cruise capacity at the end of 2015 at 486,385 passengers (a 7.3% increase over 2014). The worldwide cruise ship fleet currently stands at 298 ships and the current order book, covering 2015-2020, includes 55 new builds. The industry carried over 22.2 million passengers in 2015, up from nearly 21.5 million passengers in 2014. 

Customers 

Our customers include large, medium-sized and boutique companies, and divisions or departments of large corporations in the hospitality industry. We concentrate on serving the needs of customers in a range of customer-focused settings where brand differentiation is important, particularly in the lodging, casino, destination resort, cruise line, foodservice industries where competition for guest recruitment is intense. Our current customer base is highly fragmented, with one customer representing approximately 10% of consolidated revenue from continuing operations as of March 31, 2016. 

Seasonality 

We have traditionally experienced seasonal revenue weakness during our fiscal first quarter ending June 30. Additionally, the timing of large one-time orders, such as those associated with significant remarketed product sales around large customer refresh cycles or significant volume rollouts, occasionally creates volatility in our quarterly results. 

Competition 

Our solutions face a highly competitive market. Competition exists with respect to developing and maintaining relationships with customers, pricing for products and solutions, and customer support and service. 

We compete with other full-service providers that sell and service bundled POS and PMS solutions comprised of hardware, software, support and services. These companies, some of which are much larger than we are, include Oracle Corp., NCR, Constellation Software, Inc. and Infor. We also compete with software companies like IDeaS Revenue Solutions, POSitouch, Northwind and Xpient Solutions. In addition, we compete with PMS systems that are designed and maintained in-house by large hotel chains. 

Environmental Matters 

We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable environmental laws. Presently, we do not anticipate that such compliance will have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position with respect to any of our operations. 

Employees 

As of May 30, 2016, we had 553 employees. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements, have had no strikes or work stoppages and consider our employee relations to be good.
