Berkshire is a regional bank and financial services company providing the service capabilities of a larger institution and the focus and responsiveness of a local partner to its communities. The Company seeks to distinguish itself based on the following attributes: 

&#8226; Diversified revenue drivers and controlled expenses 

&#8226; Well positioned footprint in attractive markets 

&#8226; AMEB culture 

&#8226; Solid internal capital generation supports growth 

&#8226; Focused on long-term profitability goals and shareholder value 

&#8226; Acquisition disciplines a strength in a consolidating market 

The Bank operates under the brand of America&#8217;s Most Exciting Bank &#174; providing an engaging and innovative customer experience driven by its AMEB culture which is: 

The Bank has 93 full-service banking offices in its New England and upstate New York footprint, which extends along Interstate 90 from Boston to Syracuse, and along Interstate 91 from Hartford into Vermont. The Bank also has commercial and retail lending offices located in Eastern Massachusetts. The Company&#8217;s operations include those acquired as a result of four bank mergers in 2011 through 2012, a mortgage banking company acquisition in 2012, the acquisition of 20 New York branches in 2014, and the acquisition of Hampden Bancorp, Inc. (&#8220;Hampden&#8221;), in the second quarter of 2015. 

To augment its commercial lending operations, the Company acquired all of the outstanding equity of Firestone Financial Corp. (&#8220;Firestone&#8221;), which now operates as a subsidiary of Berkshire Bank. Firestone is a commercial specialty finance company providing secured installment loan equipment financing for small and medium-sized businesses. Firestone originates commercial and industrial loans to a national customer base in several niche industries. 

On October 27, 2015, the Company entered into a purchase and assumption agreement with 44 Business Capital, LLC (&#8220;44 Business Capital&#8221;) and Parke Bank. The Company will acquire the business model of 44 Business Capital and certain other assets of Parke Bank's SBA 7(a) loan program operations. The Company has agreed to purchase certain small business loans from Parke Bank. The transaction is subject to receipt of required regulatory approvals and is expected to be completed during the first six months of 2016. 

The Bank serves the following regions: 

&#8226; 

Western New England , with 23 banking offices, including the Company&#8217;s headquarters in Pittsfield, Mass. This region includes Berkshire County, Mass., which is the Company&#8217;s traditional market, where it has a leading market share in many of its product lines. This region also includes Southern Vermont, and many of the region&#8217;s branches are in communities close to Route 7, which runs north/south through the valleys to the west of the Berkshire Hills and Green Mountains. This region is within commuting range of both Albany, N.Y., and Springfield, Mass., and is known throughout the world as a tourist and recreational destination area, with vacation and second home traffic from Boston and New York City. The Pittsfield 2014 MSA GDP totaled $6 billion. 

&#8226; 

New York, &#32;with 43 banking offices serving the Albany Capital District and Central New York. Albany is the state capital and is part of New York&#8217;s Tech Valley which is gaining prominence as a world technology hub including leading edge nanotechnology initiatives representing a blend of private enterprise and public investment. The Company&#8217;s Central New York area includes operations in the Rome/Utica MSA and in the Syracuse MSA. These are markets along Interstate 90 with longstanding local industries and expansion influences from the Albany Capital District. The Albany/Schenectady 2014 MSA GDP was $49 billion, and the Rome/Utica/Syracuse total 2014 MSA GDP was $42 billion. 

&#8226; 

Hartford/Springfield, &#32;with 25 banking offices serving the market along the Connecticut River in this region, which is the second largest economic area in New England. This region is centrally located between Boston and New York City at the crossroads of Interstate 91, which traverses the length of New England, and Interstate 90, which traverses the width of Massachusetts. This region also has easy access to Bradley International Airport, which is a major airport serving central New England. The Springfield area is receiving major commercial investment including the first Massachusetts casino/entertainment complex, railcar manufacturing, and highway development. The Hartford/Springfield combined 2014 MSA GDP was $110 billion. 

&#8226; 

Eastern Massachusetts, &#32;with lending offices and two branch offices located in towns west and north of Boston. Eastern Massachusetts is the largest economic area in New England, and the Company&#8217;s banking operations extend from Worcester within the commuting and commerce area of Boston, east to Boston and its suburbs. Boston is viewed as a leading commercial real estate market nationally, including foreign demand for commercial and multifamily properties. The Bank&#8217;s Asset Based Lending Group is headquartered in this region, and serves middle market businesses throughout the Company&#8217;s footprint. The Boston/Worcester combined 2014 MSA GDP was $420 billion. 

During 2015, the Company continued to execute its strategy to align individual branch profitability within the context of the breadth of its footprint as a core competency. The Company sold or consolidated eight branches during the year, including three acquired from Hampden. The Company also sold its Tennessee operations and consolidated three other branches in its New York and Springfield markets. The Company expects to further execute this strategy in 2016 through continued analysis of sale and consolidation opportunities. 

Shown below is information about total loans and deposits within the Company&#8217;s New England/New York footprint, by region, as of year-end 2015. 

These regions are viewed as having favorable demographics and provide an attractive regional niche for the Bank to distinguish itself from larger national and super-regional banks, as well as from smaller community banks, while serving its market area. The Bank is the only locally headquartered regional bank serving this footprint. The Company views its footprint as comparatively stable, with modest economic growth prospects in rural areas and higher growth prospects in more developed areas. The strongest growth is expected to be in Eastern Massachusetts and the New York Capital District. The Company views itself as positioned to take advantage of the best growth opportunities as they develop across its geography. The Company&#8217;s regions have competitive economic strengths in precision manufacturing, distribution, technology, health care, and education which are expected to continue to support above average personal incomes and wealth. As a result of its growth, the Company has increased and diversified its revenues both geographically and by product type and this has improved its flexibility in pursuing growth opportunities as they arise. The Company believes it has attractive long-term growth prospects because of the 

Bank&#8217;s positioning as one of the leading regional banks in its markets with the ability to serve retail and commercial customers with a strong product set and responsive local management. The Company also has a goal to deepen its wallet share as a result of its focused cross sales program across its various business lines including insurance and wealth management. 

&#160; 

The Company has recruited executives with experience in regional bank management and has augmented its management team as it has expanded into a diversified regional financial services provider. In addition to business acquisitions, Berkshire&#8217;s expansion has been based on team and talent recruitment. The Company also pursues organic growth through ongoing business development, de novo branching, and product development. The Bank promotes itself as America&#8217;s Most Exciting Bank&#174; 

. Its vision is to excel as a high performing market leader with the right people, attitude, and energy providing an engaging and exciting customer and team member experience. This brand and culture statement is expected to drive customer engagement, loyalty, market share, and profitability. 

&#160; 

The Company offers a wide range of deposit, lending, insurance, and wealth management products to retail, commercial, not-for-profit, and municipal customers in its market areas. The Company&#8217;s product offerings also include retail and commercial electronic banking, commercial cash management, and commercial interest rate swaps. The Company stresses a culture of teamwork and performance excellence to produce customer satisfaction to support its strategic growth and profitability. The Company utilizes Six Sigma tools to improve operational effectiveness and efficiency. The Company converted its core banking systems to a new scalable technology platform in 2012, with goals to enhance service, efficiency, reliability, customer relationship management, distribution channels, product quality, and revenue generation. The systems provide deeper and more granular customer and operational data that Berkshire is mining in order to better inform its strategic direction and business execution. Berkshire has also expanded its mobile banking and remote capture offerings and utilizes its web site and online banking tools to extend the convenience that it offers to customers.

&#160; 

COMPETITION 

The Company is subject to strong competition from banks and other financial institutions and financial service providers. Its competition includes national and super-regional banks. Non-bank competitors include credit unions, brokerage firms, insurance providers, financial planners, and the mutual fund industry. New technology is reshaping customer interaction with financial service providers and the increase of internet-accessible financial institutions increases competition for the Company&#8217;s customers. The Company generally competes on the basis of customer service, relationship management, and the fair pricing of loan and deposit products and wealth management and insurance services. The location and convenience of branch offices is also a significant competitive factor, particularly regarding new offices. The Company does not rely on any individual, group, or entity for a material portion of its deposits. 

&#160; 

LENDING ACTIVITIES 

General. &#32;The Bank originates loans in the four basic portfolio categories discussed below. Lending activities are limited by federal and state laws and regulations. Loan interest rates and other key loan terms are affected principally by the Bank&#8217;s credit policy, asset/liability strategy, loan demand, competition, and the supply of money available for lending purposes. These factors, in turn, are affected by general and economic conditions, monetary policies of the federal government, including the Federal Reserve, legislative tax policies, and governmental budgetary matters. Most of the Bank&#8217;s loans are made in its market areas and are secured by real estate located in its market areas. Lending is therefore affected by activity in these real estate markets. The Bank does not engage in subprime lending activities. The Bank monitors and manages the amount of long-term fixed-rate lending volume. Adjustable-rate loan products generally reduce interest rate risk but may produce higher loan losses in the event of sustained rate increases. The Bank retains most of the loans it originates, although the Bank generally sells its originations of conforming fixed rate residential mortgages. The Bank also conducts wholesale purchases and sales of loans and loan participations generally with other banks doing business in its markets. The Bank&#8217;s loan portfolio includes loans acquired in recent business combinations and such loans generally conform to the loans from the Bank&#8217;s business activities. 

Loan Portfolio Analysis. &#32;The following table sets forth the year-end composition of the Bank&#8217;s loan portfolio in dollar amounts and as a percentage of the portfolio at the dates indicated. Further information about the composition of the loan portfolio is contained in the Loans footnote in the consolidated financial statements.

&#160; 

Residential Mortgages. The Bank offers fixed-rate and adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans with maturities of up to 30 years that are fully amortizing with monthly loan payments. Berkshire&#8217;s loan products are available through FNMA, FHLMC, government insured, and state programs. In addition, the Bank offers a suite of portfolio products through Berkshire Bank. Berkshire Bank is an in-house Direct Endorsed Lender for FHA. It also offers VA, USDA, FHA Reverse, State Housing, Home Path, HARP, and other government sponsored mortgage programs. The Company targets that its programs and pricing are highly competitive in the marketplace as it pursues opportunities to expand market share in its footprint. 

&#160; 

Residential mortgages are generally underwritten according to the Federal National Mortgage Association (&#8220;Fannie Mae&#8221;) or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Association (&#8220;Freddie Mac&#8221;) guidelines for loans they designate as &#8220;A&#8221; or &#8220;A-&#8221; (these are referred to as &#8220;conforming loans&#8221;). Private mortgage insurance is generally required for loans with loan-to-value ratios in excess of 80%. The Bank also originates loans above conforming loan amount limits, referred to as &#8220;jumbo loans,&#8221; which are generally conforming to secondary market guidelines for these loans. The Bank does not offer subprime mortgage lending programs. 

&#160; 

The Bank generally sells most of its newly originated conforming fixed rate mortgages. It also purchases or sells seasoned mortgage loans in the secondary mortgage market when opportunities become available. The Bank is approved as a direct seller to Fannie Mae, retaining the servicing rights. The majority of the Bank&#8217;s secondary marketing is to national institutional secondary market investors on a servicing-released basis. Sales of mortgages generally involve customary representations and warranties and are nonrecourse in the event of borrower default. The Bank is also an approved originator of loans for sale to the Federal Housing Administration (&#8220;FHA&#8221;), U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs (&#8220;VA&#8221;), and state housing agency programs. 

&#160; 

The Bank offers adjustable rate (&#8220;ARM&#8221;) mortgages which do not contain interest-only or negative amortization features. After an initial term of six months to 10 years, the rates on these loans generally reset every year based upon a contractual spread or margin above the average yield on U.S. Treasury securities. ARM loan interest rates may rise as interest rates rise, thereby increasing the potential for default. At year-end 2015, the Bank&#8217;s adjustable rate mortgage portfolio totaled $544 million. The Bank also originates loans to individuals for the construction and acquisition of personal residences. These loans generally provide 15-month construction periods followed by a permanent mortgage loan, and follow the Bank&#8217;s normal mortgage underwriting guidelines. 

&#160; 

Following its purchase of a mortgage banking company in 2012, the Bank has expanded its residential mortgage program and in 2014 rebranded the program as Berkshire Home Lending. Berkshire Bank is the preferred mortgage lender for the Massachusetts Teachers Association, and has been among the top ten banks in Massachusetts and Rhode Island for residential mortgage volume in certain periods in recent years. 

Commercial Real Estate. &#32;The Bank originates commercial real estate loans on properties used for business purposes such as small office buildings, industrial, healthcare, lodging, recreation, or retail facilities. This portfolio also includes commercial 1-4 family and multifamily properties. Loans may generally be made with amortizations of up to 25 years and with interest rates that adjust periodically (primarily from short-term to five years). Most commercial real estate loans are originated with final maturities of 10 years or less. As part of its business activities, the Bank also enters into commercial loan participations with regional and national banks and purchases and sells commercial loans in its footprint. 

&#160; 

Commercial real estate loans are among the largest of the bank&#8217;s loans, and may have higher credit risk and lending spreads.The Company believed that its competitive advantage for new originations was strongest in the $5-10 million size range. Because repayment is often dependent on the successful operation or management of the properties, repayment of such loans may be affected by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. The Bank seeks to minimize these risks through strict adherence to its underwriting standards and portfolio management processes. The Bank generally requires that borrowers have debt service coverage ratios (the ratio of available cash flows before debt service to debt service) of at least 1.25 times based on stabilized cash flows of leases in place, with some exceptions for national credit tenants. For variable rate loans, the Bank underwrites debt service coverage to interest rate shocks of 300 basis points or higher based on a minimum of 1.0 times coverage and it uses loan maturities to manage risk based on the lease base and interest sensitivity. Loans at origination may be made up to 80% of appraised value based on property type and risk, with sublimits of 75% or less for designated specialty property types. Generally, commercial real estate loans require personal guarantees by the principals. Credit enhancements in the form of additional collateral or guarantees are normally considered for start-up businesses without a qualifying cash flow history. 

&#160; 

The Bank offers interest rate swaps to certain larger commercial mortgage borrowers. These swaps allow the Bank to originate a mortgage based on short-term LIBOR rates and allow the borrower to swap into a longer-term fixed rate. The Bank simultaneously sells an offsetting back-to-back swap to an investment grade national bank so that it does not retain this fixed-rate risk. The Bank also records fee income on these interest rate swaps based on the terms of the offsetting swaps with the bank counterparties. 

&#160; 

The Bank originates construction loans to developers and commercial borrowers in and around its markets. The maximum loan to value limits for construction loans follow FDIC supervisory limits, up to a maximum of 80 percent. The Bank commits to provide the permanent mortgage financing on most of its construction loans on income-producing property. Advances on construction loans are made in accordance with a schedule reflecting the cost of the improvements. Construction loans include land acquisition loans up to a maximum 50 percent loan to value on raw land. Construction loans may have greater credit risk due to the dependence on completion of construction and other real estate improvements, as well as the sale or rental of the improved property. The Bank generally mitigates these risks with presale or preleasing requirements and phasing of construction. 

&#160; 

Commercial and Industrial Loans. &#32;The Bank offers secured commercial term loans with repayment terms which are normally limited to the expected useful life of the asset being financed, and generally not exceeding ten years. The Bank also offers revolving loans, lines of credit, letters of credit, time notes and Small Business Administration guaranteed loans. Business lines of credit have adjustable rates of interest and are payable on demand, subject to annual review and renewal. Commercial and industrial loans are generally secured by a variety of collateral such as accounts receivable, inventory and equipment, and are generally supported by personal guarantees. Loan-to-value ratios depend on the collateral type and generally do not exceed 80 percent of orderly liquidation value. Some commercial loans may also be secured by liens on real estate. The Bank generally does not make unsecured commercial loans. Commercial loans are of higher risk and are made primarily on the basis of the borrower&#8217;s ability to make repayment from the cash flows of its business. Further, any collateral securing such loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to monitor and appraise and may fluctuate in value. The Bank gives additional consideration to the borrower&#8217;s credit history and the guarantor&#8217;s capacity to help mitigate these risks. Additionally, the Bank uses loan structures including shorter terms, amortizations, and advance rate limitations to additionally mitigate credit risk. 

&#160; 

The Asset Based Lending Group serves the commercial middle market in New England, as well as the Bank&#8217;s market in northeastern New York. This group expands the Bank&#8217;s business lending offerings to include revolving lines of credit and term loans secured by accounts receivable, inventory, and other assets to manufacturers, distributors and select service companies experiencing seasonal working capital needs, rapid sales growth, a turnaround, buyout or recapitalization with credit needs ranging from $2 to $25 million. Asset based lending involves monitoring loan collateral so that outstanding balances are always properly secured by business assets, which reduces the risks associated with these loans. 

&#160; 

The acquisition of Firestone Financial in the third quarter of 2015 allowed the Company to expand its specialty commercial and industrial lending. Firestone originates loans secured by business-essential equipment through over 160 equipment distributors and manufacturers and directly via the end borrower in all fifty states. Key customer segments include the fitness, carnival, 

gaming, and entertainment industries. These loans function similarly to the Bank&#8217;s commercial and industrial portfolio. However, some credits have payment schedules tailored to the meet the needs of the seasonality of these borrowers&#8217; businesses. These loans generally have higher interest rates than the Bank's other commercial loans, reflecting the niche expertise required in servicing these industries. 

The Bank also reorganized its small business lending function to include the retail division in the origination of conforming small business loans in order to provide the best service to community businesses. The small business lending program is for businesses generally with annual revenues of up to $10 million and whose loan relationship with the bank is $2 million or less. The program has two distinct thresholds: branch originated loans for borrowers with revenues of $2 million or less, total loan relationship with the bank is $250 thousand or less -- and loan requests are $50 thousand or less for lines of credit and $100 thousand or less for term loans; and Business Banker originated loans for borrowers with revenues of $10 million or less, total loan relationship is $2 million or less and loan requests up to $2 million for all lending products. The program also handles an exception managed loan portfolio for loans and loan relationships under $250 thousand which require limited documentation to provide timely credit to small businesses. 

With the acquisition of 44 Business Capital, which is expected to close in the first six months of 2016, the Company intends to expand its small business lending operations to a national customer footprint. With increased originations, the Company expects to actively sell many of these credits in the secondary market. 

Consumer Loans. The Bank&#8217;s consumer loans consist principally of home equity lines of credit and indirect automobile loans, together with second mortgage loans and other consumer loans. The Bank&#8217;s home equity lines of credit are typically secured by first or second mortgages on borrowers&#8217; residences. Home equity lines have an initial revolving period up to 15 years, followed by an amortizing term up to 20 years. These loans are normally indexed to the prime rate. Home equity loans also include amortizing fixed-rate second mortgages with terms up to 15 years. Lending policies for combined debt service and collateral coverage are similar to those used for residential first mortgages, although underwriting verifications are more streamlined. The maximum combined loan-to-value is 85 percent. Home equity line credit risks include the risk that higher interest rates will affect repayment and possible compression of collateral coverage on second lien home equity lines. Acquired operations of Beacon Federal in 2012 included a significant consumer lending function focused on indirect originations of automobile loans, primarily in central New York. For new automobiles, the amount financed could be up to 100 percent of the value of the vehicle, plus applicable taxes and dealer charges (i.e., warranty and insurance charges). For used automobiles, the amount of the loan was limited to the &#8220;loan value&#8221; of the vehicle, as established by industry guides. Beginning in the latter part of 2013, the Bank decided to de-emphasize originations of super-prime loans, and as a result, the indirect portfolio has been declining. In the third quarter of 2015, the Bank recruited a senior leader for this business line to develop an indirect program in New England and New York for prime auto loans with a goal of later developing a secondary marketing program to further support this activity.

For the $1.0 billion of loans above which mature in more than one year, $253 million of these loans are fixed-rate and $837 million are variable rate. 

Loan Administration. &#32;Lending activities are governed by a loan policy approved by the Board&#8217;s Risk Management Committee. Internal staff perform and monitor post-closing loan documentation review, quality control, and commercial loan administration. The lending staff assigns a risk rating to all commercial loans, excluding point scored small business loans. Management primarily relies on internal risk management staff to review the risk ratings of the majority of commercial loan balances. 

The Bank&#8217;s lending activities follow written, non-discriminatory underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by the Risk Management Committee and Management. The Bank&#8217;s loan underwriting is based on a review of certain factors including risk ratings, recourse, loan-to-value ratios, and material policy exceptions. The Risk Management Committee has established individual and combined loan limits and lending approval authorities. Management&#8217;s Executive Loan Committee is responsible for commercial and residential loan approvals in accordance with these standards and procedures. Generally, commercial lending management has the authority to approve pass rated secured loans (with normal credit risk) up to $1 million, in conjunction with a Credit Officer up to $4.5 million and in conjunction with the Chief Credit Officer up to $10 million. The Chief Credit Officer has the authority to approve up to $7.5 million for pass rated credits with major policy exceptions and pass/watch rated credits and up to $2.5 million for special mention rated credits. The Executive Loan Committee approves secured loans over these amounts (and over $1.5 million unsecured). The Bank tracks exceptions that are approved to loan underwriting standards and exception reports are actively monitored by executive lending management. In 2015, the Bank promoted its Chief Risk Officer to President of the Bank and recruited an experienced credit professional to the position of Chief Risk Officer. 

&#160; 

The Bank&#8217;s lending activities are conducted by its salaried and commissioned loan personnel. Designated salaried branch staff originate conforming residential mortgages and receive bonuses based on overall performance. Additionally, the Bank employs commissioned residential mortgage originators. Commercial lenders receive salaries and are eligible for bonuses based on individual and overall performance. The Bank purchases whole loans and participations in loans from banks headquartered in its market and from outside of its market. These loans are underwritten according to the Bank&#8217;s underwriting criteria and procedures and are generally serviced by the originating lender under terms of the applicable agreement. The Bank routinely sells newly originated, fixed-rate residential mortgages in the secondary market. Customer rate locks are offered without charge and rate locked applications are generally committed for forward sale or hedged with derivative financial instruments to minimize interest rate risk pending delivery of the loans to the investors. The Bank also sells residential mortgages and commercial loan participations on a non-recourse basis. The Bank issues loan commitments to its prospective borrowers conditioned on the occurrence of certain events. Loan origination commitments are made in writing on specified terms and conditions and are generally honored for up to 60 days from approval; some commercial commitments are made for longer terms. The Company also monitors pipelines of loan applications and has processes for issuing letters of interest for commercial loans and preapprovals for residential mortgages, all of which are generally conditional on completion of underwriting prior to the issuance of formal commitments. 

&#160; 

The loan policy sets certain limits on concentrations of credit and requires periodic reporting of concentrations to the Risk Management Committee. In most cases, the commercial loan hold limit is 5% of risk based capital for loan transactions and 8% of risk based capital for lending relationships. Loans outstanding to the ten largest relationships averaged $24.2 million each, or 3.8% of the Bank's risk based capital at year-end 2015. The Bank also actively monitors its 25 largest borrower relationships. Commercial real estate is generally managed within federal regulatory monitoring guidelines of 300% of risk based capital for commercial real estate and 100% for commercial construction loans. At year-end 2015, non-owner occupied commercial real estate totaled 227% of Bank risk based capital and outstanding commercial construction loans were 39% of Bank risk based capital. The Bank has hold limits for several categories of commercial specialty lending including healthcare, hospitality, designated franchises, and leasing, as well as hold limits for designated commercial loan participations purchased. In most cases, these limits are below 100% of risk based capital for all outstandings in each monitored category. 

&#160; 

Problem Assets. &#32;The Bank prefers to work with borrowers to resolve problems rather than proceeding to foreclosure. For commercial loans, this may result in a period of forbearance or restructuring of the loan, which is normally done at current market terms and does not result in a &#8220;troubled&#8221; loan designation. For residential mortgage loans, the Bank generally follows FDIC guidelines to attempt a restructuring that will enable owner-occupants to remain in their home. However, if these processes fail to result in a performing loan, then the Bank generally will initiate foreclosure or other proceedings no later than the 90th day of a delinquency, as necessary, to minimize any potential loss. Management reports delinquent loans and non-performing assets to the Board quarterly. Loans are generally removed from accruing status when they reach 90 days delinquent, except for certain loans which are well secured and in the process of collection. All loan collections are managed through the Bank&#8217;s special assets group, except for consumer loan collections, which are managed by the Retail group and Firestone collections, which are handled by that subsidiary. 

&#160; 

Real estate acquired by the Bank as a result of loan collections is classified as real estate owned until sold. When property is acquired it is recorded at fair market value less estimated selling costs at the date of foreclosure, establishing a new cost basis. Holding costs and decreases in fair value after acquisition are expensed. Interest income that would have been recorded for 2015 if non-accruing loans had been current according to their original terms, amounted to $0.8 million. Included in the amount is $177 thousand related to troubled debt restructurings. The amount of interest income on those loans that was recognized in net income in 2015 was $0.1 million. Included in this amount is $95 thousand related to troubled debt restructurings. Interest 

income on accruing troubled debt restructurings totaled $0.8 million for 2015. The total carrying value of troubled debt restructurings was $22.0 million at year-end. 

The following table sets forth additional information on year-end problem assets and accruing troubled debt restructurings (&#8220;TDR&#8221;). Due to accounting standards for business combinations, non-accrual loans of acquired banks are recorded as accruing on the acquisition date. Therefore, measures related to accruing and non-accruing loans reflect these standards and may not be comparable to prior periods.

Asset Classification and Delinquencies. The Bank performs an internal analysis of its commercial loan portfolio and assets to classify such loans and assets in a manner similar to that employed by federal banking regulators. There are four classifications for loans with higher than normal risk: Loss, Doubtful, Substandard, and Special Mention. Usually an asset classified as Loss is fully charged-off. Substandard assets have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful assets have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values questionable, and there is a high possibility of loss. Assets that do not currently expose the insured institution to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories, but possess weaknesses, are designated Special Mention. Please see the additional discussion of non-accruing and potential problem loans in Item 7 and additional information in the Loan Loss Allowance Note to the consolidated financial statements. Impaired loans acquired in business combinations are normally rated Substandard or lower and the fair value assigned to such loans at acquisition includes a component for the possibility of loss if deficiencies are not corrected. 

&#160; 

Allowance for Loan Losses. &#32;The Bank&#8217;s loan portfolio is regularly reviewed by management to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. The allowance represents management&#8217;s estimate of inherent losses that are probable and estimable as of the date of the financial statements. The allowance includes a specific component for impaired loans (a &#8220;specific loan loss reserve&#8221;) and a general component for portfolios of all outstanding loans (a &#8220;general loan loss reserve&#8221;). At the time of acquisition, no allowance for loan losses is assigned to loans acquired in business combinations. These loans are carried at fair value, including the impact of expected losses, as of the acquisition date. An allowance on such loans is established subsequent to the acquisition date through the provision for loan losses based on an analysis of factors including environmental factors. The loan loss allowance is discussed further in the Note about Significant Accounting Policies in the consolidated financial statements. 

&#160; 

Management believes that it uses the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses. However, future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary, and results of operations could be adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making its determinations. Because the estimation of inherent losses cannot be made with certainty, there can be no assurance that the existing allowance for loan losses is adequate or that increases will not be necessary should the quality of any loan or loan portfolio category deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed above. Additionally, the regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, also periodically review 

the Bank&#8217;s allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require the Bank to make additional provisions for estimated losses based upon judgments different from those of management. Any material increase in the allowance for loan losses may adversely affect the Bank&#8217;s financial condition and results of operations. 

The following table presents an analysis of the allowance for loan losses for the five years indicated:

The following tables present year-end data for the approximate allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan categories at the dates indicated (including an apportionment of any unallocated amount). The first table shows for each category the amount of the allowance allocated to that category as a percentage of the outstanding loans in that category. The second table shows the allocated allowance together with the percentage of loans in each category to total loans. Management believes that the allowance can be allocated by category only on an approximate basis. The allocation of the allowance to each category is not indicative of future losses and does not restrict the use of any of the allowance to absorb losses in any category. Due to the impact of accounting standards for acquired loans, data in the accompanying tables may not be comparable between accounting periods.

INVESTMENT SECURITIES ACTIVITIES 

&#160; 

The securities portfolio provides cash flow to protect the safety of customer deposits and as a potential source of liquidity. The portfolio is also used to manage interest rate risk and to earn a reasonable return on investment. Decisions are made in accordance with the Company&#8217;s investment policy and include consideration of risk, return, duration, and portfolio concentrations. Day-to-day oversight of the portfolio rests with the Chief Financial Officer and the Treasurer. The Enterprise Risk Management/Asset-Liability Committee meets multiple times each quarter and reviews investment strategies. The Risk Management and Capital Committee of the Board of Directors provides general oversight of the investment function. 

&#160; 

The Company has historically maintained a high-quality portfolio of managed duration mortgage-backed securities, together with a portfolio of municipal bonds including national and local issuers and local economic development bonds issued to non-profit organizations. Nearly all of the mortgage-backed securities are issued by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, and consisting principally of collateralized mortgage obligations (generally consisting of planned amortization class bonds). Other than securities issued by the above agencies, no other issuer concentrations exceeding 10% of stockholders&#8217; equity existed at year-end 2015. The municipal portfolio provides tax-advantaged yield, and the local economic development bonds were originated by the Company to area borrowers. All of the Company&#8217;s available for sale municipal securities are investment-grade rated and most of the portfolio carries credit enhancement protection. The Company invests in investment grade corporate bonds and non-investment grade fixed-income securities consisting primarily of capital instruments issued by local and regional financial institutions and a mutual fund investing in non-investment grade bonds of national corporate issuers. The Company also invests in equity securities of local financial institutions, including those that might be future potential partners, as well as dividend yielding equity securities of national corporate exchange traded issuers. Historically, the Company acquired equity securities in the Bank, which was allowed under its savings bank charter. As a result of the Bank's charter change in 2014, the Bank can no longer purchase equity securities. Due to the higher financing costs at the holding company and changes in risk based capital calculations, the Company decreased its total holdings of equity securities in 2015. The Company owns restricted equity in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston (&#8220;FHLBB&#8221;) based on its operating relationship with the FHLBB. The Company owns an interest rate swap against a tax advantaged economic development bond issued to a local not-for-profit organization, and as a result this security is carried as a trading account security. The Bank did not record any write-downs of investment securities during the year and none of the Company&#8217;s investment securities were other-than-temporarily impaired at year-end. The Company generally designates investment securities as available for sale, but sometimes designates municipal bonds and similar securities as held to maturity based on its intent. This also allows the Company to more effectively manage the potential impact of longer-duration, fixed-rate securities on stockholders' equity in the event of rising interest rates. 

The following tables present the year-end amortized cost and fair value of the Company&#8217;s securities, by type of security, for the three years indicated.

The schedule includes available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities, as well as the trading security and restricted equity securities. 

The following table summarizes year-end 2015 amortized cost, weighted average yields, and contractual maturities of debt securities. Yields are shown on a fully taxable equivalent basis. A significant portion of the mortgage-based securities are planned amortization class bonds. Their expected durations are 3-5 years at current interest rates, but the contractual maturities shown reflect the underlying maturities of the collateral mortgages. Additionally, the mortgage-based securities maturities shown below are based on final maturities and do not include scheduled amortization. Yields include amortization and accretion of premiums and discounts.

DEPOSIT ACTIVITIES AND OTHER SOURCES OF FUNDS 

&#160; 

Deposits are the major source of funds for the Bank&#8217;s lending and investment activities. Deposit accounts are the primary product and service interaction with the Bank&#8217;s customers. The Bank serves personal, commercial, non-profit, and municipal deposit customers. Most of the Bank&#8217;s deposits are generated from the areas surrounding its branch offices. The Bank offers a wide variety of deposit accounts with a range of interest rates and terms. The Bank also periodically offers promotional interest rates and terms for limited periods of time. The Bank&#8217;s deposit accounts consist of demand deposits (non-interest-bearing checking), NOW (interest-bearing checking), regular savings, money market savings, and time certificates of deposit. The Bank emphasizes its transaction deposits -- checking and NOW accounts -- for personal accounts and checking accounts promoted to businesses. These accounts have the lowest marginal cost to the Bank and are also often a core account for a customer relationship. The Bank offers a courtesy overdraft program to improve customer service, and also provides debit cards and other electronic fee producing payment services to transaction account customers. The Bank promotes remote deposit capture devices so that commercial accounts can make deposits from their place of business. Additionally, the Bank offers a variety of retirement deposit accounts to personal and business customers. Deposit related fees are a significant source of fee income to the Bank, including overdraft and interchange fees related to debit card usage. Deposit service fee income also includes other miscellaneous transaction and convenience services sold to customers through the branch system as part of an overall service relationship. The Bank offers compensating balance arrangements for larger business customers as an alternative to fees charged for checking account services. Berkshire&#8217;s Business Connection is a personal financial services benefit package designed for the employees of its business customers. In addition to providing service through its branches, Berkshire provides services to deposit customers through its private bankers, MyBankers, commercial/small business relationship managers, and call center representatives. 

&#160; 

The Bank&#8217;s deposits are insured by the FDIC. The Bank has in the past offered additional 100 percent deposit insurance at no charge to customers through the Massachusetts Deposit Insurance Fund (&#8220;DIF&#8221;). The Bank terminated its participation in this fund in 2014 and the related insurance protection was phased out in 2015. The Bank began using brokered deposits more actively in 2014 and continued to expand this funds source in 2015 in order to broaden its funding base, augment its interest rate risk management vehicles, and to support loan growth. The primary source of brokered deposits is time deposits, which increased from $23 million at year-end 2013 to $380 million at year-end 2014 and $784 million at year-end 2015. The Bank also expanded its use of brokered reciprocal money market deposits to provide additional deposit protection to certain large commercial and institutional accounts. These balances are viewed as part of overall relationship balances with regional customers. These deposits increased from $9 million at year-end 2014 to $102 million at year-end 2015. Brokered deposits are sourced through four Board approved brokers; these deposits are viewed as potentially more volatile than other deposits and are managed as a component of the Bank's liquidity policies. 

The following table presents information concerning average balances and weighted average interest rates on the Bank&#8217;s interest-bearing deposit accounts for the years indicated. Deposit amounts in the following tables include balances associated with discontinued operations.

The Company also uses borrowings from the FHLBB as an additional source of funding, particularly for daily cash management and for funding longer duration assets. FHLBB advances also provide more pricing and option alternatives for particular asset/liability needs. The FHLBB functions as a central reserve bank providing credit for member institutions. As an FHLBB member, the Company is required to own capital stock of the organization. Borrowings from this institution are secured by a blanket lien on most of the Bank&#8217;s mortgage loans and mortgage-related securities, as well as certain other assets. Advances are made under several different credit programs with different lending standards, interest rates, and range of maturities. The Company has a $15 million trust preferred obligation outstanding as well as $74 million in senior subordinated notes. The Company&#8217;s common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Subject to certain limitations, the Company can also choose to issue common stock in public stock offerings and can also potentially obtain privately placed common and preferred stock, and subordinated, and senior debt from institutional and private investors. The Company maintains a universal shelf registration with the SEC to facilitate future potential capital issuances. 

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 

&#160; 

The Company uses interest rate swap instruments for its own account to fix the interest rate on some of its borrowings, all of which are designated as cash flow hedges. The Company also offers interest rate swaps to commercial loan customers who wish to fix the interest rates on their loans, and the Company backs these swaps with offsetting swaps with national bank counterparties. With other lending institutions, the Company engages in risk participation agreements. These arrangements are structured similarly to its swaps with commercial borrowers, but a different bank is the lead underwriter. The Company gets paid a fee to take on the risk associated with having to make the lead bank whole on Berkshire&#8217;s portion of the pro-rated swap should the borrower default. These swaps are designated as economic hedges. 

Additionally, the Company&#8217;s mortgage banking activities result in derivatives. Interest rate lock commitments are provided on applications for residential mortgages intended for resale and are accounted for as non-hedging derivatives. The Company arranges offsetting forward sales commitments for most of these rate-locks with national bank counterparties, which are 

designated as economic hedges. Rate locks provided for applications intended to be held for investment are not accounted for as derivative financial instruments.The Company has a policy for managing its derivative financial instruments, and the policy and program activity are overseen by the Risk Management and Capital Committee. Derivative financial instruments with counterparties which are not customers are limited to a select number of national financial institutions. Collateral may be required based on financial condition tests. The Company works with third-party firms which assist in marketing derivative transactions, executing transactions, and providing information for bookkeeping and accounting purposes.

Berkshire continues to develop its staffing, including staff for new branches and hires related to team development. The Company has also developed staff with targeted skills to deepen the Company&#8217;s infrastructure. The Company&#8217;s employees are not represented by a collective bargaining unit. 

&#160; 

SUBSIDIARY ACTIVITIES 

&#160; 

The Company wholly-owns two active consolidated subsidiaries: the Bank and Berkshire Insurance Group. The Bank operates as a commercial bank under a Massachusetts trust company charter. Berkshire Insurance Group is incorporated in Massachusetts. Berkshire Bank owns Firestone Financial, LLC which is a Massachusetts corporation, as well as consolidated subsidiaries operated as Massachusetts securities corporations. The Company also owns all of the common stock of a Delaware statutory business trust, Berkshire Hills Capital Trust I. The capital trust is unconsolidated and its only material asset is a $15 million trust preferred security related to the junior subordinated debentures reported in the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. Additional information about the subsidiaries is contained in Exhibit 21 to this report. 

REGULATION AND SUPERVISION 

&#160; 

General 

The Company is a Delaware corporation and a bank holding company, within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. As such, it is registered with, supervised by and required to comply with the rules and regulations of, the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board requires the Company to file various reports and also conducts examinations of the Company. The Company must receive the approval of the Federal Reserve Board to engage in certain transactions, such as acquisitions of additional banks and savings associations. The Company was previously regulated as a savings and loan holding company. However, in July 2014, the Company became a bank holding company in connection with the Bank&#8217;s conversion to a Massachusetts trust company charter. As a result, the Company is now regulated as a bank holding company and has further elected to become a financial holding company. As a financial holding company, the Company may engage in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to a financial activity. 

&#160; 

The Bank is a Massachusetts-chartered trust company and its deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC. The Bank was previously a Massachusetts-chartered savings bank and converted to a Massachusetts-chartered trust company in July 2014. The Bank is subject to extensive regulation by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks (the &#8220;Commissioner&#8221;) as its chartering agency, and by the FDIC, as its deposit insurer. The Bank is required to file reports with the Commissioner and the FDIC concerning its activities and financial condition in addition to obtaining regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions such as mergers with, or acquisitions of, other depository institutions or branches of other institutions. The Commissioner and the FDIC conduct periodic examinations to test the Bank&#8217;s safety and soundness and compliance with various regulatory requirements. The regulatory structure gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. Any change in such regulatory requirements and policies, whether by the Commissioner, the Massachusetts legislature, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board or Congress, could have a material adverse impact on the Company, the Bank and their operations. 

&#160; 

In January 2015, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts enacted &#8220;An Act Modernizing the Banking Laws and Enhancing the Competitiveness of State-Chartered Banks.&#8221; Among other things, the legislation attempts to better synchronize Massachusetts laws with federal requirements in the same area, streamlines the process for an institution to engage in activities permissible for federally chartered and out of state institutions, consolidates corporate governance statutes, and authorizes the Commissioner to establish a tiered supervisory system for Massachusetts chartered institutions based on factors such as asset size, capital level, balance sheet composition, examination rating, compliance, and other factors deemed appropriate. The new provisions of Massachusetts banking law took effect on April 7, 2015. 

&#160; 

Federal Legislation 

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;) was enacted in 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act has significantly changed the bank regulatory structure and is affecting the lending, investment, trading and operating activities of depository institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the Office of Thrift Supervision, the Company&#8217;s previous primary federal regulator, as of July 21, 2011. 

Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as an independent bureau of the Federal Reserve Board. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau assumed responsibility for the implementation of the federal financial consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations, a function previously assigned to prudential regulators, and has authority to impose new requirements. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions, including the authority to prohibit &#8220;unfair, deceptive or abusive&#8221; acts and practices. However, institutions of less than $10 billion in assets, such as the Bank, continue to be examined for compliance with consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations by, and are subject to the primary enforcement authority of their prudential regulator rather than the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. 

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has finalized the rule implementing the &#8220;Ability to Repay&#8221; requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. The regulations generally require creditors to make a reasonable, good faith determination as to a borrower&#8217;s ability to repay most residential mortgage loans. The final rule establishes a safe harbor for certain &#8220;Qualified Mortgages,&#8221; which contain certain features deemed less risky and omit certain other characteristics considered to enhance risk. The Ability to Repay final rules became effective on January 10, 2014. 

The Dodd-Frank Act also broadened the base for Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation assessments for deposit insurance and permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance to $250,000 per depositor. The Dodd-Frank Act increased shareholder influence over boards of directors by requiring companies to give shareholders a non-binding vote on executive 

compensation and so-called &#8220;golden parachute&#8221; payments. The legislation directed the Federal Reserve Board to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to company executives, regardless of whether or not the company is publicly traded. The Dodd-Frank Act also provided for originators of certain securitized loans to retain a percentage of the risk for transferred credits, directed the Federal Reserve Board to regulate pricing of certain debit card interchange fees, repealed restrictions on paying interest on checking accounts and contained a number of reforms related to mortgage origination. 

Many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to delayed effective dates and/or require the issuance of implementing regulations. The regulatory process is ongoing and the impact on operations cannot yet be fully assessed. However, there is a significant possibility that the Dodd-Frank Act will, at a minimum, result in increased regulatory burden, compliance costs and interest expense for the Company and the Bank. 

Certain regulatory requirements applicable to the Company, including certain changes made by the Dodd-Frank Act, are referred to below or elsewhere herein. The description of statutory provisions and regulations applicable to financial institutions and their holding companies set forth in this Form 10-K does not purport to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on the Company and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual laws and regulations. 

&#160; 

Massachusetts Banking Laws and Supervision 

&#160; 

General. &#32;As a Massachusetts-chartered depository institution, the Bank is subject to supervision, regulation, and examination by the Commissioner and to various Massachusetts statutes and regulations which govern, among other things, investment powers, lending and deposit-taking activities, borrowings, maintenance of surplus and reserve accounts, distribution of earnings, and payment of dividends. In addition, the Bank is subject to Massachusetts consumer protection and civil rights laws and regulations. The approval of the Commissioner is required for a Massachusetts-chartered institution to establish or close branches, merge with other financial institutions, issue stock, and undertake certain other activities. 

&#160; 

Massachusetts law and regulations generally allow Massachusetts institutions to engage in activities permissible for federally chartered banks or banks chartered by another state. The 2015 legislation established a 30-day notice procedure to the Commissioner in order to engage in such activities. The legislation also authorized Massachusetts institutions to engage in activities determined to be &#8220;financial in nature&#8221;, or incidental or complementary to such a financial activity, subject to a 30-day notice to the Commissioner. 

Dividends. &#32;A Massachusetts stock institution, such as the Bank, may declare cash dividends from net profits not more frequently than quarterly and non-cash dividends at any time. No dividends may be declared, credited, or paid if the institution&#8217;s capital stock is impaired. A Massachusetts stock institution with outstanding preferred stock may not, without the prior approval of the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks, declare dividends to the common stock without also declaring dividends to the preferred stock. The approval of the Commissioner is required if the total of all dividends declared in any calendar year exceeds the total of its net profits for that year combined with its retained net profits of the preceding two years, less any required transfer to surplus or a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock. Net profits for this purpose means the remainder of all earnings from current operations plus actual recoveries on loans and investments and other assets after deducting from the total thereof all current operating expenses, actual losses, accrued dividends on preferred stock, if any, and all federal and state taxes. 

Loans to One Borrower Limitations. &#32;Massachusetts banking law grants broad lending authority. However, with certain limited exceptions, total obligations of one borrower to an institution may not exceed 20.0% of the total of the institution&#8217;s capital, which is defined under Massachusetts law as the sum of the institution&#8217;s capital stock, surplus account and undivided profits. 

&#160; 

Loans to a Bank&#8217;s Insiders. &#32;The 2015 Massachusetts legislation provided that Massachusetts law incorporates federal regulations governing extensions of credit to insiders and the prior Massachusetts requirements were repealed. 

&#160; 

Investment Activities. &#32;In general, Massachusetts-chartered institutions may invest in preferred and common stock of any corporation organized under the laws of the United States or any state provided such investments do not involve control of any corporation and do not, in the aggregate, exceed 4.0% of the bank&#8217;s deposits. Massachusetts-chartered institutions may also invest an amount equal to 1.0% of their deposits in stocks of Massachusetts corporations or companies with substantial employment in Massachusetts which have pledged to the Commissioner that such monies will be used for further development within the Commonwealth. However, these powers are constrained by federal law. 

&#160; 

Regulatory Enforcement Authority. &#32;Any Massachusetts-chartered institution that does not operate in accordance with the regulations, policies, and directives of the Commissioner may be sanctioned for non-compliance, including seizure of the property and business of the institution and suspension or revocation of its charter. The Commissioner may, under certain 

circumstances, suspend or remove officers or directors who have violated the law, conducted the institution&#8217;s business in a manner which is unsafe, unsound or contrary to the depositors interests, or been negligent in the performance of their duties. In addition, upon finding that an institution has engaged in an unfair or deceptive act or practice, the Commissioner may issue an order to cease and desist and impose a fine on the institution concerned. Finally, Massachusetts consumer protection and civil rights statutes applicable to the Bank permit private individual and class action lawsuits and provide for the rescission of consumer transactions, including loans, and the recovery of statutory and punitive damage and attorney&#8217;s fees in the case of certain violations of those statutes. 

&#160; 

Massachusetts has other statutes or regulations that are similar to the federal provisions discussed below. 

Federal Regulations 

&#160; 

Capital Requirements. &#32;Federal regulations require FDIC insured depository institutions to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0%, a total capital to risk-based assets of 8.0%, and a 4.0% Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio. The existing capital requirements were effective January 1, 2015 and are the result of a final rule implementing regulatory amendments based on recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. 

Common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders&#8217; equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus, meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of accumulated other comprehensive income (&#8220;AOCI&#8221;), up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. The Bank chose the opt-out election. Institutions that have not exercised the AOCI opt-out have AOCI incorporated into common equity Tier 1 capital (including unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities). Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations. 

In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. For example, a risk weight of 0% is assigned to cash and U.S. government securities, a risk weight of 50% is generally assigned to prudently underwritten first lien one to four-family residential mortgages, a risk weight of 100% is assigned to commercial and consumer loans, a risk weight of 150% is assigned to certain past due loans and a risk weight of between 0% and 600% is assigned to permissible equity interests, depending on certain specified factors. 

In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221; consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted asset above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer requirement is being phased in beginning January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increasing each year until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019. 

In assessing an institution&#8217;s capital adequacy, the FDIC takes into consideration not only these numeric factors, but qualitative factors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where deemed necessary. As a bank holding company, the Company is also subject to regulatory capital requirements, as described in a subsequent section. 

&#160; 

Interstate Banking and Branching . &#32;Federal law permits an institution, such as the Bank, to acquire another institution by merger in a state other than Massachusetts unless the other state has opted out. Federal law, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, authorizes de novo branching into another state to the extent that the target state allows its state chartered banks to establish branches within its borders. The Bank operates branches in New York, Vermont, and Connecticut, as well as Massachusetts. At its interstate branches, the Bank may conduct any activity authorized under Massachusetts law that is permissible either for an institution chartered in that state (subject to applicable federal restrictions) or a branch in that state of an out-of-state national bank. The New York State Superintendent of Banks, the Vermont Commissioner of Banking and Insurance, and the Connecticut Commissioner of Banking may exercise certain regulatory authority over the Bank&#8217;s branches in their respective states. 

Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action. &#32;Federal law requires, among other things, that federal bank regulatory authorities take &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; with respect to banks that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For these purposes, the law establishes three categories of capital deficient institutions: undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized. 

Federal law establishes a system of prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of undercapitalized institutions. The FDIC has adopted regulations to implement the prompt corrective action legislation. The regulations were amended to incorporate the previously mentioned increased regulatory capital standards that were effective January 1, 2015. An institution is deemed to be &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater, and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5% or greater. An institution is &#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221; if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater, and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5% or greater. An institution is &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221; if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 4.0%, or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5%. An institution is deemed to be &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 3.0%, or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0%. An institution is considered to be &#8220;critically undercapitalized&#8221; if it has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%. 

&#8220;Undercapitalized&#8221; banks must adhere to growth, capital distribution (including dividend), and other limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration plan. No institution may make a capital distribution, including payment as a dividend, if it would be &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221; after the payment. A bank&#8217;s compliance with such plans is required to be guaranteed by its holding company in an amount equal to the lesser of 5% of the institution&#8217;s total assets when deemed &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221; or the amount needed to comply with regulatory capital requirements. If an &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221; bank fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is &#8220;significantly undercapitalized.&#8221; &#8220;Significantly undercapitalized&#8221; banks must comply with one or more of a number of additional restrictions, including but not limited to an order by the FDIC to sell sufficient voting stock to become &#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221;, requirements to reduce assets and cease receipt of deposits from correspondent banks or dismiss directors or officers, and restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, compensation of executive officers, and capital distributions by the holding company. &#8220;Critically undercapitalized&#8221; institutions must comply with additional sanctions including, subject to a narrow exception, the appointment of a receiver or conservator within 270 days after it obtains such status. 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015, the Bank met the criteria for being considered &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; as defined in the prompt corrective action regulations. 

Transactions with Affiliates and Loans to Insiders. &#32;Transactions between depository institutions and their affiliates are governed by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. In a holding company context, at a minimum, the parent holding company of an institution and any companies which are controlled by such holding company are affiliates of the institution. Generally, Section 23A limits the extent to which the institution or its subsidiaries may engage in &#8220;covered transactions,&#8221; such as loans, with any one affiliate to 10% of such institution&#8217;s capital stock and surplus, and contains an aggregate limit on all such transactions with all affiliates to 20% of capital stock and surplus. Loans to affiliates and certain other specified transactions must comply with specified collateralization requirements. Section 23B requires that transactions with affiliates be on terms that are no less favorable to the institution or its subsidiary as similar transactions with non-affiliates. 

&#160; 

Further, federal law restricts an institution with respect to loans to directors, executive officers, and principal stockholders (&#8220;insiders&#8221;). Loans to insiders and their related interests may not exceed, together with all other outstanding loans to such persons and affiliated entities, the institution&#8217;s total capital and surplus. Loans to insiders above specified amounts must receive the prior approval of the Board of Directors. Further, loans to insiders must be made on terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to other persons, except that such insiders may receive preferential loans made under a benefit or compensation program that is widely available to the institution&#8217;s employees and does not give preference to the insider over the employees. Federal law places additional limitations on loans to executive officers. 

&#160; 

Enforcement. &#32;The FDIC has extensive enforcement authority over insured institutions, including the Bank. This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, issue cease and desist orders and remove directors and officers. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. The FDIC has authority under federal law to appoint a conservator or receiver for an insured institution under certain circumstances. 

&#160; 

Insurance of Deposit Accounts . &#32;The Bank&#8217;s deposit accounts are insured by the deposit insurance fund of the FDIC up to applicable limits. The FDIC insures deposits up to the standard maximum deposit insurance amount (&#8220;SMDIA&#8221;) of $250,000. 

The deposit insurance limit was increased in response to the Dodd-Frank Act, which, among other provisions, made permanent the increase in the SMDIA from $100,000 to $250,000. The Dodd-Frank Act provided for temporary unlimited coverage of certain noninterest bearing transaction accounts, but such unlimited coverage expired on December 31, 2012. 

The FDIC has adopted a risk-based insurance assessment system. The FDIC assigns an institution to one of four risk categories based on the institution&#8217;s financial condition and supervisory ratings. An institution&#8217;s assessment rate depends on the capital category and supervisory category to which it is assigned and certain adjustments set forth in FDIC regulations. Institutions deemed to present higher risk to the insurance fund pay higher assessments. The overall assessment range, including prospective adjustments, is 2.5 to 45 basis points. Assessment rates are scheduled to decline as the FDIC fund reserve ratio improves. As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, FDIC assessments are now based on each institution&#8217;s total assets less Tier 1 capital, rather than deposits, as was previously the case. 

&#160; 

FDIC insured institutions are also required to pay assessments to the FDIC to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation, an agency of the federal government established to recapitalize a predecessor deposit insurance fund. These assessments will continue until the Financing Corporation bonds mature in 2017 through 2019. The assessment rate is adjusted quarterly to reflect changes in the assessment base of the fund. For the quarter ended December 31, 2015, the Financing Corporation assessment amounted to 0.60 basis points of total assets less Tier 1 capital. 

&#160; 

Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by a regulator. Management does not know of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of FDIC deposit insurance. 

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Act increased the minimum target federal deposit insurance fund ratio from 1.15% of estimated insured deposits to 1.35% of estimated insured deposits. The FDIC must seek to achieve the 1.35% ratio by September 30, 2020. Insured institutions with assets of $10 billion or more are supposed to fund the increase. The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the 1.50% maximum fund ratio, instead leaving it to the discretion of the FDIC. The FDIC has exercised that discretion by establishing a long range fund ratio of 2.00%. 

&#160; 

The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. A significant increase in insurance premiums would likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the Bank. Management cannot predict what insurance assessment rates will be in the future. 

&#160; 

Federal Home Loan Bank System . &#32;The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank system, which consists of 12 regional Federal Home Loan Banks that provide a central credit facility primarily for member institutions. The Bank, as a member, is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the FHLBB. 

&#160; 

The Federal Home Loan Banks are required to provide funds for certain purposes including contributing funds for affordable housing programs. These requirements, and general financial results, could reduce the amount of dividends that the Federal Home Loan Banks pay to their members and result in the Federal Home Loan Banks imposing a higher rate of interest on advances to their members. Historically, the FHLBB has paid dividends to member banks based on money market rates. These dividends were suspended for a time due to losses reported in 2008 and they remain at nominal levels. 

&#160; 

Enforcement 

&#160; 

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has primary federal enforcement responsibility over state chartered banks. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has authority to bring enforcement actions against such institutions and their &#8220;institution-related parties,&#8221; including officers, directors, certain shareholders, and attorneys, appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful action likely to have an adverse effect on an insured institution. Formal enforcement action may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease and desist order to removal of officers and/or directors of the institution or receivership or conservatorship in certain circumstances. Potential civil money penalties cover a wide range of violations and actions, and range up to $25 thousand per day, unless a finding of reckless disregard is made, in which case penalties may be as high as $1.0 million per day. 

Holding Company Regulation 

&#160; 

General. &#32;In July 2014, the Company&#8217;s changed status from that of a savings and loan holding company to that of a bank holding company through the Bank&#8217;s conversion from a Massachusetts-chartered savings bank to a Massachusetts-chartered 

trust company. By doing so, the previously applicable requirement that the Bank comply with the Qualified Thrift Lender Test, which required that a specified percentage of assets be in primarily residential mortgage-related investments, was eliminated. 

&#160; 

The Company is now subject to examination, regulation, and periodic reporting as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. The Company is required to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board to acquire all, or substantially all, of the assets of any other bank or bank holding company. Prior Federal Reserve Board approval would be required for the Company to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting securities of any bank or bank holding company if, after such acquisition, it would, directly or indirectly, own or control more than five percent of any class of voting shares of the bank or bank holding company. In addition to the approval of the Federal Reserve Board, prior approval may also be necessary from other agencies having supervisory jurisdiction over the bank to be acquired before any bank acquisition can be completed. 

&#160; 

A bank holding company is generally prohibited from engaging in non-banking activities, or acquiring direct or indirect control of more than five percent of the voting securities of any company engaged in non-banking activities. One of the principal exceptions to this prohibition is for activities found by the Federal Reserve Board to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. Some of the principal activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined by regulation to be so closely related to banking are: (i) making or servicing loans; (ii) performing certain data processing services; (iii) providing discount brokerage services; (iv) acting as fiduciary, investment or financial advisor; (v) leasing personal or real property; (vi) making investments in corporations or projects designed primarily to promote community welfare; and (vii) acquiring a savings and loan association whose direct and indirect activities are limited to those permitted for bank holding companies. 

&#160; 

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 authorized a bank holding company that meets specified conditions, including being &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; and &#8220;well managed,&#8221; to opt to become a &#8220;financial holding company&#8221; and thereby engage in a broader array of financial activities than previously permitted. Such activities can include insurance and investment banking. The Company has elected to become a financial holding company. 

&#160; 

The Company is subject to the Federal Reserve Board&#8217;s capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies (on a consolidated basis). Such guidelines have historically been similar to, though less stringent than, those of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation for the depository institution subsidiaries. The Dodd-Frank Act, however, required the Federal Reserve Board to promulgate consolidated capital requirements for depository institution holding companies that are no less stringent, both quantitatively and in terms of components of capital, than those applicable to institutions themselves. Instruments such as cumulative preferred stock and trust preferred securities are no longer includable as Tier 1 capital, as was primarily the case with bank holding companies, subject to certain grandfathering rules. The previously discussed final rule regarding regulatory capital requirements implements the Dodd-Frank Act as to bank holding company capital standards. Consolidated regulatory capital requirements identical to those applicable to the Bank are applied to the Company, effective January 1, 2015. As is the case with institutions themselves, the capital conservation buffer will be phased in between 2016 and 2019. 

&#160; 

A bank holding company is generally required to give the Federal Reserve Board prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of then outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of the company&#8217;s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve Board may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice, or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve Board order or directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve Board. There is an exception to this approval requirement for well-capitalized bank holding companies that meet certain other conditions. The Federal Reserve Board&#8217;s policies also require that a bank holding company serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks by standing ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to those banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and by maintaining the financial flexibility and capital-raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks where necessary. The Dodd-Frank Act codified the source of strength doctrine. 

&#160; 

The Federal Reserve Board issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends and the repurchase of shares of common stock by bank holding companies. In general, the policy provides that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization&#8217;s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Regulatory guidance provides for prior regulatory consultation with respect to dividends in certain circumstances such as where the company&#8217;s net income for the past four quarters, net of dividends&#8217; previously paid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund the dividend or the company&#8217;s overall rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the company&#8217;s capital needs and overall financial condition. The ability of a holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. The guidance also provides for regulatory consultation prior to a holding company redeeming or repurchasing regulatory capital instruments when the 

holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses or redeeming or repurchasing common stock or perpetual preferred stock that would result in a net reduction as of the end of a quarter in the amount of such equity instruments outstanding compared with the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurred. These regulatory policies could affect the ability of the Company to pay dividends, repurchase shares of its stock, or otherwise engage in capital distributions. 

The status of the Company as a registered bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act does not exempt it from certain federal and state laws and regulations applicable to corporations generally, including, without limitation, certain provisions of the federal securities laws. 

&#160; 

Acquisition of the Company. &#32;Under the Change in Bank Control Act, no person may acquire control of a bank holding company such as the Company unless the Federal Reserve Board has been given 60 days&#8217; prior written notice and has not issued a notice disapproving the proposed acquisition, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the competitive effects of the acquisition. Control, as defined under federal law, means ownership, control of or holding irrevocable proxies representing more than 25% of any class of voting stock, control in any manner of the election of a majority of the company&#8217;s directors, or a determination by the regulator that the acquirer has the power to direct, or directly or indirectly to exercise a controlling influence over, the management or policies of the institution. Acquisition of more than 10% of any class of a bank holding company&#8217;s voting stock constitutes a rebuttable presumption of control under the regulations under certain circumstances including where, is the case with the Company, the issuer has registered securities under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 

&#160; 

Massachusetts Holding Company Regulation. &#32;In addition to the federal holding company regulations, a bank holding company organized or doing business in Massachusetts must comply with regulations under Massachusetts law. Approval of the Massachusetts regulatory authorities would be required for the Company to acquire 25 percent or more of the voting stock of another depository institution. Similarly, prior regulatory approval would be necessary for any person or company to acquire 25 percent or more of the voting stock of the Company. The term &#8220;bank holding company,&#8221; for the purpose of Massachusetts law, is defined generally to include any company which, directly or indirectly, owns, controls or holds with power to vote more than 25 percent of the voting stock of each of two or more banking institutions, including commercial banks and state co-operative banks, savings banks and savings and loan association and national banks, federal savings banks and federal savings and loan associations. In general, a holding company controlling, directly or indirectly, only one banking institution will not be deemed to be a bank holding company for the purposes of Massachusetts law. Under Massachusetts law, the prior approval of the Board of Bank Incorporation is required before any of the following: any company becoming a bank holding company; any bank holding company acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than five percent of the voting stock of, or all or substantially all of the assets of, a banking institution; or any bank holding company merging with another bank holding company. Although the Company is not a bank holding company for purposes of Massachusetts law, any future acquisition of ownership, control, or the power to vote 25 percent or more of the voting stock of another banking institution or bank holding company would cause it to become such. 

Legislation. &#32;The U.S. Congress, state lawmaking bodies, and federal and state regulatory agencies continue to consider a number of wide-ranging and comprehensive proposals for altering the structure, regulation, and competitive relationships of the nation&#8217;s financial institutions. Any such legislation may impact the business of the Company and the Bank. 

&#160; 

Other Regulations 

&#160; 

Consumer Protection Laws. &#32;The Bank is subject to federal and state consumer protection statutes and regulations applicable to depository institutions including, but not limited to, the following: 

&#8226; Truth-In-Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers; 

&#8226; Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, requiring financial institutions to provide certain information about home mortgage and refinance loans; 

&#8226; Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit; 

&#8226; Fair Credit Reporting Act, governing the provision of consumer information to credit reporting agencies and the use of consumer information; 

&#8226; Fair Debt Collection Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies; and 

&#8226; Electronic Funds Transfer Act, governing automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers&#8217; rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services. 

&#160; 

The Bank also is subject to federal laws protecting the confidentiality of consumer financial records, and limiting the ability of the institution to share non-public personal information with third parties. 

The Community Reinvestment Act (&#8220;CRA&#8221;) establishes a requirement for federal banking agencies that, in connection with examinations of depository institutions within their jurisdiction, the agencies evaluate the record of the depository institutions in meeting the credit needs of their local communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of those institutions. These factors are also considered in evaluating mergers, acquisitions and applications to open a branch or new facility. Under the CRA, institutions are assigned a rating of &#8220;outstanding,&#8221; &#8220;satisfactory,&#8221; &#8220;needs to improve,&#8221; or &#8220;substantial non-compliance.&#8221; A less than &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; rating would result in the suspension of any growth of the Bank through acquisitions or opening de novo branches until the rating is improved. As of the most recent CRA examination by the FDIC, the Bank&#8217;s CRA rating was &#8220;satisfactory.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Anti-Money Laundering Laws . The Bank is subject to extensive anti-money laundering provisions and requirements, which require the institution to have in place a comprehensive customer identification program and an anti-money laundering program and procedures. These laws and regulations also prohibit depository institutions from engaging in business with foreign shell banks; require depository institutions to have due diligence procedures and, in some cases, enhanced due diligence procedures for foreign correspondent and private banking accounts; and improve information sharing between depository institutions and the U.S. government. The Bank has established policies and procedures intended to comply with these provisions. 

&#160; 

Taxation 

&#160; 

The Company reports its income on a calendar year basis using the accrual method of accounting. This discussion of tax matters is only a summary and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries. Further discussion of income taxation is contained in the income taxes note to the consolidated financial statements. The federal income tax laws apply to the Company in the same manner as to other corporations with some exceptions. The Company may exclude from income 100 percent of dividends received from the Bank and from Berkshire Insurance Group as members of the same affiliated group of corporations. The Company reports income on a calendar year basis to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Massachusetts tax law generally permits special tax treatment for a qualifying limited purpose &#8220;securities corporation.&#8221; The Bank&#8217;s securities corporations all qualify for this treatment, and are taxed at a 1.3% rate on their gross income.
