Estimated Oil and Natural Gas Reserves and Estimated Future Net Revenues 

The SEC sets rules related to reserve estimation and disclosure requirements for oil and natural gas companies. These rules require disclosure of oil and gas proved reserves by significant geographic area, using the 12-month average price, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period, rather than year-end prices, and allows the use of new technologies in the determination of proved reserves if those technologies have been demonstrated empirically to lead to reliable conclusions about reserve volumes. Subject to limited exceptions, the rules also require that proved undeveloped reserves may only be classified as such if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years. 

There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and estimates of reserves quantities and values must be viewed as being subject to significant change as more data about the properties becomes available. 

Estimates of Probable and Possible reserves are inherently imprecise. When producing an estimate of the amount of oil and natural gas that is recoverable from a particular reservoir, Probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than Proved reserves but which, together with Proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered, generally described as having a 50% probability of recovery. Possible reserves are even less certain and generally require only a 10% or greater probability of being recovered. All categories of reserves are continually subject to revisions based on production history, results of additional exploration and development, price changes and other factors. Estimates of Probable and Possible reserves are by their nature much more speculative than estimates of Proved reserves and are subject to greater uncertainties, and accordingly the likelihood of recovering those reserves is subject to substantially greater risk. These three reserve categories and net present worth discounted at 10% relating to each category have not been adjusted to different levels of recovery risk among these categories and are therefore not comparable and are not meaningfully combined. 

Estimated pre-tax future net revenues discounted at 10% or PV-10 is a financial measure that is not recognized by GAAP. We believe that the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measure of PV-10 provides useful information to investors because it is widely used by analysts and investors in evaluating oil and natural gas companies, and that it is relevant and useful for evaluating the relative monetary significance of oil and natural gas properties. Further, analysts and investors may utilize the measure as a basis for comparison of the relative size and value of our reserves to other companies' reserves. We also use this pre-tax measure when assessing the potential return on investment related to oil and natural gas properties and in evaluating acquisition opportunities. Because there are many unique factors that can impact an individual company when estimating the amount of future income taxes to be paid, we believe the use of a pre-tax measure is valuable for evaluating our Company. PV-10 is not a measure of financial or operating performance under GAAP, nor is it intended to represent the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. PV-10 should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the Standardized Measure as defined under GAAP, and reconciled herein. 

Summary of Oil &#38; Gas Reserves for Fiscal Year Ended &#32; 2016 &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32; 

Our proved, probable and possible reserves at June 30, 2016 , denominated in equivalent barrels using six MCF of gas and 42 gallons of natural gas liquids to one barrel of oil conversion ratio, were estimated by our independent petroleum engineer, DeGolyer and MacNaughton ("D&#38;M"). D&#38;M was selected for our interests in the Delhi field due to their expertise in CO 2 -EOR projects and to ensure consistency with the operator who also uses D&#38;M for their reserves estimates in the Delhi field. We also chose to have D&#38;M estimate our Giddings properties beginning in 2015 in order to simplify and consolidate our reserve reporting. D&#38;M has significant expertise in this region as well. The scope and results of their procedures are summarized in a letter from the firm, which is included as exhibit 99.4 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

The following table sets forth our estimated proved and probable reserves as of June 30, 2016 . See Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements, where additional unaudited reserve information is provided. The NYMEX previous 12-month unweighted arithmetic average first-day-of-the-month price used to calculate estimated revenues was $42.91 per barrel of crude oil and $14.38 per barrel of natural gas liquids. The price of natural gas liquids was based on the historical price received, if no historical received price is available, historical pricing in the area. Pricing differentials were applied to all properties, on an individual property basis. Quality adjustments have been applied based on actual BTU factors for each well and a shrinkage factor has been applied based on production volumes versus actual sales volumes.

Internal Controls Over Reserves Estimation Process and Qualifications of Technical Persons with Oversight for the Company's Overall Reserve Estimation Process 

Our policies regarding internal controls over reserve estimates require reserves to be prepared by an independent engineering firm under the supervision of our Executive Chairman, our Chief Executive Officer and our former Senior Vice President of Operations, acting as a consultant to the Company, and to be in compliance with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles and definitions and guidelines established by the SEC. Our Executive Chairman holds B.S. and M.E. degrees from Rice University in chemical engineering and earned an M.B.A. from Harvard University. He has over 30 years of experience in engineering, energy transactions, operations and finance with small independents, larger independents and major integrated oil companies. Our Chief Executive Officer holds a Bachelor of Business Administration degree from the University of Texas at Austin. He has over 30 years of experience in the energy industry, encompassing both upstream oil and gas companies and the oilfield service industry. Our Consultant has over 30 years of experience in oil and gas operations and holds a Bachelor of Science in Petroleum Engineering degree from the University of Oklahoma at Norman. The reserve information in this filing is based on estimates prepared by DeGoyler and MacNaughton, our independent engineering firm. The person responsible for preparing the reserve report is a Registered Professional Engineer in the State of Texas and a Senior Vice President of the firm. He holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Geology in 1973 from Eastern New Mexico University and earned a Master of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering from the University of Texas at Austin in 1975. 

He has over 36 years of oil and gas reservoir experience. We provide our engineering firm with property interests, production, current operating costs, current production prices and other information. This information is reviewed by our Senior Management and outside consultant to ensure accuracy and completeness of the data prior to submission to our independent engineering firm. The scope and results of our independent engineering firm's procedures, as well as their professional qualifications, are summarized in the letter included as exhibit 99.4 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Proved Undeveloped Reserves 

Our proved undeveloped reserves were 3,655 MBOE at June 30, 2016 with associated future development costs of approximately $14.9 million. During the year ended June 30, 2016, we incurred $16.5 million of capital spending toward proved undeveloped reserves, primarily related to the NGL plant, but the plant was not complete at the end of the year, so those reserves are still reflected as proved undeveloped. The 1,442 MBOE decrease from 5,097 MBOE at June 30, 2015 is due to a 1,091 MBOE decrease for Phase VI, a portion of the remaining undeveloped eastern area of the Delhi field that presently is uneconomic due to a lower oil price, a 154 MBOE decline in our remaining eastern area reserves and a 197 MBOE decrease in NGL plant reserves. The Phase VI eastern patterns no longer in our proved undeveloped reserves had significantly less recoverable reserves and higher future development costs than the Phase V project we continue to carry as proved undeveloped. There were no reclassifications of proved undeveloped reserves to probable or possible reserves. 

The initial assignment of proved undeveloped reserves in the Delhi field was made on June 30, 2010, which involved a large scale CO 2 &#32;enhanced oil recovery project. The operator&#8217;s development plans for the field have remained essentially unchanged and were originally scheduled to be completed by June 30, 2015, within five years from the initial recording of such proved reserves. The field is approximately 66% developed as of June 30, 2016. However, as a result of the adverse fluid release event in the field in June 2013 and the resulting delay in reversion of our working interest, development of the field was not completed as scheduled. Although no unproved reserves were converted to proved reserves during fiscal 2015 and 2016, development expenditures were ongoing. Expansion of the CO 2 &#32;flood to the remaining undeveloped eastern portion of the field commenced subsequent to reversion of our working interest in late calendar 2014. The Company incurred $3.8 million of capital expenditures until the operator suspended this project as a result of a significant reduction in its capital spending. During the year ended June 30, 2015 the NGL plant project and began and the Company incurred $5.0 million of related capital expenditures. In the year ended June 30, 2016, the Company incurred an additional $16.5 million of plant capital expenditures with $3.1 million budgeted for its completion expected in the fourth calendar quarter of 2016. At June 30, 2016, $11.6 million of net future capital expenditures also remained for development of the eastern part of the field that was suspended in late 2014 and is now planned to continue over the next two fiscal years and is expected to be completed by December 31, 2018, approximately seven and one half years after the initial recording of proved reserves. The 2013 addition of the NGL plant project to recover natural gas liquids and methane required additional planning and has resulted in a prudent delay in the full development of the field's proved reserves. Given the nature of CO 2 &#32;EOR projects, we believe that the undeveloped reserves in the Delhi field satisfy the conditions to continue to be included as proved undeveloped reserves because (1) we established and continue to follow the previously adopted development plan for this project as adjusted to incorporate the completion of the NGL plant in 2016 and delays relating to the 2013 fluid release event; (2) we have significant ongoing development activities at this project that, as budgeted and currently being expended, reflect a significant and sufficient portion of remaining capital expenditures to convert proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves; and (3) the operator has a historical record of completing the development of comparable long-term projects.

Drilling Activity 

Our productive drilling activity during the past three fiscal years ended June 30, 2016, was limited to one fiscal 2015 gross (.239 net) development well drilled in the Delhi field. No dry wells were drilled in the past three fiscal year s. 

Present Activities 

During fiscal year 2015, &#32; construction of a natural gas liquids ("NGL") recovery plant commenced in the Delhi field, which will extract and sell NGL's from the field. In addition to the value of these hydrocarbon products, the increased purity of the CO 2 stream re-injected into the field should result in significant operational benefits to the CO 2 flood. Project construction continued during fiscal year 2016, with completion expected late in calendar 2016. 

&#32;During the fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal 2016, the operator of the Delhi field commenced a project to restore production in the southwestern portion of the field. Following the fluid release event in June 2013, CO 2 &#32;injections in this area ceased in order to reduce reservoir pressure and protect the incident area. The project includes converting three shut-in wells to water injector wells in order to expand the water curtain barrier to reduce CO 2 &#32;migration into this area together with the installation of three electrical submersible pumps ("ESP") in other shut-in wells in order to increase withdrawal rates and help maintain the targeted reservoir pressure. These ESP production wells will create a modified waterflood, which is expected to increase gross oil production by an estimated 250 to 300 BOPD. 

For further discussion, see " Highlights for our fiscal year 2016" and "Capital Budget" under Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#32;of this Form 10-K. 

Delivery Commitments 

As of June 30, 2016, we were not committed to provide a fixed and determinable quantity of oil, NGLs or gas under existing agreements, nor do we currently intend to enter into any such agreements. 

Productive Wells

When the Company acquired the Delhi field in 2003, the field had been fully developed through primary and secondary recovery and all of such acreage was reflected as developed acreage. With the addition of a CO 2 -EOR project in the field, certain acreage is now reflected as undeveloped using tertiary recovery operations. We estimate that our developed acreage currently includes 9,126 gross (2,180 net) acres in the Delhi field, with approximately 4,510 gross (1,077 net) acres attributable to the remaining undeveloped areas in the eastern part of the field. We own a 23.9% working interest in the field. We are not the operator of the EOR project. 

In addition, our developed acreage includes 2,168 gross (2,134 net) in the Giddings Field comprising of a 100% working interest in two producing wells and a 99% working interest in one well subject to a back-in reversion of 22.5%. None of these wells are currently producing at economic rates in the current price environment. Subsequent to year end, we transferred one well back to the previous operator under our contractual agreement. At this time, we expect to plug and abandon the other two wells.

Shares Outstanding and Holders 

As of June 30, 2016, there were 32,907,863 &#32;shares of common stock issued and outstanding, held by approximately 218 holders of record. 

Dividends 

We began paying cash quarterly dividends on our common stock in December 2013, at a rate of $0.10 per share and adjusted the rate to $0.05 per share in March 2015. As of June 30, 2016, we had paid eleven consecutive quarterly dividends on our common stock. All dividends on our Series "A" Perpetual Preferred stock have been timely declared and paid monthly. Any future determination with regard to the payment of dividends will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will be dependent upon our future earnings, financial condition, applicable dividend restrictions and capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors. Under our current revolving credit facility, exceeding the ratio of trailing twelve month&#8217;s EBITDA minus trailing twelve month&#8217;s dividends paid to debt service, as defined, would restrict our ability to pay common stock dividends. 

Performance Graph 

The following graph presents a comparison of the yearly percentage change in the cumulative total return on our Common Stock over the period from June 30, 2011 to June 30, 2016 with the cumulative total return of the S&#38;P 500 Index and the SIG Oil Exploration and Production Index of publicly traded companies over the same period. The graph assumes that $100 was invested on June 30, 2011 in our common stock at the closing market price at the beginning of this period and in each of the other two indices and the reinvestment of all dividends, if any. The graph is presented in accordance with requirements of the SEC. Shareholders are cautioned against drawing any conclusions from the data contained therein, as past results are not necessarily indicative of future financial performance.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Our discussion and analysis includes forward-looking information that involves risks and uncertainties and should be read in conjunction with Risk Factors under Item 1A of this Form 10-K, along with Forward-Looking Information at the beginning of this report for information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to be materially different from our forward-looking statements. 

Executive Overview 

General 

We are engaged primarily in the development of oil and gas reserves within known oil and gas resources for our shareholders and customers utilizing conventional and proprietary technology. We are focused on increasing underlying asset values on a per share basis. In doing so, we depend on a conservative capital structure, allowing us to maintain control of our assets for the benefit of our shareholders, including a substantial ownership by our directors, officers and staff. By policy, every employee and director maintains a beneficial ownership of our common stock. 

Our strategy is to grow the value of our Delhi assets to maximize the value realized by our shareholders. In addition, we plan to return cash to the shareholders in the form of quarterly cash dividends and potential stock buybacks under our previously announced share repurchase program. 

We expect to fund our fiscal 2017 &#32;capital program from working capital and net cash flows from our properties. 

Highlights for our fiscal year 2016 

Finances 

&#8226; 

We funded all operations, including $21.1 million of capital spending, from internal resources and remained debt free. All of our capital expenditures and dividends were funded solely by cash flow from operations and working capital and we ended our fiscal year with no funded debt. 

&#8226; 

We returned $6.6 million to common shareholders in the form of cash dividends during fiscal 2016. We remain committed to our dividend policy and rewarding our long-term shareholders. 

&#8226; 

We invested $1.2 million in our stock buyback program during fiscal 2016. We have up to $3.4 million remaining under this program. 

&#8226; 

We increased working capital to $28.6 million at June 30, 2016 compared to $14.3 million at the prior year end. &#32;&#32;At June 30, 2016, working capital included $34.1 million of cash on hand. 

&#8226; 

We entered into a new senior secured bank credit facility. &#32;The maximum borrowing base is $50.0 million; however the initial borrowing base was set at $10.0 million. There are no outstanding borrowings. 

&#8226; 

Our hedging program resulted in $3.4 million in net gains during fiscal 2016. In fiscal 2016, we used derivative instruments to reduce our exposure to oil price volatility in order to support the capital expenditures for the Delhi NGL plant and to protect our dividend policy. We have no hedges in place beyond September 30, 2016. 

Operations 

&#8226; 

Our fiscal 2016 net income to common shareholders was $24.0 million, a substantial increase from fiscal 2015 net income of $4.3 million. &#32;During fiscal 2016, litigation settlement proceeds, insurance proceeds and realized hedging gains contributed to significantly higher net income, offset in part by increased DD&#38;A expenses, litigation expenses and higher income tax expense. This is our fifth consecutive year of reporting net income to common shareholders. 

&#8226; 

We settled outstanding litigation with the operator of Delhi field. &#32;In the settlement, we received $27.5 million in cash and a working interest in the Mengel Sand, a separate interval within the Delhi field that is not currently producing. We also reached agreement on our ownership of the CO 2 &#32;recycle facility and on the long term costs of purchased CO 2 . 

&#8226; 

Installation and construction of the NGL recovery plant at Delhi is approximately 90% complete. &#32;&#32;Technical completion and start-up of the plant is scheduled to begin in November 2016. Our net share of capital expenditures for 

this project is $24.6 million, and has been funded through cash flow from operations and working capital. Approximately $3.1 million remains to be spent as of fiscal year end 2016. 

&#8226; 

Our net oil production volumes at Delhi increased by over 46% year over year. Monthly production has been steadily increasing over the past year as a result of a conformance program and greater efficiency with the flood. The majority of the increase in our net production stems from the reversion of our 23.9% working interest and associated 19.0% revenue interest in the Delhi field which became effective on November 1, 2014. We had only eight months of working interest volumes in the prior fiscal year. 

&#8226; 

We transferred our oilfield technology operations to a new entity and we expect annual cost reductions of approximately $1.0 million. &#32;We retained a minority equity interest in the new Company and will receive a 5% royalty on all future gross revenues from the technology. In addition, we have an option to increase our equity ownership and can use the technology in any of our operated wells. 

Oil &#38; Gas Reserves (based on SEC oil price of $40.91 per barrel in effect as at June 30, 2016) 

&#8226; 

Delhi proved oil equivalent reserves at June 30, 2016 were 10.8 MMBOE , a 13% decline from the previous year. The Standardized Measure for proved reserves declined 51% to $78 million as a result of a 44% drop in the oil price from $72.55 to $40.91 per barrel. Proved reserves are 79% oil and 21% natural gas liquids, and 66% of these reserves are developed and producing. 

&#8226; 

Delhi probable reserves at June 30, 2016 were 4.5 MMBOE , a 52% decrease over the previous year. 

&#8226; 

Delhi possible reserves at June 30, 2016 were 2.7 MMBOE , a 10% decrease over the previous year.

____________________________________________________________________________ 

* 

PV-10 of Proved reserves is a pre-tax non-GAAP measure. We have included a reconciliation of PV-10 to the unaudited after-tax Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows ("Standardized Measure"), which is the &#32; most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, in &#32;Item 2. "Properties." &#32;&#32;We believe that the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measure of PV-10 provides useful and relevant information to investors because of its wide use by analysts and investors in evaluating the relative monetary significance of oil and natural gas properties, and as a basis for comparison of the relative size and value of our reserves to other companies&#8217; reserves. We also use this pre-tax measure when assessing the potential return on investment related to oil and natural gas properties and in evaluating acquisition opportunities. Because there are many unique factors that can impact an individual company when estimating the amount of future income taxes to be paid, we believe the use of a pre-tax measure is valuable for evaluating our Company. PV-10 is not a measure of financial or operating performance under GAAP, nor is it intended to represent the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves.
