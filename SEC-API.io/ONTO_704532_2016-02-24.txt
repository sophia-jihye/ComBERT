Industry Background

We participate in the sale, design, manufacture, marketing and support of process control systems for optical critical dimension metrology, thin film metrology, advanced 3-D packaging process control, and wafer defect inspection used for semiconductor manufacturing. Semiconductors are primarily packaged as integrated circuits within electronic devices, including consumer electronics, server and enterprise systems, mobile computing devices (including smart phones and tablets), data storage devices, embedded automotive and control systems, LEDs, and a multitude of other electronic products being proliferated worldwide. Integrated circuits are made up of semiconductor material layers integrating millions or billions of transistors and other electronic components, connected through a complex wiring scheme of small copper or aluminum wires, ultimately packaged into thin form factors to be mounted on circuit boards or other substrates. Our core focus is the measurement and control of the structure, composition, and geometry of the devices from the transistor layer through advanced wafer-scale packaging to improve device performance and manufacturing yields. Our end customers manufacture many types of integrated circuits for a multitude of applications, each having unique manufacturing challenges. This includes integrated circuits to enable information processing and management (logic integrated circuits), memory storage (NAND, 3D-NAND, NOR, and DRAM), analog devices (e.g., Wi-Fi and 4G radio integrated circuits, power devices) MEMS sensor devices (accelerometers, pressure sensors, microphones), image sensors, thin film head components for hard disk drives and alternative energy devices such as LEDs, power inverters and solar cells.

Demand for our products continues to be driven by our customers' desire for higher overall chip performance, including improvements in power efficiency, logic processing capability, data storage volume and manufacturing yield. To achieve these goals, our customers have increased their use of more complex materials and processing methods in their manufacturing flow. The majority of our chip customers manufacture devices in production runs defined by the smallest printed feature and the associated circuit manufacturing methods, known as a technology node, which are measured in nanometers ("nm"), or one-billionth of a meter. Current volume production is running at the 28nm-20nm nodes across foundry, logic, and memory, with customers ramping 16nm/14nm node and developing 10 nm and below devices. In some cases our customers are implementing new materials and methods in high volume manufacturing, including materials and device architectures to reduce power consumption including high dielectric constant (or high-k) materials, FinFET or tri-gate transistors, stacked memory devices including 3D-NAND, and additional system on chip solutions. To shrink features, new methods including multiple patterning lithography have been deployed. We believe the use of these new materials and methods has increased demand for our products. Next-generation devices with features smaller than 16nm/14nm are beginning to ramp production, which in turn likely will require new advancements in metrology and inspection capabilities. DRAM memory makers have shifted to 2y node production with development for sub 20nm node devices currently underway (where x, y and z represent successively smaller geometries). Non-volatile memory makers of NAND and NOR devices have ramped 1x and 1y node 

&#160;

&#160;

devices into high volume manufacturing with work extending into 1z node development and production as well as simultaneously developing and ramping stacked or 3D non-volatile memory structures. Current 3D NAND devices are built aroun d a stack of 24-48 layer pairs, and are expected to migrate to 64 layer or more pairs in the next generation of devices. Foundry and logic manufacturers are in volume production of both 28nm and 22nm node devices, ramping volume production of 16nm/14nm nod e devices and in advanced development of 1y devices. Thin film head components for hard disk drives are also being driven to smaller sizes to support next generation hard disk drives with ever increasing storage capacity requiring continued improvements in read and write head component scaling. We also enable clean energy device manufacturers, such as for LEDs and solar Photo-Voltaics ("PVs"), to achieve higher yields and lower manufacturing costs. 

Our Business

We offer a diverse line of process control and inspection products and technologies to address the manufacturing requirements of the semiconductor (and other solid state device) manufacturing industry. Our metrology systems measure and characterize the physical dimensions, material composition, optical and electrical characteristics and other critical parameters of solid state devices, from initial wafer substrate manufacturing through final packaging. For the photolithographic process, thin-film and critical-dimension metrology systems provide control of device dimensions and layer alignment. Advanced packaging techniques require metrology systems to control wafer scale features for through-silicon-via (&#8220;TSV&#8221;), micro-bump technologies and copper pillar. Additional applications include characterization of local and global topography across the wafer and inspection for both front-end of line (&#8220;FEOL&#8221;) and advanced packaging. Our materials characterization systems monitor the physical, optical, and electrical characteristics of materials including those on compound semiconductors, discrete devices, LEDs, solar PVs and unpatterned silicon wafers.

We are continually working to strengthen our competitive position by developing new technologies and products in our market segment. We have expanded our product offerings to address growing applications within the semiconductor manufacturing and adjacent industries. In pursuit of our goals, we have:

&#160;

&#183; 

Introduced new products, applications, and upgrades in every core product line and primary market served; 

&#160;

&#183;

Customer Service and Support

We believe that customer service and technical support for our systems are important factors that distinguish us from our competitors and are essential to building and maintaining close, long-term relationships with our customers. We provide a standard one-year warranty on parts and labor for most of our products. We provide system support to our customers through factory technical support and globally deployed field service personnel. The factory technical support operations provide customers with telephonic technical support access, direct training programs, operating manuals and other technical support information to enable effective use of our metrology and measurement instruments and systems. We have field service operations based in various locations throughout the United States, South Korea, Taiwan, China, Japan, Singapore, Israel, France, Italy, and Germany. 

Service revenues, including sales of replacement parts, represented 22%, 20%, and 26% of total net revenues in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Backlog

As of December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014, our backlog was $32.1 million and $41.5 million, respectively. Backlog includes orders, both shipped and not yet recognized in revenue, and not shipped, for products, services and upgrades where written customer requests have been received and we expect to ship and/or recognize revenue within 12 months. Orders are subject to cancellation or delay by the customer subject to possible penalties. However, historically, order cancellations have not been significant. Because orders presently in backlog could be cancelled or rescheduled and some orders can be received and shipped 

&#160;

&#160;

within the same quarter, we do not believe that current backlog is an accurate indication of our future revenues or f inancial performance. 

Competition

We offer different products for various semiconductor manufacturing process steps, and several of our products extend across the same process flow. However, for process control of each of these process steps, we have multiple competitors. In every market in which we participate, the global semiconductor equipment industry is intensely competitive, and driven by rapid technological adoption cycles. Our ability to effectively compete depends upon our ability to continually improve our products, applications and services, and our ability to develop new products, applications and services that meet constantly evolving customer requirements.

We believe that our competitive position in each of our markets is based on the ability of our products and services to address customer requirements related to numerous competitive factors. Competitive selections are based on many factors involving technological innovation, productivity, total cost of ownership of the system, including impact on end of line yield, price, product performance and throughput capability, quality, reliability and customer support.

In automated systems for the semiconductor industry, our principal competitors are KLA-Tencor Corporation (&#8220;KLA-Tencor&#8221;) and Nova Measuring Instruments Ltd. ("Nova") for thin film and critical dimension metrology, and CAMTek and Rudolf Technologies and other smaller suppliers for advanced packaging. Our primary competitor in integrated systems is Nova. The HB-LED, discrete device, bare silicon and solar PV markets, which are addressed primarily by our material characterization systems, are served by numerous competitors and no single competitor or group of competitors has established a majority position.

Manufacturing

Our manufacturing operations are in Milpitas, California and at various contract manufacturers around the world. It is our strategy to outsource all assemblies that do not contain elements that we believe lead to a direct competitive advantage. The majority of our automated and integrated products are currently manufactured at our Milpitas facility. We also use contract manufacturers in other locations in the United States and in China, Israel and Japan. We currently do not expect our manufacturing operations to require additional major investments in capital equipment.

We produce key parts and components and make reasonable efforts to ensure that any externally purchased parts or raw materials are available from multiple suppliers, but this is not always possible. Certain components, sub-assemblies and services necessary for the manufacture of our systems are obtained either from a sole supplier or limited group of suppliers. We also have an established long-term supply agreement for supply of our spectroscopic ellipsometers and interferometers for use in our products. Although we seek to reduce our dependence on sole and limited source suppliers, partial or complete loss of these sources could disrupt production, delay scheduled deliveries to customers and have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.

Research and Development

We continue to invest in research and development (&#8220;R&#38;D&#8221;) to provide our customers with products that add value to their manufacturing processes and that provide a better and differentiated solution than our competitors, so that our products stay in the forefront of current and future market demands. Whether it is for an advancement of current technology, yield and manufacturing improvement, enabling new end device technology, or the development of a new application in our core or emerging markets, we are committed to product excellence and longevity.

In our automated markets, our R&#38;D efforts resulted in the successful product launch of the Atlas II+ product in the marketplace, our flagship product for OCD. The Atlas II+ product provides enhanced OCD capability with a significantly lower cost of ownership model. Additionally, the UniFire system development continued with new system configurations and applications development targeted at advanced packaging applications, including further extensions for advanced packaging applications. In our integrated markets, the IMPULSE system has been further developed for inline lithography track configuration to extend our tool of record position for lithography OCD. The IMPULSE+ system, which incorporates performance and productivity enhancements to the IMPULSE was introduced in 2015.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Patents and Intellectual Property 

Our success depends in large part on the technical innovation of our products and protecting such innovations through a variety of methods. We actively pursue a program of filing patent applications to seek protection of technologically sensitive features of our metrology and inspection systems. As of December 26, 2015, we had 214 patents, including foreign patents, with expiration dates ranging from 2016 until 2035. We believe that our success will depend to a great degree upon innovation, technological expertise and our ability to adapt our products to new technology. While we attempt to establish our intellectual property rights through patents and trademarks and protect intellectual property rights through non-disclosure agreements, we may not be able to fully protect our technology, and competitors may be able to develop similar technology independently. Others may obtain patents and assert them against us. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. From time to time we receive communications from third parties asserting that our metrology systems may contain design features that the third parties claim may infringe upon their proprietary rights.

Employees

At December 26, 2015, we employed 518 persons worldwide with sales, applications and service support in key geographic areas aligned with our customer locations. None of our employees are represented by a union and we have never experienced a work stoppage as a result of union actions. Many of our employees have specialized skills that are of value to us. Our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled scientific, technical and managerial personnel, who are in great demand in our industry. We consider our employee relations to be good.

Environmental Matters

Our operations are subject to various federal, state and local environmental protection regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials, chemicals, and certain waste products. We believe that compliance with federal, state and local environmental protection regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive and financial position.

In the event that we fail to comply with such laws and regulations, we could be liable for damages, penalties and fines. We further discuss the impact of environmental regulation under &#8220;Risk Factors- We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations that could impose substantial costs upon us and may harm our business, operating results and financial condition.&#8221; in Item 1A.
