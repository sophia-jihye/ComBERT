CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This Form 10-K may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;), as amended, which are not historical facts but rather are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about our business and industry, our beliefs and assumptions. Words such as &#8220;believes,&#8221; &#8220;anticipates,&#8221; &#8220;plans,&#8221; &#8220;expects,&#8221; &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;goal,&#8221; and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. The inclusion of forward-looking statements should not be regarded as a representation by us that any of our plans will be achieved. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Such forward-looking information is also subject to various risks and uncertainties. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, risks arising from our providing services exclusively to the health care industry, primarily providers of long-term care; credit and collection risks associated with this industry; having several significant clients who each individually contributed at least 3% with one as high as 9% to our total consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 ; our claims experience related to workers&#8217; compensation and general liability insurance; the effects of changes in, or interpretations of laws and regulations governing the industry, our workforce and services provided, including state and local regulations pertaining to the taxability of our services and other labor related matters such as minimum wage increases; tax benefits arising from our corporate reorganization and self-funded health insurance program transition; risks associated with the reorganization of our corporate structure; and the risk factors described in Part I in this report under &#8220;Government Regulation of Clients,&#8221; &#8220;Competition&#8221; and &#8220;Service Agreements/Collections,&#8221; and under Item IA &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; 

These factors, in addition to delays in payments from clients and/or clients in bankruptcy or clients for which we are in litigation to collect payment, have resulted in, and could continue to result in, significant additional bad debts in the near future. Additionally, our operating results would be adversely affected if unexpected increases in the costs of labor and labor-related costs, materials, supplies and equipment used in performing services could not be passed on to our clients. 

In addition, we believe that to improve our financial performance we must continue to obtain service agreements with new clients, provide new services to existing clients, achieve modest price increases on current service agreements with existing clients and maintain internal cost reduction strategies at our various operational levels. Furthermore, we believe that our ability to sustain the internal development of managerial personnel is an important factor impacting future operating results and successfully executing projected growth strategies. 

PART I 

In this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 , Healthcare Services Group, Inc. (together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries, included in Exhibit 21 which has been filed as part of this Report) is referred to as the "Company," "we," "us" or "our." 

Item I. Business. 

General 

The Company is a Pennsylvania corporation, incorporated on November 22, 1976. We provide management, administrative and operating expertise and services to the housekeeping, laundry, linen, facility maintenance and dietary service departments of the health care industry, including nursing homes, retirement complexes, rehabilitation centers and hospitals located throughout the United States. Based on the nature and similarities of the services provided, our business operations consist of two business segments (Housekeeping and Dietary). We believe that we are the largest provider of our services to the long-term care industry in the United States, rendering such services to approximately 3,500 &#32;facilities in 48 states as of December 31, 2015. We provide our Housekeeping services to essentially all client facilities and provide Dietary services to over 1,000 &#32;of such facilities. Although we do not directly participate in any government reimbursement programs, our clients&#8217; reimbursements are subject to government regulation. Therefore, they are directly affected by any legislation and regulations relating to Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement programs. 

Segment Information 

The information called for herein is discussed below in Description of Services, and within Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. 

Description of Services 

We provide management, administrative and operating expertise and services to the housekeeping, laundry, linen, facility maintenance and dietary service departments of the health care industry. 

We are organized into, and provide our services through two reportable segments: housekeeping, laundry, linen and other services (&#8220;Housekeeping&#8221;), and dietary department services (&#8220;Dietary&#8221;). The operating results from our professional employer organization ("PEO") service contracts are included primarily in our Housekeeping segment as these services include the provision of housekeeping and laundry personnel. The Company&#8217;s corporate headquarters provides centralized financial management and administrative services to the Housekeeping and Dietary business segments. 

Housekeeping consists of managing the client&#8217;s housekeeping department which is principally responsible for the cleaning, disinfecting and sanitizing of patient rooms and common areas of a client&#8217;s facility, as well as the laundering and processing of the personal clothing belonging to the facility&#8217;s patients. Also within the scope of this segment&#8217;s service is the responsibility for laundering and processing the bed linens, uniforms and other assorted linen items utilized by a client facility. 

Dietary consists of managing the client&#8217;s dietary department which is principally responsible for food purchasing, meal preparation and providing professional dietitian consulting services, which includes the development of a menu that meets the patient&#8217;s dietary needs. 

Both segments provide our services primarily pursuant to full service agreements with our clients. In such agreements, we are responsible for the management of the department serviced, the employees located at our clients&#8217; facilities and the provision of certain supplies. We also provide services on the basis of a management-only agreement for a limited number of clients. Our agreements with clients typically provide for renewable one year service terms, cancelable by either party upon 30 to 90 days&#8217; notice after an initial period of 60 to 120 days. 

Our labor force is interchangeable with respect to each of the services within Housekeeping. Our labor force with respect to Dietary is specific to it. There are many similarities in the nature of the services performed by each segment. However, there are some differences in the specialized expertise required of the professional management personnel responsible for delivering the services of the respective segments. We believe the services of each segment provide opportunity for growth. 

An overview of each of our segments follows: 

Housekeeping 

Housekeeping services . Housekeeping services is our largest service sector, representing approximately 44% , or $631,875,000 , of consolidated revenues in 2015. This service involves the management of the client&#8217;s housekeeping department which is principally responsible for cleaning, disinfecting and sanitizing resident areas in our clients&#8217; facilities. In providing services to any given client facility, we typically hire and train the employees that were previously employed by such facility. We normally assign an on-site manager to each facility to supervise and train the front line personnel and coordinate housekeeping services with other facility support functions in accordance with the direction provided by the client. Such management personnel also oversee the execution of a variety of quality and cost-control procedures including continuous training and employee evaluation and on-site testing for infection control. The on-site management team also assists the facility in complying with federal, state and local regulations. 

Laundry and linen services . Laundry and linen services represented approximately 19% , or $275,477,000 , of consolidated revenues in 2015. Laundry services are under the responsibility of the housekeeping department and involve the laundering and processing of the residents&#8217; personal clothing. We provide laundry services to mostly all of our housekeeping clients. Linen services involve providing, laundering and processing of the sheets, pillow cases, blankets, towels, uniforms and assorted linen items used by our clients&#8217; facilities. At some facilities that utilize our laundry and linen services, we install our own equipment. Such installation generally requires an initial capital outlay by us ranging from $5,000 to $100,000 depending on the size of the facility, installation and construction costs, and the cost of equipment required. We could incur relocation or other costs in the event of the cancellation of a linen service agreement where there was an investment by us in a corresponding laundry installation. The hiring, training and supervision of the employees who perform laundry and linen services are similar to, and performed by the same management personnel who oversee the housekeeping employees located at the respective client facility. In some instances we own the linen supplies utilized at our clients&#8217; facilities and therefore, maintain a sufficient inventory of linen supplies to ensure their availability. 

Maintenance and other services . Maintenance services consist of repair and maintenance of laundry equipment, plumbing and electrical systems, as well as carpentry and painting. This service sector&#8217;s total revenues of $2,357,000 &#32;represented less than 1% of consolidated revenues in 2015. 

Laundry installation sales . We (as a distributor of laundry equipment) sell laundry installations to our clients, which typically represents the construction and installation of a turn-key operation. We generally offer payment terms, ranging from 36 to 60 months. During the years 2013 through 2015, laundry installation sales were not material to our operating results as we prefer to own such laundry installations in connection with performance of our service agreements during the term of such agreements. 

Housekeeping operating performance is significantly impacted by our management of labor costs. Labor accounted for approximately 80% &#32;of operating costs incurred at a facility service location, as a percentage of Housekeeping revenues. Changes in employee compensation resulting from legislative or other actions, anticipated staffing levels, and other unforeseen variations in our use of labor at a client service location will result in volatility of these costs. Additionally, the costs of supplies consumed in performing Housekeeping services, including linen costs, are affected by product specific market conditions and therefore are subject to price volatility. Generally, this volatility is influenced by factors outside our control and is unpredictable. Where possible, we try to obtain fixed pricing from vendors for an extended period of time on certain supplies to mitigate such price volatility. Although we endeavor to pass on increases in our labor and supply costs to our clients, the inability to attain such increases may negatively impact Housekeeping&#8217;s profit margins. 

PEO services . Through the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, HCSG Staff Leasing Solutions, LLC ("Staff Leasing"), we enter into a client services agreement to become a co-employer of the client's existing workforce, assuming responsibility for payroll, payroll taxes, insurance coverage and certain other administrative functions, while the client maintains physical care, custody and control of their workforce, including the authority to hire and terminate employees. Our services include housekeeping and laundry personnel and are provided to clients in the health care industry. As of December 31, 2015, we have PEO service contracts in several &#32;states. During the years 2013 through 2015, operating results from our PEO service contracts were not material to our operating results. 

Dietary 

Dietary services . Dietary services represented approximately 37% , or $527,140,000 , of consolidated revenues in 2015. Dietary consists of managing the client&#8217;s dietary department which is principally responsible for food purchasing, meal preparation and providing professional dietitian consulting services, which includes the development of a menu that meets the dietary needs of the residents. On-site management is responsible for all daily dietary department activities, with regular support being provided 

by a district manager specializing in dietary services, as well as a registered dietitian. We also offer consulting services to facilities to assist them in cost containment and to promote improvement in their dietary department service operations. 

Dietary operating performance is also impacted by price volatility in labor and supply costs resulting from similar factors discussed above in Housekeeping. The primary difference in impact on Dietary operations from price volatility in costs of labor and food-related supplies is that such costs represent approximately 53% &#32;and 39% &#32;of Dietary revenues, respectively. In contrast, labor is approximately 80% &#32;of operating costs as a percentage of Housekeeping revenues. 

Operational Management Structure 

By applying our professional management techniques, we generally contain or control certain housekeeping, laundry, linen, facility maintenance and dietary service costs on a continuing basis. We manage and provide our services through a network of management personnel, as illustrated below.

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Each facility is generally managed by an on-site Facility Manager, an Assistant Facility Manager, and if necessary, additional supervisory personnel. Districts, typically consisting of eight to twelve facilities, are supported by a District Manager and a Training Manager. District Managers bear overall responsibility for the facilities within their districts. They are generally based in close proximity to each facility. These managers provide active support to clients in addition to the support provided by our on-site management team. Training Managers are responsible for the recruitment, training and development of Facility Managers. A division consists of a number of regions within a specific geographical area. Divisional Vice Presidents manage each division. At December 31, 2015 we had 80 &#32;regions within 10 &#32;divisions. Each region is headed by a Regional Vice President/Manager. Most regions also have a Regional Director who assumes primary responsibility for marketing our services within the respective region. Regional Vice Presidents/Managers and Directors provide management support to a number of districts within a specific geographical area. Regional Vice Presidents/Managers and Directors report to Divisional Vice Presidents who in turn report to Senior Vice Presidents and/or Executive Vice Presidents. We believe that our divisional, regional and district organizational structure facilitates our ability to best serve, and/or sell additional services to, our existing clients, as well as obtain new clients. 

Market 

The market for our services consists of a large number of facilities involved in various aspects of the health care industry, including long-term and post-acute care facilities (skilled nursing facilities, residential care and assisted living facilities, etc.) and hospitals (acute care, critical access, psychiatric, etc.). 

These facilities primarily range in size from small private facilities to facilities with over 500 beds. Such facilities may be specialized or general, privately owned or public, profit or not-for-profit, and may serve patients on a long-term or short-term basis. We market our services to such facilities after consideration of a variety of factors including facility type, size, location, and service (Housekeeping or Dietary). The market for our services, particularly in long-term and post-acute care, is expected to continue to 

grow as the elderly population increases as a percentage of the United States population and as government reimbursement policies require increased cost control or containment by the constituents that comprise our target market. 

Marketing and Sales 

Our services are marketed at four levels of our organization: at the corporate level by the President &#38; Chief Executive Officer, Executive Vice Presidents and Senior Vice Presidents; at the divisional level by Divisional Vice Presidents; at the regional level by the Regional Vice Presidents/Divisional Managers and Directors; and at the district level by District Managers. We provide incentive compensation to our operational personnel based on achieving financial and non-financial goals and objectives which are aligned with the key elements the Company believes are necessary for it to achieve overall improvement in its financial results, along with continued business development. 

Our services are marketed primarily through referrals and in-person solicitation of target facilities. We also participate in industry trade shows, health care trade associations and healthcare support service seminars that are offered in conjunction with state or local health authorities in many of the states in which we conduct our business. Our programs have been approved for continuing education credits by state nursing home licensing boards in certain states, and are typically attended by facility owners, administrators and supervisory personnel, thus presenting marketing opportunities for us. Indications of interest in our services arising from initial marketing efforts are followed up with a presentation regarding our services and an assessment of the service requirements of the facility. Thereafter, a formal proposal, including operational recommendations and recommendations for proposed savings, is submitted to the prospective client. Once the prospective client accepts the proposal and signs the service agreement, we can set up our operations on-site within days. 

Government Regulation of Clients 

Our clients are subject to government regulation. Congress has enacted a number of major laws during the past several years that have significantly altered or will alter government reimbursement for nursing home services, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. In July 2011, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (&#8220;CMS&#8221;) issued a final rule that reduced Medicare payments to nursing centers by 11.1% and changed the reimbursement for the provision of group rehabilitation therapy services to Medicare beneficiaries. This new rule was effective as of October 1, 2011. Furthermore, in the coming year and beyond, new proposals or additional changes in existing regulations could be made which could directly impact the governmental reimbursement programs in which our clients participate. As a result, some state Medicaid programs are reconsidering previously approved increases in nursing home reimbursement or are considering delaying or foregoing those increases. A few states have indicated it is possible they will run out of cash to pay Medicaid providers, including nursing homes. 

In January 2013, the U.S. Congress enacted the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which delayed automatic spending cuts of $1.2 trillion, including reduced Medicare payments to plans and providers up to 2%. These discretionary spending caps were originally enacted under provisions in the Budget Control Act of 2011, an initiative to reduce the federal deficit through the year 2021, also known as &#8220;sequestration.&#8221; The sequestration went into effect starting March 2013. In December 2013, the U.S. Congress enacted the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, which reduces the impact of sequestration over the next two years. This began in fiscal year 2014 and extended the reduction in Medicare payments to plans and providers for two years from 2021 through 2023. 

Although laws and rulings directly affect how clients are paid for certain services, we do not directly participate in any government reimbursement programs. Accordingly, all of our contractual relationships with our clients continue to determine the clients&#8217; payment obligations to us. However, because clients&#8217; revenues are generally highly reliant on Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement funding rates, the overall effect of these laws and trends in the long term care industry have affected and could adversely affect the liquidity of our clients, resulting in their inability to make payments to us on agreed upon payment terms (See &#8220;Liquidity and Capital Resources" included in our "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"). 

The prospects for legislative action, both on the federal and state level (particularly in light of current economic environment affecting government budgets), regarding funding for nursing homes are uncertain. We are unable to predict or to estimate the ultimate impact of any further changes in reimbursement programs affecting our clients&#8217; future results of operations and/or their impact on our cash flows and operations. 

Environmental Regulation 

The Company&#8217;s operations are subject to various federal, state and/or local laws concerning emissions into the air, discharges into the waterways and the generation, handling and disposal of waste and hazardous substances. The Company&#8217;s past expenditures 

relating to environmental compliance have not had a material effect on the Company and are included in normal operating expenses. These laws and regulations are constantly evolving, and it is impossible to predict accurately the effect they may have upon the capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position of the Company in the future. Based upon information currently available, management believes that expenditures relating to environmental compliance will not have a material impact on the financial position of the Company for the foreseeable future. 

Service Agreements and Collections 

We provide our services primarily pursuant to full service agreements with our clients. In such agreements, we are responsible for the management of the department serviced, the employees located at our clients&#8217; facilities and the provision of certain supplies. We also provide services on the basis of a management-only agreement for a limited number of clients. In such agreements, our services are comprised of providing on-site management personnel, while the non-supervisory staff remain employees of the respective client. 

We typically adopt and follow the client&#8217;s employee wage structure, including its policy of wage rate increases, and pass through to the client any labor cost increases associated with wage rate adjustments. Under a management agreement, we provide management and supervisory services while the client facility retains payroll responsibility for the non-supervisory staff. Substantially all of our agreements are full service agreements. These agreements typically provide for renewable one year terms, cancelable by either party upon 30 to 90 days&#8217; notice after the initial 60 to 120 day period. As of December 31, 2015, we provided services to approximately 3,500 &#32;client facilities. 

Although many of our service agreements are cancelable on short notice, we have historically had a favorable client retention rate and expect to continue to maintain satisfactory relationships with our clients. The risks associated with short-term service agreements have not materially affected either our linen and laundry services, which may from time-to-time require capital investment, or our laundry installation sales, which may require us to finance the sales price. Such risks are often mitigated by certain provisions set forth in the agreements entered into with our clients. 

State Medicaid programs are experiencing increased demand, and with lower revenues than projected, they have fewer resources to support their Medicaid programs. In addition, Federal health reform legislation has been enacted that would significantly expand state Medicaid programs. As a result, some state Medicaid programs are reconsidering previously approved increases in nursing home reimbursement or are considering delaying those increases. A few states have indicated it is possible they will run out of cash to pay Medicaid providers, including nursing homes. Any of these changes would adversely affect the liquidity of our clients, resulting in their inability to make payments to us as agreed upon. 

We have had varying collection experience with respect to our accounts and notes receivable. When contractual terms are not met, we generally encounter difficulty in collecting amounts due from certain of our clients. Therefore, we have sometimes been required to extend the period of payment for certain clients beyond contractual terms. These clients include those who have terminated service agreements and slow payers experiencing financial difficulties. In order to provide for these collection problems and the general risk associated with the granting of credit terms, we have recorded bad debt provisions (in an Allowance for Doubtful Accounts) of $4,335,000 , $4,470,000 &#32;and $1,990,000 &#32;in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively (See Schedule II - Valuation and Qualifying Accounts and Reserves, for year-end balances). As a percentage of total revenues, these provisions represented approximately 0.3% &#32;for each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and 0.2% &#32;for the year ended December 31, 2013. In making our credit evaluations, in addition to analyzing and anticipating, where possible, the specific cases described above, we consider the general collection risk associated with trends in the long-term care industry. We also establish credit limits, perform ongoing credit evaluation and monitor accounts to minimize the risk of loss. Notwithstanding our efforts to minimize credit risk exposure, our clients could be adversely affected if future industry trends change in such a manner as to negatively impact their cash flows, as discussed in &#8220;Government Regulation of Clients&#8221; and &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in this report. If our clients experience a negative impact in their cash flows, it would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. 

Competition 

We compete primarily with the in-house support service departments of our potential clients. Most healthcare facilities perform their own support service functions without relying upon outside management firms. In addition, a number of local firms compete with us in the regional markets in which we conduct business. Several national service firms are larger and have greater financial and marketing resources than us, although historically, such firms have concentrated their marketing efforts primarily on hospitals, rather than the long-term care facilities typically serviced by us. Although the competition to provide service to health care facilities is strong, we believe that we compete effectively for new agreements, as well as renewals of existing agreements, based upon the quality and dependability of our services and the cost savings we believe we can usually implement for clients. 

Employees 

At December 31, 2015, we employed approximately 8,600 &#32;management, office support and supervisory personnel. Of these employees, approximately 650 &#32;held executive, regional/district management and office support positions, and approximately 7,900 &#32;of these employees were on-site management personnel. On such date, we employed approximately 37,300 &#32;hourly employees. Many of our hourly employees were previously support employees of our clients. We manage, for a limited number of our client facilities, the hourly employees who remain employed by those clients. 

Approximately 23% &#32;of our hourly employees are unionized. The majority of these employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements that are negotiated by individual client facilities and are assented by us, so as to bind us as an &#8220;employer&#8221; under the agreements. We may be adversely affected by relations between our client facilities and the employee unions or between us and such unions. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. 

Financial Information about Geographic Areas 

Our Housekeeping segment provided services in Canada during 2015 and 2014, although essentially all of its revenues and net income, 99% in each category, were earned in one geographic area, the United States. The Housekeeping segment no longer provides services to Canada as of December 31, 2015. The Dietary segment provides services only in the United States.
