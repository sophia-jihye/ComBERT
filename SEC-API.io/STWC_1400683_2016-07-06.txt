On September 5, 2014 the Company changed its name to Strainwise, Inc.

On September 12, 2014 the Company acquired the remaining outstanding shares of Strainwise Colorado in exchange for the issuance of 2,517,000 shares of its common stock. In connection with this transaction:

&#9679; the Company issued 1,112,350 Series A warrants to former Strainwise Colorado shareholders in exchange for a like number of warrants held by the former Strainwise Colorado shareholders. The Series A warrants the Company issued have the same terms as the warrants exchanged by the former Strainwise Colorado shareholders (exercise price: $5.00 per share/expiration date: January 31, 2019). 

&#160;

&#160;

&#9679; the Company issued 500,000 warrants to one non-affiliated person in exchange for a like number of warrants held by the former Strainwise Colorado warrant holder. The warrants the Company issued have the same terms as the warrants exchanged by the former Strainwise Colorado warrant holder (exercise price: $0.10 per share/expiration date: January 31, 2019). 

Unless otherwise indicated, all references to the Company include the operations of Strainwise Colorado.

On June 7, 2016, the Company changed its name to STWC Holdings, Inc. and changed its corporate domicile to Colorado.

As a result of the acquisition, between September 2014 and June 2015 the Company provided the following services to the retail marijuana outlets and marijuana cultivation facilities (the "Regulated Entities") owned by Shawn Phillips, the Company's former Chief Executive Officer. The services were provided pursuant to a number of Master Service Agreements with the Regulated Entities.

&#9679; Branding, Marketing, Administrative and Consulting Services: Customers may contract with the Company to use the Strainwise name, logo and affinity images in their retail store locations. A monthly fee permits the Company's branding customer to use the Strainwise brand at one specific location. In addition, the Company will assist operators in marketing and managing their businesses, setting up new retail locations and general business planning and execution at an hourly rate. This includes services to establish an efficient, predictable production process, as well as, nutrient recipes for consistent and appealing marijuana strains. 

&#9679; Accounting and Financial Services: For a monthly fee, the Company provides its customers with a fully implemented general ledger system, with an industry centric chart of accounts, which enables management to readily monitor and manage all facets of a marijuana medical dispensary, retail store and cultivation facility. The Company provides bookkeeping, accounts payable processing, cash management, general ledger processing, financial statement preparation, state and municipal sales tax filings, and state and federal income tax compilation and filings on behalf of the Company and the Captive Stores on an ongoing basis. 

&#9679; Compliance Services: The rules, regulations and state laws governing the production, distribution and retail sale of marijuana can be complex, many times obtuse, and may prove cumbersome with which to comply. Thus, customers may contract with the Company to implement a compliance process, based upon the number and type of licenses and permits for their specific business. The Company provides this service on both an hourly rate and stipulated monthly fee. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#9679; Nutrient Supplier: The Company has the ability to act as a sole source nutrient purchasing agent on behalf of potential customers, with pricing based upon the Company's bulk purchasing power. 

The Company does not grow marijuana, produce marijuana infused products, or sell marijuana or marijuana infused products of any nature.

The Company's Master Service agreements with the regulated entities were cancelled on June 30, 2015.

Although the Company plans to make these services available to retail stores and cultivation facilities in the regulated marijuana industry throughout the United States, as of April 30, 2016 the Company was not providing the services listed above to any person or entity.

In anticipation of fully implementing the Company's business plan, management of the Company met with representatives of the Colorado Marijuana Enforcement Division (the "MED") in August 2014 and presented the structure of the Company and its business plan for providing services to the retail marijuana outlets and marijuana cultivation facilities Regulated Entities. Subsequent to the meeting, over 60 license applications for the cultivation and sale of marijuana were approved and licenses were granted to Mr. Phillips.

Mr. Phillips is the sole owner of Rocky Mountain Farmacy, Inc. ("RMF"), one of the Regulated Entities, which operates The Retreat and The Shelter marijuana dispensaries. In November 2014, Mr. Phillips submitted an application to the MED for a retail license for RMF to permit the 51 st Avenue cultivation facility to supply recreational marijuana. On June 11, 2015, the State Licensing Authority issued a "Notice of Grounds for Denial of Retail Marijuana License Application and Notice of Duty to Respond" ("Grounds for Denial").The Grounds for Denial were based upon the belief of the MED that the Company and persons other than Mr. Phillips have a direct or indirect ownership or financial interest in RMF, and such should have been included on the application.

As a result of the foregoing Mr. Phillips made the decision, with concurrence of the management of the Company, to cancel all of the Master Service Agreements with the Regulated Entities effective June 30, 2015. As a result of the cancellation of the Master Service Agreements, the Company terminated approximately 80% of its employees.

Prior to May 2015 the Company leased approximately 118,500 square feet of cultivation facilities to the Regulated Entities. It was estimated that the cultivation facilities had the capacity to provide enough product to supply approximately 15 to 20 marijuana dispensaries. However, as a result of the Grounds for Denial described above, one of the cultivation facilities, the Nome facility, with approximately 38,000 square feet of fully built-out space, was not granted a license to operate, and thus, was never occupied. In addition, and due to the Grounds for Denial, the Regulated Entities have not been able to obtain licenses to operate any new dispensaries. As a result, the cultivation facilities are operating at a loss. Although the marijuana dispensaries owned by the Regulated Entities are operating at a profit, the dispensaries are not able to currently pay all of the amounts billed to them by the Company, since the profits from the dispensaries are being used to fund the operating losses of the cultivation facilities.

&#160;

&#160;

In order to reduce costs, the Nome facility was closed on May 12, 2015 and the employees that had been hired by the Regulated Entities to operate the facility were terminated. On September 30, 2015, with the consent of the owner of the Nome property, the Company's lease for this property was terminated and the associated tenant improvement loan was cancelled.

Operating Leases 

On April 1, 2014, the Company leased a cultivation facility containing approximately 60,500 square feet ("51 st Ave Lease") for a term of five years and nine months, commencing on August 17, 2014. Under the terms of the lease, the Company is obligated to pay a security deposit of $150,000, one-third of which was paid upon the execution of the lease, the second third of which is due and payable after the first harvest or by October 1, 2014, and the final third of which is due and payable after the second harvest or by December 1, 2014. The lessor will provide all of the tenant improvements that will enable the continuous cultivation of marijuana plants in the facility.

On April 22, 2014, the Company leased a cultivation facility containing approximately 38,000 square feet ("Nome Lease") for a term of seven years, commencing on April 22, 2014. As explained above, the Nome facility was closed on May 12, 2015 and, with the consent of the owner of the Nome property, the Company's lease for this property was terminated

On June 10, 2014, the Company leased a cultivation facility containing approximately 113,000 square feet ("32nd Ave Lease") for a term of five years and nine months, commencing on July 1, 2014. In April, 2015 the Company terminated the lease due to the failure of the lessor to comply with the terms of the lease. The owner of the facility filed a claim against the Company, and, under the terms of a settlement, the Company agreed to pay the owner of the facility $100,100 in five (5) equal installments, beginning May 15, 2016. The amount of the settlement was recognized as a loss on the cancellation of the lease during the year ended January 31, 2016.

On September 11, 2014, the Company leased a cultivation facility containing approximately 20,000 square feet ("Bryant Street Lease") for a term of ten years. The Company will provide all of the tenant improvements that will enable the continuous cultivation of marijuana plants in the facility.

During the term of the Bryant Street lease, the Company has the option to purchase the property subject to the lease for $2,400,000. However, the Company does not have an option to purchase the 51 st Avenue facility. The Company has the option to renew the leases described above at the end of their terms at mutually agreed upon rates.

&#160;

See Item 7 of this report for the future minimum payments under the terms of the Operating Leases.

&#160;

None of the persons leasing these facilities to the Company are affiliated with the Company in any way. The Company subleases the cultivation facilities described above to the Regulated Entities for their cultivation operations. The Company charges the Regulated Entities a markup of from 35% to 50% of the amount the Company pays the lessors of these properties.

The Strainwise University curriculum is designed to educate these inexperienced employees. The full curriculum is a collection of 10 courses. Each course will typically take a student one week to complete. Each course requires students to pass a test to receive credit; and upon graduation, students will receive a certificate of participation.

As of June 30, 2016, Strainwise University was not in operation.

Market Conditions 

In January 2014, the market was expanded in Colorado to allow adult use, including adult visitors from other states, of marijuana for recreational purposes. Oregon and Washington have also legalized cannabis for adult use. Many predict that other states will follow in enact legislation or approving ballot measures that expand the permitted use of cannabis.

According to the Colorado Department of Revenue, total sales for medical and recreational marijuana were $996 million and $699.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The state of Colorado collected $135 million and $100 million in sales and excise taxes from the sale of cannabis related products for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Government Regulation 

Marijuana is a Schedule-I controlled substance and is illegal under federal law. Even in those states in which the use of marijuana has been legalized, its use remains a violation of federal law.

&#160;

&#160;

A Schedule I controlled substance is defined as a substance that has no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of safety for use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse. The Department of Justice defines Schedule 1 controlled substances as "the most dangerous drugs of all the drug schedules with potentially severe psychological or physical dependence." If the federal government decides to enforce the Controlled Substances Act in Colorado with respect to marijuana, persons that are charged with distributing, possessing with intent to distribute, or growing marijuana could be subject to fines and terms of imprisonment, the maximum being life imprisonment and a $50 million fine.

As of May 25, 2016, 23 states and the District of Columbia allow their citizens to use Medical Marijuana. Additionally, Colorado, Oregon and Washington have legalized cannabis for adult use. The state laws are in conflict with the federal Controlled Substances Act, which makes marijuana use and possession illegal on a national level. The Obama administration has effectively stated that it is not an efficient use of resources to direct federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by state-designated laws allowing the use and distribution of medical marijuana. However, there is no guarantee that the administration will not change its stated policy regarding the low-priority enforcement of such federal laws. Additionally, any new administration that follows could change this policy and decide to enforce the federal laws strongly. Any such change in the federal government's enforcement of such current federal laws could cause significant financial damage to the Company and its shareholders. While the Company does not intend to harvest, distribute or sell cannabis, the Company may be irreparably harmed by a change in enforcement by the federal or state governments or the enactment of new and more restrictive laws.
