Our solutions are used across the entire project lifecycle to improve productivity, reduce waste and re-work, and enable more informed decision making through enhanced situational awareness, data flow and project collaboration. At the same time, our solutions can improve worker safety and reduce environmental impact. Our suite of integrated solutions and technologies in this area includes field and office software for optimized route selection and design, systems to automatically guide and control construction equipment such as bulldozers, loaders, graders and paving equipment, systems to monitor, track and manage assets, equipment and workers, and software to facilitate the sharing and communication of data in real time. Together, these solutions are designed to transform how work is done within the heavy civil construction industry. 

A key part of our civil construction market portfolio is the Connected Site, which integrates data and information across the entire construction process and across mixed fleets. This includes data from site positioning and machine control systems, construction asset management equipment and services, and various software applications. Utilizing wireless and internet-based site communications infrastructure, our Connected Site solutions include the ability to track and control equipment, perform remote machine diagnostics and reduce re-work. By leveraging the Connected Site technology, contractors gain greater insight into their operations, helping them to lower costs and improve productivity, worker safety, and asset utilization. 

To bolster the software solutions we provide to the Connected Site, we formed a joint venture with Caterpillar in October of 2008, called VirtualSite Solutions (VSS). VSS develops software for fleet management and connected worksite solutions, including subscription-based software as a service solutions. VSS solutions are part of the Connected Site portfolio, and are sold through a world-wide independent dealer channel under the name of SITECH. A separate joint venture with Caterpillar, Caterpillar-Trimble Control Technologies (CTCT) was formed in 2002 to develop the next generation of advanced electronic guidance and control products for earthmoving machines. The joint venture develops machine control and guidance products that use site design information combined with accurate positioning technology to automatically control dozer blades and other machine tools. Caterpillar generally offers joint venture products as a factory-installed option, while Trimble focuses on the aftermarket with products for mixed fleets of earthmoving machines from Caterpillar and other equipment manufacturers to allow improved management of construction sites and projects. Effective in January 2014, Caterpillar and Trimble amended the joint ventures and related agreements between the parties to expand the range of productivity applications and services the companies will provide, and to support development of comprehensive unified fleet solutions for the construction industry. 

During 2015, we acquired Linear Project, a leading provider of scheduling software for infrastructure projects, and Vianova Systems, a company specializing in BIM software for infrastructure design software solutions. The acquisitions extend Trimble&#8217;s Connected Site portfolio, enabling Trimble to deliver solutions for the owner, engineer and contractor to more closely collaborate on projects.

Patents, Licenses and Intellectual Property 

We seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products through the use of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secret laws. We have a program to file applications for and obtain patents, copyrights, and trademarks in the United States and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate. We hold over 1,100 unique issued and enforceable patents, the majority of which cover GNSS based technologies and other applications such as optical and laser technology. We are not dependent on any one patent. We also own numerous trademarks and service marks that contribute to the identity and recognition of Trimble and its products and services globally. We prefer to own the intellectual property used in our products, either directly or through subsidiaries. From time to time we license technology from third parties. 

Competition 

Our markets are highly competitive and we expect that both direct and indirect competition will increase in the future. Within each of our markets, we encounter direct competition from other GNSS, software, optical and laser suppliers such as Hexagon and Topcon, and competition may intensify from various larger U.S. and non-U.S. competitors. Our hardware products are increasingly subject to competition from existing and new entrants from emerging markets such as China, which compete aggressively on price at the lower priced end of the market. Our integrated hardware and software products may also be subject to increasing competition from mass market devices such as smartphones and tablets combined with relatively inexpensive applications, which have not been heavily used for commercial applications in the past. 

Many of our products and solutions are focused on specific industries. In each of these industries we face competition from companies providing point solutions or more traditional, less technology intensive products and services, which often have greater financial resources and more established and recognized brands in those industries. Competing in vertical markets with these more established industry participants requires that we successfully establish a market position and market new and sometimes unfamiliar technology and automated solutions to customers that have not previously used such products. We also increasingly offer enterprise level solutions designed to meet the specific needs of our target industries. In doing so, we face competition from larger and more well established providers of enterprise software and services with whom we have not previously competed. See also "Risk Factors - We face substantial competition in our markets which could decrease our revenue and growth rates or impair our operating results and financial condition." 

Sales and Marketing 

We tailor our distribution to the needs of our products and regional markets around the world. Many of our products are sold worldwide primarily through indirect channels, including distributors, dealers and authorized representatives. Occasionally we grant exclusive rights to market certain products within specific countries. These channels are supported by our regional sales offices throughout the world. We also utilize distribution alliances, OEM relationships, and joint ventures with other companies as a means to serve selected markets, as well as direct sales to end-users. 

During fiscal 2015, sales to customers in the United States represented 50%, Europe represented 24%, Asia Pacific represented 14%, and other regions represented 12% of our total revenue. 

Seasonality of Business 

Construction purchases tend to occur in early spring, and U.S. governmental agencies tend to utilize funds available at the end of the government&#8217;s fiscal year for additional purchases at the end of our third fiscal quarter in September of each year. Our agricultural equipment business revenues have historically been the highest in the first quarter, followed by the second quarter, reflecting buying in anticipation of the spring planting season in the Northern hemisphere. However, overall as a company, as a result of diversification of our business across segments and the increased impact of subscription revenues, we may experience less seasonality in the future. Changes in global macroeconomic conditions could also impact the level of seasonality we experience. 

Backlog 

In most of our markets, the time between order placement and shipment is short. Orders are generally placed by resellers and customers on an as-needed basis. In general, customers may cancel or reschedule orders without penalty. For these reasons, we do not believe that backlog is a meaningful indicator of future revenue or material to understanding our business. &#32; 

Manufacturing 

Manufacturing of many of our GNSS products is subcontracted to Flextronics International Limited in Mexico. We utilize Flextronics for Geospatial, Field Solutions and Mobile Solutions products. We utilize Benchmark Electronics Inc. in China for our Embedded Technologies and Timing products. We utilize Jabil Mexico for our Construction and Mobile Solutions products. 

Our contract manufacturing partners are responsible for significant material procurement, assembly and testing. We continue to manage product design through pilot production for the subcontracted products, and we are directly involved in qualifying suppliers and key components used in all our products. Our current contract with Flextronics continues in effect until either party gives the other ninety days written notice. We also utilize original design manufacturers for some of our products. 

We manufacture our laser and optics-based products, as well as some of our GNSS products, at our plants in Dayton, Ohio; Danderyd, Sweden and Shanghai, China. Some of these products or portions of these products are also subcontracted to third parties for assembly. 

Our design manufacturing and distribution sites in Dayton, Ohio; Sunnyvale, California; Danderyd, Sweden; Eersel, Netherlands and Shanghai, China are registered to ISO9001:2000, covering the design, production, distribution, and servicing of all our products. 

Research and Development 

We believe that our competitive position is maintained through the development and introduction of new products, including software and services, that incorporate improved features and functionality, better performance, smaller size and weight, lower cost, or some combination of these factors. We invest substantially in the development of new products. We also make significant investment in the positioning, communication and information technologies that underlie our products and will likely provide competitive advantages. 

We expect to continue investing in research and development at a rate consistent with our past, with the goal of maintaining or improving our competitive position, and entering new markets. 

Employees
