 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

SEPARATION FROM ONEOK, INC. 

On January 8, 2014, ONEOK&#8217;s board of directors approved the distribution of all the shares of our common stock to holders of ONEOK common stock. 

In order for ONEOK to effect the distribution, we requested, and the SEC declared effective, our Registration Statement on Form 10 on January 10, 2014. ONEOK transferred all of the assets and liabilities primarily related to its natural gas distribution business to us. Assets and liabilities included accounts receivable and payable, natural gas in storage, regulatory assets and liabilities, pipeline and other natural gas distribution facilities, customer deposits, employee-related assets and liabilities, including amounts attributable to pension and other postemployment benefits, tax-related assets and liabilities and other assets and liabilities primarily associated with providing natural gas distribution service in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas. Cash and certain corporate assets, such as office space in the corporate headquarters and certain IT hardware and software, were not transferred to us; however, the Transition Services Agreement between ONEOK and us provided temporary access to such corporate assets as necessary to operate our business prior to obtaining applicable corporate assets on our own. 

Immediately prior to the contribution of the natural gas distribution business to us, ONEOK contributed to the capital of the natural gas distribution business all of the amounts outstanding on the natural gas distribution business&#8217;s short-term note payable to and long-term line of credit with ONEOK. We received approximately $1.19 billion of cash from a private placement of senior notes (which were later exchanged for registered notes), then used a portion of those proceeds to fund a cash payment of approximately $1.13 billion to ONEOK. On January 31, 2014, ONEOK distributed one share of our common stock for every four shares of ONEOK common stock held by ONEOK shareholders of record as of the close of business on January 21, 2014, the record date of the distribution. At the close of business on January 31, 2014, ONE Gas became an independent, publicly traded company as a result of the distribution. Our common stock began trading &#8220;regular-way&#8221; under the ticker symbol &#8220;OGS&#8221; on the NYSE on February 3, 2014. ONEOK did not retain any ownership interest in our company. 

OUR BUSINESS 

We are an independent, publicly traded, 100 percent regulated natural gas distribution utility. We are one of the largest natural gas utilities in the United States. We are an Oklahoma corporation and are the successor to the company founded in 1906 as Oklahoma Natural Gas Company. We are the largest natural gas distributor in Oklahoma and Kansas and the third largest in Texas, providing service as a regulated public utility. We serve residential, commercial and industrial, transportation and wholesale and public authority customers in all three states. Our largest natural gas distribution markets in terms of customers are Oklahoma City and Tulsa, Oklahoma; Kansas City, Wichita and Topeka, Kansas; and Austin and El Paso, Texas. Our three divisions, Oklahoma Natural Gas, Kansas Gas Service and Texas Gas Service, distribute natural gas as public utilities to approximately 88 percent, 72 percent and 14 percent of the natural gas distribution customers in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas, respectively. 

Prior to our separation from ONEOK, our financial statements were derived from ONEOK&#8217;s financial statements, which included its natural gas distribution business as if we, for accounting purposes, had been a separate company for all periods presented. The assets and liabilities in the financial statements have been reflected on a historical basis. The financial statements for periods prior to the separation also include expense allocations for certain corporate functions historically performed by ONEOK, including allocations of general corporate expenses related to executive oversight, accounting, treasury, tax, legal, information technology and other services. We believe our assumptions underlying the financial statements, including the assumptions regarding the allocation of general corporate expenses from ONEOK, are reasonable. However, the financial statements may not include all of the actual expenses that would have been incurred by us and may not reflect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows had we been a separate publicly traded company during the periods presented prior to the separation. 

OUR STRATEGY 

Our business strategy is focused on operating our systems in a safe, reliable and environmentally responsible manner, growing our business strategically, while delivering quality customer service to our customers. Over time, we believe this will enable us to generate a competitive total return for our shareholders and maintain our financial stability, leading to our strategic goals of zero harm and a fair return. We intend to accomplish our objectives by executing on the strategies listed below: 

&#8226; 

Focus on Safety, Reliability and Compliance &#32;- We are committed to pursuing a zero-incident safety and compliance culture through programs, procedures, policies, guidelines and other internal controls designed to mitigate risk and incidents that may harm our employees, contractors, customers, the public or the environment. In addition, a significant portion of our capital spending is focused on the safety, reliability and efficiency of our natural gas distribution system. We are committed to compliance with all federal, state and local laws and regulations. 

&#8226; 

High-performing Workforce &#32;- The foundation of our company consists of our employees. We are committed to attracting, retaining and developing a high-performing workforce where every employee understands that they can and do make a difference. We embrace and promote inclusion, diversity and collaboration. We expect a high standard of performance from our employees. We encourage our workforce to measure their productivity and be accountable for the best work possible. Each day that we do our best to safely and efficiently meet the needs of our customers is a day that leads to individual success and, ultimately, the success of the company. 

&#8226; 

Increase Our Achieved ROE &#32; - &#32; We continually seek to improve our achieved ROE through improved operational performance and regulatory mechanisms. The difference between our achieved and allowed ROE is related primarily to regulatory lag. We make investments that increase our rate base and we incur increases in our costs that are above the amounts reflected in the rates we charge for our service. 

We have several initiatives underway to improve our operational performance. These initiatives include leveraging and implementing technology that is expected to result in increased efficiency, thereby helping reduce the rate of increase in operating expenses. 

Our focus on our credit metrics and maintaining a balanced approach to capital management &#32; are &#32; significant objectives in providing reasonable rates to customers while also providing a fair return to shareholders. &#32; We believe that maintaining an investment-grade credit rating is prudent for our business as we seek to access the capital markets to finance capital investments. As a 100 percent regulated utility, we intend to maintain strong credit metrics while we pursue a balanced approach to capital investment and a return of capital to shareholders via a dividend that we believe will be competitive with our peer group. 

&#8226; 

Advocate Constructive Relationships with Key Stakeholders &#32; - &#32; We plan to continue our constructive, transparent relationships with our key stakeholders, which include our customers, employees, investors and regulators. Our strategy includes seeking outcomes in future rate proceedings that provide a fair return on our infrastructure investments, while also meeting the needs of our customers through safe, reliable and efficient service. 

&#8226; 

Identify and Pursue Growth Opportunities &#32; - Our growth opportunities are a result of capital investments related to safety and reliability of our existing system, and system growth related to the economic and population growth in our service territories. As a result of our commitment to enhance the integrity, reliability and safety of our existing infrastructure, we are making significant investments in our existing system, which we expect to further grow our rate base. In addition, as our service territories continue to experience economic growth, we expect to grow our rate base through capital investments in new service lines and main line extensions, predominately in the major metropolitan areas. 

We believe that the competitiveness of natural gas is increasing, creating new market opportunities for natural gas as an energy source within our existing service territories. 

We remain committed to maintaining our status as a 100 percent regulated company, but will evaluate strategic acquisition opportunities that fall within that guideline based on our disciplined financial and operating approach, while weighing these alternatives against future investment opportunities with respect to our existing rate base. 

REGULATORY OVERVIEW 

We are subject to the regulations and oversight of the state and local regulatory authorities of the territories in which we operate. Rates and charges for natural gas distribution services are established by the OCC for Oklahoma Natural Gas and by the KCC for Kansas Gas Service. Texas Gas Service is subject to regulatory oversight by the various municipalities that it serves, which have primary jurisdiction in their respective areas. Rates in unincorporated areas of Texas and all appellate matters are subject to regulatory oversight by the RRC. These regulatory authorities have the responsibility of ensuring that the utilities in their jurisdictions provide safe and reliable service at a reasonable cost, while providing utility companies the opportunity to earn a fair and reasonable return on their investments. 

Generally, our rates and charges are established in rate case proceedings. Regulatory authorities may also approve mechanisms that allow for adjustments for specific costs or investments made between rate cases. Due to the nature of the regulatory process, there is an inherent lag between the time that we make investments or incur additional costs and the setting of new rates and/or charges to recover those investments or costs. Additionally, we are not allowed recovery of certain costs we incur. The delay between the time investments are made or increases in costs are incurred and the time that our rates are adjusted to reflect these investments and costs is referred to as regulatory lag. 

The following provides additional detail on the regulatory mechanisms in the jurisdictions we serve. 

Oklahoma &#32;- Oklahoma Natural Gas currently operates under a PBRC mechanism, which provides for streamlined annual rate reviews between rate cases and includes adjustments for incremental capital investment and allowed expenses. Under this mechanism, we have an allowed ROE of between 9 percent and 10 percent. If our achieved ROE is below 9 percent, our base rates are increased upon OCC approval to an amount necessary to restore the ROE to 9.5 percent. If our achieved ROE exceeds 10 percent, the portion of the earnings above 10 percent is shared with our customers, who receive the benefit of 75 percent of the earnings above 10 percent. We receive the benefit of the remaining 25 percent. Oklahoma Natural Gas is required to file a rate case on or before June 20, 2021, based on a test year consisting of the twelve months ending December 31, 2020. Other regulatory mechanisms in Oklahoma include the following: 

&#8226; 

PGA Clause - Oklahoma Natural Gas&#8217; commodity, transportation, storage and gas purchase operations and maintenance costs are passed through to its sales customers without markup via the PGA. Any costs associated with natural gas that is lost, used or unaccounted for in operations and the fuel-related portion of bad debts are also recovered through the PGA. 

&#8226; 

TAC - The TAC is designed to reduce the delivery charge component of customers&#8217; bills for the additional volumes used when the actual heating degree days exceed the normalized heating degree days and to increase the delivery charge component of customers&#8217; bills for volumes not used when actual heating degree days are less than the normal heating degree days. The TAC is in effect from November through April. 

&#8226; 

Energy Efficiency Programs - Oklahoma Natural Gas has an Energy-Efficiency Program, available to all of its sales customers. The costs associated with these programs and an incentive to offer these programs are recovered through a monthly surcharge on customer bills. Oklahoma Natural Gas collects approximately $11.5 million each year from sales customers to fund the program, which provides appliance rebates, education and heating system check-ups to promote energy efficiency. 

&#8226; 

Rate Design for Residential Customers - Oklahoma Natural Gas is authorized to utilize a rate structure with two choices. Rate Choice &#8220;A&#8221; is designed for customers whose annual normalized volume is less than 50 Dth. The tariff for these customers contains both a fixed monthly service charge and a per Dth delivery fee. Although a portion of the net margin for customers in Rate Choice &#8220;A&#8221; is dependent on usage, these customers use relatively small quantities of natural gas and therefore the net margin that is dependent on usage is not significant. The fixed monthly residential customer charge for Oklahoma Natural Gas is $16.43, with a delivery fee of $4.1143 per Dth for Rate Choice &#8220;A&#8221; customers. Rate Choice &#8220;B&#8221; is designed for customers whose annual normalized volume is 50 Dth or greater. The tariff for these customers contains only a fixed monthly service charge of $33.57. At December 31, 2015, 71 percent of Oklahoma Natural Gas&#8217; residential customers are on Rate Choice &#8220;B.&#8221; 

&#8226; 

Rate Design for Commercial and Industrial Customers - Oklahoma Natural Gas is authorized to utilize a rate structure with two different rate choices for its Small Commercial and Industrial, or SCI, customers. Rate Choice &#8220;A&#8221; is designed for SCI customers whose annual normalized volume is less than 40 Dth. The tariff for these customers contains both a fixed monthly service charge of $20.55 and a delivery fee of $4.5599 per Dth. Rate Choice &#8220;B&#8221; is designed for SCI customers whose annual normalized volume is 40 Dth or greater but less than 150 Dth. The tariff for these customers contains only a fixed monthly service charge of $35.75. All of Oklahoma Natural Gas&#8217; Large Commercial and Industrial, or LCI, customers, whose annual volume is 150 Dth or greater, but less than 5,000 Dth, are on a fixed monthly service charge of $93.22. At December 31, 2015, 75 percent of Oklahoma Natural Gas&#8217; commercial and industrial customers are on either SCI Rate Choice &#8220;B&#8221; or LCI. 

&#8226; 

Compressed Natural Gas Rebate Program - The CNG Rebate Program is designed to promote and support the CNG market in the state of Oklahoma by offering rebates to Oklahoma residents who purchase dedicated and bi-fueled natural gas vehicles or install residential CNG fueling stations. The rebates are funded by a $0.25 per gasoline gallon equivalent surcharge that Oklahoma Natural Gas is authorized to collect on fuel purchased from a CNG dispenser owned by Oklahoma Natural Gas. Collections from the surcharge to fund the program were not material in 2015. 

For the year ended December 31, 2015, approximately &#32;87 percent of Oklahoma Natural Gas&#8217; net margin from its sales customers was recovered from fixed charges. &#32; 

Kansas &#32;- Kansas Gas Service operates under a traditional regulatory framework, whereby periodic rate cases are filed with the KCC as needed to increase base rates to give Kansas Gas Service the opportunity to earn its authorized ROE. Other regulatory mechanisms in Kansas include the following: 

&#8226; 

COGR and ACA - These mechanisms allow Kansas Gas Service to recover the actual cost of the natural gas it sells to its customers. The COGR includes a monthly estimate of the cost Kansas Gas Service incurs in transporting, storing and purchasing natural gas supply for its sales customers, the ACA and other charges and credits. The ACA is an annual component of the COGR that compares the cost of gas recovered through the COGR for the preceding year with the actual natural gas supply costs and the fuel-related portion of bad debts for the same period. Any over- or under-recovery is reflected in the subsequent year&#8217;s COGR. 

&#8226; 

WNA Clause - This mechanism allows Kansas Gas Service to accrue the variation in net margin due to abnormal weather occurring from November through March. WNA is designed to reduce the delivery charge component of customers&#8217; bills for the additional volumes used when the actual heating degree days exceed the normalized heating degree days and to increase the delivery charge component of customers&#8217; bills for the reduction in volumes used when actual heating degrees days are less than the normal heating degree days. Once a year, the amount of the adjustment is determined and is then applied to customers&#8217; bills over the subsequent 12-month period. 

&#8226; 

ATSR - This rider allows Kansas Gas Service to recover the difference each year between the property tax costs included in its base rates and its actual property tax costs incurred without having to file a rate case. The amount of the adjustment is determined annually and recovered over the subsequent 12 months as a change in the delivery-charge component of customers&#8217; bills. 

&#8226; 

Pension and Other Postemployment Benefits Trackers - These trackers allow Kansas Gas Service to track and defer for recovery in its next rate case the difference between the pension and other postemployment benefit costs included in base rates and actual expense as determined in accordance with GAAP. 

&#8226; 

GSRS - This surcharge allows Kansas Gas Service to file for a rate adjustment providing a recovery of and return on qualifying infrastructure investments, such as expenditures necessary to meet state and federal pipeline safety requirements and government-required relocation projects incurred, each year between rate case filings. However, rate adjustment filings cannot increase a monthly charge more than $0.40 per residential customer over the most recent GSRS filing. After five annual filings, Kansas Gas Service is required to file a rate case or cease collection of the surcharge. 

The fixed monthly residential customer charge for Kansas Gas Service is $15.35. For the year ended December 31, 2015, approximately &#32;55 percent of &#32; Kansas Gas Service &#8217;s net margin from its sales customers was recovered from fixed charges. Kansas e xperiences the highest heating degree days of all of our service territories, which brings a level of stability to net margin even though a significant portion is based on usage. 

Texas &#32;- Texas Gas Service has grouped its customers into 10 service areas. These service areas are further divided into the incorporated cities and the unincorporated areas, referred to as the environs. The incorporated cities in the service areas have original jurisdiction, with the RRC having appellate authority, and the RRC has original jurisdiction for the environs. Periodic rate cases are filed with the cities or the RRC, as needed, to give Texas Gas Service the opportunity to earn its authorized ROE. Other regulatory mechanisms and constructs in Texas include the following: 

&#8226; 

GRIP Statute - For the incorporated cities in three service areas and the environs for four service areas, comprising 44 percent of Texas Gas Service&#8217;s customers, Texas Gas Service makes an annual filing under the GRIP statute, which allows it to recover taxes and depreciation and to earn a return on the annual net increase in investment for the service area. After five annual GRIP filings, Texas Gas Service is required to file a full rate case. A full rate case may be filed at shorter intervals if desired by either Texas Gas Service or the regulator. 

&#8226; 

COSA Filings - In six service areas, comprising 17 percent of its customers, Texas Gas Service makes an annual COSA filing for the incorporated cities. COSA tariffs permit Texas Gas Service to recover return, taxes and depreciation on the annual increases in net investment, as well as annual increases or decreases in certain expenses and 

revenues. Five of the COSAs have a cap of 3.5 percent to 5 percent on all or a portion of the increase. A full rate case may be filed when desired by Texas Gas Service or the regulator, but is not required. 

&#8226; 

EPARR Filings - In the EPSA, comprising 35 percent of its customers, Texas Gas Service makes an annual rate review filing for the incorporated cities. The annual rate review tariff permits Texas Gas Service to recover return, taxes and depreciation on the annual increases in net investment, as well as annual increases or decreases in certain expenses and revenues. There is no cap on the amount of the increase, but the request is subject to review and possible adjustment by the regulator. Upon notice, a full rate case may be filed by Texas Gas Service or the regulator, but is not required. In November 2015, Texas Gas Service notified the cities in the EPSA that it would be filing a full rate case in 2016. 

&#8226; 

WNA Clause - Texas Gas Service employs WNA clauses in eight of its service areas, comprising 62 percent of its customers. In one of the service areas without WNA, which comprises 38 percent of its customers, Texas Gas Service recovers 88 percent of its delivery charge from fixed charges, making revenues in this service area less weather sensitive. WNA is designed to reduce the delivery charge component of customers&#8217; bills for the additional volumes used when the actual heating degree days exceed the normalized heating degree days and to increase the margin component of customers&#8217; bills for the reduction in volumes used when actual heating degree days are less than the normal heating degree days. The WNA is in effect from September through May. 

&#8226; 

COG Clause - In all service areas, Texas Gas Service recovers 100 percent of its gas costs, including interest on natural gas in storage and the natural gas cost component of bad debts, via a COG mechanism, subject to a limitation of 5 percent on lost-and-unaccounted-for natural gas. The COG is reconciled annually to compare the gas costs recovered through the COG with the actual natural gas supply costs. Any over- or under-recovery is refunded or recovered, as applicable, in the subsequent year. 

&#8226; 

Pension and Other Postemployment Benefits - Texas Gas Service is authorized by statute to defer pension and other postemployment benefit costs that exceed the amount recovered in base rates, and to seek recovery of the deferred costs in a future rate case. 

&#8226; 

Pipeline-Integrity Testing Riders - Texas Gas Service recovers approximately 90 percent of its pipeline-integrity testing expenses via riders, COSAs and the EPARR filing, with the remainder included in base rates. 

&#8226; 

Safety-Related Plant Replacements - Texas Gas Service is authorized by RRC rule to defer interest cost, taxes and depreciation expense on safety-related plant replacements from the time the replacements are in service until the plant is reflected in base rates, and to seek recovery of those accrued amounts in a future rate proceeding. 

&#8226; 

Energy Conservation Program - Texas Gas Service has an Energy Conservation Program in its Central Texas service area, comprising 34 percent of total customers. Texas Gas Service collects approximately $3 million per year from customers to fund the program, which provides energy audits, weatherization and appliance rebates to promote energy conservation. 

The average fixed monthly residential customer charge for Texas Gas Service is $15.41, and for the year ended December 31, 2015, approximately 72 percent of Texas Gas Service&#8217;s net margin from its sales customers was recovered fr om fixed charges. &#32; 

MARKET CONDITIONS AND SEASONALITY 

Supply &#32;- We purchased 157 Bcf and 180 Bcf of natural gas supply in 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in 2015 resulted primarily from lower supply requirements due to warmer temperatures as compared with 2014. Our natural gas supply portfolio consists of long-term, seasonal and short-term contracts from a diverse group of suppliers. We award these contracts through competitive-bidding processes to ensure reliable and competitively priced natural gas supply. We acquire our natural gas supply from natural gas processors, marketers and producers. 

An objective of our supply-sourcing strategy is to provide value to our customers through reliable, competitively priced and flexible natural gas supply and transportation from multiple production areas and suppliers. This strategy is designed to mitigate the impact on our supply from physical interruption, financial difficulties of a single supplier, natural disasters and other unforeseen force majeure events, as well as to ensure these resources are reliable and flexible to meet the variations of customer demands. 

We do not anticipate problems with securing natural gas supply to satisfy customer demand; however, if supply shortages were to occur, we have curtailment tariff provisions in place that allow us to reduce or discontinue natural gas service to large industrial users and to request that residential and commercial customers reduce their natural gas requirements to an amount essential for public health and safety. In addition, during times of critical supply disruptions, curtailments of deliveries to customers with firm contracts may be made in accordance with guidelines established by appropriate federal, state and local regulatory agencies. 

Natural gas supply requirements are affected by weather conditions. In addition, economic conditions impact the requirements of our commercial and industrial customers. Natural gas usage per residential customer may decline as customers change their consumption patterns in response to a variety of factors, including: 

&#8226; 

more volatile and higher natural gas prices; 

&#8226; 

customers&#8217; improving the energy efficiency of existing homes by replacing doors and windows, adding insulation, and replacing appliances with more efficient appliances; 

&#8226; 

more energy-efficient construction; and 

&#8226; 

fuel switching from natural gas to electricity. 

In each jurisdiction in which we operate, changes in customer-usage profiles are considered in the periodic redesign of our rates. 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 50.4 Bcf of natural gas storage capacity under lease with remaining terms ranging from one to ten years and maximum allowable daily withdrawal capacity of approximately 1.3 Bcf. This storage capacity allows us to purchase natural gas during the off-peak season and store it for use in the winter periods . This storage is also needed to assure the reliability of gas deliveries during peak demands for natural gas. Approximate ly 25 per cent of our winter natural gas supply needs for our sales customers is expected to be supplied from storage. &#32; 

In managing our natural gas supply portfolios, we partially mitigate price volatility using a combination of financial derivatives and natural gas in storage. We have natural gas financial hedging programs that have been authorized by the regulatory authorities in each state in which we do business. We do not utilize financial derivatives for speculative purposes, nor do we have trading operations associated with our business. 

Demand &#32;- See discussion below under &#8220;Seasonality,&#8221; &#8220;Competition&#8221; and &#8220;Compressed Natural Gas&#8221; for factors affecting demand for our services. 

Seasonality &#32;- Natural gas sales to residential and commercial customers are seasonal, as a substantial portion of their natural gas requirements are for heating. Accordingly, the volume of natural gas sales is higher normally during the months of November through March than in other months of the year. The impact on our margins resulting from weather temperatures that are above or below normal is offset partially through our TAC and WNA mechanisms. See discussion above under &#8220;Regulatory Overview.&#8221; 

Competition &#32;- We encounter competition based on customers&#8217; preference for natural gas, compared with other energy alternatives and their comparative prices. We compete to supply energy for space and water heating, cooking, clothes drying and other general energy needs. Significant energy usage competition occurs between natural gas and electricity in the residential and small commercial markets. Customers and builders typically make the decision on the type of equipment, and therefore the energy source, at initial installation, generally locking in the chosen energy source for the life of the equipment. Changes in the competitive position of natural gas relative to electricity and other energy alternatives have the potential to cause a decline in consumption of natural gas or in the number of natural gas customers. 

The Department of Energy issued a statement of policy that it will use full fuel-cycle measures of energy use and emissions when evaluating energy-conservation standards for appliances. In addition, the EPA has determined that source energy is the most equitable unit for evaluating energy consumption. Assessing energy efficiency in terms of a full fuel-cycle or source-energy analysis, which takes all energy use into account, including transmission, delivery and production losses, in addition to energy consumed at the site, highlights the high overall efficiency of natural gas in residential and commercial uses compared with electricity. 

The below table contains data related to the cost of our delivered gas relative to electricity based on current market conditions:

(3) Calculated as the ratio of the natural gas price equivalent per dekatherm of the average retail price of electricity per kilowatt hour to the ONE Gas delivered average cost of natural gas per dekatherm. 

We are subject to competition from other pipelines for our large industrial and commercial customers, and this competition has and may continue to impact margins. Under our transportation tariffs, qualifying industrial and commercial customers are able to purchase their natural gas needs from the supplier of their choice and have us transport it for a fee. A portion of the transportation services that we provide are at negotiated rates that are below the maximum approved transportation tariff rates. Reduced-rate transportation service may be negotiated when a competitive pipeline is in close proximity or another viable energy option is available to the customer. Increased competition could potentially lower these rates. 

Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) &#32;- In meeting increased interest in CNG for motor vehicle transportation, particularly from fleet operators, we have been developing an incremental source of transportation revenue by supplying natural gas to CNG fueling stations. The benefits of these programs are increased natural gas load, which could help mitigate future residential rate increases, enhanced competitive position and increased customer satisfaction. As of December 31, 2015, we supply 129 fueling stations, 30 of which we operate. Of the 99 remaining stations, we provide supply to 56 retail and 43 private CNG stations. We transported 2.3 million Dth to CNG stations in 2015, which represents an increase of 14 percent compared with 2014. 

We will continue to support industry efforts to encourage development of more vehicle options by car and truck manufacturers, to support third-party investment in CNG fueling stations and to continue tax incentives for CNG. We continue to deploy a minimum amount of capital to connect CNG stations and allow the free market to build and operate the stations.
