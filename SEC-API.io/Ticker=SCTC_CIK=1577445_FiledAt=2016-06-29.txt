Forward-Looking Statements 

&#160;

This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes a number of forward-looking statements that reflect management's current views with respect to future events and financial performance. Forward-looking statements are projections in respect of future events or our future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as "may," "should," "expects," "plans," "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "predicts," "potential" or "continue" or the negative of th ese terms or other comparable terminology. Those statements include statements regarding the intent, belief or current expectations of us and members of our management team as well as the assumptions on which such statements are based. Prospective investors are cautioned that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risk and uncertainties, and that actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements. Based on the discontinuation of our former business plan, our current business model is to identify a viable business operation that can merge with our operation. Any forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding this should be read with a view that such transaction may not occur in the near term or at all. &#160;

These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, including the risks in the section entitled "Risk Factors" set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Readers are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report and in our other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We undertake no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes in the future operating results over time except as required by law. We believe that our assumptions are based upon reasonable data derived from and known about our business and operations. No assurances are made that actual results of operations or the results of our future activities will not differ materially from our assumptions.

Corporate History and Overview 

&#160;

We were incorporated on March 22, 2013 in the State of Nevada. Since inception, we have been engaged in the business of developing web portals to allow companies and individuals to engage in the purchase and sales of vegetarian food products over the Internet. However, we never achieved commercial sales or developed any significant operations. We currently are pursuing a business strategy of acquiring or merging with an entity with significant operations in order to create a viable business model and value for shareholders. 

&#160;

Prior to June 15, 2015, Ihsan Falou had served as our President, Treasurer and as a Director since incorporation and Majid Ali Khan had served as our Secretary and as a Director since incorporation. Ihsan Falou and Majid Ali Kahn were our only directors prior to June 15, 2015. On June 15, 2015, Ihsan Falou resigned as our President, Treasurer and director, and Majid Khan resigned as our Secretary and director. The resignations were not as a result of any disagreements on any matter relating to our operations, policies or practices.

Merger Transaction with Dotz Nano Ltd. 

&#160;

On December 11, 2015, we entered into a merger agreement with Dotz Nano Ltd. ("Dotz"), a private Israeli-based company, and Intellisense (Israel) Ltd. ("Merger Sub"), an Israeli company and direct wholly-owned subsidiary of our company. Pursuant to the merger agreement, the Merger Sub will merge with and into Dotz and Dotz will continue as the surviving corporation. Dotz will be a wholly owned subsidiary and will continue to be governed by the laws of the State of Israel. The merger agreement did not close as of March 31, 2016. 

&#160;

The merger agreement is subject to a number of conditions, which includes, among other conditions: Dotz shareholder approval; Dotz and Merger Sub receiving a Certificate of Merger from the Israeli Companies Registrar; a tax ruling from the Israel Tax Authority on terms and conditions satisfactory to Dotz; our company being reasonably satisfied with Dotz's financial statements; and us having paid all listing fees and caused a market maker to effect the trading of our common stock on the OTCQB market. 

&#160;

The merger agreement also contemplates, among other things, that we will enter into an escrow agreement with certain shareholders of Dotz, whereby such shareholders will agree not to sell any of the Merger Shares for a period of two years; elect Dr. Amiram Bornstein, Kobi Ben-Shabat and Dr. Moti Gross as directors and Dr. Gross as our Chief Executive Officer; accept the resignation of Mr. Reithinger as director and Chief Executive Officer; undergo a stock split prior to closing so that there are approximately 11,000,000 shares of common stock outstanding prior to the merger; establish a stock option plan for grant of options to acquire up to 3,950,000 shares of our common stock; and enter into an employment or consulting agreement with Dr. Gross to act as our Chief Executive Officer, which will include the issuance of up to 2,500,000 shares of our common stock in the event that our company achieves certain milestones. 

&#160;

On May 17, 2016, we entered into a Termination Agreement with Dotz and Merger Sub ("TA") whereby the contemplated transaction with Dotz shall be terminated, cancelled, annulled and of no further force. Pursuant to the terms of the TA, we will receive a termination fee of $50,000, $25,000 upon the execution of the TA and $25,000 on or prior to July 1, 2016 (the "Second Payment"). The Second Payment is personally guaranteed by Dr. Amiram Bornstein, one of the principals of Dotz.
