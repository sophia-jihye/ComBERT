Overview 

&#160; 

Build-A-Bear Workshop, Inc., a Delaware corporation, was formed in 1997 and is primarily a specialty retailer offering a &#8220;make your own stuffed animal&#8221; interactive retail-entertainment experience. As of January 2, 2016, we operated 329 company-owned retail stores in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark, including 269 Build-A-Bear Workshop &#174; stores in the United States and Canada and 60 Build-A-Bear Workshop stores in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark.

Segments and Geographic Areas 

&#160; 

We conduct our operations through three reportable segments consisting of direct-to-consumer (&#8220;DTC&#8221;), international franchising, and commercial. Our reportable segments are primarily determined by the types of customers they serve and the types of products and services that they offer. Each reportable segment may operate in many geographic areas. Financial information related to our segments and the geographic areas in which we operate is contained in &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#8221; See Note 15 &#8211; Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding sales, results of operations and identifiable assets of the Company by business segment and geographic area. 

&#160; 

Description of Operations 

&#160; 

Currently, we primarily operate specialty retail stores that provide a &#8220;make your own stuffed animal&#8221; interactive entertainment experience in which our guests visit a variety of stations within a store in order to make and customize a stuffed animal. Our retail concept is a unique combination of experience and product and we are focused on enhancing our brand equity while meeting the needs of consumers by offering a relevant selection of premium products that meet high quality standards and are trend-right. In addition, we sell products through our e-commerce sites. Our store experience appeals to a broad range of age groups and demographics, including children, as well as their parents and grandparents, teens, and adult collector and affinity consumers. We seek to provide outstanding guest service and experiences across all channels and touch points including our stores, our Web sites, our mobile sites and apps as well as traditional and social media. We have relatively balanced seasonality on a quarterly basis and guests visit our stores for multiple reasons including interactive family experiences, birthdays, parties and other milestone occasions and to purchase gifts including the &#8220;gift of experience&#8221; that comes with a Bear Bucks&#174; gift card. We believe the hands-on and interactive nature of our store and high touch service model result in guests forming an emotional connection with our brand. 

&#160; 

We believe there are opportunities to leverage the strength of the Build-A-Bear brand and generate incremental revenue and profits given the high consumer recognition and strong positioning as a trusted, high quality brand that is emotionally connected with both kids and their parents. 

&#160; 

Operating Strategies 

&#160; 

Our company has been executing a multi-year turnaround plan since 2013 to improve both consolidated comparable sales and profitability with the goals of achieving sustained profitability. In 2015, we delivered our third consecutive year of consolidated comparable sales growth and improved profitability and believe that we are positioned to evolve our goal to sustained profitable growth. In 2016, as we continue to execute our strategic plan with the key initiatives outlined below that we refer to as our MORE Strategy, we expect to deliver both incremental revenue and profit. The four key areas that we are focused on are: 

&#160; 

&#160; 1. 

More places : We plan to continue to diversify, expand and elevate our real estate portfolio while upgrading e-commerce and launching enterprise-selling capabilities. In 2015, we introduced our new &#8220;Discovery&#8221; store format which was designed to drive overall sales productivity and refresh an aged brand look. We opened eleven Discovery stores in 2015 and have seen double-digit sales growth compared to our heritage stores since the introduction. Through a combination of new stores and remodeled locations, we expect to have 45 to 55 Discovery stores by the end of 2016. We also continued to diversify our stores by opening our first ever value-based outlet concept, increased our shop-in-shop presence and expanded our seasonal pop-up locations. Separately, our international model evolved as we converted a previously franchised store in Denmark at Copenhagen&#8217;s Tivoli Gardens tourist attraction to an owned location while our franchisees adopted our successful real estate strategies adding shop-in-shop and seasonal locations in key territories. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 2. 

More product : Our goal is to increase consumer engagement with our brand with products that offer &#8220;play beyond the plush&#8221; using multi-media platforms while we also leverage our brand strength by growing outbound licensing. In 2015, we introduced two new intellectual properties, with the Honey Girls collection that targets older girls and our Promise Pets collection that appeals across segments, and also updated the Merry Mission property that was introduced in 2014 with our new Glisten reindeer character. Glisten became our top selling product in the 2015 fourth quarter. Each of these collections was supported with play beyond the plush including related apps, games, music and videos that have garnered over 10 million digital interfaces. Through the end of fiscal 2015, these properties have collectively contributed almost $60 million in revenue and we plan to expand the collections in the future. We also grew our wholesale business and our outbound licensing programs as we secured ten new agreements spanning a variety of consumer categories. 

&#160; 

&#160; 3. 

More people: We plan to extend our brand by driving our primary consumer segments while increasing demand for our teen-plus and giftables business. We expect to grow our core consumer segments of young girls, older girls and boys with a balanced offering of licensed and internally developed programs while improving our infrastructure and technology in order to drive sales with improved inventory positions. We also plan to continue to broaden our teen-plus segment by leveraging a compelling assortment of affinity, collectible, entertainment, sports and fashion properties to appeal to this generally less price-sensitive demographic that is more likely to purchase online. 

&#160; 

&#160; 4. 

More profitability : We expect to increase our 2016 pretax profit by 15% to 25% over our fiscal 2015 results by the disciplined execution of our stated strategies including those initiatives detailed above as well as our on-going efforts in process improvement, system upgrades, value engineering and strategic pricing to enhance merchandise margins. 

&#160; 

&#160; Merchandise Sourcing and Inventory Management 

&#160; 

Our retail stores offer an extensive and coordinated selection of merchandise, including over 30 different styles of animals to be stuffed, sounds and scents that can be added to the stuffed animals and a wide variety of clothing, shoes and accessories, as well as other brand appropriate toy and novelty items. We believe we comply with governmental toy safety requirements specific to each country where we have stores. 

&#160; 

Our stuffed animal skins and clothing are produced from high quality man-made materials or natural fibers, and the stuffing is made of a high-grade polyester fiber. We believe all of our products in our stores and on our e-commerce sites meet Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) requirements including the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (CPSIA) for Children&#8217;s Products. We also comply with American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM-F963), European Toy Safety Standards (EN71), China National Toy Standards (GB6675/GB5296.5), China Compulsory Certification (CCC) and Canadian Consumer Product Safety Act Toys Regulation (CCPSA). Our products are tested through independent third-party testing labs for compliance with toy safety standards. Packaging and labels for each product indicate to our guests the age grading for the product and any special warnings in accordance with guidelines established by the Consumer Product Safety Commission. We believe that our supplier factories are compliant with the International Council of Toy Industries (ICTI) CARE certification or with other third party social compliance programs. The CARE (Caring, Awareness, Responsible, Ethical) process is the ICTI program to promote ethical manufacturing in the form of fair labor treatment, as well as employee health and safety in the toy industry supply chain worldwide. In order to obtain this certification, each factory completed a rigorous evaluation performed by an accredited ICTI agent. 

&#160; 

The average time from product conception to the arrival of the products into our stores is approximately twelve months, including approximately 90 to 120 days from the beginning of production to in-store delivery. Through an ongoing analysis of selling trends, we regularly update our product assortment by increasing quantities of productive styles and eliminating less productive items. Our relationships with our vendors generally are on a purchase order basis and do not provide a contractual obligation to provide adequate supply or acceptable pricing on a long-term basis. 

&#160; 

&#160; Distribution and Logistics 

&#160; 

We own a 350,000 square-foot distribution center near Columbus, Ohio which serves the majority of our stores in the United States and Canada. We also contract with a third-party warehouse in southern California to service our West Coast stores. The contract has a one year term and is renewable. In Europe, we contract with a third-party distribution center in Selby, England under an agreement that ends in December 2019. This agreement contains clauses that allow for termination if certain performance criteria are not met. 

&#160; 

Transportation from the warehouses to our stores is managed by several third-party logistics providers. In the United States, Canada and Europe, merchandise is shipped by a variety of distribution methods, depending on the store and seasonal inventory demand. Shipments from our distribution centers are scheduled throughout the week in order to smooth workflow and stores are grouped together by shipping route to reduce freight costs. All items in our assortment are eligible for distribution, depending on allocation and fulfillment requirements, and we typically distribute merchandise and supplies to each store once or twice a week on a regular schedule, which allows us to consolidate shipments in order to reduce distribution and shipping costs. Back-up supplies, such as Cub Condo &#174; carrying cases and stuffing for the animals, are often stored in limited amounts at regional pool points. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of January 2, 2016, we had approximately 900 full-time and 3,200 part-time employees in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark. The number of part-time employees at all locations fluctuates depending on our seasonal needs. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we believe our relationship with our employees is good. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

We view the Build-A-Bear Workshop store experience as a distinctive combination of entertainment and retail with limited direct competition. Because our signature product is a stuffed animal, we compete with toy retailers, such as Wal-Mart, Toys &#8220;R&#8221; Us, Target and other discount chains. Since we develop proprietary products, we also compete indirectly with a number of companies that sell stuffed animals in the United States, including, but not limited to, Ty, Fisher Price, Mattel, Ganz, Applause, Hasbro, Commonwealth, Gund and Vermont Teddy Bear. Since we sell a product that integrates merchandise and experience, we also view our competition as any company that competes for family time and entertainment dollars, such as movie theaters, amusement parks and arcades, other mall-based entertainment venues and online entertainment. Being a mall-based retailer, we also compete with other mall-based retailers for prime mall locations, including various apparel, footwear and specialty retailers. 

&#160; 

We are aware of several small companies that operate &#8220;make your own&#8221; teddy bear and stuffed animal stores or kiosks in retail locations, but we believe none of those companies offer the breadth of assortment nor depth of experience or operate as a national or international retail company. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property and Trademarks 

&#160; 

We believe our copyrights, service marks, trademarks, trade secrets, patents and similar intellectual property are critical to our success, and we intend, directly or indirectly, to maintain and protect these marks and, where applicable, license the intellectual property. Our patents have expirations ranging from 2016 to 2033. 

&#160; 

We have developed licensing and strategic relationships with leading retail and cultural organizations. We plan to continue to add partnerships with companies that have strong, family-oriented brands and provide us with attractive marketing and merchandising opportunities. These relationships for specific products are generally reflected in contractual arrangements for limited terms that are terminable by either party upon specified notice. Specifically, we have key strategic relationships with select companies in which we feature their brands on products sold in our stores, including Disney &#174; , DreamWorks Animation, Hasbro, and major professional and collegiate sports along with other culturally relevant brands.
