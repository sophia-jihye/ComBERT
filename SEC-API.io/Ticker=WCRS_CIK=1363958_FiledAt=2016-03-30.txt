RECENT EVENTS 

&#160; 

Acquisition of Direct to Consumer Segment 

&#160;

After the close of business on June 30, 2015, we acquired a 100% ownership interest in the businesses comprising our Direct to Consumer segment. These businesses were acquired through a merger transaction governed by a Merger and Contribution Agreement entered into on June 9, 2015. As contemplated under the Merger and Contribution Agreement, we issued an aggregate of 3,500,000 shares of our common stock, representing approximately 37% of our total issued and outstanding common stock immediately after the merger.

&#160;

1&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Cellular Retail Growth 

&#160;

In 2015, we acquired 51 Cricket retail locations from other Cricket dealers, subsequently closing ten locations as part of a rationalization and store consolidation plan focused on closing underperforming stores and stores in close proximity to others. We also launched three new locations in 2015. In 2016, we thus far have acquired another ten locations and launched three more locations. We continue to seek opportunities to continue our growth in this segment.

&#160;

Acquisitions Department 

&#160;

In February 2015, Angel Donchev joined us as our Chief Investment Officer and head of our new acquisitions department. We believe that Mr. Donchev brings us significant experience in evaluating, negotiating and managing acquisition transactions. In addition, as a former member of our Board of Directors from March 2010 to September 2014, Mr. Donchev is intimately familiar with both our business and our strategy to grow profitability through the acquisition of established companies and diversify the industries and geographies in which we operate.

&#160;

We expect our focus will be on growing through the acquisition of established lower middle-market businesses. We are industry agnostic and target leaders in niche industries or geographies, as well as opportunistic purchases of businesses we believe we can improve operationally. We have a particular interest in situations involving companies facing succession dilemmas, corporate divestitures and businesses in out-of-favor industries.

&#160;

&#160;

Pending Reincorporation 

&#160;

On January 20, 2016, our shareholders approved a plan to reincorporate Western Capital Resources, Inc. in Delaware at a special meeting of the shareholders called for that purpose. Presently, we expect to consummate the reincorporation in April 2016.

&#160;

FRANCHISE SEGMENT 

&#160;

General Description 

&#160;

We offer business format franchise opportunities for AlphaGraphics&#174; Business Centers within the United States and internationally. The AlphaGraphics franchise model permits our franchisees to market and provide customized marketing solutions utilizing AlphaGraphics&#8217; trademarks, operating methods and custom-developed or licensed information technology solutions. Through our preferred vendors, we provide site selection assistance including design and construction oversight, assist with locating financing, and provide training to our franchisees prior to the launch of their franchise Business Center location(s). Additionally, throughout the term of the franchise agreement, we provide ongoing training to franchisees, national and regional advertising, and operational procedures to Business Center owners. Franchisees locate and operate their franchise locations in designated territories within a predetermined geographical region. Franchisees are also responsible to develop and maintain their customer base and operate their Business Center(s) in accordance with the franchise agreement and such standards as we direct from time to time. We profit in this segment primarily through the collection of royalty fees, as further discussed below.

&#160;

2&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The table below summarizes the number of franchised Business Centers in operation during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:

&#160;

In addition to opening new franchise locations, we also assist with the transfer process between current and future franchise owners when a franchisee seeks to sell their franchise center. We facilitated 19 and 13 franchise center transfers to new owners during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

&#160;

Our U.S. and international franchisees reported sales volumes for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 as follows:

The Franchise Process 

&#160;

Potential franchisees have the option to: (1) develop a new Business Center, (2) purchase an existing Business Center, (3) acquire an existing graphics and/or marketing related business and convert it to a Business Center, or (4) convert their own graphics and/or marketing related business to a Business Center. Our discovery process for new Business Center owners involves:

&#160;

&#183; Understanding potential franchisee&#8217;s background and goals &#183; Discussing AlphaGraphics&#8217; vision, objectives and unique B2B value proposition and the profile, style, character and habits of successful AlphaGraphics franchise owners &#183; Completing our no-obligation, confidential online Request for Consideration &#183; Assisting with the funding process &#183; Development of a business plan &#183; Reviewing our Franchise Disclosure Document &#183; Participating in a Discovery Day at our Salt Lake City, Utah location &#183; Providing in-depth discussions with current franchise owners &#183; Executing franchise agreement and paying required fees &#160;

3&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Our new franchise owners must meet the following financial requirements:

&#160;

&#183; Investment range: $260,800 - $394,400 (excluding real estate costs) &#183; Minimum required net worth: $400,000 &#183; Liquid capital: $150,000 &#183; Credit score 700+ &#160;

The Fees We Charge 

&#160;

We assess initial franchise fees, royalty fees, fees to support our dedicated AlphaGraphics Integrated Marketing Fund (&#8220;AIM&#8221;), Managed Service Fees (&#8220;MSF&#8221;) and various other fees. We currently offer a Universal Service Credits (&#8220;USC&#8221; or &#8220;rebate&#8221;) program allowing franchisees to earn a percentage of timely paid royalties as credits which can be used to offset various service and other fees.

&#160;

Royalty fees are billed monthly with fees determined by multiplying a royalty rate against franchisee gross sales. For most franchisees, the rates used range from 8% down to 3%, with the rate decreasing as franchisee fiscal year-to-date gross sales reach established thresholds. The fiscal year for royalty fee calculations is July 1st to June 30th. We may allow franchisees an election to apply their prior year&#8217;s effective rate to their royalty payments with a true up at the end of the fiscal year to adjust to the actual rate schedule.

&#160;

The table below outlines the initial non-refundable franchise fees fixed as of December 31, 2015.

Competition 

&#160;

Franchise Industry 

&#160;

The franchise business model has grown in popularity over the past several decades. Franchising provides a small business owner with the opportunity to independently own and operate a business selling brand-name products or providing established services yet enjoy widespread support from the franchisor. According to USA Today, the ten most popular franchising opportunities are in the following industries:

&#160;

l Fast food l Business Services l Retail l Automotive l Restaurants l Retail &#8211; Food l Building and Construction l Service l Maintenance l Lodging &#160;

Because of the variety of industries participating in the franchising space with high visibility brand recognition, we face considerable competition in attracting new franchise owners.

&#160;

4&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Printing Industry 

&#160;

The quick printing industry is composed of establishments primarily engaged in traditional printing activities, such as short-run offset printing or pre-press services, in combination with document photocopying service. These establishments, known as &#8220;quick printers,&#8221; generally provide short-run printing and copying with fast turnaround times.

&#160;

The digital printing industry is composed of establishments primarily engaged in printing graphic materials using digital printing equipment. Establishments known as digital printers typically provide sophisticated pre-press services, including the use of scanners to input graphic images and computers to manipulate and format the images, prior to printing.

&#160;

We face competition in the printing industry, an industry largely driven by consumer demand and costs to produce, and specifically in the quick and digital printing segments where we operate.

&#160;

Investment in a franchise location is significant, both financially and in time commitment. We believe our franchise model, with its operational advantages and guidance, provides our franchisees with substantial advantage over competitors with stand-alone operations.

&#160;

Industry Information 

&#160;

According to EPICOMM (an association for leaders in print, mail, fulfillment and marketing services), sales within the industry have shown modest gains and corresponding offsetting losses, with the greatest declines realized in 2008 and 2009, and an overall shift to consolidation of commercial printing establishments. Although digitization and the Internet have broken down barriers to entry, the printing industry has found itself in highly competitive markets with little tolerance for inefficiency and spoilage.

&#160;

CELLULAR RETAIL SEGMENT 

&#160;

General Description 

&#160;

We operate cellular retail stores as an authorized Cricket dealer, selling cellular phones and accessories, providing ancillary services and accepting service payments from customers. Authorized Cricket dealers are permitted to sell the carrier&#8217;s line and generally locate their store operations in areas with a strong potential customer base where the carrier does not maintain a corporate storefront. As an authorized Cricket dealer, we are only permitted to sell the Cricket line of no-contract cellular phones and service at our Cricket retail stores.

&#160;

We generate revenue in this business through retail sales of Cricket cellular phones, receipt of back-end compensation from Cricket, sales of phone accessories (e.g., face plates and phone chargers), fees charged when a customer changes services (service activations and reactivations, adding lines, phone number changes, etc.), or whenever a customer whom we activated on the Cricket GSM network pays his or her no-contract cellular bill.

&#160;

A summary table of the number of cellular retail stores we operated during the periods ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 follows:

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 2015 &#160; &#160; 2014 &#160; Beginning &#160; &#160; 61 &#160; &#160; &#160; 57 &#160; Acquired / Launched &#160; &#160; 54 &#160; &#160; &#160; 9 &#160; Closed &#160; &#160; (16 ) &#160; &#160; (5 ) Ending &#160; &#160; 99 &#160; &#160; &#160; 61 &#160; &#160;

Market Information and Marketing 

&#160;

Cricket Wireless service offers customers simple, predictable and affordable nationwide flat rate wireless plans. Cricket Wireless customers have had the added advantage of unlimited minutes, text messages and data on the AT&#38;T network.

&#160;

No-contract cellular products and services are primarily targeted to market segments that are underserved by traditional communications companies. In contrast, the majority of cellular customers in the U.S. subscribe to post-pay services that may require credit approval, a contractual commitment from the subscriber for a period of at least one year, and may include overage charges for call volumes, text messages or data usage in excess of a specified maximum. We believe that a significant portion of the remaining growth potential in the U.S. cellular market consists of customers who are price-sensitive and prefer not to enter into fixed-term contracts. We believe that our cellular retail product and service offerings appeal strongly to this target-market segment.

&#160;

5&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Market Strategy 

&#160;

We believe that our business model is scalable and can be expanded successfully into new markets as we continue to perfect our operational protocols and administrative office functions relating to our cellular retail business. We expect to continue making strategic and opportunistic acquisitions of existing Cricket dealerships and to launch additional stores in new AT&#38;T markets that are currently underserved by competing service providers.

&#160;

Products and Services 

&#160;

Our authorized Cricket retail stores offer the following products and services:

&#160;

&#183; Cricket Wireless service plans, each designed to attract customers by offering simple, predictable and affordable wireless voice, text and data services that are a competitive alternative to traditional wireless and wireline services (e.g., flat-rate and unlimited voice/text plans, without fixed-term contracts, early termination fees or credit checks). &#160;

&#183; Cricket Wireless plan upgrades (e.g., international calling minutes to Canada, unlimited calls to Mexico, and roaming service packages) and special phone applications (e.g., customized ring tones, wallpapers, photos, greeting cards, games, and news and entertainment message deliveries) on a no-contract basis. &#160;

&#183; Cricket handsets. &#160;

When purchasing a phone, our customers also have options among the latest in Apple, Android-based and Windows OS-based smartphones. Because there is no contract for the monthly service, customer phone purchases are paid in full at the time of purchase.

&#160;

Seasonality 

&#160;

Our Cellular Retail segment operations are influenced by seasonal effects related to traditional retail selling periods and other factors that arise from our target customer base. In particular, we generally expect sales activity to be highest in the first and fourth quarters. Nevertheless, our revenues can be strongly affected by the launch of new markets, promotional activity and competitive actions, any of which have the ability to offset or exacerbate the seasonality we normally experience.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

There is substantial and ever increasing competition in the wireless phone industry where customers can choose between many other postpaid and no-contract resellers, including AT&#38;T, Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile/Metro PCS and a larger number of regional providers. We compete for customers based principally on Cricket&#8217;s service/device offerings, price, call quality and coverage area.

&#160;

Competition for the no-contract customers, the sub-industry in which we operate, continues to grow. Other significant no-contract carriers include MetroPCS, Virgin Mobile and Boost Mobile. There is also competition with other no-contract phone service providers such as Straight Talk by Wal-Mart or Wal-Mart&#8217;s Family Mobile powered by T-Mobile, an increase of national retailers offering similar or identical products and services that we provide, such as Cricket phones sold at Game Stop and Wal-Mart, and an increase in mobile virtual network operator (&#8220;MVNO&#8221;) offerings.

&#160;

Our Cricket store business also competes with other actual or potential authorized sellers and distributors of Cricket products and services. The authorization to sell Cricket products and services is granted by Cricket Wireless, LLC, a wholly owned entity of Leap Wireless International, Inc. On March 13, 2014, Leap Wireless International was acquired by AT&#38;T. Presently, we believe that our ability to compete with other sellers of Cricket products and services will depend on the success with which we operate our current store locations. If we successfully manage those stores and are able to develop and maintain a strong working relationship with Cricket, we expect that we may be able to effectively compete for additional store authorizations when and as they come available.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

DIRECT TO CONSUMER SEGMENT 

&#160;

General Description 

&#160; 

Our direct to consumer segment is a direct marketer of roses, plants, seeds, holiday gifts and home restoration products. The business is composed of: 1) a multi-channel retailer of garden and living gift products; 2) a small wholesale seed business; and 3) a multi-channel retailer of home hardware and restoration products. Our garden products brands are highly recognizable in the rose and garden space as both the Jackson &#38; Perkins and Park Seed brands were founded more than 140 years ago.

&#160;

Products and Services 

&#160;

Our direct to consumer segment sells product through catalogs and online under the following brands:

&#160;

&#183; Jackson &#38; Perkins , 145 years of history and the most recognized brand name and the largest seller of premium roses. Jackson and Perkins is the largest seller of bare root roses in the United States, sells 130 active varieties of bare root roses, of which 52 varieties are patented by Jackson and Perkins. In addition to bare root roses, we sell rose bulbs, other flowers as well as live plants packaged as holiday gifts. Holiday gifts include wreathes, baskets and more as well as live decorative Christmas trees and amaryllis; &#183; Park Seed , 148 years in the business and one of America&#8217;s oldest and largest direct seed retailers. The # 2 brand within the seed business, Park Seed sells premium vegetable and flower seeds and various gardening supplies directly to consumers. Park Seed sells approximately 3,000 seed varieties. The wholesale seed business sells seeds, plants and other horticultural products in larger quantities to small-medium sized growers, nurseries and garden centers. Plants and seeds sales are concentrated during the spring months; &#183; Wayside Gardens , which sells unique, hard to find high-end flowers, plants and gardening supplies to the master gardener. The Wayside Gardens customer is extremely selective and will sometimes wait 2 years to fill a garden spot with a plant. Approximately 60% of sales occur in the three months from March to May, during the spring planting season; and &#183; Van Dyke&#8217;s , sells home restoration products, focusing on wood products and hardware. Van Dyke&#8217;s is an online and catalog retailer with a vast assortment of vintage home restoration wood products, hardware and antique furniture, many of which are hard to find. Historically 75% of Van Dyke&#8217;s products are shipped through a third party logistics provider located in St. Louis, MO, and the remaining 25% are drop shipped to customers but this is trending to a 55/45 mix. Sales in 2015 were concentrated in 5 primary categories &#8211; Hardware, Decorative Wood, Home Accents, Knobs and Pulls and Kitchen, Bath and Other Decor. &#160;

Seasonality 

&#160;

Demand for live good and holiday products are cyclical in nature, sensitive to seasonal growing patterns, general weather conditions, holiday sales patterns and competitive influences. As such, the direct to consumer segment&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could fluctuate significantly from period to period. The majority of segment revenue is derived in three selling periods, spring, fall, and the December holiday season, while the summer season accounts for a small portion of sales.

&#160;

Market Strategy 

&#160;

As a direct to consumer retailer, we focus our marketing spending on internet advertising, magazine advertisements and catalogs. We are focused on niche markets and direct our advertising to repeat and new customers through internet marketing strategies.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

In the retail garden business, within the bare root rose category, we compete against brick and mortar garden centers and nurseries (approximately 10,000 across the United States), as well as other online and mail-order retailers, including David Austin Roses and Regan Nursery. Across other plant categories, we compete against Gardens Alive and their portfolio of brands, and other competitors. Our biggest competitive advantages are our recognizable Jackson &#38; Perkins brand name and its proprietary patented rose varieties. The most direct competitor for Wayside Gardens is White Flower Farms, which also focuses on high-end, premium plants.

&#160;

7&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Within the holiday gift segment, we compete against larger competitors including Harry and David and 1-800 Flowers, among others. Within the seed business, our primary competitor is Burpee which, in addition to having an online presence, supplies seed products to mass market retailers, including Wal-Mart.

&#160;

Our Van Dyke&#8217;s Restorers brand competes primarily with other online retailers since brick and mortar stores cannot afford to carry Van Dyke&#8217;s breadth of SKUs. Our competitors are Signature Hardware, House of Antique Hardware, and Rejuvenation Hardware (part of Williams Sonoma). The above-mentioned competitors compete primarily in the hardware, lighting and kitchen and bath categories. The decorative wood portion of the Van Dyke&#8217;s business is in a very fragmented industry niche and there are no big decorative wood competitors. Van Dyke&#8217;s competes primarily through the breadth of its product variety as well as through its established brand name and customer list.

&#160;

CONSUMER FINANCE SEGMENT 

&#160; 

General Description 

&#160;

The majority of short-term consumer loans we provide are commonly referred to as &#8220;payday loans&#8221; or &#8220;cash advance&#8221; loans. Such loans are referred to as &#8220;payday loans&#8221; because they are typically made to borrowers who have no available cash and promise to repay the loan out of their next paycheck. We also provide short-term installment and pawn loans as part of this operating segment.

&#160;

We provide short-term consumer loans in amounts that typically range from $100 to $500 with the average loan amount, including fee, being approximately $416. Cash advance loans provide customers with cash in exchange for a promissory note with a maturity of generally two to four weeks and the customer&#8217;s post-dated personal check for the aggregate amount of the cash advance, plus a fee. The fee varies from state to state based on applicable regulations, and generally ranges from $15 to $22 for each whole or partial increment of $100 borrowed. To repay the cash advance loan, a customer may pay with cash, in which case their personal check is returned to them, or allow the check to be presented to the bank for collection. Approximately 90% and 88% of our lending revenue in the Consumer Finance segment was derived from payday lending in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Payday lending revenue made up approximately 76% of our total revenue in the Consumer Finance segment in 2015 and 2014.

&#160;

We offer short-term &#8220;installment&#8221; loans in Colorado and Wisconsin. Approximately 7% and 9% of our lending revenue in the Consumer Finance segment was derived from installment lending in 2015 and 2014, respectively. We provide our installment loan customers with cash in exchange for a promissory note with a maturity of generally six months. The fee and interest rate on installment loans vary based on applicable regulations. Like cash advance or payday loans, installment loans are unsecured.

&#160;

We operate three pawn stores in our Consumer Finance segment. Our pawn stores provide collateralized non-recourse loans, commonly known as &#8220;pawn loans&#8221; with maturities of one to four months. Allowable service charges vary by state and loan size. The loan amount varies depending on our valuation of each item pawned. We generally lend from 30% to 55% of our estimate of the collateral&#8217;s resale value. Customers have the option to redeem the pawned merchandise during the term or at maturity, or else forfeit the merchandise to us on maturity. At our pawn stores we sell merchandise that was acquired through either customer forfeiture of pawn collateral, second-hand merchandise purchased from customers or consigned to us, or new merchandise purchased from vendors. Pawn store revenues made up approximately 13% and 11% of our total revenue in the Consumer Finance segment in 2015 and 2014, respectively.

&#160;

All of our Consumer Finance lending activities and other services are subject to state regulations (which vary from state to state), federal regulations and local regulation, where applicable.

&#160;

As part of each payday and installment loan transaction, we enter into a standardized written promissory note with the borrowing customer and obtain proof of income and identity, a personal post-dated check for the principal loan amount plus a specified fee if a payday loan, and other documentation. Our standardized contracts vary based on state laws, but all of our contracts plainly state in simple terms the annual percentage rate (assuming the fees we charge are computed as interest) in compliance with Regulation Z, the borrower&#8217;s right to rescind the transaction, a dispute-resolution clause, a notice of financial privacy rights, an affirmative representation about whether the borrower is a member of the U.S. military, and the consequences of defaulting on the loan. We retain copies of our written contracts and provide a signed copy to our customers.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

In general, our lending process and standards are extraordinarily different from those used by banks. To our knowledge, banks typically order and carefully review credit reports on all loans, engage in extensive underwriting analysis, and will typically make independent verification of earnings history through phone calls, reviews of tax returns and other processes. As a result, we generally experience a higher default rate on our personal loans than banks do on their personal loans (see caption below, &#8220;Risks Associated with Our Loans&#8212;Default and Collection&#8221;). At December 31, 2015, we had an aggregate (of all loan types) of approximately:

&#160;

&#183; $4.64 million in current outstanding loan principal, fees and interest due to us &#183; $1.42 million of late loans (customers&#8217; repayment checks presented as NSF within the last 180 days or installment loan balances not past the final installment due date with one or more payments delinquent) &#160;

A summary table of the number of Consumer Finance locations operated during the periods ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 follows:

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 2015 &#160; &#160; 2014 &#160; Beginning &#160; &#160; 51 &#160; &#160; &#160; 52 &#160; Acquired / Launched &#160; &#160; - &#160; &#160; &#160; - &#160; Closed &#160; &#160; (4 ) &#160; &#160; (1 ) Ending &#160; &#160; 47 &#160; &#160; &#160; 51 &#160; &#160; 

The Fees We Charge 

&#160;

The fee we charge for a payday loan varies from state to state, based on applicable regulations, and generally ranges from $15 to $22 for each whole or partial increment of $100 borrowed. We do not charge interest in connection with our payday loans but do charge interest and fees where allowable on our short-term installment loans made in Colorado and Wisconsin. If, however, we calculate the loan fees we charge as an annual percentage rate of interest (APR), such rate would range from 177% for a 31-day loan transacted in Kansas (on the low end) to approximately 536% for a 14-day loan in Wyoming (on the high end), with the actual average loan amount and average actual loan fees we charge involving an imputed annual percentage rate of approximately 439% and 198% for a 14-day and 31-day loan, respectively. The term of a loan significantly affects the imputed APR of the fees we charge for our loans. For instance, when a $15 fee is charged for a two-week loan of $100, the resulting APR is 391%. When the same fee on $100 is charged for a four-week loan, the resulting APR is 195%. Currently, we do not charge the maximum fee permitted in all of the states where we operate. We do, however, charge a uniform fee for all transactions processed in any particular state that involve the same range of payday loan amounts and the same term.

&#160;

Of the eight states in which we presently operate, two states (South Dakota and Wisconsin) do not limit the payday loan fees we may charge or the term (i.e., the length) of the loans we may offer our customers

&#160;

In Wisconsin and Colorado, we generally offer short-term installment loans in amounts from $300 to $2,000 payable in six equal monthly payments. Colorado loan terms include a 45% annual interest rate, an origination fee of 20% on loan amounts up to $300 and 7.5% on loan amounts thereafter, and a monthly maintenance fee. Wisconsin installment loans are payable over four to six months at an annual percentage rate of approximately 480%.

&#160;

In Nebraska and Iowa we also offer pawn loans. Allowable service charges vary by state and loan size. Our pawn loans earn 20% per month and our average pawn loan amount typically ranges between $10 and $250, although may range as high as $2,000. The loan amount varies depending on our estimated value of each item pawned. 

&#160;

Many states have laws limiting the amount of fees that may be charged in connection with any lending transaction (including payday and pawn lending transactions) when calculated as an APR, and some states expressly prohibit payday lending. These limitations, combined with other limitations and restrictions, effectively prohibit us from utilizing our present business model for cash advance or &#8220;payday&#8221; lending in those jurisdictions. In addition, the federal &#8220;2007 Military Authorization Act&#8221; prohibits lenders from offering or making payday loans (or similar lending transactions) to members of the U.S. military when the interest or fees exceed a 36% APR. Like the state limitations discussed above, this limitation effectively prohibits us from providing our cash advance or &#8220;payday&#8221; lending to members of the U.S. military. As a result of these restrictions, we do not conduct business with U.S. military personnel.

&#160;

The above-described payday fees are the only fees we assess and collect from our customers for payday loans. Nevertheless, we also charge a flat fee that ranges from $15 to $30 (depending on the state) for returned checks in the event that a post-dated check we attempt to cash as repayment for our loan is returned. In 2015 and 2014, we had approximately 7,700 and 7,400 checks returned that were assessed a fee.

&#160;

9&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Extensions or &#8220;Rollovers&#8221; of Payday Loans 

&#160;

When a customer &#8220;rolls over&#8221; or extends the term of an outstanding loan, when permitted by state law, we treat that rollover or extension as a brand new loan and we again charge the above-described loan fee for that transaction. This rollover has no effect on the imputed APR of the loan in those cases where the extended term is equal to the initial term of the loan. For example, a $100 four-week loan that costs $20 to obtain is the APR equivalent of 261%. If a customer extends the term of that loan for an additional four-week period, the customer will have paid $40 total in fees to obtain the $100 eight-week loan&#8212;which is again the APR equivalent of 261%. In cases where a customer (1) extends or rolls over a loan for a length of time that is less than the original loan or (2) repays the extended loan prior to the expiration of the fully extended term, the imputed APR will increase. For example, if a customer who obtained an initial $100 four-week loan for $20 in loan fees (the APR equivalent of 261%) later extends the term of that loan for only two additional weeks and pays the additional $20 loan fee, that customer will have borrowed $100 for a six-week period at a total cost of $40&#8212;which is the APR equivalent of 347%. We do not charge any interest on the unpaid fee from the initial term of the loan because, as a condition to agreeing to a loan extension, we will only accept cash payment of the fee for extending the loan.

&#160;

Most states prohibit payday lenders from extending or refinancing a payday loan. Nevertheless, two states in which we presently provide payday loans (North Dakota and South Dakota) permit a loan to be extended or &#8220;rolled over&#8221; for a specified period. Specifically, North Dakota permits only one loan extension and South Dakota permits up to four loan extensions.

&#160;

Risks Associated With Our Loans&#8212;Default and Collection 

&#160;

Ordinarily, our customers approach us for a loan because they currently have insufficient funds to meet their present obligations, and so rarely if ever do our customers have sufficient funds in their checking accounts to cover the personal post-dated checks they provide us at the time of the loan transaction. The nature of our payday loan transactions presents a number of risks, including the ultimate risk that the loan will not be paid back. In addition, we do not obtain security for our payday loans principally because, even assuming our customers would have potential collateral to offer as security for a payday loan, the small size of each particular lending transaction does not justify the time, effort and expense of identifying the collateral and properly obtaining a security interest in such collateral. As a consequence, all of our payday loans are unsecured. This means that, absent court or other legal action compelling a customer to repay our loans, we rely principally on the willingness and ability of our customers to repay amounts they owe us. In this regard, in many cases the costs of merely attempting to collect the amounts owed to us exceed the amounts we would seek to collect&#8212;making it impractical to take formal legal action against a defaulted borrower.

&#160;

When a customer defaults on a loan, we engage in collection practices that include contacting the customer for repayment and the customer&#8217;s bank to determine whether funds are available to satisfy their personal post-dated check. If funds are available, we present the check to the bank for repayment and an official check from the bank is obtained to pay off the item. The costs involved in these initial collection efforts are minimal, involve some employee time and possibly a flat $15-30 bank fee to cover the cost of the cashier&#8217;s check. If funds are not available, we generally attempt to collect returned checks for up to 90 days (or up to 180 days in cases where a bank account is still active and the customer has not initiated a stop payment on the postdated check provided), principally through continued attempts to contact the customer. If our attempts remain unsuccessful after 90 (or 180) days, we assign the item to a collection agency. Assignment to a collection agency may cost us 30-40% of the amount eventually collected (if any) from the customer. Ordinarily, we do not recoup any costs of collection from our customers.

&#160;

Historically, we collect approximately 57% of the amount of all returned checks, which results in approximately 3.04% of our total payday loan principal and fee volume being uncollectible. In 2015, we generated approximately 161,000 payday loan transactions.

&#160; 

Industry Information 

&#160;

According to the Community Financial Services Association of America (CFSA), more than 19 million American households count a payday loan among their choice of short-term credit products. They also estimate 20,600 operating cash advance loan stores in the United States, which in the aggregate provide approximately $38.5 billion annually in short-term credit to households experiencing cash-flow shortfalls. In addition to being a valuable source of credit for many consumers, the payday loan industry makes significant contributions to the U.S. and state economies employing more than 50,000 Americans who earn $2 billion in wages and generating more than $2.6 billion in federal, state, and local taxes. Industry trends indicate that there will likely be a net decrease in total payday lending stores over the next few years due to store closings resulting from a combination of regulatory or legal changes, a slowdown in new store growth, and general economic conditions.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Predatory Lending and Regulatory Concerns 

&#160;

In general, the payday lending industry suffers from the perception and widespread belief that payday lenders are in the nature of predatory lenders, offering loans to low income and poorly educated consumers at costs that are too high to be good for consumers. This perception and belief results in frequent efforts in the U.S. Congress and various state legislatures, often proposed by consumer advocacy groups and lobbyists for traditional financial institutions such as banks, to further regulate and restrict or prohibit payday lending outright. See &#8220;Item 1A &#8211; Risk Factors&#8221; for further information regarding regulatory risks.

&#160;

We do not believe the payday lending is predatory, nor do we believe that our loans are too costly for consumers if they are judiciously obtained. In fact, we believe that bank overdraft fees by themselves are typically far more costly for consumers, and bouncing a check can often involve other negative consequences such as independent fees levied by the parties to whom a bad check is written, negative publicity, etc. In this regard, the FDIC released a November 2008 report called &#8220;Study of Bank Overdraft Programs.&#8221; The report indicates that the average amount obtained when bank customers overdraw their accounts is $60, and the average overdraft fee charged by the bank is $27. This equates to an APR of 1,173% and 587% for a two-week and four-week $60 bank &#8220;loan,&#8221; respectively. In sum, we believe that many of the bad perceptions about our industry are fueled primarily by:

&#160;

&#183; the effects of our loans on consumers who do not judiciously obtain payday loans &#183; a lack of genuine understanding about the choices faced by low and middle-income people facing a critical cash shortage &#183; anti-payday lending lobbying campaigns often funded by traditional financial institutions, such as banks and credit unions, that would economically benefit from the elimination of payday lending. &#160; 

Seasonality 

&#160;

Our Consumer Finance segment results are subject to seasonality, with the first and fourth quarters typically being our strongest periods as a result of broader economic factors, such as holiday spending habits at the end of each year and income tax refunds during the first quarter.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

Like most other payday lenders, we believe that the primary competitive factors in our business are location and customer service. We face intense competition in an industry with relatively low barriers to entry, and we believe that the payday lending markets are becoming more competitive as the industry matures and consolidates. We compete with other payday lending and check cashing stores, and with financial service entities and retail businesses that offer payday loans or similar financial services. For example, we consider credit card companies that offer payday features, credit unions, banks that offer small loans, and creditors and loan services that can extend payment terms on outstanding loans to be our competitors. In addition, we compete in part with services offered by traditional financial institutions, most particularly with respect to the &#8220;overdraft protection&#8221; services those institutions may offer and the charges they levy for checks written with insufficient funds.

&#160;

Additional areas of competition have arisen. Businesses offer loans over the Internet as well as &#8220;loans by phone,&#8221; and these services compete with the services we offer. There also has been increasing penetration of electronic banking and related services into the check cashing and money transfer industry, including direct deposit of payroll checks, payroll or debit cards, stored-value cards, prepaid credit and debit cards, and electronic transfer of government benefits.

&#160;

We also believe that customer service is critical to developing loyalty. In our industry, we believe that quality customer service means:

&#160;

&#183; assisting with the loan application process and helping our customers understand the loan terms &#183; treating customers respectfully &#183; processing transactions with accuracy, efficiency and speed &#160;

11&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Our competitors for pawn store merchandise sales include numerous retail and wholesale stores, including jewelry stores, discount retail stores, consumer electronics stores, other pawn stores, other resale stores, electronic commerce retailers and auction sites.

&#160;

The pawn industry in the United States is large and highly fragmented. The industry consists of approximately 13,000 pawn stores owned primarily by independent operators who own one to three locations. We consider the industry relatively mature. The three largest pawn store operators account for approximately 10% of the total estimated pawn stores in the United States.

&#160;

Effect of General Economic Conditions on our Consumer Finance Segment 

&#160;

While our business experienced fluctuating changes in our provision for loan losses in recent years, our provision for loan losses as a percentage of payday, installment and pawn loan revenue was 17.7% for 2015 and 16.7% in 2014. In sum, we are uncertain how the current economic conditions will affect demand for our services or our loan losses for 2016.

&#160;

Credit and financing available to us and our industry has been negatively impacted by recent federal and state legislation and regulation, including the overall negative perception associated with payday lending. For example, we are aware of federal and state regulatory pressures being exerted on our banking relationships due to the negative perception about payday lending. For more information, see &#8220;Negative Perceptions About Payday Lending&#8221; above and &#8220;Regulation&#8221; below. 

&#160;

REGULATION 

&#160;

We are subject to regulation by federal, state and local governments that affect the products and services we provide. Generally, these regulations are designed to protect consumers who deal with us and are not designed to protect our shareholders.

&#160;

Regulation of Franchise Activities 

&#160;

Our franchise offerings are governed by federal and state laws that require us to provide prospective franchisees with information describing the franchisor-franchisee relationship, and certain financial and operating information about our franchise offering. Annually and when material events occur, we prepare, register or file, and amend our &#8220;Franchise Disclosure Document&#8221; in all states requiring registration.

&#160; 

Regulation of Consumer Financing Activities 

&#160;

In those states where we currently operate consumer finance activities, we are licensed as a payday lender or pawn broker where required and are subject to various state regulations regarding the terms and conditions of our payday, installment and pawn loans and our lending policies, procedures and operations. In some states, payday lending is referred to as &#8220;deferred presentment,&#8221; &#8220;cash advance loans,&#8221; &#8220;deferred deposit loans&#8221; or &#8220;consumer installment loans.&#8221; State regulations normally limit the amount that we may lend to any single consumer and may limit the number of loans that we may make to any consumer at one time or in the course of a single year. State regulations also limit the amount of fees that we may assess in connection with any loan transaction and may limit a customer&#8217;s ability to extend or &#8220;rollover&#8221; a loan with us. Often, state regulations also specify minimum and maximum maturity dates for payday loans and, in some cases, specify mandatory cooling-off periods between transactions.

&#160;

Our payday lending practices must also comply with the disclosure requirements of the Federal Truth-In-Lending Act and Regulation Z under that Act. Our collection activities for delinquent loans are generally subject to consumer protection laws regulating debt-collection practices. Finally, our payday lending business subjects us to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.

&#160;

During the last few years, legislation has been introduced and passed in the U.S. Congress and in certain state legislatures proposing or effecting various restrictions or an outright prohibition on payday lending. Currently, state laws in Arizona, Montana, Oregon and Georgia have effectively eliminated the ability to conduct payday lending in those states. In 2010, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which consolidated most federal regulation of financial services offered to consumers, and replaced the Office of Thrift Supervision&#8217;s seat on the FDIC Board. Almost all credit providers, including mortgage lenders, providers of payday loans, other nonbank financial companies, and banks and credit unions with assets over $10 billion, are now subject to new regulations to be passed by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. While the Bureau does not appear to have authority to make rules limiting interest rates or fees charged, the scope and extent of the Bureau&#8217;s authority will nonetheless be broad, and it is expected that the Bureau will address issues such as rollovers or extensions of payday loans and compliance with federal rules and regulations. Future restrictions on the payday lending industry could have serious consequences for us.

&#160;

12&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

In addition, our Consumer Finance segment activities are subject to the following additional federal consumer laws and regulations:

&#160;

&#183; Unfair, Deceptive or Abusive Acts or Practices (UDAAP) &#183; Collections Fair Debt Collections Practice Act (FDCPA) &#183; Consumer Compliant Management &#183; Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA) (Reg. E) &#183; Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) &#183; Service Members Civil Relief Act &#160;

For more information, see &#8220; PAYDAY LENDING BUSINESS&#8212;Predatory Lending and Regulatory Concerns &#8221; above. 

&#160; 

Financial Reporting Regulation 

&#160;

Regulations promulgated by the United States Department of the Treasury under the Bank Secrecy Act require us to report all transactions involving currency in an amount greater than $10,000. Generally, every financial institution must report each deposit, withdrawal, exchange of currency or other payment or transfer that involves an amount greater than $10,000. In addition, multiple currency transactions must be treated as a single transaction if we have knowledge that the transactions are by or on behalf of any one person and result, in a single business day, in the transfer of cash in or out totaling more than $10,000. In addition, the regulations require us to maintain information concerning sales of monetary instruments for cash in amounts from $3,000 to $10,000. The Bank Secrecy Act requires us, under certain circumstances, to file a suspicious activity report.

&#160;

The Money Laundering Suppression Act of 1994 requires us, as a money service business, to register with the United States Department of the Treasury. Money services businesses include check cashers and sellers of money orders. Money services businesses must renew their registrations every two years, maintain a list of their agents, update the agent list annually, and make the agent list available for examination.

&#160;

Finally, we have established various procedures designed to comply, and we continue to monitor and evaluate our business methods and procedures to ensure compliance with the USA PATRIOT Act.

&#160;

Privacy Regulation 

&#160;

We are subject to a variety of federal and state laws and regulations restricting the use and seeking to protect the confidentiality of customer identity and other personal nonpublic customer information. We have identified our systems that capture and maintain nonpublic personal information, as that term is understood under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and associated regulations. We disclose our public information policies to our customers as required by that law. We also have systems in place intended to safeguard this information as required by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which specifically governs certain aspects of our payday lending business.

&#160;

Technology and Information 

&#160;

We maintain an integrated system of retail points of sale and management software applications and platforms for processing the various types of financial transactions we offer. These systems provide us with customer service, internal control mechanisms, record-keeping and reporting information. Both of our point-of-sale systems used at our payday and Cricket store locations integrate transaction data with our management information systems on a real-time basis, whereas our pawn point of sale system is fully contained. These systems are designed to provide summary, detailed and exception information to regional, area and store managers as well as corporate staff.

&#160;

Franchisees utilize our internally developed intranet site that provides access to tools, resources and information including Business Center contact information, royalty calculations, AIM schedules, the MSF system and the franchisee USC rebate program.

&#160;

13&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Security 

&#160;

We believe the principal security risks to our Consumer Finance and Cellular Retail segments are robbery and employee theft. We have established extensive security and management information systems to address both areas of potential loss. To protect against robbery, most payday lending store employees work behind bullet-resistant glass, and the back office, safe and computer areas are locked and closed to customers. Security measures utilized in our retail locations include mechanical safes, electronic alarm systems monitored by third parties or remote controlled systems, control over entry to customer service representative, motion detection devices, locked cases, and, at times, the use of professional security services. Consumer Finance segment employees also use cellular phones to ensure safety and security whenever they are outside secured areas.

&#160;

We implemented critical safeguarding controls, including daily cash and deposit monitoring, unannounced audits of cash and inventory items, and requiring immediate responses from our staff when irregularities in cash balances are discovered. We primarily self-insure for employee theft and dishonesty at the store level.

&#160;

EMPLOYEES 

&#160;

At December 31, 2015, we had approximately 660 employees. We believe our relationship with our employees is good, and we have not suffered any work stoppages or labor disputes. We do not have any employees that operate under collective-bargaining agreements.

&#160;

CORPORATE INFORMATION 

&#160;

Our principal offices are located at 11550 &#8220;I&#8221; Street, Suite 150, Omaha, Nebraska 68137, and our telephone number at that office is (402) 551-8888.

&#160;

Our fiscal year ends December 31. Neither we nor any of our predecessors have been in bankruptcy, receivership or any similar proceeding.

&#160;
