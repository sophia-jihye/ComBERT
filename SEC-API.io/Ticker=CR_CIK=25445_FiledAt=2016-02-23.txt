 Item 1. Business 

General 

We are a diversified manufacturer of highly engineered industrial products comprised of four segments: Fluid Handling, Payment &#38; Merchandising Technologies, Aerospace &#38; Electronics and Engineered Materials. Our primary markets are chemicals, power, oil &#38; gas, aerospace &#38; defense, along with a wide range of general industrial and consumer related end markets. 

We have been committed to the highest standards of business conduct since 1855 when our founder, R.T. Crane, resolved &#8220;to conduct my business in the strictest honesty and fairness; to avoid all deception and trickery; to deal fairly with both customers and competitors; to be liberal and just toward employees; and to put my whole mind upon the business.&#8221; 

Our strategy is to grow earnings and cash flow by focusing on manufacture of highly engineered industrial products for specific markets where our scale is a relative advantage, and where we can compete based on our proprietary and differentiated technology, our deep vertical expertise, and our responsiveness to unique and diverse customer needs. We continuously evaluate our portfolio, pursue acquisitions that complement our existing businesses and that are accretive to our growth profile, selectively divest businesses where appropriate, and pursue internal mergers to improve efficiency. We strive to foster a performance-based culture focused on productivity and continuous improvement, to attract and retain a committed management team whose interests are directly aligned with those of our shareholders, and to maintain a focused, efficient corporate structure. 

We use a comprehensive set of business processes and operational excellence tools that we call the Crane Business System ("CBS") to drive continuous improvement throughout our businesses. Beginning with a core value of integrity, the Crane Business System incorporates &#8220;Voice of the Customer&#8221; teachings (specific processes designed to capture our customers&#8217; requirements) and a broad range of operational excellence tools into a disciplined strategy deployment process that drives profitable growth by focusing on continuously improving safety, quality, delivery and cost. 

Revenues from outside the United States were approximately 38% and 41% in 2015 and 2014, respectively. For more information regarding our sales and assets by geographical region, see Part II, Item 8 under Note 13, &#8220;Segment Information,&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Reportable Segments 

For additional information on recent business developments and other information about us and our business, you should refer to the information set forth under the captions, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,&#8221; in Part II, Item 7 of this report, as well as in Part II, Item 8 under Note 13, &#8220;Segment Information,&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements for sales, operating profit and assets employed by each segment.

Engineered Materials sells the majority of its products directly to RV, trailer, and truck manufacturers, and it uses distributors and retailers to serve the commercial and industrial construction markets. Manufacturing facilities are located in the United States. 

Acquisitions 

We have completed two acquisitions in the past five years. 

In December 2013, we completed the acquisition of MEI Conlux Holdings (U.S.), Inc. and its affiliate MEI Conlux Holdings (Japan), Inc. (together, &#8220;MEI&#8221;), a leading provider of payment solutions for unattended transaction systems, which serves customers in the transportation, gaming, retail, service payment and vending markets, for a purchase price of $804 million for all of the outstanding equity interests of MEI. MEI had sales of $399 million in 2012 and was integrated into our CPI business within our Payment &#38; Merchandising Technologies segment. Goodwill for this acquisition amounted to $438 million. The amount allocated to goodwill reflects the benefits we expect to realize from the acquisition, specifically, that it will strengthen and broaden our product offering and allow us to improve our global position in all sectors of the market. 

Page 3 

In July 2011, we completed the acquisition of W. T. Armatur GmbH &#38; Co. KG (&#8220;WTA&#8221;), a manufacturer of bellows sealed globe valves, as well as certain types of specialty valves, for chemical, fertilizer and thermal oil applications, for a purchase price of $37 million in cash and $1 million of assumed debt. WTA&#8217;s 2010 sales were approximately $21 million; WTA has been integrated into our Fluid Handling segment. Goodwill for this acquisition amounted to $12 million. 

Divestitures 

We have completed four divestitures in the past five years. 

In 2014, we sold Crane Water, which was formerly part of our Fluid Handling segment, for $2.1 million and recorded a $1.1 million net loss. The business had sales of approximately $15 million in 2013. 

In December 2013, as part of the execution of regulatory remedies associated with the MEI acquisition, we sold a product line, which was formerly part of our Payment &#38; Merchandising Technologies segment, to Suzo-Happ Group for $6.8 million and recorded a $2 million gain. Sales of this product line were $15.1 million in 2013. 

In June 2012, we sold certain assets and operations of the Company&#8217;s valve service center in Houston, Texas, which was formerly part of the Fluid Handling segment, to Furmanite Corporation for $9.3 million. The service center had sales of $14 million &#32;in 2011 and was reported as discontinued operations on our Consolidated Statement of Operations. 

In June 2012, we also sold Azonix Corporation (&#8220;Azonix&#8221;), which was part of our former Controls segment, to Cooper Industries for $44.8 million. Azonix had sales of $32 million &#32;in 2011 and was reported as discontinued operations on our Consolidated Statement of Operations. 

Other Matters Relating to Our Business as a Whole 

Competitive Conditions 

Our businesses participate in markets that are highly competitive. Because of the diversity of products manufactured and sold, our businesses typically have a different set of competitors in each geographic area and end market in which they participate. Accordingly, it is not possible to estimate the number of competitors, or precise market share; however, we believe that we are a principal competitor in most of our markets. Our primary basis of competition is providing high quality products, with technological differentiation, at competitive prices, with superior customer service and timely delivery. 

Our products are sold into markets, including chemical, power, oil &#38; gas, aerospace &#38; defense, along with a wide range of general industrial and consumer related end markets. As such, our revenues depend on numerous unpredictable factors, including changes in market demand, general economic conditions, customer capital spending, and credit availability. Because our products are sold in such a wide variety of markets, we do not believe that we can reliably quantify or predict the potential effects of changes in any of the aforementioned factors. 

Our engineering and product development activities are focused on improving existing products, customizing existing products for particular customer requirements, as well as the development of new products. We own numerous patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and licenses to intellectual property, no one of which is of such importance that termination would materially affect our business. From time to time, however, we do engage in litigation to protect our intellectual property. 

Research and Development 

Research and development costs are expensed when incurred. These costs were $62.8 million , $68.0 million &#32;and $52.7 million &#32;in 2015, 2014 and 2013 , respectively, and were incurred primarily by the Aerospace &#38; Electronics and Payment &#38; Merchandising Technologies segments. 

Our Customers 

No customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues in 2015, 2014 or 2013.

Our Employees 

We employ approximately 11,200 people in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Asia and Australia. For a discussion of risks related to employee relations, please refer to &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors.&#8221; 

Raw Materials 

Our manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of raw materials, including steel, copper, cast iron, electronic components, aluminum, plastics and various petroleum-based products. We purchase raw materials from a large number of independent sources around the world. Although market forces have at times caused increases in the costs of steel, copper and petroleum-based products, there have been no raw materials shortages that have had a material adverse impact on our business, and we believe that we will generally be able to obtain adequate supplies of major raw material requirements or reasonable substitutes at acceptable costs. 

Seasonal Nature of Business 

Our business does not experience significant seasonality. 

Government Contracts 

We have agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities, primarily involving products in our Aerospace &#38; Electronics segment and, to a lesser extent, our Fluid Handling segment. As a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. The laws and regulations governing government contracts differ from those governing private contracts. For example, some government contracts require disclosure of cost and pricing data and impose certain sourcing conditions that are not applicable to private contracts. Our failure to comply with these laws could result in suspension of these contracts, criminal or civil sanctions, administrative penalties and fines or suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time. For a further discussion of risks related to compliance with government contracting requirements; please refer to &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors.&#8221;
