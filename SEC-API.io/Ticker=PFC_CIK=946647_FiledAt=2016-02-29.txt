 Item 1. Business

&#160;

First Defiance Financial Corp. (&#8220;First Defiance&#8221; or &#8220;the Company&#8221;) is a unitary thrift holding company that, through its subsidiaries, First Federal Bank of the Midwest (&#8220;First Federal&#8221; or &#8220;the Bank&#8221;), First Insurance Group of the Midwest, Inc. (&#8220;First Insurance&#8221;), and First Defiance Risk Management Inc. (collectively, &#8220;the Subsidiaries&#8221;), focuses on traditional banking and property and casualty, life and group health insurance products.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s philosophy is to grow and prosper, building long-term relationships based on top quality service, high ethical standards and safe and sound assets. The Company operates as a locally oriented, community-based financial services organization, augmented by experienced, centralized support in select critical areas. The Company&#8217;s local market orientation is reflected in its market area management and local advisory boards, which are comprised of local business persons, professionals and other community representatives that assist area management in responding to local banking needs.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s operating objectives include expansion, diversification within its markets, growth of its fee-based income and growth organically and through acquisitions of financial institutions, branches and financial services businesses. The Company seeks merger or acquisition partners that are culturally similar, have experienced management and possess either significant market area presence or have the potential for improved profitability through financial management, economies of scale and expanded services. The Company regularly evaluates merger and acquisition opportunities and conducts due diligence activities related to possible transactions with other financial institutions. As a result, merger or acquisition discussions and, in some cases, negotiations may take place and future mergers or acquisitions involving cash, debt or equity securities may occur. Acquisitions typically involve the payment of premiums over book and market values and, therefore, some dilution of the Company&#8217;s tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in any future transaction.

&#160;

At December 31, 2015, the Company had consolidated assets of $2.30 billion, consolidated deposits of $1.84 billion, and consolidated stockholders&#8217; equity of $280.2 million. The Company was incorporated in Ohio in June of 1995. Its principal executive offices are located at 601 Clinton Street, Defiance, Ohio 43512, and its telephone number is (419) 782-5015.

&#160; 

First Defiance Risk Management: First Defiance Risk Management was incorporated on December 20, 2012, as a wholly-owned insurance company subsidiary of the Company to insure the Company and the Subsidiaries against certain risks unique to the operations of the Company and for which insurance may not be currently available or economically feasible in today&#8217;s insurance marketplace.

&#160; 

Business Strategy 

&#160;

First Defiance&#8217;s primary objective is to be a high-performing community banking organization, well regarded in its market areas. First Defiance accomplishes this through emphasis on local decision making and empowering its employees with tools and knowledge to serve its customers&#8217; needs. First Defiance believes in a &#8220;Customer First&#8221; philosophy that is strengthened by its Trusted Advisor initiative. First Defiance also has a tagline of &#8220;Better Together&#8221; as an indication of its commitment to local, responsive, personalized service. First Defiance believes this strategy results in greater customer loyalty and profitability through core relationships. First Defiance is focused on diversification of revenue sources and increased market penetration in areas where the growth potential exists for a balance between acquisition and organic growth. The primary elements of First Defiance&#8217;s business strategy are commercial banking, consumer banking, including the origination and sale of single-family residential loans, enhancement of fee income, wealth management and insurance sales, each united by a strong customer service culture throughout the organization.

&#160;

Commercial and Commercial Real Estate Lending - Commercial and commercial real estate lending have been an ongoing focus and a major component of First Federal&#8217;s success. First Federal provides primarily commercial real estate and commercial business loans with an emphasis on owner- occupied commercial real estate and commercial business lending, including a focus on the deposit balances that accompany these relationships. First Federal&#8217;s client base tends to be small to middle market customers with annual gross revenues generally between $1 million and $50 million. First Federal&#8217;s focus is also on securing multiple guarantors in addition to collateral where possible. These customers require First Federal to have a high degree of knowledge and understanding of their business in order to provide them with solutions to their financial needs. First Federal&#8217;s &#8220;Customer First&#8221; philosophy and culture complements this need of its clients. First Federal believes this personal service model differentiates First Federal from its competitors, particularly the larger regional institutions. First Federal offers a wide variety of products to support commercial clients including remote deposit capture and other cash management services. First Federal also believes that the small business customer is a strong market for First Federal. First Federal participates in many of the Small Business Administration lending programs and implemented a program in 2014 targeting the small business customer. Maintaining a diversified portfolio with an emphasis on monitoring industry concentrations and reacting to changes in the credit characteristics of industries is an ongoing focus.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Consumer Banking - First Federal offers customers a full range of deposit and investment products including demand, checking, money market, certificates of deposits, Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (&#8220;CDARS&#8221;) and savings accounts. First Federal offers a full range of investment products through the wealth management department and a wide variety of consumer loan products, including residential mortgage loans, home equity loans, and installment loans. First Federal also offers online banking services, which include mobile banking and online bill pay.

&#160;

Fee Income Development - Generation of fee income and the diversification of revenue sources are accomplished through the mortgage banking operation, First Insurance and the wealth management department as First Defiance seeks to reduce reliance on retail transaction fee income.

&#160;

Deposit Growth - First Federal&#8217;s focus has been to grow core deposits with an emphasis on total relationship banking with both our retail and commercial customers. First Federal has initiated a pricing strategy that considers the whole relationship of the customer. First Federal will continue to focus on increasing its market share in the communities it serves by providing quality products with extraordinary customer service, business development strategies and branch expansion. First Federal will look to grow its footprint in areas believed to further complement its overall market share and complement its strategy of being a high-performing community bank.

&#160;

Asset Quality - Maintaining a strong credit culture is of the utmost importance to First Federal. First Federal has maintained a strong credit approval and review process that has allowed the Company to maintain a credit quality standard that balances the return with the risks of industry concentrations and loan types. First Federal is primarily a collateral lender with an emphasis on cash flow performance, while obtaining additional support from personal guarantees and secondary sources of repayment. First Federal has directed its attention to loan types and markets that it knows well and in which it has historically been successful. First Federal strives to have loan relationships that are well diversified in both size and industry, and monitors the overall trends in the portfolio to maintain its industry and loan type concentration targets. First Federal maintains a problem loan remediation process that focuses on detection and resolution. First Federal maintains a strong process of internal control that subjects the loan portfolio to periodic internal reviews as well as independent third-party loan review.

&#160;

Expansion Opportunities - First Defiance believes it is well positioned to take advantage of acquisitions or other business opportunities in its market areas. First Defiance believes it has a track record of successfully accomplishing both acquisitions and de novo branching in its market area. This track record puts the Company in a solid position to enter or expand its business. First Defiance will continue to be disciplined as well as opportunistic in its approach to future acquisitions and de novo branching with a focus on its primary geographic market area, which it knows well, and has been competing in for a long period of time, as well as surrounding market areas .

&#160;

Securities

&#160;

First Defiance&#8217;s securities portfolio is managed in accordance with a written policy adopted by the Board of Directors and administered by the Investment Committee. The Chief Financial Officer of First Federal, Controller of First Federal, and the Chief Administration Officer of First Federal can each approve transactions up to $3.0 million. Two of the three officers are required to approve transactions between $3.0 million and $5.0 million. All transactions in excess of $5.0 million must be approved by the Board of Directors.

&#160;

First Defiance&#8217;s investment portfolio includes 59 collateralized mortgage obligation (&#8220;CMO&#8221;) issues totaling $71.8 million, all of which are fully amortizing securities. Management does not believe the risks associated with any of its CMO investments are significantly different from risks associated with other pass-through mortgage-backed securities. First Defiance did not have any off-balance sheet derivative securities at December 31, 2015.

&#160;

&#160; - 5 - &#160; 

&#160;

Management determines the appropriate classification of debt securities at the time of purchase. Debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity when First Defiance has the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. Held-to-maturity securities are stated at amortized cost. Debt securities not classified as held-to-maturity and equity securities are classified as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are stated at fair value.

&#160;

The carrying value of securities at December 31, 2015 by contractual maturity is shown below. Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. For purposes of the maturity table, mortgage-backed securities, which are not due at a single maturity date, have been allocated over maturity groupings based on the weighted-average contractual maturities of underlying collateral. The mortgage-backed securities may mature earlier than their weighted-average contractual maturities because of principal prepayments.

Residential Loan Servicing Activities

&#160;

Servicing mortgage loans for investors involves a contractual right to receive a fee for processing and administering loan payments on mortgage loans that are not owned by the Company and are not included on the Company&#8217;s balance sheet. This processing involves collecting monthly mortgage payments on behalf of investors, reporting information to those investors on a monthly basis and maintaining custodial escrow accounts for the payment of principal and interest to investors and property taxes and insurance premiums on behalf of borrowers. At December 31, 2015, First Federal serviced 14,260 loans totaling $1.34 billion. The vast majority of the loans serviced for others are fixed rate conventional mortgage loans. The Company primarily sells its loans to Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae and FHLB. At December 31, 2015, 62.93%, 36.03% and 0.94% of the Company&#8217;s sold loans were to Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae and FHLB, respectively.

&#160;

As compensation for its mortgage servicing activities, the Company receives servicing fees, usually 0.25% per annum of the loan balances serviced, plus any late charges collected from delinquent borrowers and other fees incidental to the services provided. In the event of a default by the borrower, the Company receives no servicing fees until the default is cured.

&#160;

Lending Activities

&#160; 

General &#8211; A savings bank generally may not make loans to one borrower and related entities in an amount which exceeds 15% of its unimpaired capital and surplus, although loans in an amount equal to an additional 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus may be made to a borrower if the loans are fully secured by readily marketable collateral. Real estate is not considered &#8220;readily marketable collateral.&#8221; Certain types of loans are not subject to these limits. In applying these limits, loans to certain borrowers may be aggregated. Notwithstanding the specified limits, a savings bank may lend to one borrower up to $500,000 &#8220;for any purpose.&#8221; At December 31, 2015, First Federal&#8217;s limit on loans-to-one borrower was $39.3 million and its five largest loans (including available lines of credit) or groups of loans to one borrower, including related entities, were $28.3 million, $24.1 million, $23.0 million, $22.9 million and $21.0 million. All of these loans or groups of loans were performing in accordance with their terms at December 31, 2015.

&#160;

Loan Portfolio Composition &#8211; The net increase in net loans receivable over the prior year was $154.8 million, $66.5 million and $57.0 million at December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. The loan portfolio contains no foreign loans. The Company&#8217;s loan portfolio is concentrated geographically in its northwest Ohio, northeast Indiana and southeast Michigan market areas. Management has identified lending for income generating rental properties as an industry concentration. Total loans for income generating property totaled $564.1 million at December 31, 2015, which represents 30.2% of the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio.

The schedule above does not reflect the actual life of the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio. The average life of loans is substantially less than their contractual terms because of prepayments and due-on-sale clauses, which give First Defiance the right to declare a conventional loan immediately due and payable in the event, among other things, that the borrower sells the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid.

The following table sets forth the dollar amount of gross loans due after one year from December 31, 2015 which have fixed interest rates or which have floating or adjustable interest rates.

Originations, Purchases and Sales of Loans &#8211; The lending activities of First Federal are subject to the written, non-discriminatory, underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by the Board of Directors and management. Loan originations are obtained from a variety of sources, including referrals from existing customers, real estate brokers, developers and builders, newspaper and radio advertising and walk-in customers.

&#160;

First Federal&#8217;s loan approval process for all types of loans is intended to assess the borrower&#8217;s ability to repay the loan, the viability of the loan and the adequacy of the value of the collateral that will secure the loan.

&#160;

A commercial loan application is first reviewed and underwritten by one of the commercial loan officers, who may approve credits within their lending limit. Another loan officer with limits sufficient to cover the exposure must approve credits exceeding an individual&#8217;s lending limit. All credits which exceed $100,000 in aggregate exposure must be presented for review or approval to the Senior Loan Committee comprised of senior lending personnel. Credits which exceed $2,000,000 in aggregate exposure must be presented for approval to the Executive Loan Committee.

&#160;

Residential mortgage applications are accepted by retail lenders or branch managers, who utilize an automated underwriting system to review the loan request. First Federal also receives mortgage applications via an online residential mortgage origination system. A final approval of all residential mortgage applications is made by a member of a centralized underwriting staff within their designated lending limits. Loan requests in excess or outside an individual underwriter&#8217;s limit are approved by the Senior Loan Committee and, if necessary, by the Executive Loan Committee.

&#160;

Retail lenders and branch managers are authorized to originate and approve direct consumer loan requests that are within policy guidelines and within the lender&#8217;s approved lending limit. Loans in excess of the lender&#8217;s approved lending limit may be approved by retail lending managers up to their approved lending limit. Loans in excess of the retail lending manager&#8217;s authorized lending limit or outside of policy must be approved by the Senior Loan Committee and, if necessary, by the Executive Loan Committee. Indirect consumer loans originated by auto dealers are underwritten and approved by a designated underwriter in accordance with Company policy and lending limits.

&#160;

First Defiance offers adjustable-rate loans in order to decrease the vulnerability of its operations to changes in interest rates. The demand for adjustable-rate loans in First Defiance&#8217;s primary market area has been a function of several factors, including customer preference, the level of interest rates, the expectations of changes in the level of interest rates and the difference between the interest rates offered for fixed-rate loans and adjustable-rate loans. The relative amount of fixed-rate and adjustable-rate residential loans that can be originated at any time is largely determined by the demand for each in a competitive environment.

&#160;

&#160; - 10 - &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Adjustable-rate loans represented 10.3% of First Defiance&#8217;s total originations of one-to-four family residential mortgage loans in 2015 compared to 11.9% and 9.2% during 2014 and 2013, respectively.

&#160;

Adjustable-rate loans decrease the risks associated with changes in interest rates, but involve other risks, primarily because as interest rates rise, the payment by the borrower rises to the extent permitted by the terms of the loan, thereby increasing the potential for default. At the same time, the marketability of the underlying property may be adversely affected by higher interest rates.

&#160;

The following table shows total loans originated, loan reductions, and the net increase in First Defiance&#8217;s total loans and loans held for sale during the periods indicated:

Asset Quality

&#160;

First Defiance&#8217;s credit policy establishes guidelines to manage credit risk and asset quality. These guidelines include loan review and early identification of problem loans to ensure sound credit decisions. First Defiance&#8217;s credit policies and review procedures are meant to minimize the risk and uncertainties inherent in lending. In following the policies and procedures, management must rely on estimates, appraisals and evaluations of loans and the possibility that changes in these could occur because of changing economic conditions.

Overall, the level of delinquencies at December 31, 2015 decreased from the levels at December 31, 2014, when First Defiance reported that 0.76% of its outstanding loans were at least 30 days delinquent. The level of total loans 90 or more days delinquent has decreased to 0.39% at December 31, 2015 from 0.45% at December 31, 2014. The level of total loans 60-89 days delinquent decreased slightly to 0.13% at December 31, 2015 from 0.19% at December 31, 2014. Overall, the level of loans that were 30 to 59 days past due past due remained steady at 0.12% at both December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. Management has assessed the collectability of all loans that are 90 days or more delinquent as part of its procedures in establishing the allowance for loan losses.

&#160;

Nonperforming Assets &#8211; All loans are reviewed on a regular basis and are placed on non-accrual status when, in the opinion of management, the collectability of additional interest is not expected. Generally, First Defiance places all loans more than 90 days past due on non-accrual status. First Defiance also places loans on non-accrual when the loan is paying as agreed but the Company believes the financial condition of the borrower is such that this classification is warranted. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, total unpaid interest accrued to date is reversed. Subsequent payments are generally applied to the outstanding principal balance but may be recorded as interest income, depending on the assessment of the ultimate collectability of the loan. First Defiance considers that a loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that it will be unable to collect all amounts due (both principal and interest) according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. First Defiance measures impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan&#8217;s effective interest rate, the loan&#8217;s observable market price, or the fair value of the collateral, if collateral dependent. If the estimated recoverability of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment, First Defiance will recognize impairment by allocating a portion of the allowance for loan losses on cash flow dependent loans and by charging off the deficiency on collateral dependent loans.

&#160;

Loans originated by First Federal having principal balances of $41.9 million, $48.9 million and $57.3 million were considered impaired as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The decrease in impaired loans from 2013 to 2015 is due to a continued concerted effort by management and the lending staff to work specific credits out of the Bank or back to performing status. These amounts of impaired loans exclude large groups of small-balance homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment such as residential mortgage, consumer installment and credit card loans. There was $1.3 million of interest received and recorded in income during 2015 related to impaired loans. There was $1.6 million and $2.1 million recorded in 2014 and 2013, respectively. Unrecorded interest income based on the loan&#8217;s contractual terms on these impaired loans and all non-performing loans in 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $1.5 million, $1.2 million, and $1.1 million, respectively. The average recorded investment in impaired loans during 2015, 2014 and 2013 (excluding loans accounted for under FASB ASC Topic 310 Subtopic 30) was $51.8 million, $50.3 million and $65.4 million, respectively. The total allowance for loan losses related to these loans was $0.4 million, $1.3 million, and $1.4 million at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Real estate acquired by foreclosure is classified as real estate owned until such time as it is sold. First Defiance also repossesses other assets securing loans, consisting primarily of automobiles. When such property is acquired it is recorded at fair value less cost to sell. Costs relating to development and improvement of property are capitalized, whereas costs relating to holding the property are expensed. Valuations are periodically performed by management and a write-down of the value is recorded with a corresponding charge to operations if it is determined that the carrying value of property exceeds its estimated net realizable value. During 2015, First Defiance recognized $297,000 of expense related to write-downs in value of real estate acquired by foreclosure.

&#160; 

Allowance for Loan Losses &#8211; First Defiance maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb probable incurred credit losses in the loan portfolio. The allowance for loan loss is made up of two components. The first is a general reserve, which is used to record loan loss reserves for groups of homogenous loans in which the Company estimates the losses incurred in the portfolio based on quantitative and qualitative factors.

&#160;

&#160; - 13 - &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The second component of the allowance for loan loss is the specific reserve in which the Company sets aside reserves based on the analysis of individual credits. In evaluating the adequacy of its allowance each quarter, management grades all loans in the commercial portfolio. See Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis &#8211; Allowance for Loan Losses for further discussion on management&#8217;s evaluation of the allowance for loan losses.

&#160;

Loans are charged against the allowance when such loans meet the Company&#8217;s established policy on loan charge-offs and the allowance itself is adjusted quarterly by recording a provision for loan losses. As such, actual losses and losses provided for should be approximately the same if the overall quality, composition and size of the portfolio remained static along with a static loan environment. To the extent that the portfolio grows at a rapid rate or overall quality or the loan environment deteriorates, the provision generally will exceed charge-offs. However, in certain circumstances net charge-offs may exceed the provision for loan losses when management determines that loans previously provided for in the allowance for loan losses are uncollectible and should be charged off or as overall credit or the loan environment improves. Although management believes that it uses the best information available to make such determinations, future adjustments to the allowances may be necessary, and net earnings could be significantly affected, if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the initial determinations.

&#160;

At December 31, 2015, First Defiance&#8217;s allowance for loan losses totaled $25.4 million compared to $24.8 million at December 31, 2014. The following table sets forth the activity in First Defiance&#8217;s allowance for loan losses during the periods indicated.

&#160;

The provision for credit losses has decreased significantly in 2015 from previous years due to improved credit quality of the loan portfolio. Management anticipates net charge-offs in 2016 to be more consistent with 2014 than 2015 and feels that the level of the allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2015 is sufficient to cover the estimated losses incurred but not yet recognized in the loan portfolio.

Sources of Funds

&#160; 

General &#8211; Deposits are the primary source of First Defiance&#8217;s funds for lending and other investment purposes. In addition to deposits, First Defiance derives funds from loan principal repayments. Loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows are significantly influenced by general interest rates and money market conditions. Borrowings from the FHLB may be used on a short-term basis to compensate for reductions in the availability of funds from other sources. They may also be used on a longer-term basis for general business purposes. During 2007, First Defiance issued $15.0 million of trust preferred securities through an unconsolidated affiliated trust. Proceeds from the offering were used for general corporate purposes including funding of dividends and stock buybacks as well as bolstering regulatory capital at the First Federal level. First Defiance also issued $20.0 million of similar trust preferred securities in 2005.

&#160; 

Deposits &#8211; First Defiance&#8217;s deposits are attracted principally from within First Defiance&#8217;s primary market area through the offering of a broad selection of deposit instruments, including checking accounts, money market accounts, savings accounts, and term certificate accounts. Deposit account terms vary, with the principal differences being the minimum balance required, the time periods the funds must remain on deposit, and the interest rate.

&#160;

To supplement its funding needs, First Defiance also has the ability to utilize the national market for Certificates of Deposit. First Defiance has used these deposits in the past and could in the future if necessary. The total balance of national certificates of deposit was $0 at December 31, 2015 and 2014.

First Defiance borrows funds under a variety of programs at the FHLB. As of December 31, 2015, there was $59.9 million outstanding under various long-term FHLB advance programs. First Defiance utilizes short-term advances from the FHLB to meet cash flow needs and for short-term investment purposes. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, no outstanding balances existed under First Defiance&#8217;s short-term Cash Management Advance Line of Credit. The total available under this line is $15.0 million. Additionally, First Defiance has $100.0 million available under a REPO line of credit. Amounts are generally borrowed under these lines on an overnight basis. First Federal&#8217;s total borrowing capacity at the FHLB is limited by various collateral requirements. Eligible collateral includes mortgage loans, home equity loans, non-mortgage loans, cash, and investment securities. At December 31, 2015, other than amounts available on the REPO and Cash Management line, First Federal had additional borrowing capacity with the FHLB of $452.0 million as a result of these collateral requirements.

&#160;

As a member of the FHLB of Cincinnati, First Federal must maintain a minimum investment in the capital stock of that FHLB in an amount defined in the FHLB&#8217;s regulations. First Federal is permitted to own stock in excess of the minimum requirement and was in compliance with the minimum requirement with an investment in stock of the FHLB of Cincinnati of $13.8 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014. First Federal holds stock of the FHLB of Indianapolis of $9,000 at December 31, 2015 and $10,000 at December 31, 2014.

&#160;

Each FHLB is required to establish standards of community investment or service that its members must maintain for continued access to long-term advances from the FHLB. The standards take into account a member&#8217;s performance under the Community Reinvestment Act and its record of lending to first-time homebuyers.

Subordinated Debentures - In March 2007, the Company sponsored an affiliated trust, First Defiance Statutory Trust II (&#8220;Trust Affiliate II&#8221;) that issued $15.0 million of Guaranteed Capital Trust Securities (&#8220;Trust Preferred Securities&#8221;). In connection with the transaction, the Company issued $15.5 million of Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures (&#8220;Subordinated Debentures&#8221;) to Trust Affiliate II. Trust Affiliate II was formed for the purpose of issuing Trust Preferred Securities to third-party investors and investing the proceeds from the sale of these capital securities solely in Subordinated Debentures of the Company. The Subordinated Debentures held by Trust Affiliate II are the sole assets of the trust. Distributions on the Trust Preferred Securities issued by Trust Affiliate II are payable quarterly at a variable rate equal to the three-month LIBOR rate plus 1.5%. The Coupon rate payable on the Trust Preferred Securities issued by Trust Affiliate II was 2.01% and 1.74% as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 respectively.

&#160; 

The Trust Preferred Securities are subject to mandatory redemption, in whole or in part, upon repayment of the Subordinated Debentures. The Company entered into an agreement that fully and unconditionally guarantees the Trust Preferred Securities subject to the terms of the guarantee. The Trust Preferred Securities and Subordinated Debentures mature on June 15, 2037, but can be redeemed at the Company&#8217;s option at any time now. 

&#160; 

In October 2005, the Company formed an affiliated trust, First Defiance Statutory Trust I (&#8220;Trust Affiliate I&#8221;) that issued $20.0 million of Trust Preferred Securities. In connection with the transaction, the Company issued $20.6 million of Subordinated Debentures to Trust Affiliate I. Trust Affiliate I was formed for the purpose of issuing Trust Preferred Securities to third-party investors and investing the proceeds from the sale of these capital securities solely in Subordinated Debentures of the Company. The Subordinated Debentures held by Trust Affiliate I are the sole assets of the trust. Distributions on the Trust Preferred Securities issued by Trust Affiliate I are payable quarterly at a variable rate equal to the three-month LIBOR rate plus 1.38%, or 1.89% and 1.62% as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 respectively. 

&#160;

The Trust Preferred Securities issued by Trust Affiliate I are subject to mandatory redemption, in whole or in part, upon repayment of the Subordinated Debentures. The Company entered into an agreement that fully and unconditionally guarantees the Trust Preferred Securities subject to the terms of the guarantee. The Trust Preferred Securities and Subordinated Debentures mature on December 15, 2035, but can be redeemed by the Company at any time now.

&#160;

Employees

&#160;

First Defiance had 586 employees at December 31, 2015. None of these employees are represented by a collective bargaining agent, and First Defiance believes that it maintains good relationships with its personnel.

&#160;

Competition

&#160;

Competition in originating non-residential mortgage and commercial loans comes mainly from commercial banks with banking center offices in the Company&#8217;s market area. Competition for the origination of mortgage loans arises mainly from savings associations, commercial banks, and mortgage companies. The distinction among market participants is based on a combination of price, the quality of customer service and name recognition. The Company competes for loans by offering competitive interest rates and product types and by seeking to provide a higher level of personal service to borrowers than is furnished by competitors. First Federal has a significant market share of the lending markets in which it conducts operations.

&#160;

Management believes that First Federal&#8217;s most direct competition for deposits comes from local financial institutions. The distinction among market participants is based on price and the quality of customer service and name recognition. First Federal&#8217;s cost of funds fluctuates with general market interest rates. During certain interest rate environments, additional significant competition for deposits may be expected from corporate and governmental debt securities, as well as from money market mutual funds. First Federal competes for conventional deposits by emphasizing quality of service, extensive product lines and competitive pricing.

Regulation

&#160; 

General &#8211; First Defiance and First Federal are subject to regulation, examination and oversight by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (&#8220;OCC&#8221;) and the Federal Reserve Board (&#8220;Federal Reserve&#8221;). Because the FDIC insures First Federal&#8217;s deposits, First Federal is also subject to examination and regulation by the FDIC. In addition, First Federal is subject to regulation and examination by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the &#8220;CFPB&#8221;) established by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (&#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;). First Defiance and First Federal must file periodic reports with the Federal Reserve and the OCC and examinations are conducted periodically by the Federal Reserve, OCC and the FDIC to determine whether First Defiance and First Federal are in compliance with various regulatory requirements and are operating in a safe and sound manner. First Federal is subject to various consumer protection and fair lending laws. These laws govern, among other things, truth-in-lending disclosure, equal credit opportunity, and, in the case of First Federal, fair credit reporting and community reinvestment. Failure to abide by federal laws and regulations governing community reinvestment could limit the ability of First Federal to open a new branch or engage in a merger transaction. Community reinvestment regulations evaluate how well and to what extent First Federal lends and invests in its designated service area, with particular emphasis on low-to-moderate income communities and borrowers in such areas.

&#160;

First Defiance is also subject to various Ohio laws which restrict takeover bids, tender offers and control-share acquisitions involving public companies which have significant ties to Ohio.

&#160; 

Regulatory Capital Requirements &#8211; The federal banking regulators have adopted risk-based capital guidelines for financial institutions and their holding companies, designed to absorb losses. The guidelines provide a systematic analytical framework, which makes regulatory capital requirements sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banking organizations, takes off-balance sheet exposures expressly into account in evaluating capital adequacy and minimizes disincentives to holding liquid, low-risk assets. Capital levels as measured by these standards are also used to categorize financial institutions for purposes of certain prompt corrective action regulatory provisions. 

&#160;

Prior to January 1, 2015, the guidelines applicable to First Defiance and First Federal included a minimum for the ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of 8%, with at least half of the ratio composed of common shareholders&#8217; equity, minority interests in certain equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries and a limited amount of qualifying preferred stock and qualified trust preferred securities, less goodwill and certain other intangible assets (known as &#8220;Tier 1&#8221; risk-based capital). The guidelines also provided for a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to average assets, or &#8220;leverage ratio,&#8221; of 3% for savings and loan holding companies that meet certain criteria, including having the highest regulatory rating, and 4% for all other savings and loan holding companies.

&#160;

The risk-based capital guidelines adopted by the federal banking agencies are based on the &#8220;International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standard&#8221; (Basel I), published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the &#8220;Basel Committee&#8221;) in 1988. In 2004, the Basel Committee published a new capital adequacy framework (Basel II) for large, internationally active banking organizations, and in December 2010 and January 2011, the Basel Committee issued an update to Basel II (&#8220;Basel III&#8221;). The Basel Committee frameworks did not become applicable to financial institutions supervised in the United States until adopted into United States law or regulations. Although the United States banking regulators imposed some of the Basel II and Basel III rules on financial institutions with $250 billion or more in assets or $10 billion of on-balance sheet foreign exposure, it was not until July 2013 that the United States banking regulators issued final (or, in the case of the FDIC, interim final) new capital rules applicable to smaller banking organizations which also implement certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act (the &#8220;Basel III Capital Rules&#8221;). Community banking organizations, including First Defiance and First Federal, began transitioning to the new rules on January 1, 2015. The new minimum capital requirements became effective on January 1, 2015, whereas a new capital conservation buffer and deductions from common equity capital phase in from January 1, 2016, through January 1, 2019, and most deductions from common equity tier 1 capital will phase in from January 1, 2015, through January 1, 2019.

&#160;

&#160; - 19 - &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The new rules include (a) a new common equity tier 1 (&#8220;CET1&#8221;) capital ratio of at least 4.5%, (b) a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6.0%, rather than the former 4.0%, (c) a minimum total capital ratio that remains at 8.0%, and (d) a minimum leverage ratio of 4%.

&#160;

Common equity for the common equity tier 1 capital ratio includes common stock (plus related surplus) and retained earnings, plus limited amounts of minority interests in the form of common stock, less the majority of certain regulatory deductions.

&#160;

Tier 1 capital includes common equity as defined for the common equity tier 1 capital ratio, plus certain non-cumulative preferred stock and related surplus, cumulative preferred stock and related surplus and trust preferred securities that have been grandfathered (but which are not permitted going forward), and limited amounts of minority interests in the form of additional Tier 1 capital instruments, less certain deductions.

&#160;

Tier 2 capital, which can be included in the total capital ratio, includes certain capital instruments (such as subordinated debt) and limited amounts of the allowance for loan and lease losses, subject to new eligibility criteria, less applicable deductions.

&#160;

The deductions from common equity tier 1 capital include goodwill and other intangibles, certain deferred tax assets, mortgage-servicing assets above certain levels, gains on sale in connection with a securitization, investments in a banking organization&#8217;s own capital instruments and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions (above certain levels). The deductions phase in from 2015 through 2019.

&#160;

Under the guidelines, capital is compared to the relative risk related to the balance sheet. To derive the risk included in the balance sheet, one of several risk weights is applied to different balance sheet and off-balance sheet assets, primarily based on the relative credit risk of the counterparty. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors.

&#160;

The new rules also place restrictions on the payment of capital distributions, including dividends, and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers if the company does not hold a capital conservation buffer of greater than 2.5% composed of common equity tier 1 capital above its minimum risk-based capital requirements, or if its eligible retained income is negative in that quarter and its capital conservation buffer ratio was less than 2.5% at the beginning of the quarter. The capital conservation buffer phases in starting on January 1, 2016, at .625%. The implementation of Basel III did not have a material impact on First Defiance&#8217;s or First Federal&#8217;s capital ratios.

Prompt Corrective Action - The federal banking agencies have established a system of &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; to resolve certain problems of undercapitalized institutions. This system is based on five capital level categories for insured depository institutions: &#34;well capitalized,&#34; &#34;adequately capitalized,&#34; &#34;undercapitalized,&#34; &#34;significantly undercapitalized&#34; and &#34;critically undercapitalized.&#34; The federal banking agencies may (or in some cases must) take certain supervisory actions depending upon a bank's capital level. For example, the banking agencies must appoint a receiver or conservator for a bank within 90 days after it becomes &#34;critically undercapitalized&#34; unless the bank's primary regulator determines, with the concurrence of the FDIC, that other action would better achieve regulatory purposes. Banking operations otherwise may be significantly affected depending on a bank's capital category. For example, a bank that is not &#34;well capitalized&#34; generally is prohibited from accepting brokered deposits and offering interest rates on deposits higher than the prevailing rate in its market, and the holding company of any undercapitalized depository institution must guarantee, in part, specific aspects of the bank's capital plan for the plan to be acceptable.

&#160;

Effective January 1, 2015, in order to be &#34;well-capitalized,&#34; a financial institution must have a common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5%, a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital of at least 8% and a leverage ratio of at least 5%, and the institution must not be subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. As of December 31, 2015, First Federal met the ratio requirements in effect at that date to be deemed &#34;well-capitalized.&#34; See Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements which is incorporated herein by reference.

&#160;

Dividends - Dividends paid by First Federal to First Defiance are subject to various regulatory restrictions. First Federal paid $29.0 million in dividends to First Defiance in 2015 and $21.0 million in 2014. First Federal can initiate dividend payments equal to its net profits (as defined by statute) for the last two fiscal years, plus any year to date net profits. Because First Federal already paid out its 2014 and 2015 net profits in dividends to First Defiance, during 2016, First Federal can only declare dividends from its 2016 net profits. First Insurance paid $900,000 in dividends to First Defiance in 2015 and $1.2 million in dividends in 2014. First Defiance Risk Management paid $1.0 million in dividends to First Defiance in 2015 and none in 2014.

First Defiance&#8217;s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders is primarily dependent on its receipt of dividends from the Subsidiaries. The Federal Reserve expects First Defiance to serve as a source of strength for First Federal and may require First Defiance to retain capital for further investment in First Federal, rather than pay dividends to First Defiance shareholders. Payment of dividends by First Federal may be restricted at any time at the discretion of its applicable regulatory authorities if they deem such dividends to constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice. These provisions could have the effect of limiting First Defiance's ability to pay dividends on its common shares.

&#160; 

Transactions with Insiders and Affiliates - Loans to executive officers, directors and principal shareholders and their related interests must conform to the lending limits. Most loans to directors, executive officers and principal shareholders must be approved in advance by a majority of the &#8220;disinterested&#8221; members of board of directors of the association with any &#8220;interested&#8221; director not participating. All loans to directors, executive officers and principal shareholders must be made on terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions with the general public or as offered to all employees in a company-wide benefit program. Loans to executive officers are subject to additional restrictions. In addition, all related party transactions must be approved by the Company&#8217;s audit committee pursuant to NASDAQ Rule 5630, including loans made by financial institutions in the ordinary course of business. All transactions between savings associations and their affiliates must comply with Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act (&#8220;FRA&#8221;) and the Federal Reserve&#8217;s Regulation W. An affiliate of a savings association is any company or entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the savings association. First Defiance, First Defiance Risk Management and First Insurance are affiliates of First Federal.

&#160;

Holding Company Regulation - First Defiance is a unitary thrift holding company and is subject to the Federal Reserve regulations, examination, supervision and reporting requirements. Federal law generally prohibits a thrift holding company from controlling any other savings association or thrift holding company, without prior approval of the Federal Reserve, or from acquiring or retaining more than 5% of the voting shares of a savings association or holding company thereof, which is not a subsidiary.

&#160;

Deposit Insurance - Substantially all of the deposits of First Federal are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC, and First Federal is assessed deposit insurance premiums to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund. Insurance premiums for each insured institution are determined based upon the institution&#8217;s capital level and supervisory rating provided to the FDIC by the institution&#8217;s primary federal regulator and other information deemed by the FDIC to be relevant to the risk posed to the Deposit Insurance Fund by the institution. The assessment rate is then applied to the amount of the institution&#8217;s deposits to determine the institution&#8217;s insurance premium.

&#160;

The FDIC issued final rules effective April 2011 that changed the deposit insurance assessment base, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act. As adopted, the final rule changed the deposit insurance assessment base from domestic deposits to average assets less average tangible equity. The final rule also set a target size for the Deposit Insurance Fund at 2% of insured deposits and implements a lower assessment rate schedule when the fund reaches 1.15% and, in lieu of dividends, provides for a lower rate schedule when the reserve ratio reaches 2% and 2.5%. The final rule went into effect beginning with the second quarter of 2011. The change to the assessment base and assessment rates, as well as the Deposit Insurance Fund restoration time frame, has lowered First Defiance&#8217;s deposit insurance assessment.

&#160;

In addition, the FDIC has proposed changing the deposit insurance premium assessment method for banks with less than $10 billion in assets that have been insured by the FDIC for at least five years. The proposed changes would revise the financial ratios method so that it would be based on a statistical model estimating the probability of failure of a bank over three years; update the financial measures used in the financial ratios method consistent with the statistical model; and eliminate risk categories for established small banks and using the financial ratios method to determine assessment rates for all such banks (subject to minimum or maximum initial assessment rates based upon a bank&#8217;s composite examination rating).

As insurer, the FDIC is authorized to conduct examinations of, and to require reporting by, federally-insured institutions. It also may prohibit any federally-insured institution from engaging in any activity the FDIC determines by regulation or order to pose a serious threat to the Deposit Insurance Fund. The FDIC also has the authority to take enforcement actions against insured institutions. Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC or written agreement entered into with the FDIC. The management of First Federal does not know of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance.

Recent Developments 

&#160; 

Impact of Legislation - Over the last several years, Congress and the U.S. Department of the Treasury have enacted legislation and taken actions to address the disruptions in the financial system, declines in the housing market, and the overall regulation of financial institutions and the financial system. In this regard, the Dodd-Frank Act, includes provisions affecting large and small financial institutions alike, including several provisions that profoundly affect the regulation of community banks, thrifts, and bank and thrift holding companies, such as First Defiance. The Dodd-Frank Act relaxed rules regarding interstate branching, allows financial institutions to pay interest on business checking accounts, changed the scope of federal deposit insurance coverage, imposed new capital requirements on bank and thrift holding companies, and imposed limits on debit card interchange fees charged by issuer banks (commonly known as the Durbin Amendment).

&#160;

The Dodd-Frank Act also established the CFPB as an independent bureau within the Federal Reserve, which has broad authority to regulate consumer financial products and services and entities offering such products and services, including banks.

&#160;

The CFPB has indicated that mortgage lending is an area of supervisory focus and that it will concentrate its examination and rulemaking efforts on the variety of mortgage-related topics required under the Dodd-Frank Act, including steering consumers to less-favorable products, discrimination, abusive or unfair lending practices, predatory lending, origination disclosures, minimum mortgage underwriting standards, mortgage loan originator compensation, and servicing practices. The CFPB has published numerous final regulations impacting the mortgage industry, including rules related to ability-to-pay, mortgage servicing, and mortgage loan originator compensation and more regulations are anticipated. First Defiance cannot predict the content of the final CFPB and other federal agency regulations or the impact they might have on First Defiance&#8217;s financial results. The CFPB&#8217;s authority over mortgage lending, and its authority to change regulations adopted in the past by other regulators, or to rescind or ignore past regulatory guidance, could increase First Defiance&#8217;s compliance costs and litigation exposure.
