Overview of Business 

&#160; 

OriginClear is a leading provider of water treatment solutions and the developer of a breakthrough water cleanup technology. Through its wholly owned subsidiaries, OriginClear provides systems and services to treat water in a wide range of industries, such as municipal, pharmaceutical, semiconductors, industrial, and oil &#38; gas. To rapidly grow this segment of the business, we strategically acquire profitable and well-managed water treatment companies, which allow us to expand our global market presence and technical expertise. To enable a new era of clean and socially responsible water treatment solutions, we invented Electro Water Separation&#8482;, a breakthrough high-speed water cleanup technology using multi-stage electrochemistry, that we license worldwide to water treatment equipment manufacturers.Water is our most valuable resource, and the mission of The OriginClear Group&#8482; is to improve the quality of water and help return it to its original and clear condition.

&#160;

The Group 

&#160;

Outsourcing is a fast-growing reality in water treatment. Tougher regulations, water scarcities and general outsourcing trends are driving industrial and agricultural water treatment users to delegate their water problem to service providers. As Global Water Intelligence pointed out in their report on October 30, 2015, &#8220;Water is often perceived as a secondary importance, with end-users increasingly wanting to focus solely on their own core business. This is driving a move away from internal water personnel towards external service experts to take control of water aspects.&#8221; External service experts are typically small&#8211;privately owned and locally operated. Consolidating these companies could lead to enormous economies of scale through sharing of best practices, technologies, and customers. Again, Global Water Intelligence report, dated May 8, 2014 indicated, &#8220;&#8230;the market is incredibly fragmented&#8230;There needs to be some sort of aggregation of customers before it becomes a truly good business.&#8221; Therefore, OriginClear is assembling a group of such water treatment companies to create an opportunity for significant growth and increased company value for the stockholders. 

&#160;

Progressive Water Treatment 

&#160; 

On October 1, 2015, Dallas-based Progressive Water Treatment, Inc. (&#8220;PWT&#8221;) became the first acquisition in The OriginClear Group. PWT is a fast-growing designer, builder and service provider for a wide range of industrial water treatment applications. PWT reported revenue of $4,831,788 in 2015, of which $773,699 was included in the consolidated financial statements for period ending December 31, 2015.

&#160;

PWT&#8217;s Business 

&#160; 

Since 1995, Progressive Water Treatment, Inc. of McKinney, Texas has been designing and manufacturing a complete line of water treatment systems for municipal, industrial and pure water applications. Known as an OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer), PWT utilizes a wide range of technologies, including chemical injection, media filters, membrane, ion exchange and SCADA technology, in turnkey systems that it designs and builds. The Company also offers a broad range of services including maintenance contracts, retrofits and replacement assistance. In addition, PWT rents equipment in contracts of varying duration. Customers are primarily served in the United States and Canada, with the Company&#8217;s reach extending worldwide from Japan to Argentina to the Middle East. As OriginClear&#8217;s technology matures and enters commercial distribution channels, PWT intends to integrate it into applicable field situations, such as clarifying very oily, turbid water prior to processing with filters and membranes. OriginClear is currently in discussions for additional, accretive acquisitions of companies specializing in complementary markets and applications. 

&#160;

Technology Licensing 

&#160;

For its first eight years of existence, OriginClear focused uniquely on development and commercialization of its breakthrough Electro Water Separation&#8482; technology. In 2015, the technology team became self-sufficient and the Company launched it as OriginClear Technologies, operating in parallel to the OriginClear Group. The mission of OriginClear Technologies is to develop Electro Water Separation&#8482; and achieve its full recognition as an international industry standard in treating our increasingly complex wastewater treatment challenges. For this purpose, OriginClear Technologies relies on an ongoing strong R&#38;D and engineering activity for the development of its technology, while actively building its network of partners, licensees and joint venture partners for commercial development. A key element of this strategy is OriginClear (HK), OriginClear&#8217;s wholly-owned subsidiary in Hong Kong that manages Asia-Pacific market development, with a special focus on China sales and manufacturing. While OriginClear Technologies focuses on developing and monetizing the Company&#8217;s internally-developed Intellectual Property, best practices and trade secrets, it is expected to do the same for technologies which may come in the future with OriginClear Group&#8217;s acquisition of profitable water treatment companies. 

&#160;

The Technology 

&#160;

OriginClear is the proprietary developer of Electro Water Separation&#8482; (EWS), the high-speed, primarily chemical-free technology to clean up large quantities of water. It removes oils, suspended solids, certain dissolved solids, and pathogens, in a continuous and energy-efficient process. The Company originally developed this technology to solve the challenge of removing microalgae from a highly dilute state. The EWS technology remains the most efficient mechanism for the concentration of live algae cells from water. The electro-chemical process was then extended, first to cleaning up oil and gas waste water and most recently, to industrial, agricultural and urban effluents. These water treatment applications are entirely electrochemical in nature and do not rely on algae for its cleaning capabilities, which is a separate application of the technology. EWS is designed to be an early step in removal of oils, solids and pathogens; reducing the work that more expensive, downstream processes such as Ultra Filtration or Reverse Osmosis must do, therefore enabling more cost-efficient and high-volume water cleanup overall. 

&#160; 

In March of 2016, OriginClear announced that it had successfully developed and proved Advanced Oxidation for its breakthrough water cleanup system, Electro Water Separation&#8482;, or EWS. University laboratory tests have shown that EWS with Advanced Oxidation (EWS:AOx&#8482;) can now extract dissolved contaminants, which are otherwise difficult to remove without chemicals such as chlorine. Overall, the system has shown a dramatic reduction in Total Organic Compounds which includes all forms of organic contamination, solids, miscible or dissolved, to meet new stringent global discharge requirements. Even prior to this innovation, EWS, combined with an iSep ultrafiltration membrane, demonstrated up to a 99.9% removal of dispersed oil, 99.5% removal of suspended solids as well as successful treatment of chemical oxygen demand (COD), including specific contaminants such as ammonia, phosphorus and hydrogen sulfide. These results were presented at the International Water Conference in 2015. In 2016, OriginClear filed for a patent to protect the new AOx process and system configuration. Our technology integrates easily with other industry processes. We have begun to embed our technology into larger systems through licensing and joint ventures.

&#160; 

Recent Developments 

&#160;

We have been engaged in our business operations since June 2007, and to date, we have been primarily involved in research and development activities, with licensing to OEMs, and sales of pilot and demonstration equipment beginning in June of 2010. Commercial sales by both OriginClear and its licensees began in 2014. We are a joint venture partner in Ennesys, a system integrator focused on algae production to meet the European Union&#8217;s environmental regulations. In mid-2013, we installed a prototype EWS Waste unit at the Ennesys demonstration site which can process liquid waste, generating clean, nitrate-rich water to feed algae grown on the building&#8217;s roof as an energy source. In late 2013, we transferred three of our non-core patent applications to Ennesys. We continue to support Ennesys with technology and public communications. On October 1, 2015, OriginClear announced it had acquired 100 percent of Dallas-based Progressive Water Treatment Inc. (PWT), a profitable and fast-growing designer, builder and service provider for a wide range of industrial water treatment applications. This marks the first transaction in OriginClear&#8217;s corporate strategy to rapidly acquire leading U.S. water service companies focused on specialized water treatment. OriginClear aims to offer a complementary, end-to-end offering to serve growing corporate demand for outsourced water treatment. The Company acquired PWT through the transfer of all issued and outstanding shares of PWT in exchange (the &#8220;Exchange&#8221;) for 10,000 shares of a new series of preferred stock, the Series B Preferred Stock, filed with the State of Nevada by the Company on October 1, 2015. 

&#160; 

In December 2014, OriginClear announced that it launched a subsidiary in Hong Kong and granted it a master license for the People&#8217;s Republic of China. On December 3, 2015, OriginClear, and its master licensee for China, OriginClear Hong Kong (OCHK), announced that OCHK had agreed to launch sales and manufacturing joint ventures (JVs) in the People&#8217;s Republic of China and the Republic of China (Taiwan). The JV partner is Mr. Ming Xu, an inventor and owner of a construction materials factory in mainland China. Mr. Xu and OCHK plan to form a joint venture in China, intended to be a licensee of OCHK. The JV will sell equipment using OriginClear technology for People&#8217;s Republic of China and Taiwan markets. The partners intend to name the company OriginClear (China) and the agreement calls for Xu Ming to transfer 25 percent of its ownership and profit share to OCHK, in addition to meeting a royalty schedule. Finally, the JV will continue the development of the China-based manufacturing capability with a separate manufacturing joint venture. Under the agreements, Mr. Xu committed to payments totaling $1 million to purchase the rights to the JVs, and completed payments totaling $150,000 in December. In March 2016, OCHK modified the payment schedule. The parties agreed to a modified payment schedule for the balance of $850,000, to be completed by May 25, 2016. The parties also agreed that all sums received by OCHK under the present MOU remain OCHK&#8217;s property and will not be subject to any reimbursement claim whatsoever, present and future, from Xu Ming or any of his affiliates. In March 2016, OCHK also agreed to launch a Joint Venture (JV) with Osmocell Malaysia SDN Bhd, a Malaysian engineering and manufacturing company for water purification systems. The JV company, OriginClear Water Solutions SDN Bhd (OWS) is now operational. OWS plans to target the Palm Oil Mill Effluent (POME) treatment market in Malaysia. Totaling more than 65 million tonnes annually, POME effluent is widely recognized as a major environmental concern because its contamination level can be 100 times higher than domestic sewage. 

&#160; 

On March 25, 2016, by written consent the holders of the majority of the Company&#8217;s outstanding securities entitled to vote thereon approved an amendment to the Company&#8217;s Articles of Incorporation to increase the total number of shares of common stock that we are authorized to issue to 2,500,000,000 shares (from 1,000,000,000) and to increase the total number of authorized shares to 2,525,000,000 (there being no change to the number of previously authorized shares of preferred stock or par value) (the &#8220;Amendment&#8221;). The Amendment was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada on March 29, 2016. 

&#160;

Our Strategy 

&#160;

The Group 

&#160;

The OriginClear Group&#8217;s strategy is to grow incrementally by focusing on the $500 billion water treatment market, acquiring the hands on service suppliers in this market. It intends to develop a network of these wholly-owned water treatment companies to meet the needs of end users from all industries with a full range of treatment technologies. Due to increased regulation, water treatment recycling challenges and a need to focus on their own core business, many water users today are outsourcing their water treatment needs to outside experts. There will be significant synergies within the Group as technology, manufacturing expertise, market knowledge, projects and opportunities are shared. The target acquisitions must be accretive in nature with solid sales growth and profitability. The acquired companies must have a solid management team to accelerate their previous growth with excellent customer service. Initially, the acquisition focus is in the U.S. but will be expanded internationally in a few years.

Technology Licensing 

&#160; 

We are licensors of our technology. We grant non-exclusive licenses to OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers), and participate in joint ventures, contributing our technology and our commitment to each joint venture&#8217;s business focus. We have also begun to grant Master Licenses, beginning with our wholly-owned subsidiary in Hong Kong. 

&#160;

Technology Applications 

&#160;

The Algae Industry 

&#160; 

Much of the petroleum that powers our world comes from ancient algae that decomposed hundreds of millions of years ago. Like petroleum, algae can be turned into transportation fuels, chemicals, pharmaceuticals and plastics; but unlike petroleum, algae is a food as well; and absorbs CO2 in the growth process, about two tons of CO2 for every ton of algae produced. Algae is one of nature&#8242;s most efficient and versatile photosynthetic factories. It has a short growing cycle and does not require arable land or fresh water, which makes it very attractive as an energy feedstock, or as a healthy and natural feed or fertilizer. But a major barrier to commercialization is the difficulty in extracting small amounts of algae biomass from very large quantities of water at a reasonable cost and without using more energy than can be created. And the quantities of water required can be very large indeed: algae-to-water ratio can be as high as 1-to-1000. Conventional water separation technologies such as centrifuges and membranes may work on a limited basis, but can be too expensive for large-scale use. Additionally, centrifuges are typically a batch process. 

Early Harvesting Technology: Single Step Extraction&#8482; 

&#160; 

OriginClear&#8217;s early algae harvesting technology was Single Step Extraction&#8482; (SSE). Today, SSE is the first stage in EWS and it powers our sanitation and growth optimizing applications. 

&#160; 

Algae For Feed 

&#160;

In 2013, OriginClear developed demonstration systems for the aquaculture industry and showed these at a public event on December 18, 2013 at Aqua Farming Tech, a working fish farm in Thermal, California. Aqua Farming Tech remains a testing site for OriginClear&#8217;s aquaculture activities. In 2014, OriginClear assigned its aquaculture initiative to the algae division to focus on the growing opportunities in the Algae For Feed marketplace. In April 2014, OriginClear announced that it had agreed to a collaborative exchange of equipment and information with the Catalina Sea Ranch, the first offshore shellfish ranch in U.S. Federal waters. OriginClear provided a demonstration-scale Model 12 system to Catalina Sea Ranch, which has used it to treat incoming seawater and harvest algae to feed its shellfish nursery and selective breeding program. Catalina Sea Ranch provides independent data on the efficiency and use of the machine, and gives OriginClear access to its nursery for field research. OriginClear aims to continue to support the growing algae industry in the fast-growing animal and fish feed sector. 

&#160; 

The Oil and Gas Industry 

&#160;

The oil and gas industry is one of the most water-intensive industries in the world. It is both a large consumer of fresh water and producer of contaminated water, which is also a potential asset for drought-affected regions. Water is produced and used in large quantities in oil and gas operations. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, an average of 3 barrels of contaminated water is generated for each 1 barrel of oil produced. In the United States, the average is 7 barrels of water. Greentech Media reports that energy companies pay between $3 to $12 to dispose of each barrel of produced water. We believe OriginClear&#8217;s high speed, low energy and primarily chemical-free Electro Water Separation&#8482; technology is ideally suited to help clean up the large quantities of water used in oil and gas operations. A 2009 report on modern shale gas by the Groundwater Protection Council, &#34;Modern Shale Gas Development in the United States: A Primer,&#34; stated that &#8220;the amount of water needed to drill and fracture a horizontal shale gas well generally ranges from about 2 million to 4 million gallons, depending on the basin and formation characteristics.&#8221; While fracking technology promises to unleash an abundant supply of inexpensive natural gas to power the modern world, water is quickly becoming a serious limiting factor. Additionally, the water returns as &#8220;frack flowback&#8221; laced with petroleum and contaminants that require rapid and efficient removal for disposal and recycling. 

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Oil and Gas Water Cleanup Solutions 

&#160; 

The Company has completed successful trials in the Niobrara gas fields of Colorado, the Permian light crude oil fields of West Texas and the Monterey heavy crude oil fields in California. The Bakersfield testing was particularly interesting because it demonstrated that produced water from heavy oil in California&#8217;s Monterey Shale Formation could technically and economically be reprocessed for Cyclic Steam Stimulation in oil wells and agricultural irrigation water. EWS removes up to 99.9% of all free and emulsified oil, and 99.5% of suspended solids from oil &#38; gas wastewater, while also removing certain dissolved contaminants that will co-precipitate, and continuously disinfecting bacteria. In the oil and gas application, OriginClear&#8217;s core EWS technology is supplemented with &#8216;heavies&#8217; removal on the front end, intelligent controls, and a final polishing system, for a complete solution. 

&#160; 

&#160;

All systems can include a common SCADA control system with touch screen which will allow automatic control of the process as well as remote monitoring and alarms. Through its licensees and joint venture partners, OriginClear is making EWS available to customers such as: E&#38;P operators, service companies, disposal well operators and water treatment companies. 

&#160; 

Downstream Integration 

&#160; 

While OriginClear&#8217;s EWS is designed to deliver essentially &#8220;clear&#8221; water, additional processing is often needed to meet the requirements of specific applications. In such cases, OriginClear works with the manufacturers of downstream solutions, such as TriSep, Dow Chemical or their OEMs, and other manufacturers, to integrate processes such as Ultra- or Nano-Membrane Filtration, to achieve, for example, flowback water treatment to a standard acceptable for &#8220;new&#8221; frack water. This complete water treatment solution is available through OriginClear&#8217;s licensees and joint venture partners. 

&#160; 

Industrial and agricultural Waste Water 

&#160; 

Perhaps the largest of all opportunities for EWS is in cleaning up industrial, agricultural and urban effluents. Our breakthrough EWS technology is an efficient combination of flotation and advanced oxidation processes that can efficiently remove a wide range of contaminants and pathogens from incoming or outgoing water supplies. A prototype EWS unit has been demonstrated, processing liquid human waste at the Ennesys urban algae demonstration site near Paris, generating clean, nitrate-rich water to feed algae. The algae can then be converted onsite into energy for the building&#8217;s use. In this instance, EWS is turning liquid sewage into nutrition for algae that, in turn, can help make commercial buildings self-sufficient for energy. However, algae typically is not part of the process. EWS is an electrically-based technology that can target any application in waste water treatment, with a focus on the &#8220;clarity&#8221; stage of removing oils, suspended solids and bacteria. EWS technology has been shown to effectively clean organics such as petroleum, achieving up to 99.9% reduction in free oil and a 99.5% reduction in suspended solids, and reduction of up to 99% of bacteria and other invaders, for clean and sanitized effluents. Another EWS prototype has been demonstrated in China for landfill leachate treatment. EWS alone achieved a 75% reduction in leachate&#8217;s Chemical Oxygen Demand, a marker of contamination level that includes suspended solids and dissolved contamination as well, and 70% reduction in Ammonia. 

&#160; 

Competitors &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; The Algae Industry 

&#160; 

Companies in the new algae fuels industry tend to organize themselves as integrated producers and to keep their intellectual property to themselves. Our strategy, on the other hand, is to share our technology widely through licensing and private labeling. With respect to our algae harvesting and sanitizing applications, we are aware that Alfa Laval, Algix, Aurora Algae, Cavitation Technologies, Evodos, New Oil Resources, Open Algae LLC, Perlemax, Valicor, Smartflow Technologies, Westfalia and World Water Works, among others, offer competing technologies. OriginClear believes there is synergy between its process and many of these competing technologies, where EWS Algae can do the &#8220;heavy lifting&#8221; as the first, high-speed concentration stage, with other processes offering further concentration.

The Oil and Gas Industry 

&#160; 

Market and Trends 

&#160;

The oil and gas industry is a major source of waste water. In the US, it generates about seven barrels of produced water for each barrel of oil. More recently the flowback water from fracking operations is a short term, but intensive, source of waste water as well. Historically the solution to the treatment of produced and frack flowback water has primarily been to dispose it in permitted injection wells. Many technologies have existed for the &#8220;filtering&#8221; of these waters prior to injection, but with limited ability to remove contaminants. More recently, because of the cost of water management, environmental concerns and regulatory requirements, these &#8220;filtering&#8221; technologies are being reviewed and new technologies are being developed; the goal being to reduce water management costs and to dramatically reduce the volume of disposal. Not only can the oil and gas industry look forward to reduced water management costs, but environmental impacts will have been reduced; a win-win for all concerned. Accordingly, the industry is increasingly recycling its produced and frack flowback waters for use in water flooding, cyclic steam stimulation, enhanced oil recovery, new hydraulic fracturing operations, irrigation and even drinking water. Recycling is becoming the economic choice as technologies have advanced and the cost of water treatment has decreased; while at the same time, the cost of disposal has risen (according to Shale Play Water Management magazine, costing between $1.75 and $26.75 per barrel of water). In addition, intense lobbying by environmental groups in front-line regions like California and New York is driving treatment and reuse as a way to make fracking and drilling in general more acceptable, especially in the midst of California&#8217;s historic drought. Markets-and-markets reports that the global produced water treatment market size is estimated to exceed $8 billion by 2019. The major factors responsible driving the growth of this market include the energy sector growth in Africa and the Middle East, along with increasing strictness of environmental policies. According to Bluefield Research, wastewater treatment spending for hydraulic fracturing is expected to grow almost three-fold, from $138 million in 2014 to $357 million in 2020 in the U.S. Bluefield cites water supplies increasingly at risk, tighter regulations emerging in key states, and costs of disposal on the rise as factors contributing to the substantial rise in water treatment and reuse, which is expected to account for 27 percent of total produced and flowback water by 2020, about double current levels. 

&#160; 

Competing Technologies 

&#160; 

These &#8220;filtering&#8221; technologies range from simple decanting to distillation. They are typically implemented as a multi-stage process to attain water quality standards for the planned reuse. EWS can act as a pre-treatment stage for any of these multi-stage processes. While EWS can remove the emulsified and free oil, suspended solids and bacteria from the water stream, these subsequent stages can remove the heavy metals, scaling chemicals, salts and other natural and introduced chemicals. EWS can reduce fouling of these filters and membranes, making subsequent or downstream processes complementary to EWS and creating a strategic opportunity to collaborate. Direct competitors using some form of electro-coagulation technologies include: Halliburton, Watertectonics, Bosque, Ecolotron, Quantum-ionics, Kaselco, Baker Hughes, RecylClean and Ecosphere. Other companies also compete with EWS, but use other technologies that can involve chemical coagulants, batch operation or a high level of consumables. These include: Aqua-Tech, Aqua-Pure, CTI, Purifics, HydroZonics, Myclex, Osmonics, Filterboxx, MECO, Layne, 212 Resources, Veolia, Fountain Quail, Pall and Altela. 

&#160; 

The Waste Industry 

&#160; 

Waste water is a growing problem as industry, agriculture and communities expand, droughts force the need for reclamation, and aquifers and reservoirs become polluted. Meanwhile, previously lightly-regulated regions of the world are enforcing much stricter environmental regulations. Overall, water security is one of the greatest challenges of our time. According to analysts at McKinsey &#38; Company (Charting our Water Future, November 2009 report), the world will see a 40 percent gap between water supply and demand by 2030. Industrial uses account for a startling amount of water consumed around the world. According to the United Nations (The World Business Council for Sustainable Development, March 2006 report) industry consumes nearly 60 percent of available water in high-income countries. Curbing fresh water consumption at the industrial level has the potential to significantly improve water security worldwide. In general, we believe that OriginClear has one or more advantages over some of the potential competitors, in that our process does not primarily use chemicals, is highly scalable on a continuous flow process, and may be significantly lower in energy consumption. We believe our technology may, in some cases, complement these companies&#8217; offerings, however there is no guarantee that our technology will produce more efficiently or cost-effectively than these other technologies. To our knowledge, there is no company or technology available on the market providing a similar level of synergistic integration of the three processes that we implement under a single configuration: Electro Coagulation, Electro Flotation and Advanced Oxidation. 

&#160; 

Taken separately, these processes are marketed as follows: 

&#160; 

Electro Coagulation, though being a relatively new technology, has been known and available in the market for approximately 30 years. Companies like Watertectonics, Kaselco, Powel Water or H2O Technologies offer engineered electrocoagulation systems to the market. There are also a number of one-off electrocoagulation systems in operation worldwide. Electro Flotation is an emerging technology that is mostly seen in scientific publications, as an alternative to more conventional Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF) systems. DAF systems are available worldwide from numerous suppliers including but not limited to, Veolia Water, Ecologix, RWL Water, SAWater, WPL International, World Water Works, etc. Advanced Oxidation systems rely mostly on catalyst injection for their process and therefore are not as streamlined as EWS:AOx. MIOX, Blue Earth Labs are marketing similar systems for niche applications, without offering the additional suspended solids removal functions featured by EWS. Other identified competitors are Lenntech, SSWM, Esco International, and Spartan Water Treatment. In summary, while competitors exist for each of the three phases of our technology, we have not detected any that does all three in one synergistic system.

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; Government and Environmental Regulation 

&#160; 

We are not aware of any existing or probable government regulations that would negatively impact on our operations. As a licensor and/or provider of water treatment equipment, we are not subject to government regulations for the removal of oils, solids and pathogens from water, other than normal safety standards and certifications (such as UL or CE) for goods that we manufacture for demonstrations and joint ventures, and our product lines. &#160; However, our prospective customers are subject to local, state and federal laws and regulations governing environmental quality and pollution control. To date, our compliance with government regulations has had no material effect on our operations, capital, earnings, or competitive position, and the cost of such compliance has not been material. We are unable to assess or predict at this time what effect additional regulations or legislation could have on our activities. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property &#160; 

Our business is also based on developing a strong intellectual property portfolio and establishing a network of OEM distributors and core technology licensees. We have filed the following patent and trademark applications:
