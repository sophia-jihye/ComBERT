 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Cesca Therapeutics Inc. (&#8220;Cesca Therapeutics&#8221;, &#8220;Cesca&#8221;, the &#8220;Company&#8221;, &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;our&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221;), is a clinical stage biotechnology company which develops and markets integrated cellular therapies and delivery systems that advance the safe and effective practice of regenerative medicine. We are a leader in the development and manufacture of automated blood and bone marrow processing systems that enable the separation, processing and preservation of cell and tissue therapy products. Our two subsidiaries based in India, TotipotentRX and TotipotentSC, have a pipeline of human point of care experimental therapies in early stage clinical studies using bone marrow and blood derived cells and growth factors. We were founded in 1986 and are headquartered in Rancho Cordova, California. Our strategy is to continue to enhance the performance and competitiveness of our flagship product lines in the cord blood banking arena while expanding into significant new growth opportunity areas in point of care therapeutics. We are developing a number of offerings for the delivery of autologous cell therapies that address significant unmet medical needs and expect to partner with other pioneers in the stem cell arena to accelerate clinical evaluations, expedite regulatory approvals and penetrate the market. 

&#160; 

Our Strategy 

&#160; 

Our business strategy involves: 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Sustaining our leadership position in automated devices for the separation and concentration of stem cell preparation from cord blood and bone marrow.

&#160;

&#160; &#9679; 

Expansion into development of cell therapies targeting insufficiently met medical needs: our initial focus is on ischemic cardiovascular indications (critical limb ischemia (&#8220;CLI&#8221;) and acute myocardial infarction (&#8220;AMI&#8221;)) with oncology and orthopedic protocols to follow. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

A unique point of care approach; our CLI and AMI cell therapies require a single visit to the operating room for a treatment lasting only 90-120 minutes. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Delivery of a fully integrated offering: We deliver all the hardware, software and disposable components necessary for the aspiration and processing of autologous bone marrow to prepare a therapeutic dose of stem cells for re-injection into the patient at the point of care. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

The use of autologous, bone marrow derived stem cells: Our protocols are potentially safer than alternative allogeneic approaches because, in our case, the donor and the recipient of the stem cell preparation is the same individual. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

A simpler regulatory path: Cesca&#8217;s protocols are autologous and the stem cell preparations are minimally manipulated, allowing an investigational device exemption pre-market approval approach. This reduces costs and time to market when compared to investigational new drug or new drug application approaches. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

A highly resource efficient operating model: We leverage our India based clinical research organization embedded within the Fortis Healthcare network of hospitals in Asia, as a highly cost-effective approach to conducting feasibility studies and early stage clinical trials. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Multiple shots on goal: We currently have 9 protocols at various stages of clinical development. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Patent protection: We have over 25 issued patents globally with several more applications in the pipeline. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Recent Key Events and Accomplishments 

Cesca&#8217;s 2016 financial year ran from July 1, 2015 to June 30, 2016. The following are key events and accomplishments that occurred in fiscal 2016: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Submitted Investigational Device Exemption (&#8220;IDE&#8221;) Supplement for the Surgwerks TM CLI Pivotal Trial In May 2016 we submitted an IDE Supplement to the U.S. FDA for our previously approved pivotal trial for the treatment of patients with CLI using our SurgWerks TM system. In the supplement, we proposed Transcutaneous Oxygen Pressure (TcPO2) as a surrogate endpoint for limb salvage as an alternative to Amputation-Free Survival. Subsequently, the FDA approved commencement of the Phase III pivotal trial as amended, but indicated that it would require additional validation of TcPO2 as a surrogate to support future PMA approval.

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Regained Compliance with Nasdaq Minimum Bid Price Requirement 

On March 21, 2016, we received notification from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Staff indicating that we had regained compliance with the $1.00 minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. In order to regain compliance, we effected a one-for-twenty reverse stock split effective as of the close of business on March 4, 2016.

&#160;

&#160; &#9679; 

Closed a $15 Million Strategic Investment from Boyalife Group 

In February 2016 , in exchange for aggregate proceeds of $15 million, we sold and issued to Boyalife Investment Inc. and Boyalife (Hong Kong) Limited (i) 735,294 shares of common stock at a per share purchase price of $3.4 0 and (ii) senior secured convertible debentures for $12.5 million. From the proceeds, we repaid existing senior secured convertible debentures (see below) and the remaining proceeds are providing additional working capital to fund ongoing operations and strategic initiatives. In August 2016, we subsequently converted all of the principal and interest under the convertible debentures into 6,102,941 shares of our common stock, thereby cancelling all of our indebtedness to Boyalife Investment, Inc. 

&#160;

&#160; &#9679; 

Restructured Existing Senior Secured Convertible Debentures and Retired Series B Warrants 

In connection with the Boyalife financing transaction, we repaid existing thirty-year debentures and all related interest and liquidated damages. In addition, we terminated the related registration rights agreement, the exercise price of the associated Series A warrants was changed from $13.60 to $8.00 and all remaining Series B warrants which contained a cashless exercise feature were retired. 

&#160;

&#160; &#9679; 

Implemented a Restructuring Initiative to Realign Resources Behind High Impact Clinical Programs. &#160; In September 2015, we implemented a restructuring initiative to reduce costs and better align our workforce with the evolving needs of our business. We reduced approximately 15 positions, which, combined with the elimination of a number of open positions that were not back-filled, reduced annual operating costs primarily related to our cord blood banking products by approximately $3.3 million. 

&#160;

&#160; &#9679; 

Facilitated Ground-Breaking Haploidenti cal Bone Marrow T ransplantations (BMT) 

Our clinical cell therapy laboratory at the Fortis Memorial Research Institute (FMRI) in India performed three ex-vivo Haploidentical BMT cell therapy services for the treatment of thalassemia, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic myeloid leukemia and four ex-vivo cell enrichment cell therapy processing services for relapse AML.

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Secured Additional Sites for Cesca&#8217;s Flagship AXP Technology or Cord Blood Processing Services. &#160; Among others, Houston based Texas Stem Cell, the first hybrid cord blood and tissue bank in Texas, adopted the AutoXpress (&#8220;AXP&#8221;) technology for cord blood processing. Additionally, TotipotentRX expanded its private cord blood banking services to several additional hospitals in the Fortis Healthcare network throughout India.

&#160; 

The Markets We Serve 

&#160; 

Regenerative Medicine 

&#160; 

Regenerative cell therapy relies on the delivery of specific types of stem cells that have been shown to enable the repair, restoration or regeneration of diseased or damaged tissue. A broad range of cell types has been investigated, including cells found in peripheral blood, umbilical cord blood and bone marrow. 

&#160; 

The field continues to contribute to meaningful advances in the practice of medicine, as evidenced by numerous FDA and European Union (&#8220;EU&#8221;) therapeutic product approvals and the commercialization of a growing number of cell-based therapies. Most of the progress has been achieved through the broader application of adult stem cells, reflecting a greater awareness and appreciation of their therapeutic potential. 

&#160; 

The market for regenerative medicine is supported by companies that develop devices or methods for harvesting, processing, purifying, expanding, modifying, cryopreserving, storing or administering cells, or by companies that develop and commercialize the therapeutic agents themselves. Key success factors for such companies include: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

The ability to achieve high recovery and concentration of target cell types 

&#160; &#9679; 

Device ease-of use, efficiency and speed 

&#160; &#9679; 

Cell product purity, viability and potency 

&#160; &#9679; 

Cost effectiveness 

&#160; &#9679; 

Regulatory approval / FDA clearance 

&#160; 

The delivery of a cell therapy typically involves a process whereby target cells are harvested from a donor or patient, processed or expanded (grown) either within a hospital laboratory or by an FDA regulated, therapeutic manufacturer, formulated into an effective, safe dose, and delivered to a patient through a specific delivery device. Cell preparations may also be formulated in a point of care setting such as an operating room. Requirements for the preparation and use of cell therapies at the point of care include system portability, sterile field packaging, minimal manipulation, swift cell processing and predictable target cell recovery rates. 

&#160; 

Our growth strategy is focused on the development of autologous cell therapies for treatments intended to be carried out at the point of care. 

&#160; 

We believe that commercial opportunities for such therapies will develop first in cardiology, orthopedics, dermatology/wound healing and selective areas of oncology, followed by more complex pathologies such as those found in diabetes and central nervous system disorders. 

&#160; 

We also believe that developments in the field of regenerative medicine will be critical in helping to address the global increase in health care costs. As emerging cell therapies are proven to be safe, effective, and a cost-effective alternative to current standards of care, adoption will accelerate. A fundamental requirement, however, will be the continued development of baseline clinical and cost-effectiveness data through comprehensive clinical studies. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Cord Blood Banking 

Cord blood, the blood that remains in the umbilical cord after a baby is born, is rich in stem cells. Since the first cord blood transplant was carried out in 1988, stem cells derived from umbilical cord blood have become widely accepted for medical use and have been used regularly in medical procedures worldwide for the treatment of a wide range of blood diseases, genetic and metabolic disorders, immune-deficiencies and cancers. Cord blood use in clinical applications is now widely accepted and cord blood banks exist in nearly every developed country as well as a growing number of developing nations. 

&#160; 

Cesca Therapeutics (formerly ThermoGenesis) is an established leader in the development and manufacture of automated systems that enable the separation, processing and cryopreservation of stem cell preparations from cord blood. In recent years, however, the overall number of cord blood samples being collected has decreased; Bioinformant reported in their 2015 Global Strategic Report on the U.S. Cord Blood Market that the number of cord blood transplants had declined year-over-year in spite of the fact that the number of scientific publications on cord blood stem cells had grown by 7.8%. 

&#160; 

Nevertheless, there have been several recent examples of significant pharma companies entering the space. In August 2014, Novartis committed up to $435 million to Gamida Cell for development of an expanded cord blood stem cell product as a treatment for hematological malignancies such as leukemia and lymphoma, and in June 2015, AMAG Pharmaceuticals (&#8220;Nasdaq: AMAG&#8221;) announced a definitive agreement to acquire Cord Blood Registry (an existing Cesca Therapeutics customer), from GTCR, a private equity firm, for $700 million. 

&#160; 

Our Clinical Programs 

&#160; 

Our therapeutic development initiatives, focused in the fields of cardiovascular medicine and orthopedic regeneration, are based on a flexible platform of equipment and optimized disposable components for the harvesting, processing, testing and delivery of cells and growth factors from either blood or bone marrow. 

&#160; 

Our proprietary SurgWerks &#8482; System (in development) includes a broadly-capable processing platform of devices and analytics designed for use at the point of care, coupled with indication-specific, single use, disposable procedure kits for a variety of vascular and orthopedic conditions. The performance of SurgWerks &#8482; is enabled by the availability of a next generation cell processing device (referred to as the VXP System), derived from our existing and well established AutoXpress (AXP) and MarrowXpress (MXP) platforms. A key advantage of an optimized and integrated system such as SurgWerks is that it is intended to maintain high cell viability and potency through each and every step of the 90-120 minute intra-operative procedure, including bone marrow collection, target cell selection, characterization of the final cell concentrate, and re-injection into the patient. 

&#160; 

We made the following advancements in the SurgWerks System&#8217;s clinical development in fiscal 2016: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

An IDE Supplement was submitted to the FDA proposing a change in primary endpoint to a surrogate endpoint of TcPO2, with associated changes in the statistical plan. 

&#160; &#9679; 

Significant progress was made in assessment and engagement of clinical trial sites for our phase III pivotal clinical trial (CLIRST III). Over 30 sites are currently involved in various stages of engagement and Institutional Review Board (&#8220;IRB&#8221;) approvals and trial agreements have already been finalized for a subset of these 30 sites. 

&#160; &#9679; 

Training programs to support the study were defined for our clinical team and the site staff involved in the study. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

We intend to initiate the following SurgWerks System&#8217;s clinical trials in fiscal 2017: 

&#160; &#9679; 

U.S.: SurgWerks-CLI and VXP System pivotal IDE trial for patients with critical limb ischemia (CLIRST III). 

&#160; &#9679; 

India: SurgWerks-AMI feasibility (Phase II) trial on AMI patients having low ejection fractions three to ten days after the heart attack and having successful reperfusion of the affected heart artery (AMIRST II) 

&#160; 

Also in development is our CellWerks&#8482; offering, an integrated collection of devices and disposables that we believe represents a significant advance in enabling routine bone marrow transplantation procedures. The CellWerks&#8482; System is being developed to enable the processing of a stem cell aspirate or mobilized blood harvest unit while allowing the clinical laboratory to &#8220;dial in&#8221; the transplant physician&#8217;s cellular prescription, thereby achieving an optimized granulocyte, monocyte and red blood cell (RBC) cocktail composition. The CellWerks&#8482; platform and software package is being evaluated for use on minimally manipulated as well as targeted, specific cell depleted units of mobilized peripheral stem cells and bone marrow aspirate. 

&#160; 

To advance the approval of both SurgWerks &#8482; and CellWerks&#8482;, we are pursuing a rigorous, science-based clinical development program, designed around two models of clinical delivery: 

&#160; &#9679; 

SurgWerks&#8482; &#8211; intended for rapid intra-operative use 

&#160; &#9679; 

CellWerks&#8482;&#8211; intended for rapid laboratory use for specialized stem cell preparation under the direction of a GMP cellular laboratory protocol or a licensed physician. 

&#160; 

Our intention is to provide fully optimized therapeutic &#8220;kits&#8221; and highly specialized equipment for each clinical indication (in the case of SurgWerks) and flexible cell preparation devices for clinical laboratory use (in the case of CellWerks), ultimately seeking marketing approval from the FDA and/or the equivalent regulatory authorities in markets outside the U.S.

Through this advanced clinical infrastructure we also operate commercial service programs supporting bone marrow transplantation (hematopoietic stem cell transplantation) for hematological and oncological disorders as well as a licensed umbilical cord blood and tissue bank (&#8220;NovaCord&#8221;). 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Sales and Distribution Channels &#160; 

&#160; 

We market and sell our products through independent distributors, except in North America and India, where we sell direct to end-user customers. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The regenerative medicine market is characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition from medical device companies, pharmaceutical companies and stem cell companies operating in the fields of cardiac, vascular, orthopedic and neural medicine. The primary competitors for our current device offerings include BioSafe, SynGen and MacoPharma (for automated cell processing systems), and BioE, Terumo Harvest, Zimmer Biomet and Pall Corporation (for manual cell processing systems). Our competitors in the field of cell therapeutics development include MesoBlast, Osiris Therapeutics, Baxter International, Athersys, Caladrius, Capricor, Celyad, Juventas Therapeutics, Vericel, Cytori Therapeutics, Pluristem Therapeutics, Zimmer BioMet, and Bioheart. 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

Our research and development activities in fiscal 2016 were geared towards achieving key development milestones for our SurgWerks-CLI and SurgWerks-AMI clinical trial programs and the CellWerks laboratory device program. Each of these development initiatives leveraged our existing AXP and MXP platforms, with a focus on both performance improvements and ease of use in intraoperative applications. Emphasis was also placed on enhancing the capabilities of our contract manufacturing partners and building on our product quality leadership position. CLI efforts focused on development of an IDE supplement aimed at streamlining and simplifying our already approved Phase 3 (&#8220;Pivotal&#8221;) clinical trial (CLIRSTIII) and AMI activities focused on protocol design and optimization. We also invested effort in optimizing cell processing and delivery methods as well as advancing methods pertaining to our cell quality (cell analysis) technology. 

&#160; 

Collectively, research and development expenses were $3,230 and $5,939 for the years ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, respectively. Research and development activities include expenses associated with the engineering, regulatory, scientific and clinical affairs functions. 

&#160; 

Manufacturing 

&#160; 

We expect to continue to use contract manufacturers for high volume, disposable products and in-house manufacturing for low volume, high complexity devices. In addition, we are exploring the potential for the development of in-house capabilities relating specifically to pilot scale disposable manufacturing in support of our clinical programs. 

&#160; 

Quality System 

&#160; 

Our quality system is compliant with domestic and international standards and is appropriate for the specific devices we manufacture. Our corporate quality policies govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation, and servicing of all finished devices intended for human use. Such policies are intended to ensure that the products we market are safe, effective, and otherwise in compliance with the FDA Quality System Regulation (&#8220;QSR&#8221;) (21 C.F.R. Part 820) and the applicable rules of other governmental agencies. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

We and our contract manufacturers are subject to inspections by the FDA and other regulatory agencies to ensure compliance with applicable regulations, codified in the FDA&#8217;s Quality System Regulations (&#8220;QSRs&#8221;). Compliance requirements relate to manufacturing processes, product testing, documentation control and other quality assurance procedures. Our facilities have undergone International Organization of Standards (&#8220;ISO&#8221;) 13485:2012 and EU Medical Device Directive (&#8220;MDD&#8221;) (93/42/EEC) inspections and we have obtained approval to CE-Mark our products. 

&#160; 

Regulatory Scheme and Strategy 

&#160; 

The development, manufacture and marketing of our cell therapy products, as well as the design and implementation of our clinical trials, are subject to regulation by the FDA as well as the equivalent agencies of other countries including the countries of the European Union and India. 

&#160; 

The trials we conduct in India are compliant with the applicable rules of the Indian Council for Medical Research, Ministry of Health Order No. V.25011/375/2010-HR and requisite institutional ethics committee (IEC) and institutional committee for stem cell research and therapy (IC-SCRT) approvals. Both the U.S. and E.U. regulatory agencies are experienced in dealing with and accepting Indian clinical trial data. GCP necessitates review and approval by an IRB before initiation of a study, continuing review of an ongoing study by an IRB, and the documented receipt of a freely given informed consent prior to participation in the study from each subject participant. 

&#160; 

We have a quality and regulatory compliance management system that meets the requirements of the ISO 13485: 2003 standard, the FDA&#8217;s QSRs, the EU MDD, Canadian Medical Device Regulations (&#8220;SOR 98-282&#8221;), and all other applicable local, state, national and international regulations. 

&#160;

&#9679; Medical Devices. The FDA regulates medical devices to ensure their safety and efficacy under the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic (&#8220;FD&#38;C&#8221;) Act. Medical devices are defined by language within the FD&#38;C Act which essentially states that a product is considered a medical device if it is intended to provide a diagnosis or basis for treatment. Once a company determines that its product is a medical device, it is required to comply with a number of federal regulations. These include the following: 

&#160;

&#160; &#9679; 

510(k) clearance or PMA approval from the FDA, prior to commercialization (unless the device is classified as &#8220;exempt&#8221;) 

&#160; &#9679; 

Registration of the company and listing of the medical device with the FDA (within 30 days prior to commercialization) 

&#160; &#9679; 

Establishment and adherence to the FDA&#8217;s labeling requirements, and 

&#160; &#9679; 

Establishment and adherence to the FDA&#8217;s Quality Systems and Medical Device Reporting regulations. 

&#160; 

The FDA classifies medical devices into three groups: Class I, II or III. These are stratified from lowest to highest safety risk, and regulatory controls increase based on Class. 

&#160; 

Class I Devices 

Some of our products are considered to pose little or no risk when used as directed and have been deemed by the FDA to be &#8220;exempt&#8221; from FDA approval or clearance processes prior to commercialization. While pre-marketing FDA review is not mandatory for Exempt Class I medical devices, the manufacturer&#8217;s compliance with QSR is nevertheless a requirement. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Class II Devices 

Several of our products, including the BioArchive and the AXP are categorized as US Class II medical devices and require premarket notification, also known as a section 510(k) clearance, prior to commercialization. Data submitted as part of a 510(k) process must demonstrate a device is &#8220;substantially equivalent&#8221; with a predicate device that is already on the market. Once 510(k) clearance has been secured, the new medical device may be marketed for its intended use and distributed in the U.S. 

&#160; 

Class III Devices 

If a product is considered a Class III device, as is the case with the CLI SurgWerks TM - System, the FDA approval process is more stringent and time-consuming, and includes the following: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Extensive pre-clinical laboratory and animal testing 

&#160; &#9679; 

Submission and approval of an IDE application prior to the conduct of a clinical study 

&#160; &#9679; 

Human clinical studies (or trials) to establish the safety and efficacy of the medical device for the intended use, and 

&#160; &#9679; 

Submission and approval of a PMA application to the FDA. 

&#160; 

Pre-clinical testing typically involves in vitro laboratory analysis and in vivo animal studies to obtain information related to such things as product safety, feasibility, biological activity and reproducibility. The results of pre-clinical studies are submitted to the FDA as part of an IDE application and are reviewed by the Agency before human clinical trials can begin. We use external third parties, as well as our own facility in Gurgaon, India (GLP Compliant) to conduct pre-clinical studies. 

&#160; 

The CLIRST III trials will involve treatment of patients with bone marrow harvested and processed by company medical devices, employing critical quality control steps. The study will commence only after approval of an IRB. Higher risk clinical trials conducted inside the U.S. are subject to FDA IDE regulation (21 C.F.R. Part 812), or an IND application (21 C.F.R. Part 312). Clinical trials conducted outside the U.S., and the data collected therefrom are allowed in accordance with applicable FDA requirements. The FDA or the Sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time if either believes that study participants may be exposed to an unacceptable health risk. 

&#160; 

For certain Class III devices, data generated during product development, pre-clinical studies, and human clinical studies must be submitted to the FDA as a PMA application in order to secure approval for commercialization in the U.S. The FDA may deny the approval of a PMA application if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied and in some cases may mandate additional clinical testing. Product approvals, once obtained, can be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if safety concerns arise after the product reaches the market. The FDA might also require post-marketing testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety and efficacy of a medical device and has the power to forbid or limit future marketing of the product based on the results of such programs. 

&#160; 

Other U.S. Regulatory Information 

Medical device manufacturers must register with the FDA and submit their manufacturing facilities to biennial inspections to ensure compliance with applicable regulations. Failure to comply with FDA requirements can result in withdrawal of marketing clearances, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production or loss of distribution rights. In addition, device manufacturing facilities in the state of California must be registered with the California State Food and Drug Branch of the California Department of Public Health and submit to an annual inspection by the State of California to ensure compliance with applicable state regulations. We are also subject to a variety of environmental laws as well as workplace safety, hazardous material, and controlled substances regulations. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

The California State Food and Drug Branch of the California Department of Public Health completed a quality system compliance inspection at our Rancho Cordova facility in 2011 resulting in two minor observations which have since been corrected. The FDA inspected us in 2015 resulting in zero non-conformances. 

&#160; 

If we are successful in securing Medicare reimbursement, we will be subject to federal and state laws, such as the Federal False Claims Act, state false claims acts, the illegal remuneration provisions of the Social Security Act, the federal anti-kickback laws, state anti-kickback laws, and the federal &#8220;Stark&#8221; laws, that govern financial and other arrangements among healthcare providers, their owners, vendors and referral sources, and that are intended to prevent healthcare fraud and abuse. Among other things, these laws prohibit kickbacks, bribes and rebates, as well as other direct and indirect payments or fee splitting arrangements that are designed to induce the referral of patients to a particular provider for medical products or services payable by any federal healthcare program, and prohibit presenting a false or misleading claim for payment under a federal or state program. They also prohibit some physician self-referrals. These laws are liberally interpreted and aggressively enforced by multiple state and federal agencies and law enforcement (including individual &#8220;qui tam&#8221; plaintiffs) and such enforcement is increasing. For example, the Affordable Care Act increased funding for federal enforcement actions and many states have established their own Medicare/Medicaid Fraud Units and require providers to conspicuously post the applicable Unit&#8217;s hotline number. Possible sanctions for violation of any of these restrictions or prohibitions include loss of eligibility to participate in federal and state reimbursement programs and civil and criminal penalties. 

&#160; 

Also, federal transparency requirements, sometimes referred to as the &#8220;Sunshine Act&#8221; under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, require manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies that are reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children&#8217;s Health Insurance Program to report to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to physician payments and other transfers of value and physician ownership and investment interests. 

&#160; 

Changes in these laws at all levels of government are frequent and could increase our cost of doing business. If we fail to comply, even inadvertently, with any of these requirements, we could be required to alter our operations, refund payments to the government, lose our licensure or accreditation, enter into corporate integrity, deferred prosecution or similar agreements with state or federal government agencies, and become subject to significant civil and criminal penalties. 

&#160; 

International Regulatory Requirements 

International regulatory requirements differ somewhat from those of the U.S. In the EU, a single regulatory approval process has been created and approval is represented by CE-Marking. To be able to affix the CE-Mark to our medical devices and distribute them in the EU, we must meet minimum standards for safety and quality (known as the essential requirements) and comply with one or more conformity rules. A notified body assesses our quality management system and compliance with the Medical Device Directive. Marketing authorization can be revoked by the applicable governmental agency or notified body in the event of an unsuccessful quality system annual audit. 

&#160; 

In India, the regulatory body having oversight of medical devices, therapies, and cell banking is the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (&#8220;CDSCO&#8221;), and specifically the Drugs Controller General India office. Our marketing and facilities licenses are subject to revocation by the applicable state Drug Controller in Haryana or DCGI. The Haryana State Drug Controller and the DCGI completed the latest blood banking license inspection of TotipotentRX GMP cord blood banking facility within Fortis Memorial Research Institute on November 11, 2014. No non-conformances were observed.

Patents and Proprietary Rights 

&#160; 

We believe that patent protection is important for our products and current and proposed business. We have over 25 issued patents globally. 

&#160; 

The patent positions of regenerative medicine companies, such as ours, are uncertain because they involve interpretation of complex factual information and an evolving legal environment. The coverage sought in a patent application can be denied or significantly reduced either before or after the patent is issued. There can be no assurance that any of our pending patent applications will actually result in an issued patent. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that any existing or future patent will provide significant protection or commercial advantage, or that any existing or future patent will not be circumvented by a more basic patent. Generally, patent applications can be maintained in secrecy for at least 18 months after their earliest priority date. In addition, publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries. Therefore, we cannot be certain that we were the first to invent or the first to file a patent application for the subject matter covered by each of our pending U.S. and foreign patent applications. 

&#160; 

If a third party files a patent application relating to an invention claimed in our patent application, we may be required to participate in an interference or derivation proceeding conducted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to determine who owns the patent. Such proceeding could involve substantial uncertainties and cost, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. There can be no assurance that our patents, if issued, would be upheld as valid in court. 

&#160; 

Licenses 

&#160; 

The following are certain agreements involving our business. 

&#160; 

Fortis Healthcare Limited (&#8220;Fortis&#8221;) 

On August 1, 2014 we entered into an agreement with Fortis which renews and expands our existing services agreement with them in areas including, but not limited to, cord blood banking, point of care technology sales and support, bone marrow transplant and clinical/patient management. The term of the agreement is for three years. 

&#160; 

Cord Blood Registry Systems, Inc. (&#8220;CBR&#8221;) 

On December 31, 2013, we entered into a Sale and Purchase Agreement with CBR in which we agreed to supply CBR with the AXP cord blood processing system and disposables. The term of the agreement is for 5 years with automatic two-year renewal options unless CBR provides a 6 month notice of non-renewal. On September 30, 2015, we entered into a Fifth Amended and Restated Technology License and Escrow Agreement with CBR which modified the financial covenant that we must meet in order to avoid an event of default. We must maintain a cash balance coupled with short-term investments net of debt or borrowed funds that are payable within one year of not less than two million dollars. We were in compliance with this covenant at June 30, 2016. 

&#160; 

In June 2010, we entered into a License and Escrow Agreement in order to alleviate CBR&#8217;s concerns about potential long term supply risk. We are the sole supplier of critical devices and disposables used in the processing of cord blood samples in CBR&#8217;s operations. Under the License and Escrow Agreement, we granted CBR a perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to certain intellectual property necessary for the manufacture of AXP devices and disposables. The license is for the sole and limited purpose of ensuring continued supply of the AXP and related disposables for use by CBR. The licensed intellectual property is held in escrow and available to CBR only in the event of a default under the agreement. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Golden Meditech 

In August 2012, we entered into a Product Purchase and International Distributor Agreement with Golden Meditech. Under the terms of the agreement, Golden Meditech obtained the exclusive, subject to existing distributors and customers, rights to develop an installed base for our AXP System in specified countries. This includes the right to distribute AXP Disposable Blood Processing Sets and use the AXP System, and other accessories used for the processing of stem cells from cord blood. Golden Meditech has rights in the People&#8217;s Republic of China (excluding Hong Kong and Taiwan), India, Singapore, Indonesia, and the Philippines and may begin selling once relevant approval has been obtained in each respective country. Additionally, Golden Meditech is subject to certain annual minimum purchase commitments. The term of the agreement is for 5 years with one year renewal options by mutual agreement. 

&#160; 

BioParadox LLC (&#8220;BioParadox&#8221;) 

In October 2010, we entered into a License and Distribution Agreement with BioParadox. Under the terms of the agreement BioParadox obtained exclusive world-wide rights for the use, research and commercialization of the Res-Q technology in the production of PRP in the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disease. The term of the agreement was to depend on the satisfaction by BioParadox of certain milestones, or the payment of extension fees. On December 22, 2015, we gave 30 days written notice to BioParadox, terminating the agreement effective January 21, 2016. 

&#160; 

New York Blood Center (&#8220;NYBC&#8221;)/Pall Medical 

In March 1997, we and NYBC, as licensors, entered into a license agreement with Pall Medical, a subsidiary of Pall Corporation, as a licensee through which Pall Medical became the exclusive worldwide manufacturer (excluding Japan) for a system of sterile, disposable bag sets developed by us and NYBC for the processing of hematopoietic stem cells sourced from umbilical cord blood. The system is designed to simplify and streamline the harvesting concentration, cryopreservation (freezing) and transfusion of cells while maintaining the highest stem cell population and viability from each cord blood donation. In May 1999, we and Pall Medical amended the original agreement such that we regained the rights to distribute the bag sets outside North America and Europe under our own name. In fiscal 2012, we signed an agreement with NYBC which provides for the equal sharing of royalties between the two parties through the remaining term of the licenses, or June 2016. Therefore, we will not be receiving royalties on these products after June 2016. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of June 30, 2016, we had 89 employees, 46 of whom were employed in the U.S. and 43 of whom were employed in India. We also utilize temporary employees throughout the year to address business needs and significant fluctuations in orders and product manufacturing. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, nor have we experienced any work stoppage.
