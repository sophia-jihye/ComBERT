 Item 1. Business 

&#160;

Our Company 

&#160;

We manufacture, distribute and sell natural immune support products containing our proprietary yeast beta glucans, a group of beta glucans naturally occurring in the cell walls of yeast that have been shown through testing and analysis to support the immune system. Our products include once a day oral intake tablets and topical creams and gels for skin application. We believe, based on testing and analysis conducted by third parties on our behalf, that the beta glucans derived from yeast we manufacture are superior to any other beta glucans available on the market.

&#160;

Historically, we have sold our proprietary additive, for both oral and topical use, primarily to large dietary supplement and cosmetic companies. During fiscal year 2015 we saw increased interest in our SGM active agent delivery technology, which we believe may have additional beneficial and marketable uses, and on which we are conducting further testing. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2015, we established a partnership with Innate Skincare, LLC (&#8220;Innate Scientific&#8221;) to launch a complete skin care regimen containing our proprietary ingredients. We expect this partnership will be a meaningful contributor to our revenues in the 2016 fiscal year.

&#160;

We were originally incorporated under the laws of British Columbia, Canada, in 1987 under the name Anina Resources, Inc. and subsequently changed our name to Immudyne, Inc. and our jurisdiction to the State of Wyoming by continuance in September 1987. On June 30, 1994, we changed our jurisdiction to Delaware by merger with and into Immudyne, Inc., a Delaware corporation formed on June 21, 1994.

&#160;

None of the testing and analysis or scientific research mentioned in this report has been subject to the oversight of the FDA or any comparable regulatory body, and no regulatory body has attested to the efficacy of beta glucans in supporting the immune system or otherwise treating disease. Further, the marketing of beta glucans is not subject to FDA approval, and we are prohibited by Federal Trade Commission (&#8220;FTC&#8221;) and FDA regulations from suggesting in advertisements and product labels that our products mitigate, treat, cure or prevent a specific disease or class of disease.

&#160;

Our Products 

&#160;

We have a developed proprietary approach to produce beta glucans derived from yeast which we believe are superior to any other beta glucans on the market. Our yeast beta glucans are odorless and tasteless, making them suitable for use in a wide variety of oral and topical applications, including in our nutraceutical and cosmetic product lines. As the U.S. and international markets become more aware of the value of our proprietary products, we believe demand for our beta glucans will increase.

&#160;

Beta Glucans 

&#160;

Beta glucans, or undefined-Glucans, are a natural extract that are considered to be &#8220;biological response modifiers&#8221; that support the immune system. The most common sources of beta glucans are from the cell walls of baker&#8217;s yeast, the cellulose in plants, the bran of cereal grains and certain fungi and bacteria. The differences between beta glucan chemical structures are significant in regards to solubility and overall biological activity. In fact, beta glucans derived from mushrooms and cereals do not appear to have the same effects on human health as beta glucans derived from yeast.

&#160;

We derive our high-grade beta glucan from yeast cell walls using proprietary processes in our manufacturing facility. Our beta glucan is generally free of yeast by-product and endotoxins, and has demonstrated reliability in terms of both stability and biological response. In fact, we commissioned an analytical side-by-side comparison by a laboratory which conducts testing and analysis of nutraceutical compounds, between our beta glucan and each of the beta glucans manufactured by our two main competitors. The results of the analytical comparison demonstrated the superiority of our beta glucan which was far less impure and more uniform in composition than those of our competitors.

&#160;

&#160; 1 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The health benefits of yeast beta glucans have been demonstrated through extensive testing and analysis and scientific research on yeast beta glucans generally, and we are committed to supporting evidence-based studies that demonstrate the health benefits of our products. General scientific research on beta glucan derived from yeast cell walls has been conducted in recent years by renowned medical laboratories, including Baylor College of Medicine, U.S. Armed Forces Radiobiology Institute, Stanford University, Southwest Research Institute, Case Western Reserve University, University of Arkansas, North Carolina State University, University of Bern, Switzerland, and the China Agricultural University, China. As more studies are conducted on beta glucans, we believe the potential benefits to human health will continue to emerge.

&#160;

Healthcare professionals, including licensed physicians, alternative medicine practitioners, scientists and researchers have taken an interest in our immune-support products as a means of offering alternative or complementary approaches for maintaining a healthy and active lifestyle. These expressions of interest have often resulted in proposals for research studies and recommendations of our products. We plan to build upon this interest and hope to grow our contacts with licensed physicians who utilize our product in a clinical setting and with researchers who have the resources to conduct testing and analysis on our products.

&#160;

We also have relationships with medical doctors who in the past have conducted self-funded studies in which we supplied our product free of charge, though we do not have any formal clinical development or research agreements with these institutions and doctors. In addition, Dr. Sven Rohmann, PhD is our Global Chief Medical Officer and a director of the Company. Dr. Rohmann is a worldwide authority on innate immunity and has an extensive medical and business background, including having spent 10 years with Merck Serono, where he served as the Global Head, Strategic Marketing, Oncology. Dr. Joseph DiTrolio of the Roseland, New Jersey Surgery Center and St. George&#8217;s University School of Medicine is also a director of the Company. Dr. Allan Whitberg, previously of Roger Williams Medical Center in Providence, Rhode Island and currently affiliated with Boston University School of Medicine, and Dr. Stephen Petteruti of The Petteruti Center For Life Extension in Warwick, RI, are among the medical doctors with whom we have relationships and who have conducted self-funded studies on our product. We also have established a relationship with National Jewish Health in Denver, Colorado and we are exploring additional opportunities to have further studies conducted at leading institutions. We have also established a partnership with the leading physicians of the Stone Center of New Jersey to educate patients about the benefits of supplementing their chemotherapy and radiation treatments with our yeast-beta glucan products.

&#160;

To be sure, none of the testing and analysis or scientific research mentioned in this annual report has been subject to oversight of the FDA or any comparable regulatory body, and no regulatory body has attested to the efficacy of beta glucans in supporting the immune system or otherwise treating disease. Further, the marketing of beta glucans is not subject to FDA approval, and we are prohibited by FTC and FDA regulations from suggesting in advertisements and product labels that our products mitigate, treat, cure or prevent a specific disease or class of disease.

&#160; 

Yeast Beta Glucan Product Lines 

&#160;

Our nutraceutical and cosmetic product lines consist of our natural, premium yeast beta glucans in oral and topical applications. We offer our yeast beta glucans as natural raw material ingredients in bulk quantities, our &#8220;Nutraceutical and Cosmetic Additives&#8221; segment, and finished, consumer products packaged under our brands as well as private label brands, our &#8220;Finished Nutraceutical and Cosmetic Products&#8221; segment.

&#160;

Our principal, branded nutraceutical and cosmetic products for our yeast beta glucans are oral daily supplements and topical lines of rejuvenating serums and creams. Our oral supplements are dietary supplements containing proprietary combinations of our yeast beta glucan to support immune system function. Our skin care serums and creams consist of our patented yeast-derived beta glucan and other natural ingredients intended to support the skin&#8217;s immune system response and defense, skin renewal and to repair sun and environmental damage.

&#160;

&#160; 

Sales and Marketing 

&#160;

We have performance based contracts with our sales and marketing executives, which allows us to continue to maintain a relatively low overhead. Our priority is to actively pursue opportunities to market our products and increase sales. Our sales and marketing strategy primarily consists of building the brand recognition of our product lines and our proprietary yeast beta glucans. We plan to sell our products primarily on a word-of-mouth basis through distributors and our website as standalone product lines, as well as business-to-business as a cosmetic enhancement or dietary supplement.

&#160;

Our principal products are consumables that can generate a stream of repeat sales with the same end customers over an extended period, providing significant lifetime value for each customer gained. To reach these customers, our marketing strategy includes several online sales promotions. In addition, we intend to build our brand recognition with healthcare professionals through further testing and analysis of our products and educating practitioners and clinics on the benefits of our products.

&#160;

We also market out products direct to consumers through our joint venture with Innate Scientific established in October 2015 and through which we intend to develop, launch and market additional SKU&#8217;s based on our proprietary beta glucans. Innate Scientific benefits from a leadership team that has deep experience in the direct marketing space and a proven track record in creating national brands. We currently own a 33.33% economic interest and a 51% voting interest in Innate Scientific, and are in discussions to increase our economic and voting interest to over 70% in the near term, although no assurances can be made that these discussions will lead to such an increase.

&#160;

Manufacturing and Sourcing 

&#160;

We have focused on the production of immune system support compounds including our beta glucans derived from yeast for over 20 years. Our staff produces consistently high-grade, particulate and reliable beta glucans which are included in our nutraceutical and cosmetic product lines. For certain of our packaged consumer goods, we use third party contractors for encapsulation, bottling and labeling. These contractors are subject to regular government inspections, and to the best of our knowledge, comply with current GMPs and hold the necessary drug manufacturing licenses and processed food registrations required by their respective state regulators. Such packaging services are readily available from multiple sources.

&#160;

The raw materials necessary to manufacture our beta glucans principally consist of baker&#8217;s yeast and are common and readily available. We hold our suppliers to strict quality and delivery specifications as part of our GMP compliance and quality control procedures, including quality assurance of raw materials used in the production of our products.

&#160;

Our beta glucan products and manufacturing processes are protected by registered and pending patents and trade secrets. Our manufacturing facilities and practices are compliant with published current GMPs established by the FDA for dietary supplements. 

&#160;

Customers 

&#160;

We sell our products direct to consumers and to pharmaceutical, nutraceutical and consumer product companies in the U.S. market. We focus on establishing and growing long-term relationships with our customers, and we believe that the majority of our customers and partners view us as a strategic long-term supplier and value the quality of our beta glucan products. Our sales through distributors typically are made pursuant to supplier agreements executed in the ordinary course of business with individual orders made on purchase orders. 

&#160;

As we have sought to expand our sales, we have marketed our nutraceutical and cosmetic product lines through distributors, partnerships, and direct sales to consumers. We do not anticipate a seasonality of sales.

&#160;

Our largest customer, Michel Mercier Products, Inc. (d/b/a M.M.P, Inc.), accounted for 73% of our consolidated sales in 2015 and 79% our consolidated sales in 2014. Our second largest customer accounted for 12% of our consolidated sales in 2015 and 12% our consolidated sales in 2014. The remainder of our consolidated sales in 2015 were attributable to our finished cosmetic products segment and which sales were made through our joint venture with Innate Scientific.

&#160;

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The markets for nutritional supplements and skin care products are highly competitive, consisting of a large number of manufacturers, distributors and retailers, none of which dominates the fragmented and diverse market. We compete for sales direct to consumers, through distributors and business-to-business.

&#160;

Although we believe, based on testing and analysis by third parties on our behalf, that our yeast beta glucan is superior to others available on the market, we compete with other companies manufacturing beta glucans from yeast and other sources as well as companies producing other food ingredients and nutritional supplements for human use. Many end consumers may consider such products to be a replacement for the products we manufacture and distribute. Many of our competitors have greater marketing, research and capital resources than us, and may be able to offer their products at lower costs because of their greater purchasing power or lower cost of raw materials and manufacturing.

&#160;

We anticipate expanding our sales on a meaningful basis as part of our new marketing strategy focusing on our nutraceutical and cosmetic product lines. We anticipate competing in these markets on the basis of quality, our proprietary manufacturing processes, research data and effective marketing campaigns promoting the benefits of our natural immune support products. There are no assurances that our products will be able to compete in these markets, however, or that our marketing strategy will be successful.

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

We rely primarily on proprietary trade secret know how and protect our intellectual property and maintain our competitive position in the marketplace. We have several use, process and provisional patents, and intend to apply for additional patents in 2016 as new products, uses and manufacturing processes are developed. We maintain trademarks registered in the U.S. for our business name and related to our product brands. In addition, we have registered and maintain internet domain names related to our businesses, including &#8220;immudyne.com.&#8221;

&#160;

Research and Development 

&#160;

Our expertise for many years has been in the enhancement of efficient, stable and cost-effective production systems for beta glucan products derived from yeast. In 2015 we incurred research and development expenses of approximately $24,000. We currently are conducting research and development on our topical products through a partnership with BIO-EC (France), as well as a separate ongoing study in the United States on a unique application of our existing products. We plan to disclose the results of these studies during 2016 as the data becomes available.

&#160;

Governmental and Environmental Regulation 

&#160;

Our business and the manufacturing, distribution and sale of our beta glucan products are regulated in the U.S. primarily by the FDA and the FTC.

&#160;

The FDA enforces the FDCA and Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (&#8220;DSHEA&#8221;) as they pertain to foods, food ingredients, cosmetics and dietary supplement production and marketing. Dietary supplements and nutraceuticals are regulated as a category of food, not as drugs. The FDA classifies &#8220;Yeast extract (Bakers)&#8221; as generally recognized as safe (GRAS), which substances by definition are not food additives. Most GRAS substances have no quantitative restrictions as to use, although their use must conform to current GMPs. The FDA promulgates GMP guidelines to ensure that dietary supplements are produced in a quality manner, do not contain contaminants or impurities and are accurately labeled. GMPs include requirements for establishing quality control procedures, designing and constructing manufacturing plants, testing ingredients and finished products and record keeping and handling of consumer product complaints. The FDA has broad authority to enforce the provisions of federal law applicable to dietary supplements and cosmetics, including the power to monitor claims made in product labeling, to seize adulterated or misbranded products or unapproved new drugs, to request product recall, to enjoin further manufacture or sale of a product, to issue warning letters and to institute criminal proceedings.

&#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Advertising and product claims regarding the efficacy of products are also regulated by the FTC. The FTC regulates the advertising of dietary supplements and other health-related products to ensure that any advertising is truthful and not misleading, and that an advertiser maintains adequate substantiation for all product claims. FTC enforcement actions may result in consent decrees, cease and desist orders, judicial injunctions and the payment of fines with respect to advertising claims that are found to be unsubstantiated.

&#160;

Yeast beta glucans are classified as GRAS by the FDA and our oral and topical-use product lines containing our yeast beta glucan are marketed as dietary supplements and cosmetics, respectively. Under current U.S. regulations, our products must comply with certain labeling requirements enforced by the FDA and FTC, but otherwise generally are not required to receive regulatory approval prior to introduction into the U.S. market. We believe we are in compliance with all material government regulations applicable to our products.

&#160;

In the EU markets, the European Food Safety Authority (&#8220;EFSA&#8221;), an advisory panel to the European Commission, performs all scientific assessments of health claims on food and supplement labels. The European Commission will consider the opinions of EFSA in determining whether to include a health claim on a list of permissible claims. Once published, only health claims for ingredients and products included on the list may be used in promotional materials for products marketed and sold in the European Union. The marketability of our products may be limited as we look to expand our sales in the EU if the health claims of our products are not included on the list.

&#160;

In addition to the foregoing, our operations are subject to federal, foreign, state and local government laws and regulations, including those relating to zoning, workplace safety and accommodations for the disabled, and our relationship with our employees is subject to regulations, including minimum wage requirements, anti-discrimination laws, overtime, working conditions and citizenship requirements. We currently do not incur any material costs in connection with our compliance with applicable environmental laws as our manufacturing processes generate minimal discharge. Furthermore, the cost of maintaining compliance with applicable environmental laws has not, and we believe, in the future, will not, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We believe we are in substantial compliance with all material governmental regulations applicable to our operations.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, we had 4 employees, as well as part-time employees and numerous additional consultants worldwide. All employees and our officers and directors are eligible to participate in our group health and dental insurance plans.

&#160;
