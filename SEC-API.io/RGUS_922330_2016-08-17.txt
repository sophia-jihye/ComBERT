 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

We were organized under the laws of the State of Oregon on July 27, 1992 as Sky Technologies, Inc. On August 1, 1994, our name was officially changed by a vote of a majority of our shareholders to REGI U.S., Inc. At April 30, 2016 Rand Energy Group Inc., a privately held British Columbia corporation (&#8220;Rand Energy&#8221;) holds approximately 1.80% of the common shares of REGI. Rand Energy is controlled 51% by Reg Technologies Inc., a publicly held British Columbia corporation (&#8220;Reg Tech&#8221;). Reg Tech holds approximately 8.37% of the common shares of REGI. 

&#160; 

We are a development stage company engaged in the business of developing and building an improved axial vane-type rotary engine known as the RadMax&#8482; rotary technology (the &#8220;Technology&#8221; or the &#8220;RadMax&#8482; Engine&#8221;), used in the design of lightweight and high efficiency engines, compressors and pumps. The Company has a project cost sharing agreement, whereby it will fund 50% of the further development of the RadMax&#8482; Engine and Reg Tech will fund 50%. 

&#160; 

Our principal offices are located at 4810 Pt. Fosdick Dr. NW #100, Gig Harbor, WA, 98335. Our website is www.regtech.com . 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

We will need to raise additional capital in the future beyond any amount currently on hand and which may become available as a result of debt and/or equity financing, including the exercise of warrants and options which are currently outstanding, in order to fully implement our intended plan of operations. 

&#160; 

Business of the Company 

&#160; 

Overview and History 

&#160; 

We are engaged in the business of developing and building an improved axial vane-type rotary engine used in the design of lightweight and high efficiency engines, compressors and pumps. The worldwide intellectual and marketing rights to the RadMax&#8482; Engine, exclusive of the United States, are held by Reg Tech. The Company owns the U.S. marketing and intellectual rights and has a project cost sharing agreement, whereby it funds 50% of the further development of the RadMax&#8482; Engine and Reg Tech funds 50%. 

&#160; 

Based upon testing work performed by independent organizations on prototype models, we believe that the RadMax&#8482; Engine holds significant potential in a number of other applications ranging from small stationary equipment to automobiles and aircraft. In addition to its potential use as an internal combustion engine, the RadMax&#8482; Engine design is being employed in the development of several types of compressors, pumps, expanders and other applications. 

&#160; 

To date, several prototypes of the RadMax&#8482; Engine have been tested and additional development and testing work is continuing. We believe that such development and testing will continue until a commercially feasible design is perfected. There is no assurance at this time, however, that such a commercially feasible design will ever be perfected, or if it is, that it will become profitable. If a commercially feasible design is perfected, we do, however, expect to derive revenues from licensing the Technology relating to the RadMax&#8482; Engine regardless of whether actual commercial production is ever achieved. There is no assurance at this time, however, that revenues will ever be received from licensing the Technology even if it does prove to be commercially feasible. 

&#160; 

We believe that a large market would exist for a practical rotary engine which could be produced at a competitive price and which could provide a good combination of fuel efficiency, power density and exhaust emissions. 

&#160; 

Based on the market potential, we believe the RadMax&#8482; Engine is well suited for application to internal combustion engines, pumps, compressors and expansion engines. The mechanism can be scaled to match virtually any size requirement. This flexibility opens the door to large markets being developed. 

&#160; 

Products and Projects 

&#160; 

RadMax&#8482; Engine 

&#160; 

The Company is working with Reg Technologies Inc. in developing a RadMax&#8482; Diesel Engine application. 

&#160; 

We believe that the RadMax&#8482; Diesel Engine could achieve improved fuel consumption when compared to gasoline and turbine engines. This was based on a review by our previous thermodynamics engineer, Dr. Allen MacKnight, PhD, of published industry literature. Specifically, a given volume of diesel fuel contains approximately 30% more energy that the same volume of gasoline and diesel engines consume approximately 0.4 pounds of fuel for every horsepower hour. As a point of reference, all turbine engines consume approximately 0.8 pounds of fuel for every horsepower hour. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

To bring the RadMax&#8482; Diesel Engine from concept to reality, a number of milestones, or steps, are required for ultimate qualification. These started with concept drawings and presentations, and lead to testing by independent agencies to validate the emissions, horsepower, and other critical metrics. 

&#160; 

RadMax&#8482; Pump 

&#160; 

The Company actively pursued the development of the RadMax&#8482; Pump from early 2007 until March 2008. From September 2007 until March 2008, the Company worked with an industry partner in the water pump industry. The partner evaluated the Pump as a potential new product offering as part of its fire engine chemical dispersant product line. The evaluation and test period ended when the partner had a change in its senior management and their leading advocate left the company. Until there is further interest established in the RadMax&#8482; Pump by an end user, no further work is anticipated. 

&#160; 

The Company then focused all of its technical resources on validating the seals for a compressor application, leading towards the technology incorporation in the RadMax&#8482; engine. 

&#160; 

In February 2009 the pump was set up in the Company&#8217;s Richmond, B.C. laboratory, for demonstration to interested parties. It is a fully functional prototype capable of pumping twice its internal volume every revolution. Future development would take the form of customization based on interest from another industry partner. Commercialization requires tooling to significantly reduce the cost of the pump in a production environment. Until there is further interest established in the RadMax&#8482; Pump by an end user, no further work is anticipated. 

&#160; 

RadMax&#8482; Compressor 

&#160; 

The Company actively pursued the development of high pressure metal seals using the RadMax&#8482; Compressor from July 2007 until September 2007. The technical concept of high pressure metal seals was validated in a prototype compressor test bed that was fabricated from residual hardware. There was no immediate interest by an industry partner to continue a joint development of the RadMax&#8482; Compressor. Until there is further interest established in the RadMax&#8482; Compressor by an end user, no further work will be conducted. 

&#160; 

The compressor is a fully functional prototype design capable of 48 individual compression events every revolution, which represent twice its internal volume. Future development would take the form of customization based on interest from another industry partner. Commercialization requires tooling to significantly reduce the cost of the compressor in a production environment. Until there is further interest established in the RadMax&#8482; Compressor by an end user, no further work will be conducted. 

&#160; 

Recent Development 

&#160; 

On June 1, 2015 we announced that Paul Porter, our chief mechanical engineer, was preparing test facilities for the 375hp diesel engine. He would populate the engine with the new seals and prepare it for full spin testing. This phase of testing should be the final set of tests prior to placing the engine on a dynamometer. The dynamometer testing would allow us to document friction, fuel efficiency, net horsepower and emissions. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

On September 1, 2015 we announced that the prototype was being assembled, and would be spin tested when assembly was complete. After spin testing, the engine would need to be tested on a dynameter in order to begin the fine tuning of the combustion and determine the horsepower produced. 

&#160; 

On October 2, 2015 we announced that several parties had expressed interest in working with REGI to develop prototypes that meet their future needs. Preliminary designs had begun to outline physical requirements for several sizes of prototype engines. The ranges of interest were from 165 horsepower down to 5 horsepower. The end use varied from propulsion for land air and sea to power generation for land air and sea. NDA&#8217;s had been signed to allow REGI to share data with the appropriate parties, so they could begin estimates based on size and weight for their application. REGI had provided cost estimates for preparation and testing of the prototypes. The programs all included accelerated prototype development and production using state-of-the-art methods to minimize time and development costs. The information provided would be used to request budget money in the near future. 

&#160; 

On November 10, 2015 we announced that additional testing on the 375 horsepower diesel engine would be completed in Spokane, Washington. The engine was transported to Spokane Washington and was being prepared for spin testing at various RPMs with full lubrication and cooling in preparation for combustion testing. 

&#160;

Competition and Alternative Technologies 

&#160; 

We currently face and will continue to face competition in the future from established companies engaged in the business of developing, manufacturing and marketing engines and other products. While not a highly competitive business in terms of numbers of competitors, the business of developing engines of a new design and attempting to either license or produce them is nonetheless difficult because most existing engine producers are large, well financed companies which are very concerned about maintaining their market position. Such competitors are already well established in the market and have substantially greater resources than us. Internal combustion engines are produced by automobile manufacturers, marine engine manufacturers, heavy equipment manufacturers and specialty aircraft and industrial engine manufacturers. We expect that our engine would be used mainly in industrial and marine applications. 

&#160; 

Except for the Wankel rotary engine built by Mazda of Japan, no competitor, that we are aware of, presently produces in a commercial quantity any rotary engine similar to the engines we are developing. The Wankel rotary engine is similar only in that it is a rotary engine rather than a reciprocating piston engine. Without substantially greater financial resources than is currently available to us, however, it is very possible that it may not be able to adequately compete in the engine business. One competitor, Rotary Power International, is presently producing the first production SCORE rotary (Wankel type) engines. Our RadMax&#8482; Diesel Engine is more fuel efficient, smaller, quieter, costs less to produce and will have fewer exhaust emissions. 

&#160; 

We believe that if and when our engine is completely developed, in order to be successful in meeting or overcoming competition which currently exists or may develop in the future, our engine will need to offer superior performance and/or cost advantages over existing engines used in various applications. 

&#160; 

We believe strong competition can be expected in the engine market with new patents being taken out on a continuous basis and that we may have a time advantage over some of the competitive products as far as niche markets which we may enter, however there is no way to accurately determine or predict whether this situation is or will continue to be true. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The conventional piston type internal combustion engine is the prime competitor of the RadMax&#8482; Diesel Engine. Due to the substantial infrastructure built up to support the standard combustion engine, substantial barriers to entry exist into this market. 

&#160; 

A number of the new engine designs over the last decade have offered advantages on the thermodynamics front (e.g. more efficient use of energy through better combustion, better heat transfer, etc.). In the case of the RadMax&#8482; Diesel Engine, its strong point it believed to be in its mechanism, not in its thermodynamics. Whether or not the engine&#8217;s mechanism alone will provide the competitive edge necessary to result in a marketable and successful product is unknown at this time. 

&#160; 

Since we do not have management experience in manufacturing engines, we hope to be able to follow the same strategy as that of other companies such as Orbital and Wankel, where it would be licensing its technology and would therefore not be directly engaged in manufacturing. 

&#160; 

An extensive manufacturing study has not been performed to date and it could turn out that the costs to manufacture are prohibitive for one or more reasons. However, the computer modeling done can be utilized to generate manufacturing drawings which could be used to obtain preliminary costing estimates. 

&#160; 

The development of our business and its ability to maintain its competitive and technical position has depended and will depend, in part, upon its ability to attract and retain qualified scientific, engineering, managerial and manufacturing personnel. 

&#160; 

Significant competition exists from engine manufacturers and engineering firms specializing in the development of internal combustion engines technology for the automotive, marine, motorcycle and small engine industry. Such competition also exists in the pump and compressor markets which may utilize the Rand Cam technology in their products. Many of these companies have substantially greater resources for research, development and manufacturing than us. It is possible that our competitors may succeed in developing technologies and products that are more effective or commercially acceptable. We believe, based on its testing of the RadMax&#8482; Diesel Engine that the engine is a superior overall engine package to the reciprocating piston engine. This assessment is made on the basis of the RadMax&#8482; Diesel Engine&#8217;s potential for reduced engine weight and packaging volume, improved performance, and possibly lower manufacturing costs. 

&#160; 

Technology development is taking place on many fronts and competitors may have, unknown to us, a product or products under development which may be technologically superior to ours which may be more acceptable to the market. Competition with engines employing Rand Cam technology may also include other lean burn engines, electric motors, gas turbine engines, solar power and hybrid vehicles, and may include concepts not yet known to us. 

&#160; 

Environmental Matters 

&#160; 

Laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment have not had a material impact on our business. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Availability of Raw Materials 

&#160; 

Since we are not in production and there are no plans at this time for us to enter the actual engine manufacturing business, raw materials are not of present concern. At this time, however, there does not appear to be any foreseeable problem with obtaining any materials or components, which may be required in the manufacture of its potential products. 

&#160;

Marketing Strategy 

&#160; 

We intend to pursue the development of the RadMax&#8482; Diesel Engine by entering into licensing and/or joint venture arrangements with other larger companies, which have the financial resources to maximize the potential of the technology. We have no current plans to become actively involved in either manufacturing or marketing any engine or other product which it may ultimately develop to the point of becoming a commercial product. 

&#160; 

Our current objective is to complete and test the RadMax&#8482; Diesel Engine. Based on the successful testing, the prototypes will be used for presentation purposes to potential license and joint venture partners. 

&#160; 

We expect revenue from license agreements with the potential end users based on the success of the design from the compressor, pump, and diesel engine prototypes. Based on of successful testing of the RadMax&#8482; prototypes, we expect to have joint venture or license agreements finalized, which would result in royalties to us. However, there is no assurance that the tests will be successful or that we will ever receive any such royalties. 

&#160;

Dependence on Certain Commercial Agreements 

&#160; 

We do not have any material agreements upon which we are dependent. 

&#160; 

Patents 

&#160; 

U.S. patent 5,429,084 was granted on July 4, 1995, to James McCann, Brian Cherry, Patrick Badgley and four other individuals for various improvements incorporated in the RC/DC Engine, This patent has been assigned to us.
