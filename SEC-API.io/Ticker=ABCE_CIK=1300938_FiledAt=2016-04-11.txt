 ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 

OVERALL STRATEGIC DIRECTION 

&#160; 

The Company is in the Photo Voltaic (PV) solar systems industry and is an electrical product and services supplier. The Company plans to build out a network of operations in major cities in the USA in order to establish a national base of PV suppliers, lighting suppliers and electrical service operations centers. This combination of services, solar and electric, provides the company with a solid base in the standard electrical services business and a solid base in the growth markets of solar systems industry. 

&#160; 

OVERVIEW 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we operated in three locations in Arizona. The Company plan is to expand to more locations in North America in the next year as funding becomes available. We believe that the solar and energy efficiency business functions better if the employees are local individuals working and selling in their own community. Our customers have indicated a preference for dealing with local firms and we will continue our focus on company-owned integrated product and services offices. Once a local firm is established, growth tends to come from experience, quality and name recognition. We remain committed to high quality operations. 

&#160; 

Our audited statements for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 are presented below with major category details of revenue and expense including the components of operating expenses.

&#160; 

DESCRIPTION OF PRODUCTS 

&#160; 

ABCO sells and installs Solar Photovoltaic electric systems that allow the customer to produce their own power on their residence or business property. These products, installed by our crews, are purchased from both USA and offshore manufacturers. We have available and utilize many suppliers of US manufactured solar products from such companies as Sunpower, Mage, Siliken Solar, Westinghouse Solar, Schuco and various Chinese suppliers. In addition, we purchase from a number of local and regional distributors whose products are readily available and selected for markets and price. ABCO offers solar leasing and long term financing programs from UP solar, Sunpower, Suncap and AEFC that are offered to ABCO customers and other marketing and installation organizations. 

&#160; 

ABCO also sells and installs energy efficient lighting products, solar powered street lights and lighting accessories. ABCO contracts directly with manufacturers to purchase its lighting products which are sold to residential and commercial customers. 

&#160; 

ABCO has Arizona statewide approval as a registered electrical services and solar products installer. Our license is ROC 258378 electrical and we are fully licensed to offer commercial and residential electrical services and solar. We have operated in New York State and completed projects through the use of contractors licensed in New York. We have a New York business license, we are incorporated in New York and we intend to continue to do business in this state. As in all states, we will comply with all licensing requirements of those jurisdictions. 

&#160; 

The ABCO subsidiary, Alternative Energy Finance Corporation, (AEFC) a Wyoming Company provides funding for leases of photovoltaic systems. AEFC financed its owned leases from its own cash and now arranges financing with funds provided by other lessors. AEFC has not done any new leases since 2011, but intends to do so as cash becomes available. 

&#160; 

COMPETITION 

&#160; 

The solar power market itself is intensely competitive and rapidly evolving. Price and available financing are the principal methods of competition in the industry. Based upon these two criteria, our position in the industry is relatively small. There is no competitive data available to us in our competitive position within the industry. Our competitors have established market positions more prominent than ours, and if we fail to attract and retain customers and establish a successful distribution network, we may be unable to achieve sales and market share. There are a number of major multi-national corporations that produce solar power products, including, Suntech, Sunpower, First Solar, Kyocera, Sharp, GE, Mitsubishi, Solar World AG and Sanyo. Also established integrators are growing and consolidating, including GoSolar, Sunwize, Sunenergy and Real Good Solar and we expect that future competition will include new entrants to the solar power market. Further, many of our competitors are developing and are currently producing products based on new solar power technologies that may have costs similar to, or lower than, our projected costs. 

&#160; 

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES 

&#160; 

The Company believes that its key competitive advantages are: 

&#160; 

1. 

&#160; The ability to make decisions and use management&#8217;s many years of business experience to make the right decisions. 

2. 

&#160; Experience with National expansion programs by management. 

3. 

&#160; Experience with management of employee operated facilities from a central management office. 

4. 

&#160; Experience with multi-media promotional program for name recognition and product awareness. 

5. 

&#160; Alternative energy is a fast growing and popular industry that relates well to customers and current or future shareholders that recognize the market, products and business focus. 

&#160; 

ADVANTAGES OF COMPETITORS OVER US 

&#160; 

The Company believes the following are advantages of Competitors over us. 

&#160; 

1. 

&#160; Larger competitors have more capital. 

2. 

&#160; Larger companies have more experience in the market. 

3. 

&#160; Larger companies will get the larger contracts because of the level of experience. 

4. 

&#160; We have the same products but must pay more because of volume. This will be a price consideration in bidding competition 

5. 

&#160; We are a small company that may not be able to compete because we do not have experience or working capital adequate to compete with other companies. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

CURRENT BUSINESS FOCUS 

&#160; 

We believe that we have developed very good promotional material and advertising products. We have developed the key messages and promotional pieces that are relevant to our business and inexpensive to produce. We have built an informative and interactive web site that will allow people to assess their requirements and partially build and price a system, much like the automobile dealers utilize. Additional sales promotion will increase when we have secured outside financing or increased sales through direct sales efforts. Readers should review our website at www. abcosolar.com . 

&#160; 

We have established a direct sales force to sell to Government agencies including State, Local and Federal resources and a separate division to call on the many American Indian governments in the US. This allows us to quote with our specifications, products and services on Requests for Proposals (RFP&#8217;s) that are issued by the Government Services Agency (GSA), Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and other agencies. We have found that a large number of projects are not known to the general public and most contractors because governmental agencies do not widely advertise their projects. By departmentalizing this opportunity, we get more information on projects than is available in the normal course of business. 

&#160; 

ABCO will not manufacture its solar voltaic (PV) products. We will continue to be a sales and installation contractor with plans to enter the markets of major US and international cities. We will sell and use commercial off the shelf components. Initially this will include the solar panels and LED lighting products purchased to our specification. A strong alliance with a well-respected distributor will be the most conservative decision for the company at this time. 

&#160; 

ABCO will contract directly with manufacturers for it Solar Street Light products and will sell, install and maintain these products. This product is considered to be an American Made product and therefore qualifies for various government funding programs. 

&#160; 

Our business and the industry are reliant upon a number of state and federal programs to assist our customers in the acquisition of our products and services. Such programs are the utility rebates paid directly to customers for wattage installations and the state and federal tax credit programs that allow a percentage of the actual cost of installations to be refunded in the form of tax credits. Many states have mandated the utilities to collect funds from their customers for the payment of rebates. All of these programs are listed on the website www.dsireusa.org. 

&#160; 

Most of these programs are slated for expiration at differing times in the future. The federal tax credit of 30% of installation cost will expire at the end of 2016. We do not know if it will be reduced or extended nor do we know the impacts such actions will have on our business. The customers benefit from the federal and state tax credits which pass through to the owners of the solar systems. Investors often require the ownership to remain in their hands so that the tax credits can be passed through to them. This results in a lesser amount to finance and a benefit to the lessee because it lowers the lease payments. To the extent known, the curtailment or reduction of this tax credit will make a material change in our business and will very likely lower our sales prices and gross margins. Extension of the program or small reductions will probably not have a material effect on sales or gross margins because the suppliers will adjust to the new norm. We again emphasize, we cannot predict any of the future or the outcome of unknowns. State rebate mandates and state tax credits are variable by state. All of these programs provide incentives for our customers that result in reduced cost. The price of solar products has also been reduced drastically in the past two years which helping to balance the need for the subsidies. 

&#160; 

The State of Arizona subsidized incentives are not material to our programs at this time. Since the State of Arizona offers only $1,000 tax credit per residential installation and no utility rebates for residential or commercial installations, this amount of credit is not likely to negatively impact our business because it will not materially affect the price of the installation. This amount currently represents less than 2% of the price of an average residential installation. The commercial tax credit is 10% of the installation price and capped at $25,000. We have not found this credit to be an adequate incentive for a buyer of a solar project to make a purchase decision and if not available, in our opinion, most sales would not be affected. 

&#160; 

CUSTOMER BASE 

&#160; 

Referrals are important in any market and time in business makes the customer base grow. No customer represented a significant percentage of the Company&#8217;s total revenue in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 or 2014. The company believes that the knowledge, relationships, reputation and successful track record of its management will help it to build and maintain its customer base. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

EXPERIENCED MANAGEMENT 

&#160; 

The Company believes that it has experienced management. ABCO&#8217;s principal, Charles O&#8217;Dowd, has seven years of experience in the sales and installation of solar products and more than forty years of business experience. Mr. O&#8217;Dowd has the ability and experience to attract and hire experienced and talented individuals to help manage the company. 

&#160; 

Mr. Wayne Marx has been a member of the ABCO Board of Directors for six years. He also has over 40 years of self-employed business experience The Company believes that long term business experience is our most valuable management tool. 

&#160; 

ABCO has several experienced and long term employees on staff with a number of years of experience in provision of electrical services including lighting and solar installations. The Company believes that the knowledge, relationships, reputation and successful track record of its management will help it to build and maintain its customer base. 

&#160; 

FINANCIAL RESOURCES 

&#160; 

ABCO&#8217;s development activities since inception have been financially sustained through the sale of equity and capital contribution from shareholders. We will continue to source capital from the equity and debt markets in order to fund our plans for expansion if we are unable to produce adequate capital from operations. There is no guarantee that the Company will be able to obtain adequate capital from these sources, or at all. 

&#160; 

EMPLOYEES 

&#160; 

The Company presently has 15 full-time employees, five (5) in management, and three (3) in sales and the balance are in various labor crew positions. The Company anticipates that it will need to hire additional employees as the business grows. In addition, the Company may expand the size of our Board of Directors in the future. Mr. O&#8217;Dowd devotes full time (40 plus hours) to the affairs of the Company. No employees are represented by a union and there have not been any work stoppages. 

&#160; 

IMPLICATIONS OF BEING AN EMERGING GROWTH COMPANY 

We are an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221;, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012(&#8220;JOBS Act&#8221;). For as long as we are an &#8220;emerging growth company,&#8221; we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not &#8220;emerging growth companies&#8221; including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 40(t) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (&#8220;SOX&#8221;) and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports. 

Under the JOBS Act, we will remain an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; until the earliest of: 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#183; 

the last day of the fiscal year during which we have total annual gross revenues of $1 Billion dollars; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of completion of this offering; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt; and 

&#160; 

&#183; 

The date on which we are deemed to be &#8220;large accelerated filer&#8221; under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;). We will qualify as a &#8220;large accelerated filer&#8221; as of the first day of the first fiscal year after we have (i) more than $700 million in accelerated common equity held by our non-affiliated and (ii) been public for at least 12 months, the value of our outstanding common equity will be measured each year on the last day of our second fiscal quarter. 

&#160; 

The JOBS Act also provides that an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; can utilize the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#8220;Securities Act&#8221;), for complying with new or revisited accounting standards. However, we are choosing to &#8220;opt out&#8221; of such extended transition period, and, as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for companies that are not &#8220;emerging growth companies.&#8221; Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

We are an &#8220;emerging growth company,&#8221; as defined in the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an &#8220;emerging growth company,&#8221; we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to either public companies that are not &#8220;emerging growth companies,&#8221; including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of SOX. As an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; we are required to report fewer years of selected historical financial data than that reported by other public companies. We may take advantage of these exemptions until we are no longer an &#8220;emerging growth company.&#8221; We could be an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; for up to five years, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30 (the end of our second fiscal quarter) in which case we would no longer be an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; as of the following December31 (our fiscal year end). We cannot predict if investors will find our shares less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our shares less attractive as a result, there may be less active trading market for our shares and the price of our shares may be more volatile.
