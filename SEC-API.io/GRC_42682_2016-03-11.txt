 ITEM 1. BUSINESS &#150; CONTINUED &#160; 

During 2015, 2014 and 2013, there were no shipments to any single customer that exceeded 10% of total net sales. Gorman-Rupp continues to actively pursue international business opportunities and, in 2015, shipped its pumps to approximately 150 countries around the world. However, we believe that the Company&#146;s foreign operations do not involve material financial or other risks due to their relatively small size, both individually and collectively. No sales made to customers in any one foreign country amounted to more than 5% of total net sales during 2015, 2014 or 2013. 

As a result of our active pursuit of international business, approximately $136.5 million of 2015 sales were shipped outside the United States, as compared to $136.6 million in 2014 and $134.6 million in 2013. International sales represented 34%, 31% and 34% of total sales in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. See Note I to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company continues its efforts to penetrate international markets principally by its increased global investments and its sales responses to worldwide pumping needs. 

COMPETITION 

Since the late 1990&#146;s, a number of consolidations have occurred within the highly competitive pump industry. As a consequence, numerous pump competitors now exist as subsidiaries, divisions or departments within significantly larger corporations. Foreign-sourced pumps have also increasingly penetrated into most of the Company&#146;s domestic markets. 

Gorman-Rupp estimates that approximately 80 other domestic and global companies selling pumps and pump units compete in one or more of the lines of business and applications in which comparable products of the Company are utilized. International competitors are based mostly in Europe and Asia. 

Most commercial and industrial pumps are specifically designed and engineered for a particular customer&#146;s application. The Company believes that proper application, product performance, and quality of delivery and service are its principal methods of competition, and attributes its success to its continued emphasis in these areas. 

PURCHASING AND PRODUCTION 

Virtually all materials, supplies, components and accessories used by the Company in the fabrication of its products, including all castings (for which most patterns are made and owned by the Company), structural steel, bar stock, motors, solenoids, engines, seals, and plastic and elastomeric components are purchased by the Company from other suppliers and manufacturers. No purchases are made under long-term contracts and the Company is not dependent upon a single source for any materials, supplies, components or accessories which are of material importance to its business. 

The Company purchases motors for its polypropylene bellows pumps and magnetic drive pumps from several alternative vendors; and motor components for its large submersible pumps, and motors and engines for its pump systems, are purchased from a limited number of suppliers. Products requiring small motors are also currently sourced from alternative suppliers. 

The other production operations of the Company consist of the machining of castings, the cutting, shaping and welding of bar stock and structural members, the design and assembly of electrical control panels, the manufacture of a few minor components, and the assembling, painting and testing of its products. Virtually all of the Company&#146;s products are tested prior to shipment. 

OTHER ASPECTS 

As of December 31, 2015, the Company employed approximately 1,274 persons, of whom approximately 753 were hourly employees. The Company has no collective bargaining agreements, has never experienced a work stoppage and considers its labor relations to be satisfactory.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS &#150; CONTINUED &#160; 

Although the Company owns a number of patents, and several of them are important to its business, Gorman-Rupp believes that the business of the Company is not materially dependent upon any one or more patents. The Company&#146;s patents, trademarks and other intellectual property are adequate for its business purposes. 

The backlog of orders at December 31, 2015 was valued at $117.1 million compared to $160.7 million at December 31, 2014. Approximately 95% of the Company&#146;s backlog of unfilled orders is scheduled to be shipped during 2016, with the remainder principally during the first half of 2017. The decrease in backlog from 2014 is due primarily to approximately $37.7 million of shipments for the Permanent Canal Closures &#38; Pumps (&#147;PCCP&#148;) project to supply major flood control pumps to a member of a joint venture construction group for a significant New Orleans flood control project. Approximately $10.5 million of orders related to the project remain in the December 31, 2015 backlog total. The remainder of the decrease in backlog is a result of lower order rates in 2015 due to unfavorable domestic weather conditions and global impacts relating to oil pricing and production. 

The PCCP project is a fixed-price contract and full government funding has been appropriated for the project. The termination, cancellation and delay provisions within the PCCP project contract are governed by provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (&#147;FAR&#148;), principally by clauses 52.222-12 (Contract Termination-Debarment), 52.242-14 (Suspension of Work), 52.242-2 Alt. 1 (Production Progress Reports), and 52.249.10 (Default &#150; Fixed-Price Construction).
