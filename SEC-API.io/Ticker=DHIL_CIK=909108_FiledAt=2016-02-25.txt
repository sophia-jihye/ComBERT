Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, when we use the terms the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;management,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; and &#8220;our,&#8221; we mean Diamond Hill Investment Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries. 

Overview 

The Company, an Ohio corporation organized in April 1990, derives its consolidated revenue and net income from investment advisory and fund administration services provided by its subsidiaries Diamond Hill Capital Management, Inc. (&#8220;DHCM&#8221;), Beacon Hill Fund Services, Inc. (&#8220;BHFS&#8221;), and BHIL Distributors, Inc. (&#8220;BHIL&#8221;). BHFS and BHIL collectively operate as "Beacon Hill". DHCM is a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. DHCM sponsors, distributes, and provides investment advisory and related services to U.S. and foreign clients through Diamond Hill Funds (the "Funds"), institutional accounts, an exchange traded fund, and private investment funds (generally known as &#8220;hedge funds&#8221;). Beacon Hill provides fund administration and statutory underwriting services to U.S. and foreign clients, including the Funds. 

The Company&#8217;s primary objective is to fulfill our fiduciary duty to our clients. Our secondary objective is to grow the intrinsic value of the Company in order to achieve an adequate long-term return for our shareholders. 

Investment Advisory Activities 

Clients 

The Company provides investment advisory services to a broad range of clients, including corporations, mutual funds, retirement plans, public pension funds, endowments, foundations, financial institutions and high net worth individuals. We strive to expand our client base by attracting new clients and earning additional business from existing clients. 

Investment Philosophy 

We believe that a company&#8217;s intrinsic value is independent of its stock price. We also believe competitive long-term returns can be achieved by buying (shorting) companies when the current market price is at a discount (premium) to our estimate of intrinsic value, based upon a discounted cash flow methodology. 

The following are the guiding principles for our philosophy: 

&#8226; 

Treat every investment as a partial ownership interest in that company. 

Investing is most intelligent when it is viewed through the lens of an owner. 

&#8226; 

Always invest with a margin of safety. 

Our discipline is to purchase (short) securities at a sufficient discount (premium) to our estimate of intrinsic value. We estimate the intrinsic value of the company independent of the current stock market price then compare our estimate to the price to determine if an opportunity exists. When we successfully identify securities trading below (above) our estimate of intrinsic value, it increases the potential reward and serves as the most effective risk control. 

&#8226; 

Possess a long-term investment temperament. 

In the short term, emotion as much as economic fundamentals drives market prices. Over time, the economic performance of the company and the price paid, versus the market, will determine investment return. 

&#8226; 

Recognize that market price and intrinsic value tend to converge over a reasonable period of time. 

Investment opportunity lies in the ability to buy (or short), when the current market price does not reflect a company&#8217;s intrinsic value, and to sell (or cover) when price and value converge. 

Investment Process 

DHCM&#8217;s investment process begins with fundamental research focusing on estimating a company&#8217;s intrinsic value independent of its current stock price. Bottom-up analysis, which takes into consideration earnings, revenue growth, operating margins and other economic factors, is of primary importance in estimating the intrinsic value of an individual company. A five-year discounted cash flow analysis is the primary methodology to determine whether there is a discrepancy between the current market price and DHCM&#8217;s estimate of intrinsic value. In order to forecast the amount and timing of cash flows, the research analysts concentrate on the fundamental economic drivers of the business, including competitive positioning, quality of management, and balance sheet strength. Research analysts also evaluate each company within the context of sector and industry secular trends. Key factors in analyzing sectors and industries include relative pricing power, ability to earn excess returns, long-term capital flow, and other fundamental factors. DHCM also applies an intrinsic value philosophy to the analysis of fixed income securities. 

Only securities selling at a discount (premium) to intrinsic value will be purchased (sold short). A portfolio manager assigns the highest weights to the highest conviction names. Within certain diversification constraints, a portfolio manager is willing to take outsized positions in the highest conviction ideas and we will often have no exposure to industries without attractive intrinsic value opportunities. A stock will be sold (or covered) if its price reaches DHCM&#8217;s estimate of intrinsic value, if fundamentals deteriorate, if a more attractive opportunity is identified, or if the holding reaches a specified limit as a percent of the portfolio. 

DHCM believes that many investors&#8217; short-term focus hinders their long-term results, which creates market inefficiencies and, therefore, opportunities. In addition, not all investors are valuation sensitive. We believe that we can exploit these market anomalies/inefficiencies by possessing a long-term investment temperament and practicing a consistent and repeatable business appraisal approach to investing. Furthermore, DHCM believes that investing in securities whose market prices are significantly below its estimate of intrinsic value (or selling short securities whose market prices are above its estimate of intrinsic value) is a reliable method to achieve above average relative returns, as well as mitigate risk. 

Investment Advisory Fees 

The Company&#8217;s principal source of revenue is investment advisory fee income earned from managing client accounts under investment advisory and sub-advisory agreements. The fees earned depend on the type of investment strategy, account size and servicing requirements. Revenues depend on the total value and composition of assets under management (&#8220;AUM&#8221;). Accordingly, net cash flows from clients, market fluctuations in client portfolios, and the composition of AUM impact our revenues and results of operations. We also have certain agreements which allow us to earn variable fees in the event that investment returns exceed targeted amounts during a measurement period. 

Investment Strategies 

The Company offers several traditional and alternative investment strategies, which are all based on the same intrinsic value philosophy. As of December 31, 2015 , we offered the following representative investment strategies to our clients: 

1. 

Small Cap &#32;- Pursues long-term capital appreciation by investment in a portfolio of small-capitalization U.S. equity securities. 

2. 

Small-Mid Cap &#32;- Pursues long-term capital appreciation by investing in a portfolio of small- and mid-capitalization U.S. equity securities. 

3. 

Mid Cap - Pursues long-term capital appreciation by investing in a portfolio of mid-capitalization U.S. equity securities 

4. 

Large Cap &#32;- Pursues long-term capital appreciation by investing in a portfolio of large-capitalization U.S. equity securities. 

5. 

Select &#32;- Pursues long-term capital appreciation by investing in a concentrated portfolio of U.S. companies across a broad range of market capitalizations. 

6.

9.

Investment Results 

The Company believes that one of the most important characteristics exhibited by the best investment firms is excellent investment returns for their clients over a long period of time. We are pleased that, during our history as an investment advisory firm, we have delivered what we believe are strong long-term investment returns for our clients. Investment returns have been a key driver in the long-term success we have achieved in growing assets under management ("AUM"). 

In 2015, the Russell 1000 Index posted a total return, including dividends, of 0.92%, while the broader Russell 3000 Index posted a 0.48% total return. Small cap stocks fared worse than large cap stocks, with the Russell 2000 Index posting a total return of -4.41%. Absolute returns for our equity strategies were primarily negative in 2015, while returns relative to benchmarks were mixed. Across most of our equity strategies, holdings in the energy and industrials sectors were the primary detractors from return in 2015, reflecting concerns about the slowdown in China&#8217;s economic growth as well as exposure to commodity price declines. Nonetheless, as of December 31, 2015, the since-inception returns for all but one of our strategies with at least a five-year track record exceeded their respective benchmark returns. The only exception was our Research Opportunities Fund. As always, we remain focused on five-year periods to evaluate our results, as we believe five years is the shortest time period for statistical significance. &#32; 

The performance of active strategies relative to a passive benchmark tends to be cyclical. These cycles are created because price momentum can persist in the short-term but reverts in the long-term. Market returns are often driven by investor emotions and unpredictable market psychology in the short-term, which has been extended in recent years by unprecedented monetary stimulus; an extended bull market characterized by lower volatility, lower dispersion, and higher correlations; less focus on individual, bottom-up company fundamentals; and self-reinforcing passive flows. While market conditions over the past five years have made it difficult for many active managers to outperform passive alternatives, we expect the cycle will turn in favor of active management, and we are beginning to see signs of a turning point. Dispersion between individual stock returns is increasing, and in December 2015 the Federal Reserve increased its Fed Funds target rate for the first time since 2006. We continue to believe that our intrinsic value-focused approach will outperform over a full market cycle, supported by our intrinsic value-based investment philosophy, long-term perspective, disciplined approach, and alignment with our clients&#8217; interests. The following is a summary of the investment returns for each of our representative strategies as of December 31, 2015, relative to its respective passive benchmark.

Capacity 

The Company&#8217;s primary goal is to fulfill our fiduciary duty to clients. We understand that our ability to retain and grow assets as a firm has been, and will be, driven primarily by delivering attractive long-term investment results to our clients. When we have determined that the size of any of our strategies hinders our ability to add value over a passive alternative, we have closed those strategies to new clients and we will continue to do so, which will impact our ability to grow AUM. We have prioritized, and will continue to prioritize, investment results over asset accumulation. The Small Cap strategy was closed to new investors as of December 31, 2015 and the Long-Short strategy was closed to new investors as of June 12, 2015. We estimate our AUM capacity to be approximately $30-$40 billion, with AUM of $16.8 billion &#32;as of December 31, 2015 . 

Distribution Channels 

The Company&#8217;s investment advisory services are distributed through multiple channels. Our institutional sales efforts include building relationships with institutional consultants and also establishing direct relationships with institutional clients. Our sales efforts for the Funds include wholesaling to third-party financial intermediaries, including independent registered investment advisers, brokers, financial planners, and wealth advisers, who utilize the Funds in investment programs they construct for their clients.

Growth Strategy 

The Company&#8217;s growth strategy will remain focused on achieving excellent investment results in all our strategies and providing the highest level of client service. We will continue to focus on the development of distribution channels to enable us to offer our various investment strategies to a broad array of clients. We seek to continue to grow our AUM through our proprietary funds and institutional accounts. We have a targeted strategic business plan to further penetrate our existing distribution channels. Our business development efforts are focused on expanding the institutional consultant channel and plan sponsor network on the separate account side, as well as our intermediary network on the fund side. 

Fund Administration Activities 

Fund Administration Services 

The Company provides fund administration services to the Funds and other third party mutual fund companies and investment advisers. Fund administration services are broadly defined as portfolio and regulatory compliance, treasury and financial oversight, statutory underwriting, oversight of back-office service providers such as the custodian, fund accountant, and transfer agent, and general business management and governance of the mutual fund complex. These services are offered on a stand-alone basis, as well as through a series or "umbrella" trust whereby individual investment advisers can establish a mutual fund under a fund complex sponsored by the Company. 

Fund Administration Fees 

The Company earns revenue from performing the various fund administration activities described above under individual client agreements. The fees earned depend on the type of service, fund size, and/or servicing requirements. Certain client agreements have a fixed fee arrangement while others have a fee derived as a percentage of assets under administration. 

Competition 

Competition in the area of investment management and fund administration is intense, and our competitors include investment management firms, broker-dealers, banks and insurance companies, some of whom offer various investment alternatives, including passive index strategies. Many competitors are better known than the Company, offer a broader range of investment products and have more offices, employees and business development representatives. We compete primarily on the basis of philosophy, performance and client service. 

Regulation 

The Company and our business are subject to various federal, state and foreign laws and regulations. As a matter of public policy, regulatory bodies are charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and with protecting the interests of participants in those markets, including investment advisory clients and shareholders of investment funds. Under these laws and regulations, agencies that regulate investment advisers have broad administrative powers, including the power to limit, restrict or prohibit an investment adviser from carrying on its business in the event the adviser fails to comply with such laws and regulations. Possible sanctions that may be imposed include civil and criminal liability, the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in certain lines of business for specified periods of time, revocation of investment adviser, broker/dealer, and other registrations, censures and fines. 

DHCM is registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the &#8220;Advisers Act&#8221;) and operates in a highly regulated environment. The Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers, including fiduciary duties, recordkeeping requirements, operational requirements and disclosure obligations. All Diamond Hill Funds are registered with the SEC under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and are required to make notice filings with all states where the Funds are offered for sale. BHIL is registered with the SEC as a broker/dealer and is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (&#8220;FINRA&#8221;). Virtually all aspects of our investment advisory and fund administration business are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations. 

To the extent that DHCM is a &#8220;fiduciary&#8221; under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (&#8220;ERISA&#8221;) with respect to benefit plan clients, it is subject to ERISA regulations. ERISA and applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries, prohibit certain transactions involving ERISA plan clients, and provide monetary penalties for violations of these prohibitions. The U.S. Department of Labor, which administers ERISA, has been increasingly active in proposing and adopting regulations affecting the asset management industry. 

The Company&#8217;s trading activities for client accounts are regulated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;), as well as as various FINRA rules, including laws governing trading on inside information, market manipulation and a broad number of trading requirements (e.g., volume limitations, reporting obligations) and market regulation policies in the United States. 

The preceding descriptions of the regulatory and statutory provisions applicable to us are not complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to their respective statutory or regulatory provisions. Failure to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business. 

Contractual Relationships with the Diamond Hill Funds 

The Company is very dependent on our contractual relationships with the Funds. In the event our advisory or administration agreements with the Funds are terminated, not renewed, or amended to reduce fees, we would be materially and adversely affected. We generated approximately 75% , 73% &#32;and 71% &#32;of our 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;revenues, respectively, from our advisory and administrative contracts with the Funds. We consider our relationship with the Funds and their board of trustees to be good, and have no reason to believe that these advisory or administration contracts will not be renewed in the future; however, there is no assurance that the Funds will choose to continue their relationships with the Company. Please see Item 1A for risk factors regarding this relationship. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , the Company and its subsidiaries employed 126 &#32;full-time equivalent employees. As of December 31, 2014 , the comparable number was 107 . We believe that our relationship with our employees is good. Our employee count has been growing over the past several years and we expect that general trend to continue.
