 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

A. BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT

There have been no changes to our business development since our last annual report on Form 10-K. We are still in the development stage and have not begun to earn any revenue. 

B. FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT SEGMENTS

As defined by generally accepted accounting principles (&#34;GAAP&#34;), we do not have any segments separate and apart from our business as a whole. Accordingly, there are no measures of revenue from external customers, profit and loss, or total assets aside from what is reported in the Financial Statements attached to this Form 10-K.

C. BUSINESS OF THE COMPANY

There have been no changes to our business since our last annual report on Form 10-K. We are still in the development stage and have not begun to earn any revenue. 

We continue to seek opportunities to implement our business plan as previously reported.
