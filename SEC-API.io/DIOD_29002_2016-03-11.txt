The aggregate consideration was approximately $403.2 million including the value of Pericom equity awards paid out or converted to Diodes equity awards pursuant to the Merger Agreement and the Merger Agreement Amendment. The aggregate consideration resulted in $54.3 million of goodwill. These preliminary amounts are subject to adjustment.

SEGMENT INFORMATION AND ENTERPRISE-WIDE DISCLOSURES 

For financial reporting purposes, we operate in a single segment, standard semiconductor products, through our various design, manufacturing and distribution facilities. We sell product primarily through our operations in Asia, North America and Europe. We aggregate our products in a single segment because the products have similar economic characteristics, are similar in production process and manufacturing flow, and share the same customers and target end-equipment markets. See Note 14 of &#8220;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#8221; of this Annual Report for addition information. 

OUR INDUSTRY 

Semiconductors are critical components used in the manufacture of a broad range of electronic products and systems. Since the invention of the transistor in 1948, continuous improvements in semiconductor processes and design technologies have led to smaller, more complex and more reliable devices at a lower cost per function. The availability of low-cost semiconductors, together with increased customer demand for sophisticated electronic systems, has led to the proliferation of semiconductors in diverse end-use applications. 

OUR COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS 

We believe our competitive strengths include the following: 

Flexible, scalable and cost-effective manufacturing &#8211; Our manufacturing operations are a core element of our success, and we have designed our manufacturing base to allow us to respond quickly to changes in demand trends in the end-markets we serve. For example, we have structured our assembly and test facilities to enable us to rapidly and efficiently add capacity and adjust product mix to meet shifts in customer demand and overall market trends. As a result, we have historically operated our Shanghai manufacturing facilities at near full capacity, while at the same time expanding that capacity to meet our growth objectives. In 2011, we established an additional manufacturing facility for semiconductor assembly and test in Chengdu, China, which became fully production capable during the second half of 2015. Additionally, the Shanghai and Chengdu locations of our manufacturing operations provide us with access to a workforce at a relatively low overall cost base while enabling us to better serve our leading customers, many of which are located in Asia. In 2012, we acquired approximately 51% of the outstanding common stock of Eris Technology Corporation (&#8220;Eris&#8221;), primarily to obtain its automatic manufacturing capabilities in assembly and test for various diode products. In 2013, we acquired BCD, which has in-house manufacturing capabilities in China, as well as a cost-effective development team that can be deployed across multiple product families. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212; During times of difficult market conditions, our fixed costs combined with lower net sales and lower profit margins may have a negative impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.&#8221; in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report for additional information. 

Integrated packaging expertise &#8211; Our expertise in designing and manufacturing innovative and proprietary packaging solutions enables us to package a variety of different device functions into an assortment of packages ranging from miniature chip-scale packaging to packages that integrate multiple separate discrete and/or analog chips into a single semiconductor product called an array. Our ability to design and manufacture multi-chip semiconductor solutions as well as advanced integrated devices provides our customers with products of equivalent functionality with fewer individual parts, and at lower overall cost, than alternative products. This combination of integration, functionality and miniaturization makes our products well suited for high-volume consumer electronic devices such as LED televisions, LCD panels, set-top boxes and consumer portables such as smartphones, tablets and notebooks. 

- 2 -

Broad customer base and diverse end-markets &#8211; Our customers are comprised of lea ding OEMs as well as major EMS providers. Overall, we serve over 250 direct customers worldwide and over 50,000 additional customers through our distributors. Our products are ultimately used in end-products in a number of markets served by our broad custo mer base, which we believe makes us less susceptible to market fluctuations driven by either specific customers or specific end-user applications. 

Customer focused product development &#8211; Effective collaboration with our customers and a commitment to customer service are essential elements of our business. We believe focusing on dependable delivery and support tailored to specific end-user applications has fostered deep customer relationships and created a key competitive advantage for us in the highly fragmented discrete, logic and analog semiconductor marketplace. We believe our close relationships with our customers have provided us with keener insight into our customers&#8217; product needs. This results in a stronger demand for our product designs and often provides us with insight into additional opportunities for new design wins in our customers&#8217; products. See &#8220;Risk Factors - We are and will continue to be under continuous pressure from our customers and competitors to reduce the price of our products, which could adversely affect our growth and profit margins&#8221; in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report for additional information. 

Management experience &#8211; The members of our executive team average over 30 years of industry experience, and the length of their service has created significant institutional insight into our markets, our customers and our operations. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212; We may fail to attract or retain the qualified technical, sales, marketing, finance and management personnel required to operate our business successfully, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.&#8221; in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report for additional information. 

OUR STRATEGY 

Our strategy is to continue to enhance our position as a leading global designer, manufacturer and supplier of high-quality application-specific standard semiconductor products, utilizing our innovative and cost-effective assembly and test (packaging) technology and leveraging our process expertise and design excellence to achieve above-market profitable growth. 

The principal elements of our strategy include the following: 

Continue to rapidly introduce innovative discrete, logic and analog semiconductor products &#8211; We intend to maintain our rapid pace of new product introductions, especially for high-volume, high-growth applications with short design cycles, such as LCD and LED televisions and panels, set-top boxes, portables such as smartphones, tablets and notebooks along with other consumer electronics and computing devices, as well as added emphasis on products for the LED lighting market and the industrial and automotive markets. During 2015, we continued to achieve many significant new design wins at OEMs. Although a design win from a customer does not necessarily guarantee future sales to that customer, we believe that continued introduction of new and well-defined product solutions is critically important in maintaining and extending our market share in the highly competitive semiconductor marketplace. See &#8220;Risk Factors &#8211; Obsolete inventories as a result of changes in demand for our products and change in life cycles of our products could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.&#8221; in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report for additional information. 

Expand our available market opportunities &#8211; We believe we have many paths to increasing our addressable market opportunity. From a product perspective, we intend to continue expanding our product portfolio by developing derivative and enhanced performance devices that target adjacent markets and end-equipment. We will continue to cultivate new and emerging customers within our targeted markets, further increasing our already broad customer base. As we focus on new customers, we try to expand our product portfolio penetration within these new, as well as existing, customers. As we expand our extensive range of high power efficiency and small form factor packages, we plan to introduce new and existing product functions in these new packages to allow an even greater market range. 

Maintain intense customer focus &#8211; We intend to continue to strengthen and deepen our customer relationships. We believe that continued focus on customer service is important and will help to increase our net sales, operating performance and market share. To accomplish this, we intend to continue to closely collaborate with our customers to design products that meet their specific needs. A critical element of this strategy is to further reduce our design cycle time in order to quickly provide our customers with innovative products. Additionally, to support our customer-focused strategy, we continue to expand our sales force and field application engineers, particularly in Asia and Europe, during periods of growth. See &#8220;Risk Factors &#8211; We are and will continue to be under continuous pressure from our customers and competitors to reduce the price of our products, which could adversely affect our growth and profit margins.&#8221; in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report for additional information. 

Enhance cost competitiveness &#8211; A key element of our success is our overall low-cost manufacturing base. While we believe that our Shanghai manufacturing facilities are among the most efficient in the industry, we will continue to refine our proprietary manufacturing processes and technology to achieve additional cost efficiencies. In 2011, we commenced the expansion of our capacity further by establishing an additional manufacturing facility for semiconductor assembly and test in Chengdu, China, that became fully 

- 3 -

production capable in the second half of 2015. Historically, we attempt to operate our Shanghai facilities at near full utilization rates in order to achieve meaningful economies of scale. 

Pursue selective strategic acquisitions &#8211; As part of our strategy to expand our semiconductor product offerings and to maximize our market opportunities, we may acquire technologies, product lines or companies in order to enhance our product portfolio and accelerate our new product offerings. During 2011, we acquired approximately 30% of the outstanding common stock of Eris, and during 2012, we increased our ownership in Eris to approximately 51%. The product offering of Eris includes Schottky Diodes, TVS Diodes, Zener Diodes, Bridge Diodes, rectifiers and the relevant devices. Also in 2012, we completed the acquisition of Power Analog Microelectronics, Inc. (&#8220;PAM&#8221;), a provider of advanced analog and high-voltage power ICs, whose product portfolio includes Class D audio amplifiers, DC-DC converters and LED backlighting drivers. In 2013, we acquired BCD which, with its established manufacturing and sales presence in Asia and a particularly strong local market position in China, offers us an even greater penetration of the consumer electronics, computing and communications markets. In 2015, we acquired Pericom Semiconductor Corporation. Pericom designs, develops and markets high-performance ICs and FCPs used in many of today&#8217;s advanced electronic systems. ICs include functions that support the connectivity, timing and signal conditioning of high-speed parallel and serial protocols that transfer data among a system&#8217;s microprocessor, memory and various peripherals, such as displays and monitors, and between interconnected systems. FCPs are electronic components that provide frequency references such as crystals and oscillators for computer, communication and consumer electronic products. Analog, digital and mixed-signal ICs, together with FCPs enable higher system bandwidth and signal quality, resulting in better operating reliability and signal integrity, and lower overall system cost in applications such as notebook computers, servers, network switches and routers, storage area networks, digital TVs, cell phones, GPS and digital media players. 

See &#8220;Risk Factors &#8211; Part of our growth strategy involves identifying and acquiring companies. We may be unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or consummate desired acquisitions and, if we do make any acquisitions, we may be unable to successfully integrate any acquired companies with our operations, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition&#8221; in Part I, Item 1A and Note 16 of &#8220;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#8221; of this Annual Report for additional information.

CUSTOMERS 

We serve over 250 direct customers worldwide, including major OEMs and EMS providers. Additionally, we have approximately 150 distributor customers worldwide, through which we indirectly serve over 50,000 customers. Our customers include: (i) leading OEMs in a broad range of industries, such as Continental AG, Delta Electronics, Honeywell, Osram, Phillips, Arris, Emerson, Hella, LG Electronics, Lenovo, Quanta Computer, Seagate, Sagem Communication, and Samsung Electronics; (ii) leading EMS providers, such as Celestica, Flextronics, Hon Hai Precision Industry, Inventec, Jabil Circuit, and Sanmina-SCI, who build end-market products incorporating our semiconductors for companies such as Google, GoPro, Cisco, Dell, EMC, Intel, Microsoft, Thompson, and Roche Diagnostics; and (iii) leading distributors such as Arrow, Avnet, Future Electronics, Rutronic, Yosun Industrial, DigiKey, and Zenitron. 

For the years 2015, 2014 and 2013, our OEM and EMS customers together accounted for 33%, 33% and 35%, respectively, of our net sales. The decrease in 2014 is due primarily to the fact that the majority of BCD net sales are to distributors. No customer accounted for 10% or more of our net sales in 2015, 2014 or 2013. In addition, for information concerning our business with related parties, see &#8220;Business - Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.&#8221; 

We believe that our close relationships with our customers have provided us with deeper insight into our customers&#8217; product needs. In addition to seeking to expand relationships with our existing customers, our strategy is to pursue new customers and diversify our customer base by focusing on leading global consumer electronics companies and their EMS providers and distributors. See &#8220;Risk Factors &#8211; Our customers require our products to undergo a lengthy and expensive qualification process without any assurance of product sales and demand to audit our operations from time to time. A failure to qualify a product or a negative audit finding could adversely affect our net sales, operating results and financial condition.&#8221; in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report for additional information. 

We generally warrant that products sold to our customers will, at the time of shipment, be free from defects in workmanship and materials and conform to our approved specifications.

MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS AND FACILITIES 

We operate two assembly and test facilities located in Shanghai, China, one in Jinan, China, one in Neuhaus, Germany, one in Taipei, Taiwan and one in Chengdu, China that became fully production capable in the second half of 2015. We have two wafer fabrication facilities located in Shanghai, one in Kansas City, Missouri and one in Manchester, U.K. Our wafer fabrication facilities in Shanghai include two 150mm wafer fabrication centers, our Kansas City facility fabricates 125mm and 150mm wafers, and our Manchester facility fabricates 150mm wafers. 

In 2010, we announced an investment agreement with the Management Committee of the Chengdu Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone (the &#8220;CDHT&#8221;). Under this agreement, we formed a joint venture with a Chinese partner, Chengdu Ya Guang Electronic Company Limited (&#8220;Ya Guang&#8221;), to establish a semiconductor assembly and test manufacturing facility in Chengdu, China. We currently own 95% of the joint venture. The CDHT granted the joint venture a 50-year land lease, provides corporate and employee tax incentives, tax refunds, subsidies and other financial support. This is a long-term, multi-year project that will provide us additional capacity as needed. As of December 31, 2015, we have invested approximately $120 million, primarily for infrastructure, buildings and equipment related capital expenditures. 

For the years ending December 31, 2015 and 2014, our total capital expenditures were approximately $138 million and $59 million, respectively. The majority of our capital expenditures are in China. 

Our manufacturing processes use many raw materials, including silicon wafers, aluminum and copper lead frames, gold and copper wire and other metals, molding compounds and various chemicals and gases. We also rely on equipment and finished product suppliers. We are continuously evaluating our raw material costs in order to reduce our consumption while protecting and maintaining product performance. We have no material agreements with any of our suppliers that impose minimum or continuing supply obligations. From time to time, suppliers may extend lead-times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. Although we believe that supplies of the raw materials we use are currently and will continue to be available, shortages could occur in various essential materials due to interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry. See &#8220;Risk Factors &#8211; We depend on third-party suppliers for timely deliveries of raw materials, manufacturing services, product and process development, parts and equipment, as well as finished products from other manufacturers, and our reputation with customers, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies in a timely manner.&#8221; in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report for additional information.

Our corporate headquarters are located in a facility we own in Plano, Texas. We also lease or own properties around the world for use as sales and administrative offices, research and development centers, manufacturing facilities, warehouses and logistics centers. The size or location of these properties can change from time to time based on our business requirements. See &#8220;Proper ties&#8221; in Part I, Item 2 of this Annual Report for additional information. 

BACKLOG 

The amount of backlog to be shipped during any period is dependent upon various factors, and orders are subject to cancellation or modification, usually with no penalty to the customer. Orders are generally booked from one month to greater than twelve months in advance of delivery. The rate of booking of new orders can vary significantly from month to month. We, and the industry as a whole, continue to experience a trend towards shorter customer-requested lead-times, and we expect this trend to continue. The amount of backlog at any date depends upon various factors, including the timing of the receipt of orders, fluctuations in orders of existing product lines, and the introduction of any new lines. Accordingly, we believe that the amount of our backlog at any date is not an accurate measure of our future sales. We strive to maintain proper inventory levels to support our customers&#8217; just-in-time order expectations. Our backlog of orders, based on expected ship date, was $122 million at December 31, 2015 and $130 million at December 31, 2014.

PATENTS, TRADEMARKS AND LICENSES 

Historically, patents and trademarks have not been material to our operations, but we expect them to become more important, particularly as they relate to our miniature and power efficient packaging technologies. 

Our initial product patent portfolio was primarily composed of discrete technologies. In the late 1990s, our engineers began to research and develop innovative packaging technologies, which produced several important breakthroughs and patents, such as the PowerDI &#174; series of packaging technology to foster our growth in the semiconductor industry. 

We acquired Anachip Corp., a fabless semiconductor company, in 2006, which initiated our presence in the analog product market with a portfolio of standard linear and low dropout regulator products, among others. 

Through our acquisition of the assets of APD Semiconductor, Inc. in 2006, we acquired the SBR&#174; patents and trademark. SBR&#174; is a state-of-the-art integrated circuit wafer processing technology, which is able to integrate and improve the benefits of the two existing rectifier technologies into a single device. The creation of a finite conduction cellular IC, combined with inherent design uniformity, has allowed manufacturing costs to be kept competitive with the existing power device technology, and thus has produced a breakthrough in rectifier technology. 

PowerDI and SBR are registered trademarks of Diodes Incorporated 

In 2008, we acquired Zetex, which subsequently increased our available discrete and analog technologies with patents and trademarks for bipolar transistors and power management products such as LED drivers. LED drivers support a wide range of applications for automotive, safety and security, architecture, and portable lighting and are highly efficient and cost-effective. 

In 2012, we acquired PAM, a provider of advanced analog and high-voltage power ICs. PAM&#8217;s product portfolio includes Class D audio amplifiers, DC-DC converters and LED backlighting drivers, which has strengthened our position as a global provider of high-quality and high-efficiency, space-saving analog products by expanding our product portfolio with innovative &#8220;filter-less&#8221; digital audio amplifiers, application-specific power management ICs, as well as high-performance LED drivers and DC-DC converters. 

In 2013, we acquired BCD, a leading supplier of standard linear and power management devices. BCD has a product portfolio that includes AC/DC and DC/DC solutions for chargers and power adapters. BCD&#8217;s established presence in Asia, with a particularly strong local market position in China, offers us even greater participation into the consumer electronics, computing and communications end-markets. 

In 2015, we acquired Pericom. Pericom designs, develops and markets high-performance ICs and FCPs used in many of today&#8217;s advanced electronic systems. ICs include functions that support the connectivity, timing and signal conditioning of high-speed parallel and serial protocols that transfer data among a system&#8217;s microprocessor, memory and various peripherals, such as displays and monitors, and between interconnected systems. FCPs are electronic components that provide frequency references such as crystals and oscillators for computer, communication and consumer electronic products. Pericom&#8217;s analog, digital and mixed-signal ICs, together with our FCPs enable higher system bandwidth and signal quality, resulting in better operating reliability and signal integrity, and lower overall system cost in applications such as notebook computers, servers, network switches and routers, storage area networks, digital TVs, cell phones, GPS and digital media players.

COMPETITION 

Numerous semiconductor manufacturers and distributors serve the discrete, logic and analog semiconductor components market, making competition intense. Some of our larger competitors include Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation, Infineon Technologies A.G., NXP Semiconductors N.V., ON Semiconductor Corporation, Rohm Electronics USA, LLC, Toshiba Corporation and Vishay Intertechnology, Inc., many of which have greater financial, marketing, distribution, brand name recognition, research and development, manufacturing and other resources. Accordingly, we from time to time may reposition product lines or decrease prices, which may affect our sales of, and profit margins on, such product lines. The price, features, availability and quality of the products, and our ability to design products and deliver customer service in keeping with the customers&#8217; needs, determine the competitiveness of our products. We believe that our product focus, packaging expertise and our flexibility and ability to quickly adapt to customer needs affords us competitive advantages. See &#8220;Risk Factors &#8211; The semiconductor business is highly competitive, and increased competition may harm our business, operating results and financial condition.&#8221; in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report for additional information. 

ENGINEERING AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 

Our engineering and research and development groups consist of applications, circuit design, and product development engineers who assist in determining the direction of our future product lines. One of their key functions is to work closely with market-leading customers to further refine, expand and improve our product portfolio within our target product types and packages. In addition, customer requirements and acceptance of new package types are assessed and new, higher-density and more energy-efficient packages are developed to satisfy customers&#8217; needs. 

Product development engineers work directly with our semiconductor circuit design and layout engineers to develop and design products that match our customers&#8217; requirements. We have the capability to capture the customers&#8217; electrical and packaging requirements and translate those requirements into product specifications which can then be designed and manufactured to support customers&#8217; end-system applications. 

For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, our investment in research and development activities was approximately $57 million, $52 million and $48 million, respectively, or approximately 7%, 6% and 6%, respectively, of net sales. 

EMPLOYEES 

As of December 31, 2015, we employed 7,695 employees (including approximately 1,000 temporary labor or independent contractors). 6,674 of our employees were in Asia, 558 were in the U.S. and 463 were in Europe. None of our employees in Asia or the U.S. are subject to a collective bargaining agreement, but a majority of our employees in Europe is covered by local labor agreements. We consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory. See &#8220;Risk Factors &#8211; We may fail to attract or retain the qualified technical, sales, marketing, finance and management/executive personnel required to operate our business successfully, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.&#8221; in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report for additional information.
