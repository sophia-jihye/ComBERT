 Item 1. Business As used in this report, the terms &#147;we,&#148; &#147;us,&#148; &#147;our,&#148; &#147;GEO&#148; and the &#147;Company&#148; refer to The GEO Group, Inc., its consolidated subsidiaries and its unconsolidated affiliates, unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires. 

General 

We are a fully-integrated real estate investment trust (&#147;REIT&#148;) specializing in the ownership, leasing and management of correctional, detention and re-entry facilities and the provision of community-based services and youth services in the United States, Australia, South Africa and the United Kingdom. We own, lease and operate a broad range of correctional and detention facilities including maximum, medium and minimum security prisons, immigration detention centers, minimum security detention centers, as well as community based re-entry facilities. We develop new facilities based on contract awards, using our project development expertise and experience to design, construct and finance what we believe are state-of-the-art facilities that maximize security and efficiency. We provide innovative compliance technologies, industry-leading monitoring services, and evidence-based supervision and treatment programs for community-based parolees, probationers and pretrial defendants. We also provide secure transportation services for offender and detainee populations as contracted domestically and in the United Kingdom through our joint venture GEO Amey PECS Ltd. (&#147;GEOAmey&#148;). As of December 31, 2015, our worldwide operations included the management and/or ownership of approximately 87,000 beds at 104 correctional, detention and community based facilities, including idle facilities and projects under development, and also include the provision of community supervision services for more than 139,000 offenders and pre-trial defendants, including approximately 89,000 individuals through an array of technology products including radio frequency, GPS, and alcohol monitoring devices. 

We provide a diversified scope of services on behalf of our government clients: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; our correctional and detention management services involve the provision of security, administrative, rehabilitation, education, and food services, primarily at adult male correctional and detention facilities; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; our community-based services involve supervision of adult parolees and probationers and the provision of temporary housing, programming, employment assistance and other services with the intention of the successful reintegration of residents into the community; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; our youth services include residential, detention and shelter care and community-based services along with rehabilitative and educational programs; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; we provide comprehensive electronic monitoring and supervision services; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; we develop new facilities, using our project development experience to design, construct and finance what we believe are state-of-the-art facilities that maximize security and efficiency; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; we provide secure transportation services for offender and detainee populations as contracted; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; our services are provided at facilities which we either own, lease or are owned by our customers. 

We began operating as a REIT for federal income tax purposes effective January 1, 2013. As a result of the REIT conversion, we reorganized our operations and moved non-real estate components into taxable REIT subsidiaries (&#147;TRS&#148;). We are a Florida corporation and our predecessor corporation prior to the REIT conversion was originally organized in 1984. 

&#160; 

Business Segments 

We conduct our business through four reportable business segments: our U.S. Corrections &#38; Detention segment; our GEO Care segment; our International Services segment and our Facility Construction &#38; Design segment. We have identified these four reportable segments to reflect our current view that we operate four distinct business lines, each of which constitutes a material part of our overall business. Our U.S. Corrections &#38; Detention segment primarily encompasses our U.S.-based privatized corrections and detention business. Our GEO Care segment, which conducts its services in the U.S., consists of our community based services business, our youth services business and our electronic monitoring and supervision service. Our International Services segment primarily consists of our privatized corrections and detention operations in South Africa, Australia, and the United Kingdom. Our Facility Construction &#38; Design segment primarily contracts with various states, local and federal agencies, as well as international agencies, for the design and construction of facilities for which we generally have been, or expect to be, awarded management contracts. Financial information about these segments for years 2015, 2014 and 2013 is contained in Note 17 &#151; Business Segments and Geographic Information included in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K. 

Recent Developments 

Contract awards and facility activations 

The following contract awards and facility activations occurred during 2015: 

On January 28, 2015, we announced that we signed a contract for the reactivation of our company-owned, 400-bed Mesa Verde Detention Facility in California. The facility will house immigration detainees under an intergovernmental service agreement between the City of McFarland and U.S. Immigration Customs and Enforcement (&#147;ICE&#148;). 

On February 18, 2015, we announced the closing of our previously announced acquisition of the LCS Facilities (as defined below) totaling more than 6,500 beds from LCS. Refer to Note 2 &#151; Business Combinations in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K for further discussion. 

On April 27, 2015, we announced that our wholly-owned subsidiary, The GEO Group Australia Pty. Ltd (&#147;GEO Australia&#148;) signed a contract with the Department of Justice and Regulation in the State of Victoria, Australia for the continued management and operation of the Fulham Correctional Centre and the Fulham Nalu Challenge Community Unit (the &#147;Centre&#148;). The Centre has a contract capacity of 947 beds with a further increase in planned capacity under construction. 

On April 28, 2015, we announced that we had begun to mobilize our company-owned, 1,748-bed North Lake Correctional Facility located in Baldwin, Michigan. The decision to mobilize North Lake Correctional Facility was made as a result of the current demand for out-of-state correctional bed space. 

On May 20, 2015, we announced that we signed a contract with the Vermont Department of Corrections for the out-of-state housing of up to 675 inmates at our company-owned North Lake Correctional Facility in Baldwin, Michigan. 

On May 21, 2015, we announced that we signed a contract with the Washington Department of Corrections for the out-of-state housing of up to 1,000 inmates at our company-owned North Lake Correctional Facility in Baldwin, Michigan. 

On July 6, 2015, we announced the activation of three company-owned facilities totaling 4,320 beds in Oklahoma, Michigan, and California. On October 1, 2015, we announced the signing of a new contract with ICE 

&#160; 

for the continued management of our company-owned, 1,575-bed Northwest Detention Center (the &#147;Center&#148;) in Tacoma, Washington. The contract for the continued management of the Center will have a term of nine years and six months inclusive of renewal options. 

In September 2015, our GEO Care division was awarded a five-year contract for the provision of community-based case management services under a new pilot program by the Department of Homeland Security for families going through the immigration review process. 

On October 28, 2015, we announced that we will assume management of the 3,400-bed Arizona State Prison-Kingman in Kingman, Arizona on December 1, 2015 under a managed-only contract with the Arizona Department of Corrections effective through February 2023. The facility currently houses approximately 1,700 inmates and is expected to ramp up through end of the first quarter of 2016. 

Business Combinations 

On February 17, 2015, we acquired eight correctional and detention facilities (the &#147;LCS Facilities&#148;) totaling more than 6,500 beds from LCS Corrections Services, Inc., a privately-held owner and operator of correctional and detention facilities in the United States, and its affiliates (collectively, &#147;LCS&#148;) for cash consideration of $307.4 million. Refer to Note 2 Business Combinations included in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K. 

On May 18, 2015, our wholly-owned subsidiary, B.I. Incorporated (&#147;BI&#148;) acquired 100% of the outstanding common stock of Soberlink, Inc. (&#147;Soberlink&#148;) for cash consideration of $24.4 million. Soberlink is a leading developer and distributor of mobile alcohol monitoring devices and services. Refer to Note 2 &#151; Business Combinations included in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K. 

Idle Facilities 

We are currently marketing approximately 3,300 vacant beds at four of our idle facilities to potential customers. The annual carrying cost of idle facilities in 2016 is estimated to be $12.7 million, including depreciation expense of $1.5 million. As of December 31, 2015, these facilities had a net book value of $35.2 million. We currently do not have any firm commitment or agreement in place to activate these facilities. These idle facilities are included in the U.S. Corrections &#38; Detention segment. The per diem rates that we charge our clients often vary by contract across our portfolio. However, if all of these idle facilities were to be activated using our U.S. Corrections &#38; Detention average per diem rate in 2015, (calculated as the U.S. Corrections &#38; Detention revenue divided by the number of U.S. Corrections &#38; Detention mandays) and based on the average occupancy rate in our U.S. Corrections &#38; Detention facilities for 2015, we would expect to receive incremental revenue of approximately $70 million and an increase in earnings per share of approximately $.20 to $.25 per share based on our average U.S. Corrections and Detention operating margin. 

Quality of Operations 

We operate each facility in accordance with our company-wide policies and procedures and with the standards and guidelines required under the relevant management contract. For many facilities, the standards and guidelines include those established by the American Correctional Association, or (&#147;ACA&#148;). The ACA is an independent organization of corrections professionals, which establishes correctional facility standards and guidelines that are generally acknowledged as a benchmark by governmental agencies responsible for correctional facilities. Many of our contracts in the United States require us to seek and maintain ACA accreditation of the facility. We have sought and received ACA accreditation and re-accreditation for all such facilities. We achieved a median re-accreditation score of 99.8% as of December 31, 2015. Approximately 79.5% of our 2015 U.S. Corrections &#38; Detention revenue was derived from ACA accredited facilities for the year ended 

&#160; 

December 31, 2015. We have also achieved and maintained accreditation by The Joint Commission at four of our correctional facilities and at nine of our youth services locations. We have been successful in achieving and maintaining accreditation under the National Commission on Correctional Health Care, or (&#147;NCCHC&#148;), in a majority of the facilities that we currently operate. The NCCHC accreditation is a voluntary process which we have used to establish comprehensive health care policies and procedures to meet and adhere to the ACA standards. The NCCHC standards, in most cases, exceed ACA Health Care Standards and we have achieved this accreditation at nine of our U.S. Corrections &#38; Detention facilities and at two youth services locations. Additionally, BI has achieved a certification for ISO 9001:2008 for the design, production, installation and servicing of products and services produced by the electronic monitoring business units, including electronic home arrest and electronic monitoring technology products and monitoring services, installation services, and automated caseload management services. 

Business Development Overview 

We intend to pursue a diversified growth strategy by winning new clients and contracts, expanding our real estate and government services portfolio and pursuing selective acquisition opportunities. Our primary potential customers include: governmental agencies responsible for local, state and federal correctional facilities in the United States; governmental agencies responsible for correctional facilities in Australia, South Africa and the United Kingdom; federal, state and local government agencies in the United States responsible for community-based services for adult and juvenile offenders; federal, state and local government agencies responsible for monitoring community-based parolees, probationers and pretrial defendants; and other foreign governmental agencies. We achieve organic growth through competitive bidding that begins with the issuance by a government agency of a request for proposal, or RFP. We primarily rely on the RFP process for organic growth in our U.S. and international corrections operations as well as in our community based re-entry services and electronic monitoring services business. 

For our facility management contracts, our state and local experience has been that a period of approximately 60 to 90 days is generally required from the issuance of a request for proposal to the submission of our response to the request for proposal; that between one and four months elapse between the submission of our response and the agency&#146;s award for a contract; and that between one and four months elapse between the award of a contract and the commencement of facility construction or management of the facility, as applicable. 

For our facility management contracts, our federal experience has been that a period of approximately 60 to 90 days is generally required from the issuance of a request for proposal to the submission of our response to the request for proposal; that between 12 and 18 months elapse between the submission of our response and the agency&#146;s award for a contract; and that between four and 18 weeks elapse between the award of a contract and the commencement of facility construction or management of the facility, as applicable. 

If the local, state or federal facility for which an award has been made must be constructed, our experience is that construction usually takes between nine and twenty-four months to complete, depending on the size and complexity of the project. Therefore, management of a newly constructed facility typically commences between ten and twenty-eight months after the governmental agency&#146;s award. 

For the services provided by BI, local, state and federal experience has been that a period of approximately 30 to 90 days is generally required from the issuance of an RFP or Invitation to Bid, or ITB, to the submission of our response; that between one and three months elapse between the submission of our response and the agency&#146;s award for a contract; and that between one and three months elapse between the award of a contract and the commencement of a program or the implementation of program operations, as applicable. 

The term of our local, state and federal contracts range from one to five years and some contracts include provisions for optional renewal years beyond the initial contract term. Contracts can, and are periodically, extended beyond the contract term and optional renewal years through alternative procurement processes including sole source justification processes, cooperative procurement vehicles and agency decisions to add extension time periods. 

&#160; 

We believe that our long operating history and reputation have earned us credibility with both existing and prospective customers when bidding on new facility management contracts or when renewing existing contracts. Our success in the RFP process has resulted in a pipeline of new projects with significant revenue potential. 

During 2015, we entered into seven new or expansion projects representing an aggregate of 8,681 additional beds compared to eight new or expansion projects representing an aggregate of 7,720 beds during 2014. 

In addition to pursuing organic growth through the RFP process, we will from time to time selectively consider the financing and construction of new facilities or expansions to existing facilities on a speculative basis without having a signed contract with a known customer. We also plan to leverage our experience and scale of service offerings to expand the range of government-outsourced services that we provide. We will continue to pursue real-estate opportunities and selected acquisition opportunities in our core services and other government services areas that meet our criteria for growth and profitability. We have engaged and intend in the future to engage independent consultants to assist us in developing privatization opportunities and in responding to requests for proposals, monitoring the legislative and business climate, and maintaining relationships with existing customers. 

Facility Design, Construction and Finance 

We offer governmental agencies consultation and management services relating to the design and construction of new correctional and detention facilities and the redesign and renovation of older facilities including facilities we own, lease or manage as well as facilities we do not own, lease or manage. Domestically, as of December 31, 2015, we have provided services for the design and construction of approximately 53 facilities and for the redesign, renovation and expansion of approximately 49 facilities. Internationally, as of December 31, 2015, we have provided services for the design and construction of 11 facilities and for the redesign, renovation and expansion of one facility. 

Contracts to design and construct or to redesign and renovate facilities may be financed in a variety of ways. Governmental agencies may finance the construction of such facilities through any of the following methods: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; a one time general revenue appropriation by the governmental agency for the cost of the new facility; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; general obligation bonds that are secured by either a limited or unlimited tax levy by the issuing governmental entity; or 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; revenue bonds or certificates of participation secured by an annual lease payment that is subject to annual or bi-annual legislative appropriations. 

We may also act as a source of financing or as a facilitator with respect to the financing of the construction of a facility. In these cases, the construction of such facilities may be financed through various methods including the following: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; funds from equity offerings of our stock; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; cash on hand and/or cash flows from our operations; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; borrowings by us from banks or other institutions (which may or may not be subject to government guarantees in the event of contract termination); 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; funds from debt offerings of our notes; or 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; lease arrangements with third parties. 

If the project is financed using direct governmental appropriations, with proceeds of the sale of bonds or other obligations issued prior to the award of the project, then financing is in place when the contract relating to the construction or renovation project is executed. If the project is financed using project-specific tax-exempt bonds or other obligations, the construction contract is generally subject to the sale of such bonds or obligations. Generally, substantial expenditures for construction will not be made on such a project until the tax-exempt bonds or other obligations are sold; and, if such bonds or obligations are not sold, construction and therefore, 

&#160; 

management of the facility, may either be delayed until alternative financing is procured or the development of the project will be suspended or entirely canceled. If the project is self-financed by us, then financing is generally in place prior to the commencement of construction. 

Under our construction and design management contracts, we generally agree to be responsible for overall project development and completion. We typically act as the primary developer on construction contracts for facilities and subcontract with bonded National and/or Regional Design Build Contractors. Where possible, we subcontract with construction companies that we have worked with previously. We make use of an in-house staff of architects and operational experts from various correctional disciplines (e.g. security, medical service, food service, inmate programs and facility maintenance) as part of the team that participates from conceptual design through final construction of the project. This staff coordinates all aspects of the development with subcontractors and provides site-specific services. 

When designing a facility, our architects use, with appropriate modifications, prototype designs we have used in developing prior projects. We believe that the use of these designs allows us to reduce the potential of cost overruns and construction delays and to reduce the number of correctional officers required to provide security at a facility, thus controlling costs both to construct and to manage the facility. Our facility designs also maintain security because they increase the area under direct surveillance by correctional officers and make use of additional electronic surveillance. 

The following table sets forth our current expansion and development project and its stage of completion for the Company&#146;s facilities:

Leading Corrections Provider Uniquely Positioned to Offer a Continuum of Care 

We are the second largest provider of privatized correctional and detention facilities worldwide and the largest provider of community-based re-entry services, youth services and electronic monitoring services in the U.S. corrections industry. We believe these leading market positions and our diverse and complementary service offerings enable us to meet the growing demand from our clients for comprehensive services throughout the entire corrections lifecycle. Our continuum of care enables us to provide consistency and continuity in case management, which we believe results in a higher quality of care for offenders, reduces recidivism, lowers overall costs for our clients, improves public safety and facilitates successful reintegration of offenders back into society. In 2015, we made a commitment to fund up to an additional $5 million dollar annual investment to expand our continuum of care platform of programs. 

Attractive REIT Profile 

Key characteristics of our business make us a highly attractive REIT. We are in a real estate intensive industry. Since our inception, we have financed and developed dozens of facilities. We have a diversified set of investment grade customers in the form of government agencies which are required to pay us on time by law. We have historically experienced customer retention in excess of 90%. Our strong and predictable occupancy rates generate a stable and sustainable stream of revenue. This stream of revenue combined with our low maintenance capital expenditure requirement translates into steady predictable cash flow. The REIT structure also allows us to pursue growth opportunities due to the capital intensive nature of corrections/detention business. 

&#160; 

Large Scale Operator with National Presence 

We operate the sixth largest correctional system in the U.S. by number of beds, including the federal government and all 50 states. We currently have correctional operations in approximately 33 states and offer electronic monitoring services in every state. In addition, we have extensive experience in overall facility operations, including staff recruitment, administration, facility maintenance, food service, security, and in the supervision, treatment and education of inmates. We believe our size and breadth of service offerings enable us to generate economies of scale which maximize our efficiencies and allows us to pass along cost savings to our clients. Our national presence also positions us to bid on and develop new facilities across the U.S. 

Long-Term Relationships with High-Quality Government Customers 

We have developed long-term relationships with our federal, state and other governmental customers, which we believe enhance our ability to win new contracts and retain existing business. We have provided correctional and detention management services to the United States Federal Government for 29 years, the State of California for 28 years, the State of Texas for approximately 28 years, various Australian state government entities for 24 years and the State of Florida for approximately 22 years. These customers accounted for approximately 68.2% of our consolidated revenues for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. 

Recurring Revenue with Strong Cash Flow 

Our revenue base is derived from our long-term customer relationships, with contract renewal rates and facility occupancy rates both approximating 90% over the past five years. We have been able to expand our revenue base by continuing to reinvest our strong operating cash flow into expansionary projects and through strategic acquisitions that provide scale and further enhance our service offerings. Our consolidated revenues have grown from $877.0 million in 2007 to $1.8 billion in 2015. We expect our operating cash flow to be well in excess of our anticipated annual maintenance capital expenditure needs, which would provide us significant flexibility for growth in capital expenditures, future dividend payments in connection with operating as a REIT, acquisitions and/or the repayment of indebtedness. 

Sizeable International Busines 

Our international infrastructure, which leverages our operational excellence in the U.S., allows us to aggressively target foreign opportunities that our U.S. based competitors without overseas operations may have difficulty pursuing. We currently have international operations in Australia, South Africa and the United Kingdom. Our international services business generated approximately $262 million of revenues, representing approximately 14% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015. Included in our international revenues are construction revenues related to our prison project in Ravenhall, Australia which are presented in our Facility Design &#38; Construction segment. We believe we are well positioned to continue benefiting from foreign governments&#146; initiatives to outsource correctional services. 

Experienced, Proven Senior Management Team 

Our Chief Executive Officer and the founder, George C. Zoley, Ph.D., has led our Company for 31 years and has established a track record of growth and profitability. Under his leadership, our annual consolidated revenues from continuing operations have grown from $40.0 million in 1991 to $1.8 billion in 2015. Mr. Zoley is one of the pioneers of the industry, having developed and opened what we believe to be one of the first privatized detention facilities in the U.S. in 1986. Our Chief Financial Officer, Brian R. Evans, has been with our Company for over 15 years and has led our conversion to a REIT as well as the integration of our recent acquisitions and financing activities. Our top seven senior executives have an average tenure with our Company of over 11 years. 

&#160; 

Business Strategies 

Provide High Quality, Comprehensive Services and Cost Savings Throughout the Corrections Lifecycle 

Our objective is to provide federal, state and local governmental agencies with a comprehensive offering of high quality, essential services at a lower cost than they themselves could achieve. We believe government agencies facing budgetary constraints will increasingly seek to outsource a greater proportion of their correctional needs to reliable providers that can enhance quality of service at a reduced cost. We believe our expanded and diversified facility and service offerings uniquely position us to bundle our high quality facility services and provide a comprehensive continuum of care for our clients, which we believe will lead to lower cost outcomes for our clients and larger scale business opportunities for us. 

Maintain Disciplined Operating Approach 

We refrain from pursuing contracts that we do not believe will yield attractive profit margins in relation to the associated operational risks. In addition, although we engage in facility development from time to time without having a corresponding management contract award in place, we endeavor to do so only where we have determined that there is medium to long-term client demand for a facility in that geographical area. We have also elected not to enter certain international markets with a history of economic and political instability. We believe that our strategy of emphasizing lower risk and higher profit opportunities helps us to consistently deliver strong operational performance, lower our costs and increase our overall profitability. 

Pursue International Growth Opportunities 

As a global provider of privatized correctional services, we are able to capitalize on opportunities to operate existing or new facilities on behalf of foreign governments. We have seen increased business development opportunities including opportunities to cross sell our expanded service offerings in recent years in the international markets in which we operate and are currently exploring opportunities for several new projects. We will continue to actively bid on new international projects in our current markets and in new markets that fit our target profile for profitability and operational risk. 

Selectively Pursue Acquisition Opportunities 

We intend to continue to supplement our organic growth by selectively identifying, acquiring and integrating businesses that fit our strategic objectives and enhance our geographic platform and service offerings. Since 2005, and including the acquisitions of Protocol Criminal Justice, Inc. (&#147;Protocol&#148;), Soberlink and the LCS Facilities, we have completed nine acquisitions for total consideration, including debt assumed, in excess of $1.7 billion. Our management team utilizes a disciplined approach to analyze and evaluate acquisition opportunities, which we believe has contributed to our success in completing and integrating our acquisitions.

(1) Capacity as used in the table refers to operational capacity consisting of total beds for all facilities except for the seven Non-residential service centers under Youth Services for which we have provided service capacity which represents the number of juveniles that can be serviced daily. (2) For Youth Services Non-Residential Service Centers, the contract commencement date represents either the program start date or the date that the facility operations were acquired by our subsidiary. The service agreements under these arrangements provide for services on an as-contracted basis and there are no guaranteed minimum populations or management contracts with specified renewal dates. These arrangements are more perpetual in nature. For acquired operations, the commencement date is the original date of contract. (3) GEO provides services at these facilities through various Inter-Governmental Agreements, or IGAs, through the various counties and other jurisdictions. (4) The contract for this facility only requires GEO to provide maintenance services. (5) The Colorado Day Reporting Centers provide many of the same services as the full service Day Reporting Centers, but rather than providing these services through comprehensive treatment plans dictated by the governing authority, these services are provided on a fee for service basis. Such services may be connected to government agency contracts and would be reimbursed by those agencies. Other services are offered directly to offenders allowing them to meet court-ordered requirements and paid by the offender as the service is provided. &#160; 

Government Contracts &#151; Terminations, Renewals and Competitive Re-bids 

Generally, we may lose our facility management contracts due to one of three reasons: the termination by a government customer with or without cause at any time; the failure by a customer to renew a contract with us upon the expiration of the then current term; or our failure to win the right to continue to operate under a contract that has been competitively re-bid in a procurement process upon its termination or expiration. Our facility management contracts typically allow a contracting governmental agency to terminate a contract with or without cause at any time by giving us written notice ranging from 30 to 180 days. If government agencies were to use these provisions to terminate, or renegotiate the terms of their agreements with us, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. See &#147;Risk Factors &#151; &#147;We are subject to the loss of our facility management contracts, due to terminations, non-renewals or competitive re-bids, which could adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity, including our ability to secure new facility management contracts from other government customers&#148;. 

Aside from our customers&#146; unilateral right to terminate our facility management contracts with them at any time for any reason, there are two points during the typical lifecycle of a contract which may result in the loss by us of a facility management contract with our customers. We refer to these points as contract &#147;renewals&#148; and contract &#147;re-bids.&#148; Many of our facility management contracts with our government customers have an initial fixed term and subsequent renewal rights for one or more additional periods at the unilateral option of the customer. Because most of our contracts for youth services do not guarantee placement or revenue, we have not considered these contracts to ever be in the renewal or re-bid stage since they are more perpetual in nature. As such, the contracts for youth services are not considered as renewals or re-bids nor are they included in the table below. We count each government customer&#146;s right to renew a particular facility management contract for an additional period as a separate &#147;renewal.&#148; For example, a five-year initial fixed term contract with customer options to renew for five separate additional one-year periods would, if fully exercised, be counted as five separate renewals, with one renewal coming in each of the five years following the initial term. As of December 31, 2015, 36 of our facility management contracts representing approximately 25,000 beds are scheduled to expire on or before December 31, 2016, unless renewed by the customer at its sole option in certain cases, or unless renewed by mutual agreement in other cases. These contracts represented 29.3% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015. We undertake substantial efforts to renew our facility management contracts. Our average historical facility management contract renewal approximates 90%. However, given their unilateral nature, we cannot assure you that our customers will in fact exercise their renewal options under existing contracts. In addition, in connection with contract renewals, either we or the contracting government agency have typically requested changes or adjustments to contractual terms. As a result, contract renewals may be made on terms that are more or less favorable to us than those in existence prior to the renewals. 

We define competitive re-bids as contracts currently under our management which we believe, based on our experience with the customer and the facility involved, will be re-bid to us and other potential service providers in a competitive procurement process upon the expiration or termination of our contract, assuming all renewal options are exercised. Our determination of which contracts we believe will be competitively re-bid may in some cases be subjective and judgmental, based largely on our knowledge of the dynamics involving a particular contract, the customer and the facility involved. Competitive re-bids may result from the expiration of the term of a contract, including the initial fixed term plus any renewal periods, or the early termination of a contract by a customer. Competitive re-bids are often required by applicable federal or state procurement laws periodically in order to encourage competitive pricing and other terms for the government customer. Potential bidders in competitive re-bid situations include us, other private operators and other government entities. While we are pleased with our historical win rate on competitive re-bids and are committed to continuing to bid competitively on appropriate future competitive re-bid opportunities, we cannot in fact assure you that we will prevail in future competitive re-bid situations. Also, we cannot assure you that any competitive re-bids we win will be on terms more favorable to us than those in existence with respect to the expiring contract. 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, eight of our facility management contracts representing 8.7% and $160.0 million of our 2015 consolidated revenues are subject to competitive re-bid in 2016. The following table sets forth the number of facility management contracts that we currently believe will be subject to competitive re-bid in each of the next five years and thereafter, and the total number of beds relating to those potential competitive re-bid situations during each period:

&#160; Competition 

We compete primarily on the basis of the quality of facility and range of services we offer; our experience domestically and internationally in the design, construction, and management of privatized correctional and detention facilities; our reputation; and our pricing. We compete directly with the public sector, where governmental agencies responsible for the operation of correctional, detention, youth services, community based services and re-entry facilities are often seeking to retain projects that might otherwise be privatized. In the private sector, our U.S. Corrections &#38; Detention and International Services business segments compete with a number of companies, including, but not limited to: Corrections Corporation of America; Management and Training Corporation; Emerald Companies; Community Education Centers; LaSalle Southwest Corrections; Group 4 Securicor; Sodexo Justice Services (formerly Kaylx); and Serco. Our GEO Care business segment competes with a number of different small-to-medium sized companies, reflecting the highly fragmented nature of the youth services and community based services industry. BI&#146;s electronic monitoring business competes with a number of companies, including, but not limited to: G4 Justice Services, LLC; Elmo-Tech, a 3M Company; and Pro-Tech, a 3M Company. Some of our competitors are larger and have more resources than we do. We also compete in some markets with small local companies that may have a better knowledge of the local conditions and may be better able to gain political and public acceptance. 

Employees and Employee Training 

At December 31, 2015, we had 15,806 full-time employees. Of our full-time employees, 483 were employed at our corporate headquarters and regional offices and 15,323 were employed at facilities and international offices. We employ personnel in positions of management, administrative and clerical, security, educational services, human services, health services and general maintenance at our various locations. Approximately 3,260 and 1,590 employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements in the United States and at international offices, respectively. We believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory. 

Under the laws applicable to most of our operations, and internal company policies, our correctional officers are required to complete a minimum amount of training. We generally require at least 40 hours of pre-service training before an employee is allowed to assume their duties plus an additional 120 hours of training during their first year of employment in our domestic facilities, consistent with ACA standards and/or applicable state laws. In addition to the usual 160 hours of training in the first year, most states require 40 or 80 hours of on-the-job training. Florida law requires that correctional officers receive 520 hours of training. We believe that our training programs meet or exceed all applicable requirements. 

Our training program for domestic facilities typically begins with approximately 40 hours of instruction regarding our policies, operational procedures and management philosophy. Training continues with an additional 120 hours of instruction covering legal issues, rights of inmates, techniques of communication and 

&#160; 

supervision, interpersonal skills and job training relating to the particular position to be held. Each of our employees who has contact with inmates receives a minimum of 40 hours of additional training each year, and each manager receives at least 24 hours of training each year. 

At least 160 hours of training are required for our employees in Australia and South Africa before such employees are allowed to work in positions that will bring them into contact with inmates. Our employees in Australia and South Africa receive a minimum of 40 hours of refresher training each year. In the United Kingdom, our corrections employees also receive a minimum of 240 hours of training prior to coming in contact with inmates and receive additional training of approximately 25 hours annually. 

With respect to BI and the Intensive Supervision and Appearance Program (&#147;ISAP&#148;) services contract, new employees are required to complete training requirements as outlined in the contract within 14 days of hire and prior to being assigned autonomous ISAP related duties. These employees receive 25 hours of refresher training annually thereafter. Program managers for our ISAP contract must receive 24 hours of additional initial training. BI&#146;s monitoring services maintains its own comprehensive certification and training program for all monitoring service specialists. We require all new personnel hired for a position in monitoring operations to complete a seven-week training program. Successful completion of our training program and a final certification is required of all of our personnel performing monitoring operations. We require that certification is achieved prior to being permitted to work independently in the call center. 

Business Regulations and Legal Considerations 

Many governmental agencies are required to enter into a competitive bidding procedure before awarding contracts for products or services. The laws of certain jurisdictions may also require us to award subcontracts on a competitive basis or to subcontract or partner with businesses owned by women or members of minority groups. 

Certain states, such as Florida, deem correctional officers to be peace officers and require our personnel to be licensed and subject to background investigation. State law also typically requires correctional officers to meet certain training standards. 

The failure to comply with any applicable laws, rules or regulations or the loss of any required license could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, our current and future operations may be subject to additional regulations as a result of, among other factors, new statutes and regulations and changes in the manner in which existing statutes and regulations are or may be interpreted or applied. Any such additional regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Insurance 

The nature of our business exposes us to various types of third-party legal claims, including, but not limited to, civil rights claims relating to conditions of confinement and/or mistreatment, sexual misconduct claims brought by prisoners or detainees, medical malpractice claims, product liability claims, intellectual property infringement claims, claims relating to employment matters (including, but not limited to, employment discrimination claims, union grievances and wage and hour claims), property loss claims, environmental claims, automobile liability claims, contractual claims and claims for personal injury or other damages resulting from contact with our facilities, programs, electronic monitoring products, personnel or prisoners, including damages arising from a prisoner&#146;s escape or from a disturbance or riot at a facility. In addition, our management contracts generally require us to indemnify the governmental agency against any damages to which the governmental agency may be subject in connection with such claims or litigation. We maintain a broad program of insurance coverage for these general types of claims, except for claims relating to employment matters, for which we carry no insurance. There can be no assurance that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover all claims to which we may be exposed. It is our general practice to bring merged or acquired companies into our corporate master policies in order to take advantage of certain economies of scale. 

&#160; 

We currently maintain a general liability policy and excess liability policies with total limits of $77.0 million per occurrence and in the aggregate covering the operations of U.S. Corrections &#38; Detention, GEO Care&#146;s community based services, GEO Care&#146;s youth services and BI. We have a claims-made liability insurance program with a specific loss limit of $35.0 million per occurrence and in the aggregate related to medical professional liability claims arising out of correctional healthcare services. We are uninsured for any claims in excess of these limits. We also maintain insurance to cover property and other casualty risks including, workers&#146; compensation, environmental liability and automobile liability. 

For most casualty insurance policies, we carry substantial deductibles or self-insured retentions of $3.0 million per occurrence for general liability and medical professional liability, $2.0 million per occurrence for workers&#146; compensation and $1.0 million per occurrence for automobile liability. In addition, certain of our facilities located in Florida and other high-risk hurricane areas carry substantial windstorm deductibles. Since hurricanes are considered unpredictable future events, no reserves have been established to pre-fund for potential windstorm damage. Limited commercial availability of certain types of insurance relating to windstorm exposure in coastal areas and earthquake exposure mainly in California and the Pacific Northwest may prevent us from insuring some of our facilities to full replacement value. 

With respect to our operations in South Africa, the United Kingdom and Australia, we utilize a combination of locally-procured insurance and global policies to meet contractual insurance requirements and to protect us. In addition to these policies, our Australian subsidiary carries tail insurance on a general liability policy related to a discontinued contract. 

Of the reserves discussed above, our most significant insurance reserves relate to workers&#146; compensation, general liability and auto claims. These reserves are undiscounted and were $52.8 million and $49.5 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively and are included in accrued expenses in the accompanying balance sheets. We use statistical and actuarial methods to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as historical frequency and severity of claims at each of our facilities, claim development, payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services and unpredictability of the size of jury awards. We also may experience variability between our estimates and the actual settlement due to limitations inherent in the estimation process, including our ability to estimate costs of processing and settling claims in a timely manner as well as our ability to accurately estimate our exposure at the onset of a claim. Because we have high deductible insurance policies, the amount of our insurance expense is dependent on our ability to control our claims experience. If actual losses related to insurance claims significantly differ from our estimates, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely impacted. 

International Operations 

Our international operations for fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013 consisted of the operations of our wholly-owned Australian subsidiaries, our wholly owned subsidiary in the United Kingdom, and South African Custodial Management Pty. Limited, our consolidated joint venture in South Africa, which we refer to as SACM. In Australia, our wholly-owned subsidiary, GEO Australia, currently manages four facilities. Additionally, in September 2014, one of our Australian subsidiaries signed the Ravenhall Prison Project Agreement (&#147;Ravenhall Contract&#148;) with the State for the development and operation of a new 1,000-bed facility in Ravenhall, a locality near Melbourne, Australia under a Public-Private Partnership financing structure. The facility will also have the capacity to house 1,300 inmates should the State have the need for additional beds in the future. The design and construction phase of the agreement began in September 2014 with completion expected towards the end of 2017. We operate one facility in South Africa through SACM. Our wholly-owned subsidiary in the United Kingdom, The GEO Group UK Ltd., operates the 217-bed Dungavel House Immigration Removal Centre located near Glasgow, Scotland. See Item 7 for more discussion related to the results of our international operations.
