 Item 1. Business. Summary 

FS Investment Corporation (NYSE: FSIC), or the Company, which may also be referred to as &#147;we,&#148; &#147;us&#148; or &#147;our,&#148; was incorporated under the general corporation laws of the State of Maryland on December 21, 2007 and formally commenced investment operations on January 2, 2009. We are an externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company, or BDC, under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the 1940 Act. As such, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. In addition, we have elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and intend to qualify annually, as a regulated investment company, or RIC, under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. As of December 31, 2015, we had total assets of approximately $4.1 billion. 

We are managed by FB Income Advisor, LLC, or FB Advisor, a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, or the Advisers Act, which oversees the management of our operations and is responsible for making investment decisions with respect to our portfolio. FB Advisor has engaged GSO / Blackstone Debt Funds Management LLC, or GDFM, to act as our investment sub-adviser. GDFM assists FB Advisor in identifying investment opportunities and makes investment recommendations for approval by FB Advisor, according to guidelines set by FB Advisor. GDFM, a registered investment adviser under the Advisers Act, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of GSO Capital Partners LP, or GSO. GSO is the credit platform of The Blackstone Group L.P., or Blackstone, a leading global alternative asset manager and provider of financial advisory services. GSO is one of the world&#146;s largest credit platforms in the alternative asset business with approximately $79.1 billion in assets under management as of December 31, 2015. 

Our investment objectives are to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, long-term capital appreciation. We seek to meet our investment objectives by: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; utilizing the experience and expertise of the management teams of FB Advisor and GDFM, along with the broader resources of GSO, which include its access to the relationships and human capital of its parent, Blackstone, in sourcing, evaluating and structuring transactions; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; employing a defensive investment approach focused on long-term credit performance and principal protection; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; focusing primarily on debt investments in a broad array of private U.S. companies, including middle-market companies, which we define as companies with annual revenue of $50 million to $2.5 billion at the time of investment. In many market environments, we believe such a focus offers an opportunity for superior risk adjusted returns; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; investing primarily in established, stable enterprises with positive cash flows; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; maintaining rigorous portfolio monitoring, in an attempt to anticipate and pre-empt negative credit events within our portfolio. 

Our portfolio is comprised primarily of investments in senior secured loans and second lien secured loans of private middle market U.S. companies and, to a lesser extent, subordinated loans of private U.S. companies. Although we do not expect a significant portion of our portfolio to be comprised of subordinated loans, there is no limit on the amount of such loans in which we may invest. We may purchase interests in loans or make other 

&#160; 

debt investments, including investments in senior secured bonds, through secondary market transactions in the &#147;over-the-counter&#148; market or directly from our target companies as primary market or directly originated investments. In connection with our debt investments, we may on occasion receive equity interests such as warrants or options as additional consideration. We may also purchase or otherwise acquire minority interests in the form of common or preferred equity or equity-related securities, such as rights and warrants that may be converted into or exchanged for common stock or other equity or the cash value of common stock or other equity, in our target companies, generally in conjunction with one of our debt investments or through a co-investment with a financial sponsor, such as an institutional investor or private equity firm. In addition, a portion of our portfolio may be comprised of corporate bonds, collateralized loan obligations, or CLOs, other debt securities and derivatives, including total return swaps and credit default swaps. FB Advisor will seek to tailor our investment focus as market conditions evolve. Depending on market conditions, we may increase or decrease our exposure to less senior portions of the capital structure or otherwise make opportunistic investments. 

The senior secured loans, second lien secured loans and senior secured bonds in which we invest generally have stated terms of three to seven years and subordinated debt investments that we make generally have stated terms of up to ten years, but the expected average life of such securities is generally between three and seven years. However, there is no limit on the maturity or duration of any security in our portfolio. Our debt investments may be rated by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization, or NRSRO, and, in such case, generally will carry a rating below investment grade (rated lower than &#147;Baa3&#148; by Moody&#146;s Investors Service, Inc., or Moody&#146;s, or lower than &#147;BBB-&#148; by Standard &#38; Poor&#146;s Ratings Services, or S&#38;P). We also invest in non-rated debt securities. 

To seek to enhance our returns, we employ leverage as market conditions permit and at the discretion of FB Advisor, but in no event will leverage employed exceed 50% of the value of our assets, as required by the 1940 Act. 

During the year ended December 31, 2015, we made investments in portfolio companies totaling $1,647,620. During the same period, we sold investments for proceeds of $607,368 and received principal repayments of $1,018,152. As of December 31, 2015, our investment portfolio, with a total fair value of $4,029,371 (54% in first lien senior secured loans, 15% in second lien senior secured loans, 6% in senior secured bonds, 11% in subordinated debt, 2% in collateralized securities and 12% in equity/other), consisted of interests in 114 portfolio companies. The portfolio companies that comprised our portfolio as of such date had an average annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, of approximately $113.2 million. As of December 31, 2015, the debt investments in our portfolio were purchased at a weighted average price of 98.3% of par, and our estimated gross portfolio yield (which represents the expected annualized yield to be generated by us on our portfolio based on the composition of our portfolio as of such date), prior to leverage, was 9.8% based upon the amortized cost of our investments. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our total return based on net asset value was 1.63% and our total return based on market value was (0.50)%. 

Our estimated gross portfolio yield may be higher than an investor&#146;s yield on an investment in shares of our common stock. Our estimated gross portfolio yield does not reflect operating expenses that may be incurred by us. In addition, our estimated gross portfolio yield and total return figures disclosed above do not consider the effect of any sales commissions or charges that may be incurred in connection with the sale of shares of our common stock. Our estimated gross portfolio yield and total return based on net asset value do not represent actual investment returns to stockholders. Our estimated gross portfolio yield and total return figures are subject to change and, in the future, may be greater or less than the rates set forth above. See footnotes 6 and 7 to the table included in Note 11 to our audited consolidated financial statements included herein for information regarding the calculation of our total return based on net asset value and total return based on market value, respectively. 

As a BDC, we are subject to certain regulatory restrictions in making our investments. For example, BDCs generally are not permitted to co-invest with certain affiliated entities in transactions originated by the BDC or its 

&#160; 

affiliates in the absence of an exemptive order from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. However, BDCs are permitted to, and may, simultaneously co-invest in transactions where price is the only negotiated point. In an order dated June 4, 2013, the SEC granted exemptive relief permitting us, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, to co-invest in certain privately negotiated investment transactions with certain affiliates of FB Advisor, including FS Energy and Power Fund, FS Investment Corporation II, FS Investment Corporation III, FS Investment Corporation IV and any future BDCs that are advised by FB Advisor or its affiliated investment advisers, or collectively our co-investment affiliates. We believe this relief has and may continue to enhance our ability to further our investment objectives and strategy. We believe this relief may also increase favorable investment opportunities for us, in part, by allowing us to participate in larger investments, together with our co-investment affiliates, than would be available to us if such relief had not been obtained. Because we did not seek exemptive relief to engage in co-investment transactions with GDFM and its affiliates, we are permitted to co-invest with GDFM and its affiliates only in accordance with existing regulatory guidance.

Gross assets shown as of June 30, 2015. Our chairman and chief executive officer, Michael C. Forman, has led FB Advisor since its inception. In 2007, he co-founded Franklin Square Holdings with the goal of delivering alternative investment solutions, advised by what Franklin Square Holdings believes to be best-in-class institutional asset managers, to individual investors nationwide. In addition to leading FB Advisor, Mr. Forman currently serves as chairman, president and chief executive officer of FS Investment Advisor, LLC, FS Energy and Power Fund, FSIC II Advisor, LLC, FS Investment Corporation II, FSIC III Advisor, LLC, FS Investment Corporation III, FSIC IV Advisor, LLC, FS Investment Corporation IV, FS Global Advisor, LLC, FS Global Credit Opportunities Fund and the FSGCOF Offered Funds. 

FB Advisor&#146;s senior management team has significant experience in private lending and private equity investing, and has developed an expertise in using all levels of a firm&#146;s capital structure to produce income-generating investments, while focusing on risk management. The team also has extensive knowledge of the managerial, operational and regulatory requirements of publicly registered alternative asset entities, such as BDCs. We believe that the active and ongoing participation by Franklin Square Holdings and its affiliates in the credit markets, and the depth of experience and disciplined investment approach of FB Advisor&#146;s management team, will allow FB Advisor to successfully execute our investment strategy. 

All investment decisions require the unanimous approval of FB Advisor&#146;s investment committee, which is currently comprised of Mr. Forman, Gerald F. Stahlecker, Zachary Klehr and Sean Coleman. Our board of directors, including a majority of independent directors, oversees and monitors our investment performance and annually reviews our amended and restated investment advisory agreement, dated July 17, 2014, or the July 2014 investment advisory agreement, and the investment sub-advisory agreement that FB Advisor has entered into with GDFM to determine, among other things, whether the fees payable under such agreements are reasonable in light of the services provided. 

About GDFM 

From time to time, FB Advisor may enter into sub-advisory relationships with registered investment advisers that possess skills that FB Advisor believes will aid it in achieving our investment objectives. FB Advisor has engaged GDFM to act as our investment sub-adviser. GDFM assists FB Advisor in identifying investment opportunities and makes investment recommendations for approval by FB Advisor according to guidelines set by FB Advisor. GDFM also serves as the investment sub-adviser to FS Investment Corporation II, FS Investment Corporation III and FS Investment Corporation IV. Furthermore, GDFM&#146;s parent, GSO, serves as the investment sub-adviser to FS Energy and Power Fund and FS Global Credit Opportunities Fund. GDFM is a Delaware limited liability company with principal offices located at 345 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10154. 

GDFM is a wholly-owned subsidiary of GSO. GSO is the credit platform of Blackstone, a leading global alternative asset manager. As of December 31, 2015, GSO and its affiliates, excluding Blackstone, managed approximately $79.1 billion of assets across multiple strategies and investment types within the leveraged finance marketplace, including leveraged loans, high-yield bonds, distressed, mezzanine and private equity. As investment sub-adviser, GDFM makes recommendations to FB Advisor in a manner that is consistent with its existing investment and monitoring processes. 

Blackstone is a leading global alternative asset manager and provider of financial advisory services. It is one of the largest independent managers of private capital in the world, with assets under management of

Market Opportunity 

We believe that there are and will continue to be significant investment opportunities in the senior secured and second lien secured loan asset class, as well as investments in debt securities of middle market companies. 

Attractive Opportunities in Senior Secured and Second Lien Secured Loans 

We believe that opportunities in senior secured and second lien secured loans are significant because of the variable rate structure of most senior secured debt issues and because of the strong defensive characteristics of this investment class. Given current market conditions, we believe that debt issues with variable interest rates often offer a superior return profile to fixed-rate securities, since variable interest rate structures are generally less susceptible to declines in value experienced by fixed-rate securities in a rising interest rate environment. 

Senior secured debt also provides strong defensive characteristics. Because this debt has priority in payment among an issuer&#146;s security holders (i.e., holders are due to receive payment before junior creditors and equityholders), they carry the least potential risk among investments in the issuer&#146;s capital structure. Further, these investments are secured by the issuer&#146;s assets, which may be seized in the event of a default, if necessary. They generally also carry restrictive covenants aimed at ensuring repayment before junior creditors, such as most types of unsecured bondholders, and other security holders and preserving collateral to protect against credit deterioration. 

The chart below illustrates examples of the collateral used to secure senior secured and second lien secured debt.

Opportunity in Middle Market Private Companies 

In addition to investing in senior secured and second lien secured loans generally, we believe that the market for lending to private companies, particularly middle market private companies within the United States, is underserved and presents a compelling investment opportunity. We believe that the following characteristics support our belief: 

Large Target Market 

According to The U.S. Census Bureau, in its 2012 economic census, there were approximately 42,600 middle market companies in the United States with annual revenues between $50 million and $2.5 billion, compared with approximately 1,350 companies with revenues greater than $2.5 billion. These middle market companies represent, we believe, a significant portion of the growth segment of the U.S. economy and often require substantial capital investment to grow their businesses. Middle market companies have generated a significant number of investment opportunities for us and investment programs managed by our affiliates and GDFM over the past several years, and we believe that this market segment will continue to produce significant investment opportunities for us. 

Limited Investment Competition 

Despite the size of the market, we believe that regulatory changes and other factors have diminished the role of traditional financial institutions and certain other capital providers in providing financing to middle market companies. As tracked by S&#38;P Capital IQ LCD, U.S. banks&#146; share of senior secured loans to middle market companies represented 7% of overall middle market loan volume in 2015, up slightly from 4% in 2014 and down from nearly 20% in 2011. We believe this trend of reduced middle market lending by financial institutions may continue as increased regulatory scrutiny as well as other regulatory changes may further reduce banks&#146; lending activities and may serve to reduce further the role banks play in providing capital to middle market companies. 

In addition, regulatory uncertainty regarding CLOs may limit financing available to middle market companies. Risk retention and certain limitations placed on some banks&#146; ability to hold CLO securities may also inhibit future CLO creation and future lending to middle market companies. CLOs represented 61.2% of the institutional investor base for broadly syndicated loans in 2015, as tracked by S&#38;P Capital IQ LCD, and any decline in the formation of new CLOs will likely have broad implications for the senior secured loan marketplace and for middle market borrowers. 

We also believe that lending and originating new loans to middle market companies, which are often private, generally requires a greater dedication of the lender&#146;s time and resources compared to lending to larger companies, due in part to the smaller size of each investment and the often fragmented nature of information available from these companies. Further, many investment firms lack the breadth and scale necessary to identify investment opportunities, particularly in regards to directly originated investments in middle market companies, and thus we believe that attractive investment opportunities are often overlooked. In addition, middle market companies may require more active monitoring and participation on the lender&#146;s part. We believe that many large financial organizations, which often have relatively high cost structures, are not suited to deal with these factors and instead emphasize services and transactions to larger corporate clients with a consequent reduction in the availability of financing to middle market companies. 

Attractive Market Segment 

We believe that the underserved nature of such a large segment of the market can at times create a significant opportunity for investment. In many environments, we believe that middle market companies are more likely to offer attractive economics in terms of transaction pricing, up-front and ongoing fees, prepayment penalties and security features in the form of stricter covenants and quality collateral than loans to larger companies. In addition, as compared to larger companies, middle market companies often have simpler capital structures and carry less leverage, thus aiding the structuring and negotiation process and allowing us greater 

&#160; 

flexibility in structuring favorable transactions. We believe that these factors will result in advantageous conditions in which to pursue our investment objectives of generating current income and, to a lesser extent, long-term capital appreciation. 

Characteristics of and Risks Related to Investments in Private Companies 

We invest primarily in the debt of private middle market U.S. companies. Investments in private companies pose significantly greater risks than investments in public companies. First, private companies have reduced access to the capital markets, resulting in diminished capital resources and ability to withstand financial distress. As a result, these companies, which may present greater credit risk than public companies, may be unable to meet the obligations under their debt securities that we hold. Second, the investments themselves may often be illiquid. The securities of most of the companies in which we invest are not publicly-traded or actively-traded on the secondary market and are, instead, traded on a privately negotiated over-the-counter secondary market for institutional investors. In addition, our directly originated investments generally will not be traded on any secondary market and a trading market for such investments may not develop. These securities may also be subject to legal and other restrictions on resale. As such, we may have difficulty exiting an investment promptly or at a desired price prior to maturity or outside of a normal amortization schedule. These investments may also be difficult to value because little public information generally exists about private companies, requiring an experienced due diligence team to analyze and value the potential portfolio company. Finally, these companies often may not have third-party debt ratings or audited financial statements. We must therefore rely on the ability of FB Advisor and/or GDFM to obtain adequate information through their due diligence efforts to evaluate the creditworthiness of, and risks involved in, investing in these companies, and to determine the optimal time to exit an investment. These companies and their financial information will also generally not be subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and other rules and regulations that govern public companies that are designed to protect investors. 

Investment Strategy 

Our principal focus is to invest in senior secured and second lien secured loans of private middle market U.S. companies, and to a lesser extent, subordinated loans of private U.S. companies. Although we do not expect a significant portion of our portfolio to be comprised of subordinated loans, there is no limit on the amount of such loans in which we may invest. We may purchase interests in loans or make other debt investments, including investments in senior secured bonds, through secondary market transactions in the &#147;over-the-counter&#148; market or directly from our target companies as primary market or directly originated investments. In connection with our debt investments, we may on occasion receive equity interests such as warrants or options as additional consideration. We may also purchase or otherwise acquire minority interests in the form of common or preferred equity or equity-related securities, such as rights and warrants that may be converted into or exchanged for common stock or other equity or the cash value of common stock or other equity, in our target companies, generally in conjunction with one of our debt investments or through a co-investment with a financial sponsor, such as an institutional investor or private equity firm. In addition, a portion of our portfolio may be comprised of corporate bonds, CLOs, other debt securities and derivatives, including total return swaps and credit default swaps. FB Advisor will seek to tailor our investment focus as market conditions evolve. Depending on market conditions, we may increase or decrease our exposure to less senior portions of the capital structure or otherwise make opportunistic investments. 

When identifying prospective portfolio companies, we focus primarily on the attributes set forth below, which we believe will help us generate higher total returns with an acceptable level of risk. While these criteria provide general guidelines for our investment decisions, we caution investors that, if we believe the benefits of investing are sufficiently strong, not all of these criteria necessarily will be met by each prospective portfolio company in which we choose to invest. These attributes are: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Leading, defensible market positions. We seek to invest in companies that have developed strong positions within their respective markets and exhibit the potential to maintain sufficient cash flows and 

&#160; 

&#160; profitability to service our debt in a range of economic environments. We seek companies that can protect their competitive advantages through scale, scope, customer loyalty, product pricing or product quality versus their competitors, thereby minimizing business risk and protecting profitability. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Investing in stable companies with positive cash flow. We seek to invest in established, stable companies with strong profitability and cash flows. Such companies, we believe, are well-positioned to maintain consistent cash flow to service and repay our loans and maintain growth in their businesses or market share. We do not intend to invest to any significant degree in start-up companies, turnaround situations or companies with speculative business plans. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Proven management teams. We focus on companies that have experienced management teams with an established track record of success. We typically prefer our portfolio companies to have proper incentives in place, which may include non-cash and performance-based compensation, to align management&#146;s goals with ours. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Private equity sponsorship. Often, we seek to participate in transactions sponsored by what we believe to be sophisticated and seasoned private equity firms. FB Advisor&#146;s management team believes that a private equity sponsor&#146;s willingness to invest significant sums of equity capital into a company is an endorsement of the quality of the investment. Further, by co-investing with such experienced private equity firms which commit significant sums of equity capital ranking junior in priority of payment to our debt investments, we may benefit from the due diligence review performed by the private equity firm, in addition to our own due diligence review. Further, strong private equity sponsors with significant investments at risk have the ability and a strong incentive to contribute additional capital in difficult economic times should operational or financial issues arise, which could provide additional protections for our investments. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Allocation among various issuers and industries. We seek to allocate our portfolio broadly among issuers and industries, thereby attempting to reduce the risk of a downturn in any one company or industry having a disproportionate adverse impact on the value of our portfolio. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Viable exit strategy. While we attempt to invest in securities that may be sold in a privately negotiated over-the-counter market, providing us a means by which we may exit our positions, we expect that a large portion of our portfolio may not be sold on this secondary market. For any investments that are not able to be sold within this market, we focus primarily on investing in companies whose business models and growth prospects offer attractive exit possibilities, including repayment of our investments, an initial public offering of equity securities, a merger, a sale or a recapitalization, in each case with the potential for capital gains. 

In addition, in an order dated June 4, 2013, the SEC granted exemptive relief that, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, expands our ability to co-invest in certain privately negotiated investment transactions with our co-investment affiliates, which we believe has and may continue to enhance our ability to further our investment objectives and strategy. 

Potential Competitive Strengths 

We believe that we offer investors the following potential competitive strengths: 

Global platform with seasoned investment professionals 

We believe that the breadth and depth of the experience of FB Advisor&#146;s senior management team, together with the wider resources of GSO&#146;s investment team, which is dedicated to sourcing, structuring, executing, monitoring and harvesting a broad range of private investments, as well as the specific expertise of GDFM, provide us with a significant competitive advantage in sourcing and analyzing attractive investment opportunities. 

&#160; 

Long-term investment horizon 

Our long-term investment horizon gives us great flexibility, which we believe allows us to maximize returns on our investments. Unlike most private equity and venture capital funds, as well as many private debt funds, we are not required to return capital to our stockholders once we exit a portfolio investment. We believe that freedom from such capital return requirements, which allows us to invest using a longer-term focus, provides us with the opportunity to increase total returns on invested capital, compared to other private company investment vehicles. 

GDFM transaction sourcing capability 

FB Advisor seeks to leverage GDFM&#146;s significant access to transaction flow. GDFM seeks to generate investment opportunities through syndicate and club deals (generally, investments made by a small group of investment firms) and, subject to regulatory constraints as discussed under &#147;&#151;Regulation,&#148; and the allocation policies of GDFM and its affiliates, as applicable, also through GSO&#146;s direct origination channels. GDFM also relies on its relationships with private equity sponsors, investment banks and commercial banks to source investment opportunities. These include significant contacts to participants in the credit and leveraged finance marketplace, which it can draw upon in sourcing investment opportunities for us. With respect to syndicate and club deals, GDFM has built a network of relationships with commercial and investment banks, finance companies and other investment funds as a result of the long track record of its investment professionals in the leveraged finance marketplace. With respect to GDFM&#146;s origination channel, FB Advisor seeks to leverage the global presence of GSO to generate access to a substantial amount of directly originated transactions with attractive investment characteristics. We believe that the broad network of GDFM provides a significant pipeline of investment opportunities for us. GDFM also has a significant trading platform, which, we believe, allows us access to the secondary market for investment opportunities. 

Disciplined, income-oriented investment philosophy 

FB Advisor and GDFM employ a defensive investment approach focused on long-term credit performance and principal protection. This investment approach involves a multi-stage selection process for each investment opportunity, as well as ongoing monitoring of each investment made, with particular emphasis on early detection of deteriorating credit conditions at portfolio companies which would result in adverse portfolio developments. This strategy is designed to maximize current income and minimize the risk of capital loss while maintaining the potential for long-term capital appreciation. 

Investment expertise across all levels of the corporate capital structure 

FB Advisor and GDFM believe that their broad expertise and experience investing at all levels of a company&#146;s capital structure enable us to manage risk while affording us the opportunity for significant returns on our investments. We attempt to capitalize on this expertise in an effort to produce and maintain an investment portfolio that will perform in a broad range of economic conditions. 

Operating and Regulatory Structure 

Our investment activities are managed by FB Advisor and supervised by our board of directors, a majority of whom are independent. Under the July 2014 investment advisory agreement, we have agreed to pay FB Advisor an annual base management fee based on the average value of our gross assets and an incentive fee based on our performance. See &#147;Item 7. Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#151;Contractual Obligations&#148; for a description of the fees we pay to FB Advisor. 

From time to time, FB Advisor may enter into sub-advisory relationships with registered investment advisers that possess skills or attributes that FB Advisor believes will aid it in achieving our investment objectives. FB Advisor has engaged GDFM to act as our investment sub-adviser. GDFM assists FB Advisor in identifying investment opportunities and makes investment recommendations for approval by FB Advisor according to guidelines set by FB Advisor. 

&#160; 

FB Advisor oversees our day-to-day operations, including the provision of general ledger accounting, fund accounting, legal services, investor relations and other administrative services. FB Advisor also performs, or oversees the performance of, our corporate operations and required administrative services, which includes being responsible for the financial records that we are required to maintain and preparing reports for our stockholders and reports filed with the SEC. In addition, FB Advisor assists us in calculating our net asset value, overseeing the preparation and filing of tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports to our stockholders, and generally overseeing the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others. 

Pursuant to our administration agreement, dated April 16, 2014, or the administration agreement, we reimburse FB Advisor for expenses necessary to perform services related to our administration and operations, including FB Advisor&#146;s allocable portion of the compensation and related expenses of certain personnel of Franklin Square Holdings providing administrative services to us on behalf of FB Advisor. We reimburse FB Advisor no less than quarterly for all costs and expenses incurred by FB Advisor in performing its obligations and providing personnel and facilities under the administration agreement. FB Advisor allocates the cost of such services to us based on factors such as total assets, revenues, time allocations and/or other reasonable metrics. Our board of directors reviews the methodology employed in determining how the expenses are allocated to us and the proposed allocation of administrative expenses among us and certain affiliates of FB Advisor. Our board of directors then assesses the reasonableness of such reimbursements for expenses allocated to us based on the breadth, depth and quality of such services as compared to the estimated cost to us of obtaining similar services from third-party service providers known to be available. In addition, our board of directors considers whether any single third-party service provider would be capable of providing all such services at comparable cost and quality. Finally, our board of directors compares the total amount paid to FB Advisor for such services as a percentage of our net assets to the same ratio as reported by other comparable BDCs. 

We have contracted with State Street Bank and Trust Company to provide various accounting and administrative services, including, but not limited to, preparing preliminary financial information for review by FB Advisor, preparing and monitoring expense budgets, maintaining accounting and corporate books and records, processing trade information provided by us and performing testing with respect to RIC compliance. Prior to April 1, 2015, we had contracted with Vigilant Compliance, LLC to provide the services of Salvatore Faia as our chief compliance officer. 

As a BDC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. Also, while we are permitted to finance investments using debt, our ability to use debt will be limited in certain significant respects pursuant to the 1940 Act. Within the limits of existing regulation, we will adjust our use of debt, according to market conditions, to the level we believe will allow us to generate maximum risk-adjusted returns. See &#147;&#151;Regulation.&#148; We have elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and intend to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. 

Investment Types 

Our portfolio is comprised primarily of investments in senior secured loans and second lien secured loans of private middle market U.S. companies and, to a lesser extent, subordinated loans of private U.S. companies. Although we do not expect a significant portion of our portfolio to be comprised of subordinated loans, there is no limit on the amount of such loans in which we may invest. We may purchase interests in loans or make other debt investments, including investments in senior secured bonds, through secondary market transactions in the &#147;over-the- counter&#148; market or directly from our target companies as primary market or directly originated investments. In connection with our debt investments, we may on occasion receive equity interests such as warrants or options as additional consideration. We may also purchase or otherwise acquire minority interests in the form of common or preferred equity or equity-related securities, such as rights and warrants that may be converted into or exchanged for common stock or other equity or the cash value of common stock or other equity, in our target companies, generally in conjunction with one of our debt investments or through a co-investment with a financial 

&#160; 

sponsor, such as an institutional investor or private equity firm. In addition, a portion of our portfolio may be comprised of corporate bonds, CLOs, other debt securities and derivatives, including total return swaps and credit default swaps. FB Advisor will seek to tailor our investment focus as market conditions evolve. Depending on market conditions, we may increase or decrease our exposure to less senior portions of the capital structure, where returns tend to be stronger in a more stable or growing economy, but less secure in weak economic environments. Below is a diagram illustrating where these investments lie in a typical portfolio company&#146;s capital structure. Senior secured debt is situated at the top of the capital structure and typically has the first claim on the assets and cash flows of the company, followed by second lien secured debt, subordinated debt, preferred equity and, finally, common equity. Due to this priority of cash flows, an investment&#146;s risk increases as it moves further down the capital structure. Investors are usually compensated for this risk associated with junior status in the form of higher returns, either through higher interest payments or potentially higher capital appreciation. We rely on FB Advisor&#146;s and GDFM&#146;s experience to structure investments, possibly using all levels of the capital structure, which we believe will perform in a broad range of economic environments. 

Typical Leveraged Capital Structure Diagram 

&#160;

&#160;

Senior Secured Loans 

Senior secured loans are situated at the top of the capital structure. Because these loans generally have priority in payment, they carry the least risk among all investments in a firm. Generally, our senior secured loans are expected to have maturities of three to seven years, offer some form of amortization, and have first priority security interests in the assets of the borrower. Generally, we expect that the interest rate on our senior secured loans typically will have variable rates ranging between 6.0% and 10.0% over a standard benchmark, such as the prime rate or the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR. 

Second Lien Secured Loans 

Second lien secured loans are immediately junior to senior secured loans and have substantially the same maturities, collateral and covenant structures as senior secured loans. Second lien secured loans, however, are granted a second priority security interest in the assets of the borrower, which means that any realization of collateral will generally be applied to pay senior secured loans in full before second lien secured loans are paid 

&#160; 

and the value of the collateral may not be sufficient to repay in full both senior secured loans and second lien secured loans. In return for this junior ranking, second lien secured loans generally offer higher returns compared to senior secured debt. These higher returns come in the form of higher interest and in some cases the potential for equity participation through warrants, though to a lesser extent than with subordinated loans. Generally, we expect these loans to carry a fixed rate, or a floating current yield of 9.0% to 12.0% over a standard benchmark. In addition, we may receive additional returns from any warrants we may receive in connection with these investments. 

Senior Secured Bonds 

Senior secured bonds are generally secured by collateral on a senior, pari passu or junior basis with other debt instruments in an issuer&#146;s capital structure and have similar maturities and covenant structures as senior secured loans. Generally, we expect these investments to carry a fixed rate of 8.0% to 14.0%. 

Subordinated Debt 

In addition to senior secured loans, second lien secured loans and senior secured bonds, we may invest a portion of our assets in subordinated debt. Subordinated debt investments usually rank junior in priority of payment to senior debt and are often unsecured, but are situated above preferred equity and common equity in the capital structure. In return for their junior status compared to senior debt, subordinated debt investments typically offer higher returns through both higher interest rates and possible equity ownership in the form of warrants, enabling the lender to participate in the capital appreciation of the borrower. These warrants typically require only a nominal cost to exercise. We generally target subordinated debt with interest-only payments throughout the life of the security, with the principal due at maturity. Typically, subordinated debt investments have maturities of five to ten years. Generally, we expect these securities to carry a fixed rate, or a floating current yield of 7.5% to 14.0% over a standard benchmark. In addition, we may receive additional returns from any warrants we may receive in connection with these investments. In some cases, a portion of the total interest may accrue or be paid-in-kind, or PIK. 

Equity and Equity-Related Securities 

While we intend to maintain our focus on investments in debt securities, from time to time, when we see the potential for extraordinary gain, or in connection with securing particularly favorable terms in a debt investment, we may enter into investments in preferred or common equity, typically in conjunction with a private equity sponsor we believe to be sophisticated and seasoned. In addition, we typically receive the right to make equity investments in a portfolio company whose debt securities we hold in connection with the next equity financing round for that company. This right may provide us with the opportunity to further enhance our returns over time through equity investments in our portfolio companies. In addition, we may hold equity-related securities, such as rights and warrants that may be converted into or exchanged for common stock or other equity or the cash value of common stock or other equity, generally obtained in conjunction with one of our debt investments or through a co-investment with a financial sponsor, such as an institutional investor or private equity firm. In the future, we may achieve liquidity through a merger or acquisition of a portfolio company, a public offering of a portfolio company&#146;s stock or by exercising our right, if any, to require a portfolio company to repurchase the equity-related securities we hold. With respect to any preferred or common equity investments, we expect to target an annual investment return of at least 15%. 

Non-U.S. Securities 

We may invest in non-U.S. securities, which may include securities denominated in U.S. dollars or in non-U.S. currencies, to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act. 

&#160; 

Collateralized Loan Obligations 

We may invest in CLOs, which are a form of securitization where payments from multiple loans are pooled together. Investors may purchase one or more tranches of a CLO and each tranche typically reflects a different level of seniority in payment from the CLO. 

Other Securities 

We may also invest from time to time in derivatives, including total return swaps and credit default swaps. We anticipate that any use of derivatives would primarily be as a substitute for investing in conventional securities. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

We may maintain a certain level of cash or equivalent instruments to make follow-on investments, if necessary, in existing portfolio companies or to take advantage of new opportunities. 

Comparison of Targeted Debt Investments to Corporate Bonds 

Loans to private companies are debt instruments that can be compared to corporate bonds to aid an investor&#146;s understanding. As with corporate bonds, loans to private companies can range in credit quality depending on security-specific factors, including total leverage, amount of leverage senior to the security in question, variability in the issuer&#146;s cash flows, the quality of assets securing debt and the degree to which such assets cover the subject company&#146;s debt obligations. As is the case in the corporate bond market, we will require greater returns for securities that we perceive to carry increased risk. The companies in which we invest may be leveraged, often as a result of leveraged buyouts or other recapitalization transactions, and, in many cases, will not be rated by national rating agencies. When our targeted debt investments do carry ratings from a NRSRO, we believe that such ratings generally will be below investment grade (rated lower than &#147;Baa3&#148; by Moody&#146;s or lower than &#147;BBB-&#148; by S&#38;P). To the extent we make unrated investments, we believe that such investments would likely receive similar ratings if they were to be examined by a NRSRO. Compared to below-investment grade corporate bonds that are typically available to the public, our targeted senior secured and second lien secured loan investments are higher in the capital structure, have priority in receiving payment, are secured by the issuer&#146;s assets, allow the lender to seize collateral if necessary, and generally exhibit higher rates of recovery in the event of default. Corporate bonds, on the other hand, are often unsecured obligations of the issuer. 

The market for loans to private companies possesses several key differences compared to the corporate bond market. For instance, due to a possible lack of debt ratings for certain middle market firms, and also due to the reduced availability of information for private companies, investors must conduct extensive due diligence investigations before committing to an investment. This intensive due diligence process gives the investor significant access to management, which is often not possible in the case of corporate bondholders, who rely on underwriters, debt rating agencies and publicly available information for due diligence reviews and monitoring of corporate issuers. While holding these investments, private debt investors often receive monthly or quarterly updates on the portfolio company&#146;s financial performance, along with possible representation on the company&#146;s board of directors, which allows the investor to take remedial action quickly if conditions happen to deteriorate. Due to reduced liquidity, the relative scarcity of capital and extensive due diligence and expertise required on the part of the investor, we believe that private debt securities typically offer higher returns than corporate bonds of equivalent credit quality. 

Sources of Income 

The primary means through which our stockholders will receive a return of value is through interest income, dividends and capital gains generated by our investments. In addition to these sources of income, we may receive 

&#160; 

fees paid by our portfolio companies, including one-time closing fees paid at the time each investment is made. Closing fees typically range from 1.0% to 2.0% of the purchase price of an investment. In addition, we may generate revenues in the form of non-recurring commitment, origination, structuring or diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance, consulting fees and performance-based fees. 

Risk Management 

We seek to limit the downside potential of our investment portfolio by: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; applying our investment strategy guidelines for portfolio investments; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; requiring a total return on investments (including both interest and potential appreciation) that adequately compensates us for credit risk; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; allocating our portfolio among various issuers and industries, size permitting, with an adequate number of companies, across different industries, with different types of collateral; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; negotiating or seeking debt investments with covenants or features that protect us while affording portfolio companies flexibility in managing their businesses consistent with preservation of capital, which may include affirmative and negative covenants, default penalties, lien protection, change of control provisions and board rights. 

We may also enter into interest rate hedging transactions at the sole discretion of FB Advisor. Such transactions will enable us to selectively modify interest rate exposure as market conditions dictate. 

Affirmative Covenants 

Affirmative covenants require borrowers to take actions that are meant to ensure the solvency of the company, facilitate the lender&#146;s monitoring of the borrower, and ensure payment of interest and loan principal due to lenders. Examples of affirmative covenants include covenants requiring the borrower to maintain adequate insurance, accounting and tax records, and to produce frequent financial reports for the benefit of the lender. 

Negative Covenants 

Negative covenants impose restrictions on the borrower and are meant to protect lenders from actions that the borrower may take that could harm the credit quality of the lender&#146;s investments. Examples of negative covenants include restrictions on the payment of dividends and restrictions on the issuance of additional debt without the lender&#146;s approval. In addition, certain covenants restrict a borrower&#146;s activities by requiring it to meet certain earnings interest coverage ratio and leverage ratio requirements. These covenants are also referred to as financial or maintenance covenants. 

Investment Process 

The investment professionals employed by FB Advisor and GDFM have spent their careers developing the resources necessary to invest in private companies. Our transaction process is highlighted below. 

Our Transaction Process 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Sourcing 

In order to source transactions, FB Advisor seeks to leverage GDFM&#146;s significant access to transaction flow, along with GDFM&#146;s trading platform. GDFM seeks to generate investment opportunities through its trading platform, through syndicate and club deals, through relationships with investment banks, which may be exclusive to GDFM, and, subject to regulatory constraints and the allocation policies of GDFM and its affiliates, as applicable, through GSO&#146;s direct origination channels. With respect to syndicate and club deals, GDFM has built a network of relationships with commercial and investment banks, finance companies and other investment funds as a result of the long track record of its investment professionals in the leveraged finance marketplace. GDFM may compensate certain brokers or other financial services firms out of its own profits or revenues for services provided in connection with the identification of appropriate investment opportunities. With respect to GDFM&#146;s origination channel, FB Advisor seeks to leverage the global presence of GSO to generate access to a substantial amount of directly originated transactions with attractive investment characteristics. We believe that the broad network of GDFM provides a significant pipeline of investment opportunities for us. 

Evaluation 

Initial Review. In its initial review of an investment opportunity to present to FB Advisor, GDFM&#146;s transaction team examines information furnished by the target company and external sources, including rating agencies, if applicable, to determine whether the investment meets our basic investment criteria and other guidelines specified by FB Advisor, within the context of proper allocation of our portfolio among various issuers and industries, and offers an acceptable probability of attractive returns with identifiable downside risk. For the majority of securities available on the secondary market, a comprehensive analysis is conducted and continuously maintained by a dedicated GDFM research analyst, the results of which are available for the transaction team to review. In the case of a directly originated transaction, FB Advisor and GDFM conduct detailed due diligence investigations as necessary. 

Credit Analysis/Due Diligence. Before undertaking an investment, the transaction teams from FB Advisor and GDFM conduct a thorough due diligence review of the opportunity to ensure the company fits our investment strategy, which may include: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; a full operational analysis to identify the key risks and opportunities of the target&#146;s business, including a detailed review of historical and projected financial results; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; a detailed analysis of industry dynamics, competitive position, regulatory, tax and legal matters; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; on-site visits, if deemed necessary; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; background checks to further evaluate management and other key personnel; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; a review by legal and accounting professionals, environmental or other industry consultants, if necessary; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; financial sponsor due diligence, including portfolio company and lender reference checks, if necessary; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; a review of management&#146;s experience and track record. 

When possible, our advisory team seeks to structure transactions in such a way that our target companies are required to bear the costs of due diligence, including those costs related to any outside consulting work we may require. 

Execution 

Recommendation. FB Advisor has engaged GDFM to identify and recommend investment opportunities for its approval. GDFM seeks to maintain a defensive approach toward its investment recommendations by 

&#160; 

emphasizing risk control in its transaction process, which includes (i) the pre-review of each opportunity by one of its portfolio managers to assess the general quality, value and fit relative to our portfolio, (ii) where possible, transaction structuring with a focus on preservation of capital in varying economic environments and (iii) ultimate approval of investment recommendations by GDFM&#146;s investment committee. 

Approval. After completing its internal transaction process, GDFM makes formal recommendations for review and approval by FB Advisor. In connection with its recommendation, it transmits any relevant underwriting material and other information pertinent to the decision-making process. In addition, GDFM makes its staff available to answer inquiries by FB Advisor in connection with its recommendations. The consummation of a transaction requires unanimous approval of the members of FB Advisor&#146;s investment committee. 

Monitoring 

Portfolio Monitoring. FB Advisor, with the help of GDFM, monitors our portfolio with a focus toward anticipating negative credit events. To maintain portfolio company performance and help to ensure a successful exit, FB Advisor and GDFM work closely with, as applicable, the lead equity sponsor, loan syndicator, portfolio company management, consultants, advisers and other security holders to discuss financial position, compliance with covenants, financial requirements and execution of the company&#146;s business plan. In addition, depending on the size, nature and performance of the transaction, we may occupy a seat or serve as an observer on a portfolio company&#146;s board of directors or similar governing body. 

Typically, FB Advisor and GDFM receive financial reports detailing operating performance, sales volumes, margins, cash flows, financial position and other key operating metrics on a quarterly basis from our portfolio companies. FB Advisor and GDFM use this data, combined with due diligence gained through contact with the company&#146;s customers, suppliers, competitors, market research and other methods, to conduct an ongoing, rigorous assessment of the company&#146;s operating performance and prospects. GDFM may rely on brokers or other financial services firms that may help identify potential investments from time to time for assistance in monitoring these investments. 

In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, FB Advisor uses an investment rating system to characterize and monitor the expected level of returns on each investment in our portfolio. FB Advisor uses an investment rating scale of 1 to 5. The following is a description of the conditions associated with each investment rating: 

&#160;

Investment Rating &#160; Summary Description 

1 &#160; Investment exceeding expectations and/or capital gain expected. 2 &#160; Performing investment generally executing in accordance with the portfolio company&#146;s business plan&#151;full return of principal and interest expected. 3 &#160; Performing investment requiring closer monitoring. 4 &#160; Underperforming investment&#151;some loss of interest or dividend possible, but still expecting a positive return on investment. 5 &#160; Underperforming investment with expected loss of interest and some principal. FB Advisor monitors and, when appropriate, changes the investment ratings assigned to each investment in our portfolio. In connection with valuing our assets, our board of directors reviews these investment ratings on a quarterly basis. In the event that our advisory team determines that an investment is underperforming, or circumstances suggest that the risk associated with a particular investment has significantly increased, FB Advisor will attempt to sell the asset in the secondary market, if applicable, or to implement a plan to attempt to exit the investment or to correct the situation. 

&#160; 

The following table shows the distribution of our investments on the 1 to 5 investment rating scale at fair value as of December 31, 2015 and 2014:

&#160; The amount of the portfolio in each grading category may vary substantially from period to period resulting primarily from changes in the composition of the portfolio as a result of new investment, repayment and exit activities. In addition, changes in the grade of investments may be made to reflect our expectation of performance and changes in investment values. 

Valuation Process. Each quarter, we value investments in our portfolio, and such values are disclosed each quarter in reports filed with the SEC. Investments for which market quotations are readily available are recorded at such market quotations. With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, our board of directors determines the fair value of such investments in good faith, utilizing the input of our valuation committee, FB Advisor and any other professionals or materials that our board of directors deems worthy and relevant, including GDFM and independent third-party valuation services, if applicable. See &#147;Item 7. Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#151;Critical Accounting Policies&#151;Valuation of Portfolio Investments.&#148; 

Managerial Assistance. As a BDC, we must offer, and provide upon request, managerial assistance to certain of our portfolio companies. This assistance could involve, among other things, monitoring the operations of our portfolio companies, participating in board and management meetings, consulting with and advising officers of portfolio companies and providing other organizational and financial guidance. Depending on the nature of the assistance required, FB Advisor or GDFM will provide such managerial assistance on our behalf to portfolio companies that request this assistance. To the extent fees are paid for these services, we, rather than FB Advisor or GDFM, will retain any fees paid for such assistance. 

Exit 

While we attempt to invest in securities that may be sold in a privately negotiated over-the-counter market, providing us a means by which we may exit our positions, we expect that a large portion of our portfolio may not be sold on this secondary market. For any investments that are not able to be sold within this market, we focus primarily on investing in companies whose business models and growth prospects offer attractive exit possibilities, including repayment of our investments, an initial public offering of equity securities, a merger, a sale or a recapitalization, in each case with the potential for capital gains. 

&#160; 

Financing Arrangements 

To seek to enhance our returns, we employ leverage as market conditions permit and at the discretion of FB Advisor, but in no event will leverage employed exceed 50% of the value of our assets, as required by the 1940 Act. Below is a summary of our outstanding financing arrangements as of December 31, 2015:

Our average borrowings and weighted average interest rate, including the effect of non-usage fees, for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $1,877,789 and 3.75%, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, our weighted average effective interest rate on borrowings, including the effect of non-usage fees was 3.96%. 

See &#147;Item 7. Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#151;Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources&#148; for additional information regarding our financing arrangements. 

Regulation 

We have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. The 1940 Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between BDCs and their affiliates, principal underwriters and affiliates of those affiliates or underwriters. The 1940 Act requires that a majority of our directors be persons other than &#147;interested persons,&#148; as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. In addition, the 1940 Act provides that we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or to withdraw our election as, a BDC unless approved by a majority of our outstanding voting securities. 

The 1940 Act defines &#147;a majority of the outstanding voting securities&#148; as the lesser of (i) 67% or more of the voting securities present at a meeting if the holders of more than 50% of our outstanding voting securities are present or represented by proxy or (ii) 50% of our voting securities. 

We will generally not be able to issue and sell our common stock at a price per share, after deducting underwriting commissions and discounts, that is below our net asset value per share. See &#147;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#151;Risks Related to Business Development Companies&#151;Regulations governing our operation as a BDC and a RIC will affect our ability to raise, and the way in which we raise, additional capital or borrow for investment purposes, which may have a negative effect on our growth.&#148; We may, however, sell our common stock, or warrants, options or rights to acquire our common stock, at a price below the then-current net asset value of our common stock if our board of directors determines that such sale is in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders, and our stockholders approve such sale. At the 2015 annual stockholders meeting, our stockholders approved the sale of shares of our common stock at a price below the then-current net asset value per share, subject to certain conditions, during the period beginning on June 22, 2015 and expiring on June 22, 2016. We currently do not intend to utilize this authority to sell shares of our common stock at a price below the then-current net asset value per share. In addition, we may generally issue new shares of our common stock at a price below net asset value per share in rights offerings to existing stockholders, in payment of dividends and in certain other limited circumstances. 

&#160; 

As a BDC, we are subject to certain regulatory restrictions in making our investments. For example, BDCs generally are not permitted to co-invest with certain affiliated entities in transactions originated by the BDC or its affiliates in the absence of an exemptive order from the SEC. However, BDCs are permitted to, and may, simultaneously co-invest in transactions where price is the only negotiated point. In an order dated June 4, 2013, the SEC granted exemptive relief permitting us, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, to co-invest in certain privately negotiated investment transactions with our co-investment affiliates. Under the terms of this relief, a &#147;required majority&#148; (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of our independent directors must make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our stockholders and do not involve overreaching of us or our stockholders on the part of any person concerned and (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of our stockholders and is consistent with our investment objectives and strategy. We believe this relief has and may continue to enhance our ability to further our investment objectives and strategy. We believe this relief may also increase favorable investment opportunities for us, in part, by allowing us to participate in larger investments, together with our co-investment affiliates, than would be available to us if such relief had not been obtained. Because we did not seek exemptive relief to engage in co-investment transactions with GDFM and its affiliates, we are permitted to co-invest with GDFM and its affiliates only in accordance with existing regulatory guidance. 

Qualifying Assets 

Under the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as qualifying assets, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the company&#146;s total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our business are any of the following: 

&#160;

&#160; 1. Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. An eligible portfolio company is defined in the 1940 Act as any issuer which: &#160;

&#160; a. is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States; &#160;

&#160; b. is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company wholly owned by the BDC) or a company that would be an investment company but for certain exclusions under the 1940 Act; and &#160;

&#160; c. satisfies any of the following: &#160;

&#160; i. does not have any class of securities that is traded on a national securities exchange; &#160;

&#160; ii. has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange, but has an aggregate market value of outstanding voting and non-voting common equity of less than $250 million; &#160;

&#160; iii. is controlled by a BDC or a group of companies including a BDC and the BDC has an affiliated person who is a director of the eligible portfolio company; or &#160;

&#160; iv. is a small and solvent company having total assets of not more than $4.0 million and capital and surplus of not less than $2.0 million. &#160;

&#160; 2. Securities of any eligible portfolio company that we control. &#160;

&#160; 3. Securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incident thereto, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements. &#160; 

&#160; 4. Securities of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no ready market for such securities and we already own 60% of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company. &#160;

&#160; 5. Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described in (1) through (4) above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities. &#160;

&#160; 6. Cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment. In addition, a BDC must have been organized and have its principal place of business in the United States and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described in (1), (2) or (3) above. 

Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies 

In order to count portfolio securities as qualifying assets for the purpose of the 70% test, we must either control the issuer of the securities or must offer to make available to the issuer of the securities (other than small and solvent companies described above) significant managerial assistance; except that, where we purchase such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together, one of the other persons in the group may make available such managerial assistance. Making available managerial assistance means, among other things, any arrangement whereby the BDC, through its directors, officers or employees, offers to provide, and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company. 

Temporary Investments 

Pending investment in other types of &#147;qualifying assets,&#148; as described above, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as temporary investments, so that 70% of our assets are qualifying assets. Typically, we will invest in U.S. Treasury bills or in repurchase agreements, provided that such agreements are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price that is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements. However, if more than 25% of our total assets constitute repurchase agreements from a single counterparty, we would not meet the asset diversification tests in order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes as described below under &#147;&#151;Taxation as a RIC.&#148; Thus, we do not intend to enter into repurchase agreements with a single counterparty in excess of this limit. FB Advisor will monitor the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we enter into repurchase agreement transactions. 

Senior Securities 

We are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of debt and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 200% immediately after each such issuance. In addition, while any senior securities remain outstanding, we must make provisions to prohibit any distribution to our stockholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. We may also borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our total assets for temporary purposes without regard to asset coverage. For a discussion of the risks associated with leverage, see &#147;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#151;Risks Related to Debt Financing&#148; and &#147;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#151;Risks Related to Business Development Companies.&#148; 

&#160; 

Code of Ethics 

We and FB Advisor have each adopted a code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 promulgated under the 1940 Act that, among other things, establishes procedures for personal investments and restricts certain personal securities transactions. Personnel subject to the codes may invest in securities for their personal investment accounts, including securities that may be purchased or held by us, so long as such investments are made in accordance with each code&#146;s requirements. Our code of ethics was filed as an exhibit to our current report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on March 12, 2014 and FB Advisor&#146;s code of ethics was filed as an exhibit to pre-effective amendment no. 1 to our registration statement on Form N-2 filed with the SEC on June 16, 2014. You may also read and copy these codes of ethics at the SEC&#146;s Public Reference Room located at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. You may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at (202) 551-8090. In addition, each code of ethics is available on our website at www.fsinvestmentcorp.com and on the EDGAR Database on the SEC&#146;s Internet site at www.sec.gov . You may also obtain a copy of each code of ethics, after paying a duplicating fee, by electronic request at the following e-mail address: publicinfo@sec.gov, or by writing the SEC&#146;s Public Reference Section at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. 

Compliance Policies and Procedures 

We and FB Advisor have adopted and implemented written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of the federal securities laws and are required to review these compliance policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation. Our chief compliance officer and the chief compliance officer of FB Advisor are responsible for administering these policies and procedures. 

Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures 

We have delegated our proxy voting responsibility to FB Advisor. The proxy voting policies and procedures of FB Advisor are set forth below. The guidelines are reviewed periodically by FB Advisor and our independent directors, and, accordingly, are subject to change. 

As an investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act, FB Advisor has a fiduciary duty to act solely in the best interests of its clients. As part of this duty, it recognizes that it must vote client securities in a timely manner free of conflicts of interest and in the best interests of its clients. These policies and procedures for voting proxies for the investment advisory clients of FB Advisor are intended to comply with Section 206 of, and Rule 206(4)-6 promulgated under, the Advisers Act. 

FB Advisor will vote proxies relating to our securities in the best interest of its clients&#146; stockholders. It will review on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted for a stockholder vote to determine its impact on the portfolio securities held by its clients. Although FB Advisor will generally vote against proposals that may have a negative impact on its clients&#146; portfolio securities, it may vote for such a proposal if there exists compelling long-term reasons to do so. 

The proxy voting decisions of FB Advisor are made by the senior officers who are responsible for monitoring each of its clients&#146; investments. To ensure that its vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, it will require that: (a) anyone involved in the decision-making process disclose to its chief compliance officer any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote; and (b) employees involved in the decision making process or vote administration are prohibited from revealing how FB Advisor intends to vote on a proposal in order to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties. 

You may obtain information, without charge, regarding how FB Advisor voted proxies with respect to our portfolio securities by making a written request for proxy voting information to: Chief Compliance Officer, FS Investment Corporation, 201 Rouse Boulevard, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19112 or by calling us collect at (215) 495-1150. 

&#160; 

Other 

We will be periodically examined by the SEC for compliance with the 1940 Act. 

We are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect us against larceny and embezzlement. Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to us or our stockholders arising from willful misconduct, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person&#146;s office. 

Securities Exchange Act and Sarbanes-Oxley Act Compliance 

We are subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, including the filing of quarterly, annual and current reports, proxy statements and other required items. In addition, we are subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which imposes a wide variety of regulatory requirements on publicly-held companies and their insiders. Many of these requirements affect us. For example: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; pursuant to Rule 13a-14 promulgated under the Exchange Act, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer are required to certify the accuracy of the financial statements contained in our periodic reports; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; pursuant to Item 307 of Regulation S-K, our periodic reports are required to disclose our conclusions about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; pursuant to Rule 13a-15 promulgated under the Exchange Act, our management is required to prepare a report regarding its assessment of our internal control over financial reporting; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; pursuant to Item 308 of Regulation S-K, our auditors must attest to, and report on, our management&#146;s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. 

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to review our current policies and procedures to determine whether we comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder. We monitor our compliance with all regulations that are adopted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and take actions necessary to ensure that we are in compliance therewith. 

Taxation as a RIC 

We have elected to be subject to tax as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, we generally will not have to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that we timely distribute each tax year as distributions to our stockholders. To qualify for and maintain our qualification as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements (as described below). In addition, in order to maintain RIC tax treatment, we must distribute to our stockholders, for each tax year, distributions generally of an amount at least equal to 90% of our &#147;investment company taxable income,&#148; which is generally the sum of our net ordinary income plus the excess, if any, of realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses, determined without regard to any deduction for distributions paid, or the Annual Distribution Requirement. 

If we: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; qualify as a RIC; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, 

then we will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of our income or capital gains we distribute (or are deemed to distribute) as distributions to stockholders. We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular corporate rates on any income or capital gains not distributed (or deemed distributed) as distributions to our stockholders. 

&#160; 

As a RIC, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible federal excise tax on certain undistributed income unless we distribute distributions in a timely manner to our stockholders generally of an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our net ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections) for the calendar year, (2) 98.2% of our capital gain net income, which is the excess of capital gains in excess of capital losses, or &#147;capital gain net income&#148; (adjusted for certain ordinary losses), for the one-year period ending October 31 of that calendar year (as adjusted for certain ordinary losses) and (3) any net ordinary income and capital gain net income for the preceding years that were not distributed during such years and on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax, or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement. Any distribution declared by us during October, November or December of any calendar year, payable to stockholders of record on a specified date in such a month and actually paid during January of the following calendar year, will be treated as if it had been paid by us, as well as received by our U.S. stockholders, on December 31 of the calendar year in which the distribution was declared. We generally will endeavor in each tax year to avoid any material U.S. federal excise tax on our earnings. 

In order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must, among other things: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; continue to qualify as a BDC under the 1940 Act at all times during each tax year; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; derive in each tax year at least 90% of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities, loans, gains from the sale of stock or other securities, net income from certain &#147;qualified publicly-traded partnerships,&#148; or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock or other securities, or the 90% Income Test; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; diversify our holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the tax year: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; at least 50% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5% of the value of our assets or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; no more than 25% of the value of our assets is invested in the securities, other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs, of one issuer, of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable Code rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses or of certain &#147;qualified publicly-traded partnerships,&#148; or the Diversification Tests. 

For U.S. federal income tax purposes, we may be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive a corresponding payment in cash. For example, if we hold debt instruments that are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount (such as debt instruments with PIK interest or, in certain cases, increasing interest rates or debt instruments that were issued with warrants), we must include in income each tax year a portion of the original issue discount that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same tax year. We may also have to include in income other amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as deferred loan origination fees that are paid after origination of the loan or are paid in non-cash compensation such as warrants or stock. We anticipate that a portion of our income may constitute original issue discount or other income required to be included in taxable income prior to receipt of cash. Further, we may elect to amortize market discount and include such amounts in our taxable income in the current tax year, instead of upon disposition, as an election not to do so would limit our ability to deduct interest expense for tax purposes. 

We invest a portion of our net assets in below investment grade instruments. Investments in these types of instruments may present special tax issues for us. U.S. federal income tax rules are not entirely clear about issues such as when we may cease to accrue interest, original issue discount or market discount, when and to what extent deductions may be taken for bad debts or worthless instruments, how payments received on obligations in default should be allocated between principal and income and whether exchanges of debt instruments in a bankruptcy or workout context are taxable. We will address these and other issues to the extent necessary in order to seek to ensure that we distribute sufficient income to avoid any material U.S. federal income or excise tax. 

&#160; 

Because any original issue discount or other amounts accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income for the tax year of the accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, even though we will not have received any corresponding cash amount. As a result, we may have difficulty meeting the Annual Distribution Requirement necessary to qualify for and maintain RIC tax treatment under Subchapter M of the Code. We may have to sell or otherwise dispose of some of our investments at times and/or at prices we would not consider advantageous, raise additional debt or equity capital or forgo new investment opportunities for this purpose. If we are not able to obtain cash from other sources, we may fail to qualify for RIC tax treatment and thus become subject to corporate-level income tax. 

Although we do not presently expect to do so, we are authorized to borrow funds and to sell or otherwise dispose of assets in order to satisfy distribution requirements. However, under the 1940 Act, we are not permitted to make distributions to our stockholders while our debt obligations and other senior securities are outstanding unless certain &#147;asset coverage&#148; tests are met. See &#147;&#151;Regulation&#151;Senior Securities.&#148; Moreover, our ability to sell or otherwise dispose of assets to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement may be limited by (1) the illiquid nature of our portfolio and/or (2) other requirements relating to our status as a RIC, including the Diversification Tests. If we sell or otherwise dispose of assets in order to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement, we may make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous. 

A portfolio company in which we invest may face financial difficulties that require us to work-out, modify or otherwise restructure our investment in the portfolio company. Any such transaction could, depending upon the specific terms of the transaction, result in unusable capital losses and future non-cash income. Any such transaction could also result in our receiving assets that give rise to non-qualifying income for purposes of the 90% Income Test or otherwise would not count toward satisfying the Diversification Tests. 

Some of the income that we might otherwise earn, such as fees for providing managerial assistance, certain fees earned with respect to our investments, income recognized in a work-out or restructuring of a portfolio investment, or income recognized from an equity investment in an operating partnership, may not satisfy the 90% Income Test. To manage the risk that such income might disqualify us as a RIC for failure to satisfy the 90% Income Test, one or more subsidiary entities treated as U.S. corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes may be employed to earn such income and (if applicable) hold the related asset. Such subsidiary entities will be required to pay U.S. federal income tax on their earnings, which ultimately will reduce the yield to our stockholders on such fees and income. 

Employees 

We do not currently have any employees. Each of our executive officers is a principal, officer or employee of FB Advisor, which manages and oversees our investment operations. In the future, FB Advisor may retain additional investment personnel based upon its needs.
