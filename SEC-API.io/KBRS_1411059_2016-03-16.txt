 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Overview 

KBS Real Estate Investment Trust II, Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) was formed on July 12, 2007 as a Maryland corporation that elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (&#8220;REIT&#8221;) beginning with the taxable year ended December 31, 2008 and it intends to continue to operate in such a manner. The Company has invested in a diverse portfolio of real estate and real estate-related investments. As used herein, the terms &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our&#8221; and &#8220;us&#8221; refer to the Company and as required by context, KBS Limited Partnership II, a Delaware limited partnership (the &#8220;Operating Partnership&#8221;), and their subsidiaries. We conduct our business primarily through our Operating Partnership, of which we are the sole general partner. Subject to certain restrictions and limitations, our business is managed by KBS Capital Advisors LLC (&#8220;KBS Capital Advisors&#8221;), our external advisor, pursuant to an advisory agreement. KBS Capital Advisors conducts our operations and manages our portfolio of real estate and real estate-related investments. Our advisor owns 20,000 shares of our common stock. We have no paid employees. 

On September 27, 2007, we filed a registration statement on Form S-11 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;) to offer a maximum of 280,000,000 shares of common stock for sale to the public, of which 200,000,000 shares were registered in our primary offering and 80,000,000 shares were registered under our dividend reinvestment plan. We ceased offering shares of common stock in our primary offering on December 31, 2010. We sold 182,681,633 &#32;shares of common stock in the primary offering for gross offering proceeds of $1.8 billion . We terminated the offering under our dividend reinvestment plan effective May 29, 2014. We sold 30,903,504 shares of common stock under our dividend reinvestment plan for gross offering proceeds of $298.2 million. Also as of December 31, 2015 , we had redeemed 24,048,952 &#32;of the shares sold in our offering for $235.4 million . 

As of December 31, 2015 , we owned 12 &#32;real estate properties (consisting of 10 &#32;office properties, one &#32;office/flex property and an office campus consisting of eight &#32;office buildings) and one &#32;real estate loan receivable. 

Our focus in 2016 is to: continue to strategically sell assets and make special distributions to stockholders; strategically negotiate lease renewals or new leases that facilitate the sales process and enhance property stability for prospective buyers; and complete major capital improvement projects, such as renovations or amenity enhancements, with the goal of attracting a greater pool of quality buyers. 

Objectives and Strategies 

Our primary investment objectives are: 

&#8226; 

to provide our stockholders with attractive and stable cash distributions; and 

&#8226; 

to preserve and return our stockholders&#8217; capital contributions. 

We have sought and will seek to achieve these objectives by managing our diverse portfolio of real estate and real estate-related investments, which we acquired using a combination of equity raised in our initial public offering and debt financing. We have diversified our portfolio by investment size, investment type, investment risk and geographic region. 

On January 27, 2016, our board of directors formed a special committee (the "Special Committee") composed of all of our independent directors to explore the availability of strategic alternatives involving us. While we conduct this process, we remain 100% focused on managing our properties. 

As part of the process of exploring strategic alternatives, on February 23, 2016, the Special Committee engaged Evercore Group L.L.C. (&#8220;Evercore&#8221;) to act as our financial advisor and to assist the Special Committee with this process. Under the terms of the engagement, Evercore will provide various financial advisory services, as requested by the Special Committee as customary for an engagement in connection with exploring strategic alternatives. Although the Special Committee has engaged Evercore to assist us and the Special Committee with the exploration of strategic alternatives for us, we are not obligated to enter into any particular transaction or any transaction at all. Further, although we have begun the process of exploring strategic alternatives, there is no assurance that the process will result in stockholder liquidity, or provide a return to stockholders that equals or exceeds our estimated value per share. 

&#32;4 

Real Estate Portfolio 

Real Estate Investments 

We have made investments in core properties, which are generally lower risk, existing properties with at least 80% occupancy and minimal near-term lease rollover. As of December 31, 2015 , our portfolio of real estate properties was composed of ten &#32;office properties, one &#32;office/flex property and an office campus consisting of eight &#32;office buildings encompassing 5.2 million &#32;rentable square feet. 

All of our properties are located in the United States. We originally intended to hold our core properties for four to seven years, which we believe is a reasonable period to enable us to capitalize on the potential for increased income and capital appreciation of properties. Our advisor has developed a well-defined exit strategy for each of our investments. Specifically, our advisor assigned a sell date to each asset we acquired prior to its purchase as part of the original business plan for the asset. KBS Capital Advisors continually performs a hold-sell analysis on each asset in order to determine a reasonable time to sell the asset and generate a strong return for our stockholders. Periodic reviews of each asset focus on the remaining available value enhancement opportunities for the asset and the demand for the asset in the marketplace. Economic and market conditions may influence us to hold our investments for different periods of time. We may sell an asset before the end of the expected holding period if we believe that market conditions and asset positioning have maximized its value to us or the sale of the asset would otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. 

&#32;The following charts illustrate the geographic diversification of our real estate investments based on total leased square feet and total annualized base rent as of December 31, 2015 : 

_____________________ 

(1) Annualized base rent represents annualized contractual base rental income as of December 31, 2015 , adjusted to straight-line any contractual tenant concessions (including free rent), rent increases and rent decreases from the lease&#8217;s inception through the balance of the lease term. 

&#32;5 

We have a stable tenant base and we have tried to diversify our tenant base in order to limit exposure to any one tenant or industry. As of December 31, 2015 , our portfolio of real estate properties was 87% &#32;occupied. One tenant leasing space in our portfolio of real estate properties represented more than 10% of our total annualized base rent. See Item 2, &#8220;Properties &#8212; Concentration of Credit Risks.&#8221; 

Our top ten tenants leasing space in our portfolio of real estate properties represented approximately 53.3% of our total annualized base rent as of December 31, 2015 . The chart below illustrates the diversity of tenant industries in our portfolio of real estate properties based on total annualized base rent as of December 31, 2015 :

* &#8220;Other&#8221; includes any industry less than 2% of total. 

As of December 31, 2015 , our highest tenant industry concentrations (greater than 10% of annualized base rent) of our real estate portfolio were as follows:

No other tenant industries accounted for more than 10% of annualized base rent. 

The total cost of our real estate portfolio as of December 31, 2015 &#32;was $1.3 billion. Our real estate portfolio accounted for 97%, 95% and 92% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. 

&#32;6 

Real Estate-Related Investment 

As of December 31, 2015 , we owned one fixed-rate mortgage loan. We originally intended to hold our real estate-related investment until maturity. However, economic and market conditions may influence us to hold it for a different period of time. We may sell our mortgage loan before the end of the expected holding period if we believe that market conditions and asset positioning have maximized its value to us or the sale of the asset would otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. 

The total cost and book value of our real estate-related investment as of December 31, 2015 &#32;were $14.3 million and $14.2 million , respectively. Our real estate-related investment accounted for 3%, 5% and 8% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. The annualized effective interest rate on our real estate-related investment was 7.6%. 

Financing Objectives 

We financed the majority of our real estate and real estate-related investments with a combination of the proceeds we received from our initial public offering and debt. We used debt financing to increase the amount available for investment and to increase overall investment yields to us and our stockholders. As of December 31, 2015 , the weighted-average interest rate on our debt was 3.0%. 

We borrow funds at both fixed and variable rates; as of December 31, 2015 , we had $140.0 million &#32;and $407.5 million &#32;of fixed and variable rate debt outstanding, respectively. Of the variable rate debt outstanding, approximately $265.5 million &#32;was effectively fixed through the use of interest rate swap agreements. The weighted-average interest rates of our fixed rate debt and variable rate debt as of December 31, 2015 &#32;were 3.5% and 2.8%, respectively. The weighted-average interest rate represents the actual interest rate in effect as of December 31, 2015 &#32;(consisting of the contractual interest rate and the effect of interest rate swaps and floors), using interest rate indices as of December 31, 2015 , where applicable. 

The following is a schedule of maturities, including principal amortization payments, for all of our notes payable outstanding as of December 31, 2015 &#32;(in thousands):

We limit our total liabilities to 75% of the cost (before deducting depreciation or other noncash reserves) of all of our tangible assets; however, we may exceed that limit if the majority of the conflicts committee approves each borrowing in excess of this limitation and we disclose such borrowings to our stockholders in our next quarterly report with an explanation from the conflicts committee of the justification for the excess borrowing. We did not exceed this limitation on borrowings during any quarter of 2015. As of December 31, 2015 , our borrowings and other liabilities were approximately 36% &#32;of both the cost (before deducting depreciation or other noncash reserves) and book value (before deducting depreciation) of our tangible assets, respectively. 

Market Outlook - Real Estate and Real Estate Finance Markets 

The following discussion is based on management&#8217;s beliefs, observations and expectations with respect to the real estate and real estate finance markets. 

Current conditions in the global capital markets remain volatile. The slowdown in global economic growth, and the increase in oil production capacity, has had a ripple effect through the energy and commodity markets. Decreasing levels of demand for commodities have led to a weakening of global economic conditions, particularly in emerging market nations. Many nations in the developing world rely on metals, minerals and oil production as the basis of their economies. When demand for these resources drops, the economic environment deteriorates, and deflation becomes a very real risk. Over the past decade the United States has seen a resurgence of the domestic energy markets. The growth of domestic oil and natural gas production helped the U.S. economy rebound from the 2008-2009 recession. During the first quarter of 2016, supply pressures in the energy markets have driven down the price of oil to levels not seen in many years, and U.S. economic growth has slowed. 

&#32;7 

Central bank interventions and the use of monetary policy to combat the lingering effects of the 2008-2009 recession continue to affect the global economy. The U.S. Federal Reserve (the &#8220;FED&#8221;) pursued an accommodative monetary policy that included cutting interest rates and implementing a quantitative easing (&#8220;QE&#8221;) program. In 2015, the U.S. economy continued strengthening, and the FED ceased the QE program and raised the Target Funds rate by 25 basis points. In 2012, Japan embarked on a massive QE program designed to kick start the country&#8217;s economy. The Japanese economy remains weak, with little or no economic growth. In Europe, the European Central Bank (&#8220;ECB&#8221;) announced its own QE program in January 2015. The long awaited announcement led to lower European interest rates and a weakening of the Euro against other currencies. With much of the EU economy still experiencing low economic growth, the ECB is now poised to increase its QE program. While the intent of these policies is to spur economic growth, the size of these programs is unprecedented, and the ultimate impact on the global financial system is unknown. 

In the United States, recent economic data has been mixed. Slow and steady growth in the labor markets has driven unemployment to 4.9% as of January 2016. The labor force participation rate continues to be relatively low and personal income growth has been modest. Consumer spending in the United States has been increasing, and consumer confidence levels are starting to reach levels last seen in the mid-2000&#8217;s. U.S. gross domestic product (&#8220;U.S. GDP&#8221;) has continued to grow. On an annual basis, U.S. GDP growth in 2014 was 2.4%, which was an improvement over 2013&#8217;s growth rate of 1.5%. In 2015 U.S. GDP growth came in at 2.4%, with the trend moving towards slower growth in the first quarter of 2016. 

With the backdrop of increasing levels of global political conflict, and weaker international economic conditions, the U.S. dollar has remained a safe haven currency. The U.S. commercial real estate market has benefited from strong inflows of foreign capital. In 2015 commercial real estate transaction volumes increased 23%, making 2015 the second highest level of investment volume, behind only 2007. Foreign capital flows represent 17% of the 2015 volume. Initially, gateway markets such as New York City and San Francisco benefited from a high demand for commercial properties. Now investors have branched into secondary and tertiary markets, and demand for investments is leading to price increases and an uptick in construction and development. Some fear the potential creation of an asset bubble, particularly in the gateway metropolitan markets. 

Impact on Our Real Estate Investments 

The increased volatility in the global financial markets and the potential increase in U.S. interest rates are introducing a level of uncertainty into our outlook for the performance of the U.S. commercial real estate markets. Currently, both the investing and leasing environments are highly competitive. While there has been an increase in the amount of capital flowing into U.S. real estate markets, which has resulted in an increase in real estate values in certain markets, the uncertainty regarding the economic environment has made businesses reluctant to make long-term commitments, as is evidenced by the lower level of business investment and capital expenditures. Possible future declines in rental rates, slower or potentially negative net absorption of leased space and expectations of future rental concessions, including free rent to renew tenants early, to retain tenants who are up for renewal or to attract new tenants, may result in decreases in cash flows. Historically low interest rates could help offset some of the impact of these potential decreases in operating cash flow for properties financed with variable rate mortgages; however, interest rates likely will not remain at these historically low levels for the remaining life of many of our investments. In fact, the FED increased interest rates in Q4 2015. Currently we expect further increases in interest rates, but are uncertain as to the timing and levels. Interest rates have become more volatile as the global capital markets react to increasing economic and geopolitical risks. 

Impact on Our Real Estate-Related Investment 

Our real estate loan receivable is directly secured by commercial real estate. As a result, our real estate-related investment, in general, has been and likely will continue to be impacted by the same factors impacting our real estate properties. The higher yields and the improving credit position of many U.S. tenants and borrowers have attracted global capital. However, the real estate and capital markets are fluid, and the positive trends can reverse quickly. Current economic conditions remain relatively volatile and can have a negative impact on the performance of collateral securing our loan investment, and therefore may impact the ability of the borrower under our loan to make contractual interest payments to us. 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had a fixed-rate real estate loan receivable with an outstanding principal balance of $14.2 million and a carrying value (including unamortized origination and closing costs) of $14.2 million that matures in 2018. 

&#32;8 

Impact on Our Financing Activities 

In light of the risks associated with potentially volatile operating cash flows from some of our real estate properties, and the possible increase in the cost of financing due to higher interest rates, we may have difficulty refinancing some of our debt obligations prior to or at maturity or we may not be able to refinance these obligations at terms as favorable as the terms of our existing indebtedness. Recent financial market conditions have improved from the bottom of the economic cycle, and short-term interest rates in the U.S. have increased. Market conditions can change quickly, potentially negatively impacting the value of our investments. 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had debt obligations in the aggregate principal amount of $547.5 million &#32;with a weighted-average remaining term of 1.6 years. We had a total of $140.0 million &#32;of fixed rate notes payable and $407.5 million &#32;of variable rate notes payable as of December 31, 2015 . The interest rates on $265.5 million of our variable rate notes payable are effectively fixed through interest rate swap agreements. As of December 31, 2015 , we had a total of $332.0 million of debt obligations scheduled to mature within 12 months of that date. We plan to exercise our extension options available under our loan agreements, pay down or refinance the related notes payable prior to their maturity dates. 

Economic Dependency 

We are dependent on our advisor for certain services that are essential to us, including the management of the daily operations of our real estate and real estate-related investment portfolio; the disposition of real estate and real estate-related investments; and other general and administrative responsibilities. In the event that our advisor is unable to provide any of these services, we will be required to obtain such services from other sources. 

Competitive Market Factors 

The U.S. commercial real estate leasing markets remain competitive. We face competition from various entities for prospective tenants and to retain our current tenants, including other REITs, pension funds, insurance companies, investment funds and companies, partnerships and developers. Many of these entities have substantially greater financial resources than we do and may be able to accept more risk than we can prudently manage, including risks with respect to the creditworthiness of a tenant. As a result of their greater resources, those entities may have more flexibility than we do in their ability to offer rental concessions to attract and retain tenants. This could put pressure on our ability to maintain or raise rents and could adversely affect our ability to attract or retain tenants. As a result, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and ability to pay distributions to our stockholders may be adversely affected. 

We also face competition from many of the types of entities referenced above regarding the disposition of properties. These entities may possess properties in similar locations and/or of the same property types as ours and may be attempting to dispose of these properties at the same time we are attempting to dispose of some of our properties, providing potential purchasers with a larger number of properties from which to choose and potentially decreasing the sales price for such properties. Additionally, these entities may be willing to accept a lower return on their individual investments, which could further reduce the sales price of such properties. This competition could decrease the sales proceeds we receive for properties that we sell, assuming we are able to sell such properties, which could adversely affect our cash flows and the overall return for our stockholders. 

Although we believe that we are well-positioned to compete effectively in each facet of our business, there is enormous competition in our market sector and there can be no assurance that we will compete effectively or that we will not encounter increased competition in the future that could limit our ability to conduct our business effectively. 

&#32;9 

Compliance with Federal, State and Local Environmental Law 

Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous real property owner or operator may be liable for the cost of removing or remediating hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in such property. These costs could be substantial. Such laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. Environmental laws also may impose liens on properties or restrictions on the manner in which properties may be used or businesses may be operated, and these restrictions may require substantial expenditures or prevent us from entering into leases with prospective tenants that may be impacted by such laws. Environmental laws provide for sanctions for noncompliance and may be enforced by governmental agencies or, in certain circumstances, by private parties. Certain environmental laws and common law principles could be used to impose liability for the release of and exposure to hazardous substances, including asbestos-containing materials and lead-based paint. Third parties may seek recovery from real property owners or operators for personal injury or property damage associated with exposure to released hazardous substances and governments may seek recovery for natural resource damage. The cost of defending against claims of environmental liability, of complying with environmental regulatory requirements, of remediating any contaminated property, or of paying personal injury, property damage or natural resource damage claims could reduce our cash available for distribution to our stockholders. 

All of our properties were subject to Phase I environmental assessments prior to the time they were acquired. Some of our properties are subject to potential environmental liabilities arising primarily from historic activities at or in the vicinity of the properties. Based on our environmental diligence and assessments of our properties and our purchase of pollution and remediation legal liability insurance with respect to some of our properties, we do not believe that environmental conditions at our properties are likely to have a material adverse effect on our operations.
