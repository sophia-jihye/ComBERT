 Item 1. Business. 

BUSINESS DESCRIPTION 

Curtiss-Wright Corporation is a global company that delivers highly engineered, critical function products and services to the commercial, defense, power generation, and industrial markets. We were formed in 1929 by the merger of companies founded by the Wright brothers and Glenn Curtiss, both aviation pioneers. We are incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware and headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina. We are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and trade under the symbol CW. 

Our strategy is to be an integrated, global diversified industrial company. We expect that the diversification of the portfolio should mitigate the impact of the volatility of business cycles and allow us to realize growth in new products and markets. We strive for consistent organic sales growth, operating margin expansion, and free cash flow generation, while also maintaining a disciplined and balanced capital deployment strategy. 

We are positioned on high-performance platforms that require technical sophistication. Our technologies are intended to improve operating efficiency and reliability while meeting demanding performance requirements. Our ability to provide high-performance, advanced technologies on a cost-effective basis is fundamental to our strategy to drive increased value to our customers. We compete globally, primarily based on technology and pricing. Our business challenges include price pressure, technological and economic developments, and geopolitical events, such as diplomatic accords. 

Business Segments 

We manage and evaluate our operations based on the products and services we offer and the different markets we serve. Based on this approach we operate through three segments: Commercial/Industrial, Defense, and Power. 

Our principal manufacturing facilities are located in the United States in New York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, and internationally in Canada and the United Kingdom. 

Commercial / Industrial 

Sales in the Commercial/Industrial segment are primarily to the general industrial and commercial aerospace markets and, to a lesser extent, the defense and power generation markets. The businesses in this segment provide a diversified offering of highly engineered products and services including: industrial vehicle products such as electronic throttle control devices and transmission shifters; sensors, controls and electro-mechanical actuation components and utility systems used on commercial aircraft; surface technology services such as shot peening, laser peening, coatings and advanced testing; and valves primarily to the industrial and naval defense markets. Additionally, we provide industrial pressure relief management systems to the oil and gas and petrochemical industries. The businesses within our Commercial/Industrial segment are impacted primarily by general economic conditions which may include consumer consumption or commercial construction rates, as the nature of their products and customers primarily support global industrial, commercial aerospace, oil and gas industries, commercial vehicles, and transportation industries. As commercial industrial businesses, production and service processes do not vary widely and rest primarily within material modification, machining, assembly, and testing and inspection at commercial grade specifications. The businesses distribute products through commercial sales and marketing channels and may be impacted by changes in the regulatory environment. 

Defense 

Sales in the Defense segment are primarily to the defense markets and, to a lesser extent, to the commercial aerospace market. The businesses in this segment provide a diversified offering of products including: Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) &#32; embedded computing board level modules, integrated subsystems, flight test equipment, instrumentation and control systems, turret aiming and stabilization products, and weapons handling systems. The businesses within our Defense segment are impacted primarily by government funding and the direction of U.S. government spending. Our products typically support government entities in aerospace defense, ground defense and naval defense industries. Additionally, we provide avionics and electronics, flight test equipment, and aircraft data management solutions to the commercial aerospace market. Our defense businesses supporting government contractors typically utilize more advanced production and service processes than our commercial businesses and have stringent specifications and performance requirements. The businesses market and distribute products through regulated government contracting channels. 

Power 

Sales in the Power segment are primarily to the nuclear power generation market and, to a lesser extent, to the naval defense market. The businesses in this segment provide a diversified offering of products, including a wide range of hardware, pumps, valves, fastening systems, specialized containment doors, airlock hatches, spent fuel management products, and fluid sealing technologies for nuclear power plants and nuclear equipment manufacturers. We also have been able to leverage existing technology and engineering expertise to provide Reactor Coolant Pump (RCP) technology, pump seals, and control rod drive mechanisms for commercial nuclear power plants. The power generation businesses within our Power segment are impacted by pricing and demand for various forms of energy (e.g. coal, natural gas, oil, and nuclear). The businesses are typically dependent upon the need for new construction, maintenance, and overhaul by nuclear energy providers. The businesses are often subject to changes in regulation impacting demand, consumption, and underlying supply. The production and service processes are primarily material modification, machining, assembly, and testing and inspection that are typical of commercial grade or regulated specifications. The businesses distribute products through commercial sales and marketing channels and may be impacted by changes in the regulatory environment. Additional products within our Power segment include main coolant pumps, power-dense compact motors, generators, and secondary propulsion systems, primarily to the U.S. Navy. The defense businesses in this segment are impacted primarily by government funding and the level of U.S. government spending. 

OTHER INFORMATION 

Certain Financial Information 

For information regarding sales by geographic region, see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part II, Item 8, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

In 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , our foreign operations as a percentage of pre-tax earnings were essentially flat, generating 51% , 51% , and 48% , respectively, of our pre-tax earnings. 

Government Sales 

Our sales to the U.S. Government and foreign government end use represented 36% , 34% , and 34% &#32;of consolidated sales during 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , respectively. 

In accordance with normal U.S. Government business practices, contracts and orders are subject to partial or complete termination at any time at the option of the customer. In the event of a termination for convenience by the government, there generally are provisions for recovery of our allowable incurred costs and a proportionate share of the profit or fee on the work completed, consistent with regulations of the U.S. Government. Fixed-price redeterminable contracts usually provide that we absorb the majority of any cost overrun. In the event that there is a cost underrun, the customer recoups a portion of the underrun based upon a formula in which the customer&#8217;s portion increases as the underrun exceeds certain established levels. 

Generally, long-term contracts with the U.S. Government require us to invest in and carry significant levels of inventory. However, where allowable, we utilize progress payments and other interim billing practices on nearly all of these contracts, thus reducing the overall working capital requirements. It is our policy to seek customary progress payments on certain of our contracts. Where we obtain such payments under U.S. Government prime contracts or subcontracts, the U.S. Government has either title to or a secured interest in the materials and work in process allocable or chargeable to the respective contracts. (See Notes 1.F, 4, and 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, contained in Part II, Item 8, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). 

Customers 

We have hundreds of customers in the various industries we serve. No commercial customer accounted for more than 10% of our total sales during 2015 , 2014 , or 2013 . 

Approximately 30% &#32;of our total sales for 2015 , and 28% &#32;for 2014 , and 2013 , respectively, were derived from contracts with agencies of, and prime contractors to, the U.S. Government. Information on the Company&#8217;s sales to the U.S. Government, including direct sales as a prime contractor and indirect sales as a subcontractor, is as follows:

Patents 

We own and license a number of United States and foreign patents and patent applications, which have been obtained or filed over a period of years. We also license intellectual property to and from third parties. Specifically, the U.S. Government receives licenses in our patents that are developed in performance of government contracts, and it may use or authorize others to use the technology covered by such patents for government purposes. Additionally, unpatented research, development, and engineering skills, some of which have been acquired by the company through business acquisitions, make an important contribution to our business. While our intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important to the operation of our business, we do not consider the success of our business or business segments to be materially dependent upon the timing of expiration or protection of any one or group of patents, patent applications, or patent license agreements under which we now operate. 

Research and Development 

We primarily conduct our own research and development activities. Company-sponsored research and development costs are charged to expense when incurred. Total research and development expenses amounted to $61 million , $68 million , and $64 million &#32;in 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , respectively.
