 ITEM 1. BUSINES S 

Our Business 

TeleTech Holdings, Inc. (&#8220;TeleTech&#8221;, &#8220;the Company&#8221;, &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;our&#8221; or &#8220;us&#8221;) is a customer engagement management service provider that delivers integrated consulting, technology, growth and customer care solutions on a global scale. Our suite of product s and service s allows us to design and deliver engaging, outcome-based customer experiences across numerous interaction channels. Our solutions are supported by 44,000 employees delivering services in 24 countries from 67 delivery centers on six continents. Our revenue for fiscal 2015 was $1,287 million. 

Since our establishment in 1982, we have helped clients strengthen their customer relationships, brand recognition and loyalty through customer engagement solutions. We deliver thought leadership, technology and innovation that create customer strategies designed to differentiate our clients from their competition; data analytics that personalize interactions and increase customer value; and integration services that connect clients&#8217; customer relationship management (&#8220;CRM&#8221;) system to a cloud-based collaboration platform, leading to customer interactions that are seamless and relevant. 

Our services are value-oriented, outcome-based, and delivered on a global scale across all of our business segments: Customer Management Services (&#8220;CMS&#8221;), Customer Growth Services (&#8220;CGS&#8221;), Customer Technology Services (&#8220;CTS&#8221;) and Customer Strategy Services (&#8220;CSS&#8221;). Our integrated customer experience managed services platform differentiates the Company by combining strategic consulting, data analytics, process optimization, system design and integration, operational excellence, and technology solutions and services. 

We have developed tailored expertise in the automotive, communications, financial services, government, healthcare, logistics, media and entertainment, retail, technology, travel and transportation industries. We target customer-focused industry leaders in the Global 1000 and serve approximately 300 global clients. 

To improve our competitive position in a rapidly changing market and stay strategically relevant to our clients, we continue to invest in innovation and growth businesses, diversifying our heritage business process outsourcing services of our CMS segment into higher-value consulting, data analytics, digital marketing and technology-enabled services. Of the $1,287 million in revenue we reported in 2015 , approximately 29% or $373 million came from the CGS, CTS and CSS segments (our &#8220;Emerging Segments&#8221;), focused on customer-centric strategy, growth or technology-based services, with the remainder of our revenue coming from the heritage business process outsourcing focused CMS segment. 

Consistent with our growth and diversification strategy, we continue to invest in technology differentiation, analytics, cloud computing and digital marketing. We also invest in businesses that accelerate our strategy: in 2014, we acquired Sofica Group, a Bulgarian customer management services company which provides our clients with the capabilities of 18 additional languages while contributing to the geographic and time zone diversity of our footprint; and rogenSi, a global leadership, change management and sales consulting company that further diversifies our consulting offerings.

Our strong balance sheet, cash flows from operations and access to debt and capital markets have historically provide d us the financial flexibility to effectively fund our organic growth, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions and incremental investments. Additionally, we continue to return capital to our shareholders via an ongoing stock repurchase program and regular semi-annual dividends . As of December 31, 2015 , our cumulative authorized repurchase allowance was $662.3 million, of which we repurchased 42.8 million shares for $642.8 million. For the period from January 1, &#160; 201 6 &#160; through March 7, 2016 , we &#160; purchased 217,346 additional shares at a cost of $5.6 million. The stock repurchase program does not have an expiration date. Effective February 18 , 201 6 , the Board of Dire ctors authorized an increase in the share repurchase allowance of $ 25 &#160; million . 

On February 24, 2015 , our Board of Directors adopted a dividend policy, with the intent to distribute a periodic cash dividend to stockholders of our common stock, after consideration of, among other things, TeleTech&#8217;s performance, cash flows, capital needs and liquidity factors. Given our cash flow generation and balance sheet strength, we believe cash dividends and early returns to shareholders through share repurchases, in balance with our investments in innovation and strategic acquisitions, align shareholder interests with the needs of the Company. The initial dividend of $0.18 per common share was paid on March 16, 2015 to shareholders of record as of March 6, 2015. An additional dividend of $0.18 per common share was paid on October 14, 2015 to shareholders of record as of September 30, 2015. Effective February 18, 2016, the Board of Directors authorized an increase in the semi-annual dividend to $0.18 5 per common share , &#160; payable on A pril 15, 2016 &#160; to shareholders of record as of March 31, 2016. 

Our Market Opportunity 

We believe that exceptional customer engagement creates sustainable economic value for our clients and our market opportunities are defined by the following trends: 

&#183; 

Increasing focus on customer engagement to sustain competitive advantage. &#8212; Our ability to sustain a competitive advantage based on price or product differentiation has significantly narrowed given the speed of technological innovation. As customers become more connected and widely broadcast their experiences across a variety of social networking channels, the quality of the experience has a profound impact on brand loyalty and business performance. We believe customers are increasingly shaping their attitudes, behaviors and willingness to recommend or stay with a brand on the totality of their experience, including not only the superiority of the product or service but more importantly on the quality of their ongoing service interactions. Given the strong correlation between high customer satisfaction and improved profitability, we believe more companies are increasingly focused on selecting third-party partners, such as TeleTech, who can deliver an analytic-driven, integrated solution that increases the lifetime value of each customer relationship versus merely reducing costs. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Increasing percentage of companies consolidating their customer engagement requirements with the few select partners who can deliver measurable business outcomes by offering an integrated, technology-rich solution. &#8212; The proliferation of mobile communication technologies and devices along with customers&#8217; increased access to information and heightened expectations are driving the need for companies to implement enabling technologies that ensure customers have the best experience across all devices and channels. These two-way interactions need to be received or delivered seamlessly via the customer channel of choice and include voice, email, chat, SMS text, intelligent self serve, virtual agents and the social network. We believe companies will continue to consolidate to third-party partners, like TeleTech, who have demonstrated expertise in increasing brand value by delivering a holistic, integrated customer-centric solution that spans strategy to execution versus the time, expense and often failed returns resulting from linking together a series of point solutions from different providers . 

&#183; 

Focus on speed-to-market by companies launching new products or entering new geographic locations . &#8212; As companies broaden their product offerings and enter new markets, they are looking for partners that can provide speed-to-market while reducing their capital and operating risk. To achieve these benefits, companies select us because of our extensive operating track record, established global footprint, financial strength, commitment to innovation, and our ability to quickly scale infrastructure and complex business processes around the globe in a short period of time while assuring a high-quality experience for their customers. 

Our Strategy 

We aim to grow our revenue and profitability by focusing on higher margin, data and technology-enabled services that drive a superior customer experience and engagement. To that end we plan to continue: 

&#183; 

Building deeper, more strategic relationships with existing global clients to drive enduring, transformational change within their organizations; 

&#183; 

Pursuing new clients who lead their respective industries and who are committed to the customer engagement as a differentiator; 

&#183; 

Investment in our Global Markets and Industries sales leadership team; 

&#183; 

Executing strategic acquisitions that further complement and expand our integrated solution; and 

&#183; 

Investing in innovative technology-enabled platforms and innovating through proprietary technology advancements, broader and globally protected intellectual property, and process optimization. 

Our Integrated Service Offerings and Business Segments 

We have four operating and reportable segments, which provide an integrated set of services including : 

Customer Strategy Services 

We typically begin by engaging our clients at a strategic level. Through our strategy, change management and analytics-driven consulting expertise, we help our clients design, build and execute their customer engagement strategies. We help our clients to better understand and predict their customers&#8217; behaviors and preferences along with their current and future economic value. Using proprietary analytic models, we provide the insight clients need to build the business case for customer centricity, to better optimize their marketing spend and then work alongside them to help implement our recommendations. A key component of this segment involves instilling a high performance culture through management and leadership alignment and process optimization. 

&#160;

Customer Technology Services 

Once the design of the customer engagement is completed, our ability to architect, deploy and host or manage the client&#8217;s customer management environments becomes a key enabler to achieving and sustaining the client&#8217;s customer engagement vision. Given the proliferation of mobile communication technologies and devices, we enable our clients&#8217; operations to interact with their customers across the growing array of channels including email, social networks, mobile, web, SMS text, voice and chat. We design, implement and manage cloud, on-premise or hybrid customer management environments to deliver a consistent and superior experience across all touch points on a global scale that we believe result in higher quality, lower costs and reduced risk for our clients. Through our proprietary Humanify&#8482; technology, we also provide data-driven context aware SaaS-based solutions that link customers seamlessly and directly to appropriate resources, any time and across any channel. 

Customer Management Services 

We design and manage clients&#8217; front-to-back office processes to deliver just-in-time, personalized, multi-channel interactions. Our front-office solutions seamlessly integrate voice, chat, email, e-commerce and social media to optimize the customer experience for our clients. In addition, we manage certain client back-office processes to enhance their customer-centric view of relationships and maximize operating efficiencies. Our delivery of integrated business processes via our onshore, offshore or work-from-home associates reduces operating costs and allows customer needs to be met more quickly and efficiently, resulting in higher satisfaction, brand loyalty and a stronger competitive position for our clients. 

Customer Growth Services 

We offer integrated sales and marketing solutions to help our clients boost revenue in new, fragmented or underpenetrated business-to-consumer or business-to-business markets. We deliver approximately $ 2 billion in client revenue annually via the acquisition, growth and retention of customers through a combination of our highly trained, client-dedicated sales professionals and our proprietary Revana Analytic Multichannel Platform TM . This platform continuously aggregates individual customer information across all channels into one holistic view so as to ensure more relevant and personalized communications. As a result of our acquisition of the digital agency WebMetro, we have developed an integrated marketing-to-sales platform that links online searches to live sales through a closed loop, multichannel interface. This platform uses proprietary tools and methodology to capture and use more than 400 marketing and sales data points to engage with customers in relevant conversations. 

Based on our clients&#8217; requirements, we provide our services on an integrated cross-business segment and on a discrete basis. 

Additional information with respect to our segments and geographic footprint is included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Our Competitive Strengths 

We believe our integrated suite of services and holistic approach to customer engagement is an industry differentiator. Our end-to-end capabilities, from customer strategy and technology services to customer management and growth services, improve customer outcomes, increase satisfaction and loyalty, strengthen operating effectiveness and efficiencies, and drive long-term growth and profitability for our clients. We also believe that our technological solutions, innovative human capital strategies and globally scaled and deployed best practices are key elements to our continued industry leadership. 

As the complexity and pace of technological change required to deliver a multi-channel customer engagement increases, the successful execution of our principal corporate strategies is based on our competitive strengths, which are briefly described below: 

&#183; 

Our industry reputation and leadership position with over three decades of expertise delivering integrated customer engagement solutions provides our clients with the ability to enable, manage and grow the value of every customer relationship; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Multi-channel, multi-modal solutions that meet the rapidly changing profile of the customer and their heightened expectations; 

&#183; 

Scalable technology and human capital infrastructure using globally deployed best practices to ensure a consistent, high-quality service; 

&#183; 

Tailored and optimized customer care delivery through the use of proprietary workforce hiring, training and performance optimization methodology and tools; and 

&#183; 

Commitment to continued product and services innovation that enhances the strategic capabilities of our clients. 

Technological Excellence 

Our technology platform is based on a secure, private, 100% internet protocol based infrastructure. This architecture enables us to centralize and standardize our worldwide delivery capabilities resulting in improved scalability and quality of delivery for our clients, as well as lower capital, and lower information technology (&#8220;IT&#8221;) operating costs. 

The foundation of this platform is our four IP hosting centers known as TeleTech GigaPOPs&#174;, which are located on three continents. Our GigaPOPs&#174; provide a fully integrated suite of voice and data routing, workforce management, quality monitoring, business analytic and storage capabilities, enabling seamless operations from any location around the globe. This hub and spoke model enables us to provide our services at the lowest cost while increasing scalability, reliability, asset utilization and the diversity of our service offerings. It also provides an effective redundancy to address ordinary course system interruptions and outages due to natural disasters and other force majeure conditions. 

To ensure high end-to-end security and reliability of this critical infrastructure, we monitor and manage the TeleTech GigaPOPs&#174; 24 x 7, 365 days per year from several strategically located global command centers as well as providing redundant, fail-over capabilities for each GigaPOP&#174; to address ordinary course system interruptions and outages due to natural disasters and other force majeure conditions. 

Importantly, this platform has become the foundation for new, innovative offerings including TeleTech&#8217;s cloud-based offerings, TeleTech@Home and our suite of human capital solutions. 

Innovative Human Capital Strategies 

Our globally located, highly trained employees are a crucial component of the success of our business. We have made significant investments in proprietary technologies, management tools, methodologies and training processes in the areas of talent acquisition, learning services, knowledge management, workforce collaboration and performance optimization. These capabilities are the culmination of more than three decades of experience in managing large, global workforces combined with the latest technology, innovation and strategy in the field of human capital management. This capability has enabled us to deliver a consistent, scalable and flexible workforce that is highly engaged in achieving or exceeding our clients&#8217; business objectives. 

Globally Deployed Best Operating Practices 

Globally deployed best operating practices assure that we deliver a consistent, scalable, high-quality experience to our clients&#8217; customers from any of our 67 delivery centers and work from home associates around the world. Standardized processes include our approach to attracting, screening, hiring, training, scheduling, evaluating, coaching and maximizing associate performance to meet our clients&#8217; needs. We provide real-time reporting on performance across the globe to ensure consistency of delivery. In addition, this information provides valuable insight into what is driving customer inquiries, enabling us to proactively recommend process changes to our clients to optimize their customers&#8217; experience. 

&#160;

Our global operating model includes delivery centers in 1 7 countries on six continents that operate 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. New delivery centers are established and existing centers are expanded or scaled down to accommodate anticipated business demands or specific client needs. We continue to expand our capacity in the Philippines and Latin America to leverage demand and favorable cost efficiencies, and are exploring opportunities in Central Europe and Africa to augment our multi-lingual service offerings and continue to diversify our footprint. 

Of the 1 7 countries from which we provide customer management solutions, 11 provide services for onshore clients including the U.S., Australia, Brazil, China, Germany, Ireland, Macedonia, New Zealand, South Africa, Thailand, and the United Kingdom. The total number of workstations in these countries is 12,900 , or 36% of our total delivery capacity. The other six countries provide services, partially or entirely, for offshore clients including Bulgaria, Canada, Costa Rica, Mexico, Poland, and the Philippines. The total number of workstations in these countries is 22,500 or 64% of our total delivery capacity. 

See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a description of the risks associated with our foreign operations. 

Clients 

We develop long-term relationships with Global 1000 companies in customer intensive industries, whose business complexities and customer focus requires a partner that can quickly and globally scale integrated technology and data-enabled services. 

In 2015 , our top five and ten clients represente d 35% and 48% of total revenue, respectively; and one of our clients, Telstra Corporation Limited, represented 10% of our total annual revenue. In several of our operating segments, we enter into long-term relationships which provide us with a more predictable revenue stream. Although most of our contracts can be terminated for convenience by either party, our relationships with our top five clients have ranged from two to 1 9 years including multiple contract renewals for several of these clients. In 2015 , we had a 96 % client retention rate for the combined Customer Management Services and Customer Growth Services segments. 

Certain of our communications clients provide us with telecommunication services through arm&#8217;s length negotiated transactions. These clients cur rently represent approximately 17 % of our total annual revenue. Expenditures under these supplier contracts represent less than one percent of our total operating costs. 

Competition 

We are a diverse, global customer engagement management company. Our competitors vary by geography and business segment, and range from large multinational corporations to smaller, narrowly-focused enterprises. Across our lines of business, the principal competitive factors include: client relationships, technology and process innovation; integrated solutions, operational performance and efficiencies, pricing, brand recognition and financial strength. 

Our strategy in maintaining market leadership is to prudently invest, innovate and provide integrated value-driven services, all centered around customer engagement management. Today, we are executing on a more expansive, holistic strategy by transforming our business into higher-value offerings through organic investments and strategic acquisitions. As we execute, we are differentiating ourselves in the marketplace and entering new markets that introduce us to an expanded competitive landscape. 

In our core customer care and management competency, we primarily compete with the in-house customer management operations of our current and potential clients, as well as other companies that provide customer care and business process outsourcing (&#8220;BPO&#8221;) services, including: Convergys, Sykes, and Teleperformance, among others. As we expand our offerings into customer engagement consulting, technology, and growth, we are competing with smaller specialized companies and divisions of multinational companies, including Bain &#38; Company, McKinsey &#38; Company, Accenture, IBM, AT&#38;T, Interactive Intelligence, LiveOps, inContact, Five9, WPP, Publicis Groupe, Dentsu, Sitel, and others. 

&#160;

Employees 

Our people are our most valuable asset. As of December 31, 2015 , we had 44,000 employees in 24 countries on six continents. Although a small percentage of these employees are hired seasonally to address the fourth quarter and first quarter higher business volumes in retail , healthcare and other seasonal industries, most remain employed throughout the year and work at 67 locations and through our @home environment. Approximately 67 % of our employees are located out side of the U.S. Approximately 15 % of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, most of which are mandated under national labor laws outside of the United States. These agreements are subject to periodic renegotiations and we anticipate that they will be renewed in the ordinary course of business without material impact to our business or in a manner materially different from other companies covered by such industry-wide agreements. 

Research, Innovation, Intellectual Property and Proprietary Technology 

We recognize the value of innovation in our business and are committed to developing leading-edge technologies and proprietary solutions. Research and innovation has been a major factor in our success and we believe that it will continue to contribute to our growth in the future. We use our investment in research and development to create, commercialize and deploy innovative business strategies and high-value technology solutions. 

We deliver value to our clients through, and our success in part depends on, certain proprietary technologies and methodologies. We leverage U.S. and foreign patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark laws as well as confidentiality, proprietary information non-disclosure agreements, and key staff non-competition agreements to protect our proprietary technology. 

As of December 31, 2015 we had 92 patent applications pending in 10 jurisdictions; and own 120 U.S. and non-U.S. patents that we leverage in our operations and as market place differentiation for our service offerings. Our trade name, logos and names of our proprietary solution offerings are protected by their historic use and by trademarks and service marks registered in 59 countries.
