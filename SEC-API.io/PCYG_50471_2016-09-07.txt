ITEM I. 

BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

Park City Group, Inc. (the &#8220; Company &#8221;) is a Software-as-a-Service (&#8220; SaaS &#8221;) provider. The Company&#8217;s technology helps companies to synchronize their systems with those of their trading partners to make more informed business decisions. We provide companies with greater flexibility in sourcing products by enabling them to choose new suppliers and integrate them into their supply chain faster and more cost effectively, and we help them to more efficiently manage these relationships to &#8220;stock less and sell more&#8221;, enhancing revenue while lowering working capital, labor costs and waste. Through our subsidiary, ReposiTrak, Inc. ( &#8220;ReposiTrak&#8221; ), we also help reduce a company&#8217;s potential regulatory, legal, and criminal risk from its supply chain partners by providing a way for them to ensure these suppliers are compliant with food and drug safety regulations , such as the Food Safety Modernization Act (&#8220; FSMA &#8221;) and the Drug Quality and Security Act (&#8220; DQSA &#8221;). 

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s services are delivered though proprietary software products designed, developed, marketed and supported by the Company. These products are designed to provide transparency and facilitate improved business processes among all key constituents in the supply chain, starting with the retailer and moving back to suppliers and eventually to raw material providers. We provide cloud-based applications and services that address e-commerce, supply chain, and compliance activities. The principal customers for the Company's products are multi-store food retail store chains and their suppliers, branded food manufacturers, food wholesalers and distributors, and other food service businesses. 

&#160;

The Company has a hub and spoke business model. We are typically engaged by retailers and distributors ( &#8220;Hubs&#8221; ), which in turn have us engage their suppliers ( &#8220;Spokes&#8221; ) to sign up for our services. The bulk of the Company&#8217;s revenue is from recurring subscription payments typically based on a monthly volume metric between the Hub and the Spoke. We also have a Professional Services business, which conducts customization, implementation, and training, for which revenue is recognized on a percentage-of-completion or pro rata over the life of the subscription, depending on the nature of the engagement. In a few instances the Company will also sell its software in the form of a license. 

&#160;

The Company is incorporated in the state of Nevada. The Company has three subsidiaries: PC Group, Inc. (formerly, Park City Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation), a Utah corporation (98.76% owned), Park City Group, Inc. (formerly, Prescient Applied Intelligence, Inc.), a Delaware corporation (100% owned) and ReposiTrak, Inc., a Utah corporation (100% owned). All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Our principal executive offices of the Company are located at 299 South Main Street, Suite 2370, Salt Lake City, Utah 84111. Our telephone number is (435) 645-2000. Our website address is http://www.parkcitygroup.com , and ReposiTrak&#8217;s website address is http://repositrak.com . 

&#160;

&#160; 

Acquisition of ReposiTrak 

&#160; 

On June 30, 2015, the Company consummated the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding capital stock of ReposiTrak. The accompanying audited consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended June 30, 2015 contain the results of operations of ReposiTrak from June 30, 2015. We issued 873,438 shares of our common stock in connection with this acquisition. As a result of the acquisition of ReposiTrak, we significantly expanded the services we can offer to our customer base. 

We have accounted for the acquisition as the purchase of a business. The assets acquired and the liabilities assumed of ReposiTrak have been recorded at their respective fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is attributed to buyer-specific value resulting from expected synergies, including long-term cost savings, as well as industry relationships that are not included in the fair values of assets. Goodwill will not be amortized. 

The purchase price consisted of the 873,438 shares of our common stock. The fair value of the shares issued was $10,821,897 and was determined using the closing price of our common stock on June 30, 2015. The price paid to acquire ReposiTrak was $10,830,897, approximately $9,000 of which was for direct transaction costs associated with the issuance of equity. The net acquisition cost of $10,799,778, which excludes $31,119 of cash acquired from ReposiTrak, were allocated based on their estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as follows:

Company History 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s technology has its genesis in the operations of Mrs. Fields Cookies co-founded by Randall K. Fields, the Company&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer. The Company began operations utilizing patented computer software and profit optimization consulting services to help its retail clients reduce their inventory and labor costs - the two largest controllable expenses in the retail industry. Because the product concepts originated in the environment of actual multi-unit retail chain ownership, the products are strongly oriented to an operation&#8217;s bottom line results. 

&#160;

&#160; 

The Company was incorporated in the State of Delaware on December 8, 1964 as Infotec, Inc. From June 20, 1999 to approximately June 12, 2001, it was known as Amerinet Group.com, Inc. In 2001, the name was changed from Amerinet Group.com to Fields Technologies, Inc. On June 13, 2001, the Company entered into a &#8220;Reorganization Agreement&#8221; with Randall K. Fields and Riverview Financial Corporation whereby it acquired substantially all of the outstanding stock of Park City Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, which became a 98.67% owned subsidiary. 

On July 25, 2002, Fields Technologies, Inc. changed its name from Fields Technologies, Inc. to Park City Group, Inc. through a merger with Park City Group, Inc., a Nevada corporation, which was organized for that purpose and was also the surviving entity in the merger. As a result, both the parent-holding company (Nevada) and its operating subsidiary (Delaware) were named Park City Group, Inc. In February 2014, Park City Group, Inc. (Delaware) was domesticated in Utah and changed its name to PC Group, Inc. Park City Group, Inc. (Nevada) has no business operations separate from the operations conducted through its subsidiaries, including ReposiTrak, Inc. and Park City Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation , (formerly Prescient Applied Intelligence, Inc. (&#8220; Prescient &#8221;). 

&#160; 

On January 13, 2009, the Company acquired 100% of Prescient, a leading provider of on-demand solutions for the retail marketplace, including both retailers and suppliers. Its solutions capture information at the point of sale, provide greater visibility into real-time demand and turn data into actionable information across the entire supply chain. In February 2014, Prescient changed its name to Park City Group, Inc. The Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements contain the results of operations of Park City Group, Inc. (Delaware). Operations are conducted through this subsidiary. 

ReposiTrak was founded by Leavitt Partners, LP. It was originally incorporated as Global Supply Chain Systems, Inc. on May 17, 2012 and on November 8, 2012 changed its name to ReposiTrak. ReposiTrak became a wholly owned subsidiary of Park City Group, Inc. on June 30, 2015. &#160; ReposiTrak was developed in response to the passage of the FSMA. ReposiTrak helps a company protect its brand and mitigate potential regulatory, legal and criminal risk from its supply chain by helping to ensure that all parties are compliant with best practices and food and drug safety regulations. 

Target Industries Overview 

The Company initially developed its software for supermarkets, convenience stores and other retailers. Following the acquisition of Prescient in 2009, we expanded our offerings to include supply chain solutions focused on large manufacturers, distributors and suppliers in the consumer products industry. With the acquisition of ReposiTrak in 2015, this group was expanded to include manufacturers, distributors and suppliers in the food industry. The Company also provides professional consulting services targeting implementation, assessments, profit optimization and support functions for its application and related products. 

&#160; 

Backdrop 

The U.S. consumer retail sector has faced competitive pressure from a number of significant forces including the rise of online retailers with lower fixed operating costs as well as sector consolidation in many categories. Retailers have responded to these pressures in a number of ways including putting a greater emphasis on specialization within their product mix through initiatives such as local sourcing or the development of in-store brands or private labels. Retailers have also attempted to lower their fixed cost by shifting a greater percentage of their product mix to Direct Store Delivery (&#8220; DSD &#8221;). In addition to differentiated products and increased logistics support, retailers are also increasingly pressuring suppliers to provide direct economic incentives or assistance. 

More recently, there has been a sweeping change in the regulatory environment in which food growers, processors, distributors and retailers compete. The law also provides the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( &#8220;FDA&#8221; ) with new enforcement authorities, it also sets cause for a whole host of potential civil claims. In short, the degree to which the retail food business has moved toward a highly regulated industry is substantial. 

&#160;

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s software and consulting services are designed to address the business problems faced by our customers. Our technology helps retailers to synchronize their business systems with those of their suppliers in order to give a cohesive view of their entire supply chain so as to enable them to make more informed business decisions. Through our cloud-based infrastructure we provide retailers with greater flexibility in sourcing products by enabling them to choose new suppliers and integrate them into their supply chain faster and more cost effectively, and we help retailers to more efficiently manage their relationships with these suppliers so that they can &#8220;stock less and sell more&#8221; lowering working capital and labor costs while also increasing revenue. 

&#160;

ReposiTrak was developed in response to the passage of the FSMA, and the then pending DWSA . ReposiTrak helps a company to protect its brand from the degradation of value that typically results from an outbreak of contamination or other incidents adversely affecting the supply chain as well as mitigates potential regulatory, legal and criminal risk from its supply chain by helping a company to ensure that all parties in its supply chain are compliant with best practices and food and drug safety regulations. 

Solutions and Services 

&#160; 

Advanced Commerce and Supply-Chain Solutions 

The Company&#8217;s primary advanced commerce and supply-chain solutions are Scan Based Trading, ScoreTracker, Vendor Managed Inventory, Store Level Replenishment, Enterprise Supply Chain Planning, Fresh Market Manager and ActionManager&#174;, all of which are designed to aid the retailer and supplier with managing inventory, product mix and labor while improving sales through reduced out of stocks by improving visibility and forecasting. 

&#160;

Food Safety Solutions 

&#160; 

ReposiTrak leverages the technology developed to help a company protect its brand and mitigate potential regulatory, legal and criminal risk from its supply chain by helping to ensure that all parties are compliant with best practices and food and drug safety regulations imposed by the FSMA and DWSA. ReposiTrak&#8482;, is powered by the Company&#8217;s technology, and currently includes three main applications: Vendor Validation, Compliance Management, and Track &#38; Trace. 

&#160; 

Services 

The Company has two services groups: The Business Analytics Group offers business-consulting services to suppliers and retailers in the grocery, convenience store and specialty retail industries. The Professional Services Group provides consulting services to ensure that our solutions are seamlessly integrated into our customers&#8217; business processes as quickly and efficiently as possible. 

During the year ending June 30, 2016, the Company began to embark on a process of converging our legacy Park City supply-chain business with our ReposiTrak food safety business. 

Technology, Development and Operations 

Product Development 

&#160; 

The products sold by the Company are subject to rapid and continual technological change. Products available from the Company, as well as from its competitors, increasingly offer a wider range of features and capabilities. The Company believes that in order to compete effectively in its selected markets, it must provide compatible systems incorporating new technologies at competitive prices. In order to achieve this, the Company has made a substantial commitment to on-going development. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Our product development strategy is focused on creating common technology elements that can be leveraged in applications across our core markets. Except for its supply chain application, which is based on a proprietary architecture, the Company&#8217;s software architecture is based on open platforms and is modular, thereby allowing it to be phased into a customer&#8217;s operations. In order to remain competitive, we are currently designing, coding and testing a number of new products and developing expanded functionality of our current products. 

Operations 

We currently serve our customers from a third-party data center hosting facility. Along with the Company&#8217;s Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements (&#8220; SSAE &#8221;) No. 16 certification Service Organization Control (&#8220; SOC2 &#8221;), the third-party facility is also a SSAE No. 16 &#8211; SOC2 certified location and is secured by around-the-clock guards, biometric screening and escort-controlled access, and is supported by on-site backup generators in the event of a power failure. As part of our current disaster recovery arrangements, all of our customers&#8217; data is currently backed-up in near real-time. Even with the disaster recovery arrangements, our service could be interrupted. 

&#160; 

Customers 

&#160; 

We are currently engaged by customers of all sizes. Our customers primarily include food related consumer goods retailers, suppliers, processors and manufacturers. However, the Company is opportunistic and will offer its solutions to non-food consumer goods related companies as well. No single customers accounted for more than 10% percent of our revenue in fiscal 2016. 

&#160;

Prior to the acquistion of ReposiTrak, our contractual relationship with ReposiTrak generated approximately $3.0 million in subscription revenue and management fees during the year ended June 30, 2015, which amount constituted approximately 21% of the Company&#8217;s total revenue in such year. After acquiring ReposiTrak on June 30, 2015 we fully consolidated its financial results into our financial results. As such, we ceased to recognize subscription revenue and management fees from ReposiTrak, and instead began to recognize ReposiTrak revenue from customer connections directly. ReposiTrak generated $2.2 million in revenue from customer connections during the year ended June 30, 2016. 

&#160; 

Sales, Marketing and Customer Support 

Sales and Marketing 

Through a focused and dedicated sales effort designed to address the requirements of each of its software and service solutions, we believe our sales force is positioned to understand our customers&#8217; businesses, trends in the marketplace, competitive products and opportunities for new product development. Our deep industry knowledge enables the Company to take a consultative approach in working with our prospects and customers. Our sales personnel focus on selling our technology solutions to major customers, both domestically and internationally. 

&#160; 

To date, our primary marketing objectives have been to increase awareness of our technology solutions, generate sales leads and develop new customer relationships. In addition, the sales effort has been directed toward developing existing customers by cross-selling ReposiTrak food safety services to legacy Park City Group accounts as well as introducing our solutions to ReposiTrak customers. To this end, we attend industry trade shows, conduct direct marketing programs, publish industry trade articles and white papers, participate in interviews and selectively advertise in industry publications. 

During the year ending June 30, 2016 the Company began to embark on a process of converging our legacy supply-chain business with our ReposiTrak food safety business. As part of this process, we have begun to reorganize our sale force and reorient our marketing efforts. This process has involved stream lining the sales force in an effort to enable cross-selling by reducing regional account managers and shifting our sales emphasis towards ReposiTrak&#8217;s inside sales team located at our corporate headquarters in Salt Lake City, Utah. We are also considering rebranding some of our services to better reflect the consolidated offering. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Customer Support 

&#160;

Our global customer support group responds to both business and technical inquiries from our customers relating to how to use our products and is available to customers by telephone and email. Basic customer support during business hours is available at no charge to customers who purchase certain Company solutions. Premier customer support includes extended availability and additional services, such as an assigned support representative and/or administrator. Premier customer support is available for an additional fee. Additional support services include developer support and partner support. 

&#160; 

Competition 

The market for the Company&#8217;s products and services is very competitive. We believe the principal competitive factors include product quality, reliability, performance, price, vendor and product reputation, financial stability, features and functions, ease of use, quality of support and degree of integration effort required with other systems. Our supply chain solution competitors include supply chain vendors, major enterprise resource planning (&#8220; ERP &#8221;) software vendors, mid-market ERP vendors and niche players for VMI and SLR. ReposiTrak&#8217;s competitors include a variety of food safety consultants who may help a potential customer build their own in-house solution as well as certain technology component providers. 

We compete with large enterprise-wide software vendors, developers and integrators, business-to-business exchanges, consulting firms, focused solution providers, and business intelligence technology platforms. While our competitors are often considerably larger companies in size with larger sales forces and marketing budgets, we believe that our deep industry knowledge, the breadth and depth of our offerings, and our relationships with key industry, wholesaler, and other trade groups and associations, give us a competitive advantage. Our ability to continually improve our products, processes and services, as well as our ability to develop new products, enables the Company to meet evolving customer requirements. 

Patents and Proprietary Rights 

The Company relies on a combination of trademark, copyright, trade secret and patent laws in the United States and other jurisdictions as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our name. We also enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and other third parties and control access to software, documentation and other proprietary information. 

&#160; 

The Company has been awarded nine U.S. patents, eight U.S. registered trademarks and has 37 U.S. copyrights relating to its software technology and solutions. The Company&#8217;s patent portfolio has been transferred to an unrelated third party, although the Company retains the right to use the licensed patents in connection with its business. However, Company policy is to continue to seek patent protection for all developments, inventions and improvements that are patentable and have potential value to the Company and to protect its trade secrets and other confidential and proprietary information. The Company intends to vigorously defend its intellectual property rights to the extent its resources permit. 

&#160; 

The Company is not aware of any patent infringement claims against it; however, there are no assurances that litigation to enforce patents issued to the Company to protect proprietary information, or to defend against the Company&#8217;s alleged infringement of the rights of others will not occur. Should any such litigation occur, the Company may incur significant litigation costs, Company resources may be diverted from other planned activities, and while the outcome of any litigation is inherently uncertain, any litigation result may cause a materially adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s operations and financial condition. Any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, could divert management attention from executing our business plan and could require us to alter our technology, change our business methods and/or pay monetary damages or enter into licensing agreements. 

&#160;

Employees 

&#160; 

As of June 30, 2016, the Company employed a total of 66 employees. Of these employees, ten are located overseas. The Company plans to continue expanding its offshore workforce to augment its analytics services offerings, expand its professional services and to provide additional programming resources. The employees are not represented by any labor union. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Reports to Security Holders 

&#160; 

The Company is subject to the informational requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Accordingly, it files annual, quarterly and other reports and information with the Securities and Exchange Commission. You may read and copy these reports and other information at the Securities and Exchange Commission's public reference rooms in Washington, D.C. and Chicago, Illinois. The Company&#8217;s filings are also available to the public from commercial document retrieval services and the website maintained by the Securities and Exchange Commission at http://www.sec.gov . 

&#160; 

Government Regulation and Approval 

&#160; 

Like all businesses, the Company is subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, including regulations relating to patent, copyright, and trademark law matters.
