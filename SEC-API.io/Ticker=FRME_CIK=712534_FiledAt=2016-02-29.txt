 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

GENERAL 

First Merchants Corporation (the &#8220;Corporation&#8221;) is a financial holding company headquartered in Muncie, Indiana and was organized in September 1982. The Corporation&#8217;s Common Stock is traded on NASDAQ&#8217;s Global Select Market System under the symbol FRME. The Corporation has one full-service bank charter, First Merchants Bank, National Association (the &#8220;Bank&#8221;), which opened for business in Muncie, Indiana, in March 1893. The Bank also operates Lafayette Bank and Trust, Ameriana Bank, Ameriana Financial Services and First Merchants Trust Company as divisions of First Merchants Bank, N.A. The Bank includes 116 banking locations in twenty-seven Indiana, two Illinois and two Ohio counties. In addition to its branch network, the Corporation&#8217;s delivery channels include ATMs, check cards, remote deposit capture, interactive voice response systems and internet technology. The Corporation&#8217;s business activities are currently limited to one significant business segment, which is community banking.

ACQUISITION AND DIVESTITURE POLICY 

The Corporation anticipates that it will continue its policy of geographic expansion of its banking business through the acquisition of banks whose operations are consistent with its banking philosophy. Management routinely explores opportunities to acquire financial institutions and other financial services-related businesses and to enter into strategic alliances to expand the scope of its services and its customer base. 

On December 31, 2015, the Corporation acquired 100 percent of Ameriana Bancorp ("Ameriana"). Ameriana was headquartered in New Castle, Indiana and had 13 full service banking centers in east central and central Indiana. Pursuant to the merger agreement, shareholders of Ameriana received .9037 shares of the Corporation's common stock for each share of Ameriana Bancorp common stock held. The Corporation issued approximately 2.8 million shares of common stock, which was valued at approximately $70.4 million. 

On June 12, 2015, the Corporation sold all of its stock in First Merchants Insurance Services, Inc., an Indiana corporation ("FMIG"), to USI Insurance Services LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("USI"). The sale price was $18.0 million, of which $16.0 million was paid at closing with the remaining $2.0 million paid through a two-year promissory note. The sale of FMIG generated a gain on sale of $8.3 million. 

On April 17, 2015, the Corporation acquired 100 percent of C Financial Corporation ("C Financial"). C Financial was headquartered in Columbus, Ohio and had 6 full service banking centers serving the Columbus, Ohio market. Pursuant to the merger agreement, shareholders of C Financial received $6.738 in cash for each share of C Financial stock held, resulting in a total purchase price of $14.5 million. 

On November 7, 2014, the Corporation acquired 100 percent of Community Bancshares, Inc. ("Community"). Community was headquartered in Noblesville, Indiana and had 10 full-service banking centers serving central Indiana. Pursuant to the merger agreement, each outstanding share of common stock of Community was converted into the right to receive either (a) 4.0926 shares of the Corporation's common stock, plus cash in lieu of fractional shares; or (b) $85.94 in cash, based upon shareholder elections. The Corporation paid $14.2 million in cash and issued approximately 1.6 million shares of common stock, valued at approximately $35.0 million, for a total purchase price of approximately $49.2 million. 

PART I: ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Effective November 12, 2013, the Corporation acquired 100 percent of CFS Bancorp ("CFS") in an all stock transaction. CFS was headquartered in Munster, Indiana and had 20 banking centers in northwestern Indiana and northeastern Illinois. Pursuant to the merger agreement, the shareholders of CFS received 0.65 percent of a share of the Corporation's common stock for each share of CFS Bancorp common stock held. The Corporation issued approximately 7.1 million shares of common stock, which was valued at approximately $135.6 million. 

Effective February 10, 2012, the Bank assumed substantially all of the deposits and certain other liabilities and acquired certain assets of SCB Bank ("SCB"), a federal savings bank headquartered in Shelbyville, Indiana, from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"), as receiver for SCB, pursuant to the terms of the Purchase and Assumption Agreement - Modified Whole Bank; All Deposits, entered into by the Bank, the FDIC as receiver of SCB and the FDIC. 

Details of the acquisitions can be found in Note 2. ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included as Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

COMPETITION 

The Bank is located in Indiana, Ohio and Illinois counties where other financial services companies provide similar banking services. In addition to the competition provided by the lending and deposit gathering subsidiaries of national manufacturers, retailers, insurance companies and investment brokers, the Bank competes vigorously with other banks, thrift institutions, credit unions and finance companies located within its service areas. 

REGULATION AND SUPERVISION OF FIRST MERCHANTS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Bank Holding Company Regulation 

The Corporation is registered as a bank holding company and has elected to be a financial holding company. It is subject to the supervision of, and regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (&#8220;Federal Reserve&#8221;) under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the &#8220;BHC Act&#8221;), as amended. Bank holding companies are required to file periodic reports with and are subject to periodic examination by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve has issued regulations under the BHC Act requiring a bank holding company to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to the Bank. Thus, it is the policy of the Federal Reserve that a bank holding company should stand ready to use its resources to provide adequate capital funds to the Bank during periods of financial stress or adversity. Additionally, under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (&#8220;FDICIA&#8221;), a bank holding company is required to guarantee the compliance of any subsidiary bank that may become &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221; (as defined in the FDICIA section of this Form 10-K) with the terms of any capital restoration plan filed by such subsidiary with its appropriate federal banking agency. Under the BHC Act, the Federal Reserve has the authority to require a bank holding company to terminate any activity or relinquish control of a non-bank subsidiary (other than a non-bank subsidiary of a bank) upon the determination that such activity constitutes a serious risk to the financial stability of any bank subsidiary. 

The BHC Act requires the Corporation to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before: 

&#8226; 

acquiring direct or indirect control or ownership of any voting shares of any bank or bank holding company if, after such acquisition, the bank holding company will directly or indirectly own or control more than 5 percent of the voting shares of the bank or bank holding company; 

&#8226; 

merging or consolidating with another bank holding company; or 

&#8226; 

acquiring substantially all of the assets of any bank. 

&#160; 

The BHC Act generally prohibits bank holding companies that have not become financial holding companies from (i) engaging in activities other than banking or managing or controlling banks or other permissible subsidiaries, and (ii) acquiring or retaining direct or indirect control of any company engaged in the activities other than those activities determined by the Federal Reserve to be closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks. 

Capital Adequacy Guidelines for Bank Holding Companies 

In July 2013, the United States banking regulators adopted new capital rules which modified the risk-based capital and leverage capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and depository institutions. These rules are commonly known as "Basel III". Basel III was effective for the Corporation on January 1, 2015. Basel III addresses the components of capital and other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions' regulatory capital ratios. Basel III also implements the requirements of Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act to remove references to credit ratings from the federal banking agencies' rules. Certain of the Basel III rules came into effect for the Corporation and the Bank on January 1, 2015, and the balance of the rules are subject to a phase-in period which will continue through 2019. 

Basel III introduced a new capital measure "Common Equity Tier 1" ("CET1"). Basel III specifies that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and "Additional Tier 1 Capital" instruments meeting specified requirements. CET1 capital consists of common stock instruments that meet the eligibility criteria, retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income and common equity Tier 1 minority interest. Basel III also defines CET1 narrowly by requiring that most adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1, and not to the other components of capital. 

Basel III requires the Corporation to maintain minimum amounts and ratio of common equity tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets, as defined in the regulation. Under Basel III, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions, including dividends, the Corporation must hold a capital conservation buffer above the adequately capitalized common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio. The capital conservation buffer is being phased in from zero percent to 2.50 percent by 2019. 

PART I: ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

When fully phased-in on January 1, 2019, Basel III will require banking organizations to maintain: 

&#8226; 

a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of a least 4.5 percent, plus a 2.5 percent "capital conservation buffer" (which is added to the 4.5 percent CET1 as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7.0 percent upon full implementation) 

&#8226; 

a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0 percent, plus the 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 6.0 percent Tier 1 capital ratio as that buffer is phased-in, effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5 percent upon full implementation); 

&#8226; 

a minimum ratio of total capital (Tier 1 plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0 percent, plus the 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 8.0 percent total capital ratio as that buffer is phased-in, effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5 percent upon full implementation); and 

&#8226; 

a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0 percent, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to adjusted average consolidated assets. 

Basel III also provides for a &#8220;countercyclical capital buffer&#8221; that is applicable to only certain covered institutions and is not expected to have any current applicability to the Corporation or the Bank. 

The aforementioned capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer will face limitations on the payment of dividends, common stock repurchases and discretionary cash payments to executive officers based on the amount of the shortfall. 

Basel III provides for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10 percent of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15 percent of CET1. Under Basel III, the Corporation and the Bank were given a one-time election (the &#8220;Opt-out Election&#8221;) to filter out certain accumulated other comprehensive income (&#8220;AOCI&#8221;) components. The AOCI Opt-out Election was made on the March 31, 2015 Call Report and FR Y-9C for the Bank and the Corporation, respectively. 

Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 began on January 1, 2015 and will be phased-in over a five-year period (20 percent per year). The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 at the 0.625 percent level and be phased-in over a four-year period (increasing by that amount on each subsequent January 1, until it reaches 2.5 percent on January 1, 2019). 

Basel III permits banks with less than $15 billion in assets to continue to treat trust preferred securities as Tier 1 capital. This treatment is permanently grandfathered as Tier 1 capital even if the Corporation should ever exceed $15 billion in assets due to organic growth. Should the Corporation exceed $15 billion in assets as the result of a merger or acquisition, then the Tier 1 treatment of its outstanding trust preferred securities will be phased out, but those securities will still be treated as Tier 2 capital. Basel III permits banks with less than $250 billion in assets to choose to continue excluding unrealized gains and losses on certain securities holdings for purposes of calculating regulatory capital. The rules limit a banking organization&#8217;s capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the banking organization does not hold a &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221; consisting of a specified amount of CET1 capital in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. 

Historically, the regulation and monitoring of a bank and bank holding company's liquidity has been addressed as a supervisory matter, without minimum required formulaic measures. The Basel III liquidity framework requires banks and bank holding companies to measure their liquidity against specific liquidity tests that, although similar in some respects to liquidity measures historically applied by banks and regulators for management and supervisory purposes, is now required by regulation. One test, referred to as the liquidity coverage ratio (&#8220;LCR&#8221;), is designed to ensure that the banking entity maintains an adequate level of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets equal to the entity&#8217;s expected net cash outflow for a 30-day time horizon (or, if greater, 25% of its expected total cash outflow) under an acute liquidity stress scenario. The other test, referred to as the net stable funding ratio (&#8220;NSFR&#8221;), is designed to promote more medium- and long-term funding of the assets and activities of banking entities over a one-year time horizon. These requirements are expected to incent banking entities to increase their holdings of U.S. Treasury securities and other sovereign debt as a component of assets and increase the use of long-term debt as a funding source. The NSFR will be subject to an observation period through mid-2016 and, subject to any revisions resulting from the analyses conducted and data collected during the observation period, implemented as a minimum standard by January 1, 2018. These new standards are subject to further rulemaking and their terms may well change before implementation. The federal banking agencies have not proposed rules implementing the Basel III liquidity framework and have not determined to what extent they will apply to U.S. banks that are not large, internationally active banks. 

The following are the Corporation&#8217;s regulatory capital ratios as of December 31, 2015 :

Bank Regulation 

The Bank is supervised, regulated and examined by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the &#8220;OCC&#8221;). The OCC has the authority to issue cease-and-desist orders if it determines that activities of the Bank regularly represent an unsafe and unsound banking practice or a violation of law. Federal law extensively regulates various aspects of the banking business such as reserve requirements, truth-in-lending and truth-in-savings disclosures, equal credit opportunity, fair credit reporting, trading in securities and other aspects of banking operations. Current federal law also requires banks, among other things, to make deposited funds available within specified time periods. 

Bank Capital Requirements 

Capital adequacy is an important indicator of financial stability and performance. The Corporation and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies and are assigned to a capital category. The assigned capital category is largely determined by four ratios that are calculated according to the regulations: total risk-based capital, tier 1 risk-based capital, common equity tier 1 capital, and tier 1 leverage ratios. The ratios are intended to measure capital relative to assets and credit risk associated with those assets and off-balance sheet exposures of the entity. The capital category assigned to an entity can also be affected by qualitative judgments made by regulatory agencies about the risk inherent in the entity's activities that are not part of the calculated ratios. 

There are five capital categories defined in the regulations, ranging from well capitalized to critically undercapitalized. Classification of a bank in any of the undercapitalized categories can result in actions by regulators that could have a material effect on a bank's operations. Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, and of tier 1 capital to average assets, or leverage ratio, all of which are calculated as defined in the regulations. Banks with lower capital levels are deemed to be undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized, depending on their actual levels. The appropriate federal regulatory agency may also downgrade a bank to the next lower capital category upon a determination that the bank is in an unsafe or unsound practice. Banks are required to monitor closely their capital levels and to notify their appropriate regulatory agency of any basis for a change in capital category. 

Basel III was effective for the Bank on January 1, 2015. Basel III requires the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratio of common equity tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets, as defined in the regulation. Under Basel III, the Bank elected to opt-out of including accumulated other comprehensive income in regulatory capital. As of December 31, 2015 , the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to be considered well capitalized. 

FDIC Improvement Act of 1991 

The FDICIA requires, among other things, federal bank regulatory authorities to take &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; with respect to banks, which do not meet minimum capital requirements. For these purposes, FDICIA establishes five capital tiers: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;) has adopted regulations to implement the prompt corrective action provisions of FDICIA. 

Basel III revised the "prompt corrective action" regulations by: 

&#8226; 

introducing CET1 ratio requirement at each level (other than critically undercapitalized), with the required CET1 ratio being 6.5 percent for well-capitalized status; 

&#8226; 

increasing the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirement for each category, with the minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio for well-capitalized status being 8.0 percent; and 

&#8226; 

eliminating a provision that provides that a bank with a composite supervisory rating of 1 may have a 3.0 percent leverage ratio and still be well-capitalized. 

The FDICIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distributions (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its parent holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be &#8220;undercapitalized.&#8221; &#8220;Undercapitalized&#8221; banks are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration plan. A bank&#8217;s compliance with such plan is required to be guaranteed by the bank&#8217;s parent holding company. If an &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221; bank fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized. &#8220;Significantly undercapitalized&#8221; banks are subject to one or more restrictions, including an order by the FDIC to sell sufficient voting stock to become "adequately capitalized", requirements to reduce total assets and cease receipt of deposits from correspondent banks, and restrictions on compensation of executive officers. &#8220;Critically undercapitalized&#8221; institutions may not, beginning 60 days after becoming &#8220;critically undercapitalized,&#8221; make any payment of principal or interest on certain subordinated debt or extend credit for a highly leveraged transaction or enter into any transaction outside the ordinary course of business. In addition, &#8220;critically undercapitalized&#8221; institutions are subject to appointment of a receiver or conservator. 

As of December 31, 2015 , the Bank was &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; based on the &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; ratios described above. It should be noted that a bank&#8217;s capital category is determined solely for the purpose of applying the OCC&#8217;s &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; regulations and that the capital category may not constitute an accurate representation of the bank&#8217;s overall financial condition or prospects. 

PART I: ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Volcker Rule 

In December 2013, United States banking regulators adopted final rules implementing the Volcker Rule under the Dodd-Frank Act. The Volcker Rule places certain limitations on the trading activity of insured depository institutions and their affiliates subject to certain exceptions. The restricted trading activity includes purchasing or selling certain types of securities or instruments in order to benefit from short-term price movements or to realize short-term profits. Exceptions to the Volcker Rule include trading in certain U.S. Government or other municipal securities and trading conducted in certain capacities as a broker or other agent, as a fiduciary on behalf of customers, to satisfy a debt previously contracted, repurchase and securities lending agreements and risk-mitigating hedging activities. The Volcker Rule also prohibits banking institutions from having an ownership interest in a hedge fund or private equity fund. The implementation of the new Volcker Rule did not have a material impact on the Corporation or the Bank. 

LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY INITIATIVES TO ADDRESS FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC CRISES 

&#160; 

Small Business Lending Program 

In 2010, Congress established the Small Business Lending Fund (&#8220;SBLF&#8221;) under the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 encouraging lending to small business by providing capital to qualified community banks with assets of less than $10 billion. On September 22, 2011, the Corporation became a participant in SBLF by entering into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the &#8220;Purchase Agreement&#8221;) with the U.S. Department of Treasury ("Treasury"), pursuant to which the Corporation issued 90,782.94 shares of the Corporation&#8217;s Senior Non-Cumulative Perpetual 

Preferred Stock, Series B (the &#8220;Series B Preferred Stock&#8221;), having a liquidation amount per share equal to $1,000, for a total purchase price of $90,782,940. 

&#160; 

The Series B Preferred Stock was entitled to receive non-cumulative dividends, payable quarterly, on each January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1, beginning October 1, 2011. The dividend rate was based on the level of the Bank's lending to small businesses. The Series B Preferred Stock was non-voting, except in limited circumstances, and was issued in a private placement exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 

&#160; 

On January 3, 2013, the Corporation redeemed 22,695.94 shares of the Series B Preferred Stock held by the Treasury at an aggregate redemption price of $22,695,940 plus accrued but unpaid dividends. On July 2, 2013, the Corporation redeemed an additional 34,044 shares of the Series B Preferred Stock held by the Treasury at an aggregate redemption price of $34,044,000 plus accrued but unpaid dividends. On November 22, 2013, the Corporation redeemed the final 34,043 shares of the Series B Preferred Stock held by the Treasury at an aggregate redemption price of $34,043,000 plus accrued but unpaid dividends. This redemption resulted in all of the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock having been redeemed and the Corporation ending its participation in the SBLF program. 

Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 

On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;) into law. The Dodd-Frank Act has had a broad impact on the financial services industry, including significant regulatory and compliance changes. Many of the requirements called for in the Dodd-Frank Act are being implemented over time and continue to be subject to various federal agencies implementing regulations over the course of several years. Although many of the required regulations have been promulgated, there are additional regulations yet to be finalized. The changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may materially impact the profitability of the Corporation&#8217;s business activities, require changes to certain business practices, impose more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage requirements or otherwise adversely affect the business. At a minimum, the Dodd-Frank Act is likely to: 

&#8226; 

increase the cost of operations due to greater regulatory oversight, supervision and examination of banks and bank holding companies, including higher deposit insurance premiums; 

&#8226; 

limit the Corporation&#8217;s ability to raise additional capital through the use of trust preferred securities as new issuances of these securities may no longer be included as Tier 1 capital; 

&#8226; 

reduce the flexibility to generate or originate certain revenue-producing assets based on increased regulatory capital standards; and 

&#8226; 

limit the ability to expand consumer product and service offerings due to anticipated stricter consumer protection laws and regulations. 

The Corporation&#8217;s management is currently taking steps to best prepare for the implementation and to minimize the adverse impact on the business, financial condition and results of operation. 

Deposit Insurance 

The Bank is insured up to regulatory limits by the FDIC; and, accordingly, is subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund administered by the FDIC. The FDIC has adopted regulations establishing a permanent risk-related deposit insurance assessment system. Under this system, the FDIC places each insured bank in one of four risk categories based on (i) the bank&#8217;s capital evaluation, and (ii) supervisory evaluations provided to the FDIC by the bank&#8217;s primary federal regulator. Each insured bank&#8217;s annual assessment rate is then determined by the risk category in which it is classified by the FDIC. 

PART I: ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

When Dodd-Frank became effective, it permanently raised the previous Standard Maximum Deposit Insurance Amount (&#8220;SMDIA") to $250,000. The FDIC insurance coverage limit applies per depositor, per insured depository institution for each account ownership category. 

As of January 1, 2013, noninterest-bearing transaction deposit accounts are no longer insured separately from other accounts at the same FDIC-insured institution. Instead, noninterest-bearing transaction accounts will be added to other accounts, and the aggregate balance insured up to at least the Standard Maximum Deposit Insurance Amount of $250,000, at each institution. 

DIVIDEND LIMITATIONS 

National banking laws restrict the amount of dividends that an affiliate bank may declare in a year without obtaining prior regulatory approval. National banks are limited to the bank&#8217;s retained net income (as defined) for the current year plus those for the previous two years. At December 31, 2015 , the Corporation&#8217;s affiliates (including the Bank and other affiliates) had a total of $29,812,000 &#32;retained net profits available for 2016 &#32;dividends to the Corporation without prior regulatory approval. 

BROKERED DEPOSITS 

Under FDIC regulations, no FDIC-insured depository institution can accept brokered deposits unless it (i) is well capitalized, or (ii) is adequately capitalized and received a waiver from the FDIC. In addition, these regulations prohibit any depository institution that is not well capitalized from (a) paying an interest rate on deposits in excess of 76 basis points over certain prevailing market rates or (b) offering &#8220;pass through&#8221; deposit insurance on certain employee benefit plan accounts unless it provides certain notice to affected depositors. 

INTERSTATE BANKING AND BRANCHING 

Under the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (&#8220;Riegle-Neal&#8221;), subject to certain concentration limits, required regulatory approvals and other requirements, (i) financial holding companies such as the Corporation are permitted to acquire banks and bank holding companies located in any state; (ii) any bank that is a subsidiary of a bank holding company is permitted to receive deposits, renew time deposits, close loans, service loans and receive loan payments as an agent for any other bank subsidiary of that holding company; and (iii) banks are permitted to acquire branch offices outside their home states by merging with out-of-state banks, purchasing branches in other states, and establishing de novo branch offices in other states. 

FINANCIAL SERVICES MODERNIZATION ACT 

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (the &#8220;Financial Services Modernization Act&#8221;) establishes a comprehensive framework to permit affiliations among commercial banks, insurance companies, securities firms, and other financial service providers by revising and expanding the existing BHC Act. Under this legislation, bank holding companies would be permitted to conduct essentially unlimited securities and insurance activities as well as other activities determined by the Federal Reserve Board to be financial in nature or related to financial services. As a result, the Corporation is able to provide securities and insurance services. Furthermore, under this legislation, the Corporation is able to acquire, or be acquired, by brokerage and securities firms and insurance underwriters. In addition, the Financial Services Modernization Act broadens the activities that may be conducted by national banks through the formation of financial subsidiaries. Finally, the Financial Services Modernization 

Act modifies the laws governing the implementation of the Community Reinvestment Act and addresses a variety of other legal and regulatory issues affecting both day-to-day operations and long-term activities of financial institutions. 

A bank holding company may become a financial holding company if each of its subsidiary banks is well capitalized, is well managed and has at least a satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment Act, by filing a declaration that the bank holding company wishes to become a financial holding company. No regulatory approval is required for a financial holding company to acquire a company, other than a bank or savings association, engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature, as determined by the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago approved the Corporation&#8217;s application to become a Financial Holding Company effective September 13, 2000. 

USA PATRIOT ACT 

As part of the USA Patriot Act, signed into law on October 26, 2001, Congress adopted the International Money Laundering Abatement and Financial Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001 (the &#8220;Act&#8221;). The Act authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the heads of other government agencies, to adopt special measures applicable to financial institutions such as banks, bank holding companies, broker-dealers and insurance companies. Among its other provisions, the Act requires each financial institution: (i) to establish an anti-money laundering program; (ii) to establish due diligence policies, procedures and controls that are reasonably designed to detect and report instances of money laundering in United States private banking accounts and correspondent accounts maintained for non-United States persons or their representatives; and (iii) to avoid establishing, maintaining, administering, or managing correspondent accounts in the United States for, or on behalf of, a foreign shell bank that does not have a physical presence in any country. In addition, the Act expands the circumstances under which funds in a bank account may be forfeited and requires covered financial institutions to respond under certain circumstances to requests for information from federal banking agencies within 120 hours. 

Treasury regulations implementing the due diligence requirements were issued in 2002. These regulations required minimum standards to verify customer identity, encouraged cooperation among financial institutions, federal banking agencies, and law enforcement authorities regarding possible money laundering or terrorist activities, prohibited the anonymous use of &#8220;concentration accounts,&#8221; and required all covered financial institutions to have in place an anti-money laundering compliance program. 

PART I: ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

The Act also amended the Bank Holding Company Act and the Bank Merger Act to require the federal banking agencies to consider the effectiveness of a financial institution&#8217;s anti-money laundering activities when reviewing an application under these acts. 

THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT 

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (&#8220;Sarbanes-Oxley Act&#8221;), which became law on July 30, 2002, added new legal requirements for public companies affecting corporate governance, accounting and corporate reporting. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act provides for, among other things: 

&#8226; 

a prohibition on personal loans made or arranged by the issuer to its directors and executive officers (except for loans made by a bank subject to Regulation O); 

&#8226; 

independence requirements for audit committee members; 

&#8226; 

independence requirements for company auditors; 

&#8226; 

certification of financial statements on Forms 10-K and 10-Q reports by the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer; 

&#8226; 

the forfeiture by the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of bonuses or other incentive-based compensation and profits from the sale of an issuer&#8217;s securities by such officers in the twelve-month period following initial publication of any financial statements that later require restatement due to corporate misconduct; 

&#8226; 

disclosure of off-balance sheet transactions; 

&#8226; 

two-business day filing requirements for insiders filing Form 4s; 

&#8226; 

disclosure of a code of ethics for financial officers and filing a Form 8-K for a change in or waiver of such code; 

&#8226; 

the reporting of securities violations &#8220;up the ladder&#8221; by both in-house and outside attorneys; 

&#8226; 

restrictions on the use of non-GAAP financial measures in press releases and SEC filings; 

&#8226; 

the formation of a public accounting oversight board; and 

&#8226; 

various increased criminal penalties for violations of securities laws. 

The SEC was delegated the task of enacting rules to implement various provisions. In addition, each of the national stock exchanges developed new corporate governance rules, including rules strengthening director independence requirements for boards, the adoption of corporate governance codes and charters for the nominating, corporate governance and audit committees. 

ADDITIONAL MATTERS 

The Corporation and the Bank are subject to the Federal Reserve Act, which restricts financial transactions between banks and affiliated companies. The statute limits credit transactions between banks, affiliated companies and its executive officers and its affiliates. The statute prescribes terms and conditions for bank affiliate transactions deemed to be consistent with safe and sound banking practices. It also restricts the types of collateral security permitted in connection with the bank&#8217;s extension of credit to an affiliate. Additionally, all transactions with an affiliate must be on terms substantially the same or at least as favorable to the institution as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non-affiliated parties. 

In addition to the matters discussed above, the Bank is subject to additional regulation of its activities, including a variety of consumer protection regulations affecting its lending, deposit and collection activities and regulations affecting secondary mortgage market activities. 

The earnings of financial institutions are also affected by general economic conditions and prevailing interest rates, both domestic and foreign, and by the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States Government and its various agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve regulates the supply of credit in order to influence general economic conditions, primarily through open market operations in United States Government obligations, varying the discount rate on financial institution borrowings, varying reserve requirements against financial institution deposits, and restricting certain borrowings by financial institutions and their subsidiaries. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve have had a significant effect on the operating results of the Bank in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. 

Additional legislation and administrative actions affecting the banking industry may be considered by the United States Congress, state legislatures and various regulatory agencies, including those referred to above. It cannot be predicted with certainty whether such legislation or administrative action will be enacted or the extent to which the banking industry, the Corporation or the Bank would be affected.

(1) &#32;Average balance of securities is computed based on the average of the historical amortized cost balances without the effects of the fair value adjustment. 

(2) &#32;Tax-exempt securities and loans are presented on a fully taxable equivalent basis, using a marginal tax rate of 35 percent for 2015, 2014 and 2013. These totals equal $10,975, $7,921 and $6,043,

(3) &#32;Non-accruing loans have been included in the average balances.

ANALYSIS OF CHANGES IN NET INTEREST INCOME 

The following table presents net interest income components on a tax-equivalent basis and reflects changes between periods attributable to movement in either the average balance or average interest rate for both earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The volume differences were computed as the difference in volume between the current and prior year multiplied by the interest rate from the prior year. The interest rate changes were computed as the difference in rate between the current and prior year multiplied by the volume from the prior year. Volume/rate variances have been allocated on the basis of the absolute relationship between volume variances and rate variances.

INVESTMENT SECURITIES 

Management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment (&#8220;OTTI&#8221;) at least on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation. The investment securities portfolio is evaluated for OTTI by segregating the portfolio into two general segments and applying the appropriate OTTI model. Investment securities are generally evaluated for OTTI under Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) 320, Investments &#8211; Debt and Equity Securities . However, certain purchased beneficial interest, including certain non-agency government-sponsored mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations are evaluated using the model outlined in ASC 325-10 , Investments - Other . 

In determining OTTI under ASC 320, management considers many factors, including: (1) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (2) the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, (3) whether the market decline was affected by macroeconomic conditions, and (4) whether the Corporation has the intent to sell the debt security or more likely than not, will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery. The assessment of whether an other-than-temporary decline exists involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and is based on the information available to management at a point in time. 

When OTTI occurs, the amount of OTTI recognized in the income statement depends on whether the Corporation intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not that the Corporation will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, less any recognized credit loss. If the intent is to sell, or it is more likely than not that the Corporation will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, less any recognized credit loss, the OTTI shall be recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment&#8217;s amortized cost basis, less any recognized credit loss, and its fair value at the balance sheet date. If the intent is not to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that the Corporation will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis less any recognized credit loss, the OTTI has been separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors. The amount of the total OTTI related to the credit loss is determined based on the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and is recognized in earnings. The amount of the total OTTI related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes. The previous amortized cost basis less the OTTI recognized in earnings becomes the new amortized cost basis of the investment. 

The Corporation&#8217;s management has evaluated all securities with unrealized losses for OTTI as of December 31, 2015 . The evaluations are based on the nature of the securities, the extent and duration of the loss and the intent and ability of the Corporation to hold these securities either to maturity or through the expected recovery period. 

PART I: ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

In determining the fair value of the investment securities portfolio, the Corporation utilizes a third party for portfolio accounting services, including market value input, for those securities classified as Level I and Level II in the fair value hierarchy. The Corporation has obtained an understanding of what inputs are being used by the vendor in pricing the portfolio and how the vendor classified these securities based upon these inputs. From these discussions, the Corporation&#8217;s management is comfortable that the classifications are proper. The Corporation has gained trust in the data for two reasons: (a) independent spot testing of the data is conducted by the Corporation through obtaining market quotes from various brokers on a periodic basis; and (b) actual gains or loss resulting from the sale of certain securities has proven the data to be accurate over time. Fair value of securities classified as Level 3 in the valuation hierarchy were determined using a discounted cash flow model that incorporated market estimates of interest rates and volatility in markets that have not been active. 

The Corporation continues to evaluate the portfolio for OTTI on an ongoing basis. In 2015, the Corporation sold its remaining trust preferred security which had no remaining book value as a result of OTTI of approximately $500,000 taken in 2009. 

The amortized cost, gross unrealized gains, gross unrealized losses and approximate market value of the investment securities at the dates indicated were:

Loans are reclassified to a non-accruing status when, in management&#8217;s judgment, the collateral value and financial condition of the borrower do not justify accruing interest. Interest previously recorded, but not deemed collectible, is reversed and charged against current income. Payments subsequently received on non-accrual loans are applied to principal. 

At December 31, 2015, non-accrual loans and other real estate owned of $31,389,000 and $17,257,000 include assets acquired from Ameriana of $2,229,000 and $5,719,000, respectively. At December 31, 2014, non-accrual loans and other real estate owned of $48,789,000 and $19,293,000 included assets acquired from Community of $5,674,000 and $6,662,000, respectively. At December 31, 2013, non-accrual loans and other real estate owned of $56,402,000 and $22,246,000 include assets acquired from CFS of $22,703,000 and $12,899,000, respectively. At December 31, 2012, non-accrual loans and other real estate owned of $53,399,000 and $13,263,000 include assets acquired from SCB of $4,219,000 and $160,000, respectively. 

PART I: ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Renegotiated loans are loans for which concessions are granted to the borrower due to deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower, resulting in the inability of the borrower to meet the original contractual terms of the loans. These concessions may include interest rate reductions, principal forgiveness, extensions of maturity date or other actions intended to minimize losses. Certain loans restructured may be excluded from restructured loan disclosures in years subsequent to the restructuring if the loans are in compliance with their modified terms. A non-accrual loan that is restructured may remain non-accrual for a period of approximately six months until the borrower can demonstrate their ability to meet the restructured terms. A borrower's performance prior to the restructuring, as well as after, will be considered in assessing whether the borrower can meet the new terms resulting in the loan being returned to accruing status in a shorter or longer period of time than the standard six months. If the borrower&#8217;s performance under the modified terms is not reasonably assured, the loan will remain non-accrual. 

For the year ended December 31, 2015, interest income of $648,000 was recognized on the non-accruing and renegotiated loans listed in the table above, whereas interest income of $2,057,000 would have been recognized under their original loan terms. 

At December 31, 2015, the commercial impaired loan total of $97,527,000 &#32;included $11,365,000 &#32;and $1,841,000 &#32;in loans acquired from Ameriana and C Financial, respectively. At December 31, 2014, the commercial impaired loan total of $116,223,000 included $17,027,000 in loans acquired from Community. At December 31, 2013, the commercial impaired loan total of $119,755,000 included $69,448,000 in loans acquired from CFS. At December 31, 2012, the commercial impaired loan total of $79,179,000 included $17,334,000 in loans acquired from SCB. Commercial impaired loans include non-accrual loans, loans accounted for under ASC 310-30, and loans risk graded as substandard, doubtful and loss that were still accruing but deemed impaired according to the guidance set forth in ASC 310. Also included in impaired loans are accruing loans that are contractually past due 90 days or more and troubled debt restructurings. A loan is deemed impaired under ASC 310 when, based on current information or events, it is probable that all amounts due of principal and interest according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement will not be collected. A specific allowance for losses was not deemed necessary for a subset of the impaired loans totaling $90,975,000, but a specific allowance of $1,842,000 was recorded for the remaining balance of $6,552,000 and is included in the Corporation&#8217;s allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2015. Specific reserves totaling $153,000 were recorded on loans acquired from CFS and Community. No specific allowance was recorded on loans acquired in SCB, C Financial or Ameriana transactions. The average balance of the aforementioned total impaired loans for 2015 was $103,368,000. 

An allowable method for determining impairment is estimating the fair value of collateral on collateral dependent loans. This method requires obtaining a current independent appraisal of the collateral and applying a discount factor to the value. The fair value of real estate is generally based on appraisals by qualified licensed appraisers. The appraisers determine the value of the real estate by utilizing an income or market valuation approach. If an appraisal is not available, the fair value may be determined by using a discounted cash flow analysis. Fair value on other collateral such as business assets is typically ascertained by assessing, either singularly or some combination of, asset appraisals, accounts receivable aging reports, inventory listings and &#32; or customer financial statements. Both appraised values and values based on borrower&#8217;s financial information are discounted as considered appropriate based on age and quality of the information and current market conditions. 

In addition to the impaired loans discussed above, management also identified loans totaling $240,948,000 as of December 31, 2015 that were deemed to be criticized, but not impaired. These loans are not included in the table above, or the impaired loan table in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements. A criticized loan is a loan in which there are concerns regarding the borrower&#8217;s ability to comply with the repayment terms. 

See additional information regarding loan credit quality in Note 5. LOANS AND ALLOWANCE, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included as Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Loan concentrations are considered to exist when there are amounts loaned to multiple borrowers engaged in similar activities, which would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions. As of December 31, 2015, the only concentrations of commercial loans within a single industry (as segregated by North American Industry Classification System &#8220;NAICS code&#8221;) in excess of 10 percent of loans were Lessors of Nonresidential Buildings and Lessors of Residential Buildings and Dwellings. 

LOAN LOSS CHARGE OFF PROCEDURES 

The Corporation maintains an allowance to cover probable credit losses in its loan portfolio. The allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses and decreased by charge offs less recoveries. All charge offs are approved by the senior loan officers or loan committees, depending on the amount of the charge off, and are reported to the Board of Directors. Loans are charged off when a determination is made that all or a portion of a loan is uncollectible. 

PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES 

In banking, loan losses are a cost of doing business. Although management emphasizes the early detection and charge off of loan losses, it is inevitable that certain losses, which have not been specifically identified, exist in the portfolio. Accordingly, the provision for loan losses is charged to earnings on an anticipatory basis, and recognized loan losses net of recoveries are deducted from the established allowance. Over time, all net loan losses are charged to earnings. During the year, an estimate of the expected losses for the year serves as a starting point in determining the appropriate level of the provision for loan losses. Based on management&#8217;s judgment as to the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses, the amount provided in any period may be greater or less than net loan losses for the same period. The determination of the provision for loan losses in any period is based on management&#8217;s continuing review and evaluation of the loan portfolio, and its judgment as to the impact of current economic conditions on the portfolio. The evaluation by management includes consideration of past loan loss experience, changes in the composition of the loan portfolio, and the current condition and amount of loans outstanding. See additional information in the &#8220;Provision and Allowance For Loan Losses&#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included as Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
