 Item 1. Business. 

&#160; 

Power REIT (the &#8220;Registrant&#8221; or the &#8220;Trust&#8221;, and together with its consolidated subsidiaries, &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221;, the &#8220;Company&#8221; or &#8220;Power REIT&#8221;, unless the context requires otherwise) is a Maryland-domiciled real estate investment trust (a &#8220;REIT&#8221;) that holds, develops, acquires and manages real estate assets related to transportation and energy infrastructure in the United States. Within the transportation and energy infrastructure sectors, Power REIT is focused on making new acquisitions of real estate that are or will be leased to renewable energy generation projects, such as utility-scale solar farms and wind farms, that have low or minimal technology risk. 

&#160; 

The Trust is structured as a holding company and owns its assets through four wholly-owned, special purpose subsidiaries that have been formed in order to hold real estate assets, obtain financing and generate lease revenue. During 2015, the Trust dissolved its wholly owned subsidiary, Power REIT Financo LLC, which was necessitated by a credit facility that was retired during 2015. As of December 31, 2015, the Trust&#8217;s assets consisted of approximately 112 miles of railroad infrastructure and related real estate which is owned by its subsidiary Pittsburgh &#38; West Virginia Railroad (&#8220;P&#38;WV&#8221;) and approximately 601 acres of fee simple land leased to a number of solar power generating projects with an aggregate generating capacity of approximately 108 Megawatts (&#8220;MW&#8221;). Power REIT is actively seeking to expand its portfolio of real estate related to renewable energy generation projects and is pursuing investment opportunities that qualify for REIT ownership within solar, wind, hydroelectric, geothermal, transmission and other infrastructure projects.

P&#38;WV is a business trust organized under the laws of Pennsylvania for the purpose of owning railroad assets that are currently leased to Norfolk Southern Railway (&#8220;NSC&#8221;) pursuant to a 99-year lease that became effective in 1964 and is subject to an unlimited number of 99-year renewal periods under the same terms and conditions, including annual rent payments, at the option of NSC (the &#8220;Railroad Lease&#8221;). P&#38;WV&#8217;s assets consist of a railroad line of approximately 112 miles in length, extending through Connellsville, Washington and Allegheny Counties in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, through Brooke County in the State of West Virginia and through Jefferson and Harrison Counties in the State of Ohio, to Pittsburgh Junction in Harrison County, Ohio. There are also branch lines that total approximately 20 miles in length located in Washington and Allegheny Counties in Pennsylvania and Brooke County in West Virginia. NSC pays P&#38;WV base cash rent of $915,000 per year, payable in quarterly installments. In addition, Power P&#38;WV believes NSC is obligated to pay additional rent and other amounts, which is the subject of litigation. (See Item 3, Legal Proceedings).

In order for Power REIT to maintain its REIT qualification, at least 90% of its ordinary taxable annual income must be distributed to shareholders.
