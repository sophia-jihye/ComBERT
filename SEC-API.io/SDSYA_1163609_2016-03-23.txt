 Item 1. Business. 

Overview 

South Dakota Soybean Processors, LLC (&#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) owns and operates a soybean processing plant and a soybean oil refinery in Volga, South Dakota. We also own and operate an oilseed processing plant located approximately five miles east of Miller, South Dakota, which we purchased on December 19, 2014 and have been operating since April 30, 2015. We are owned by approximately 2,200 members, most of whom reside in South Dakota and neighboring states and many of whom deliver and sell soybeans to our plant for processing. 

Our core business consists of processing locally grown soybeans into soybean meal and soybean oil. Approximately 80% of a bushel of soybeans (60 pounds) is processed into soybean meal or hulls, and the remaining 20% is extracted as oil. We sell the soybean meal primarily to resellers, feed mills, and livestock producers as livestock feed. We market and sell multiple grades of soybean oil in either crude or refined format. Crude and refined soybean oil are marketed and sold to the food, biodiesel and chemical industries. Under certain market conditions, we may register and deliver warehouse receipts for crude oil according to the terms and conditions of a Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) soybean oil futures contract. 

We strive to maintain a competitive position in the marketplace by producing high quality products, operating a highly efficient operation at the lowest possible cost, and adding value to our core products to capture larger margins. We continue to search for ways to improve our efficiencies by analyzing new methods of vertical integration, adding value to our products by investing in further processing of our products, and reviewing new applications for our products in the plastics and energy fields. While it is our objective to maximize the issuance of cash distributions to our members from profits generated through operations, we recognize the need to maintain our financial strength by reinvesting for our future. 

General Development of Business 

We were originally organized as a South Dakota cooperative in 1993. As a South Dakota cooperative, we were entitled to single-level, pass-through tax treatment on income generated through our members&#8217; patronage. This allowed us to pass our income onto our members in the form of distributions without first paying taxes at the company level, similar to a partnership. As we grew, however, the continuing availability of this advantageous tax treatment became less secure. As a result, in 2001 the cooperative&#8217;s board of directors approved a plan to reorganize into a South Dakota limited liability company, which became effective on July 1, 2002. 

We began producing soybean meal, crude soybean oil, and soybean hulls in late 1996. Since then we have made significant capital improvements and expanded our business to include the development of vertically integrated product lines and services. In 2002, we completed the construction of a refining facility and began refining crude soybean oil. In 2003, we acquired ownership and management control of Urethane Soy Systems Company (USSC), a company that produced and sold various soybean oil-based polyurethane products, only to close its operations in December 2011 because of poor financial performance. In May 2011, we completed the construction and start-up of a deodorizer at our facility, which allows us to deodorize refined soybean oil and sell the oil directly to customers in the food industry. In December 2014, we purchased an oilseed processing plant located near Miller, South Dakota, which is approximately 100 miles west of our main facility in Volga. The Miller plant allows us to expand into new markets by allowing us to process identity-preserved soybeans, such as GMO-free and organic. 

Industry Information 

The soybean processing industry converts soybeans into soybean meal, soybean hulls and soybean oil. A bushel of soybeans typically yields approximately 44 pounds of meal, 4 pounds of hulls, and 11 pounds of crude oil when processed. While the meal and hulls are mostly consumed by animals, food ingredients are the primary end use for the oil. Crude soybean oil is generally refined for use as salad and cooking oil, baking and frying fat, and to a more limited extent, for industrial uses. Increasingly, the sale of soybean oil for human consumption is impacted by the regulation of trans-fat. Trans-fat is created by the hydrogenation process of products such as soybean oil and plant oils. Since 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has required that food processors disclose the level of trans-fatty acids contained in their products. In addition, various local governments in the U.S. have enacted, or are considering enacting, restrictions on the use of trans-fats in restaurants. As a result, many food manufacturers have reduced the amount of hydrogenated soybean oil they include in their products or switched to other oils containing lower amounts of trans-fat. 

Soybean production is concentrated in the central U.S., Brazil, Argentina and China. In the 2015 harvest season, the U.S. produced approximately 3.89 billion bushels of soybeans, approximately 1% below last year's record crop, and approximately 37% of estimated world production. The USDA estimates that approximately 51% of soybeans produced in the U.S. are processed domestically, 46% are exported as whole soybeans, and 3% are retained for seed and residual use. Historically, there has been an adequate supply of soybeans produced in South Dakota and upper Midwest for the soybean processing industry. In 2015, farm producers in South Dakota produced 235.1 million bushels of soybeans, ranking it seventh among the top producing states in the U.S. as set forth in the following table:

Soybean processing facilities are generally located close to adequate sources of soybeans and a strong demand for meal to decrease transportation costs. Soybean meal is predominantly consumed by poultry and swine in the U.S. On average, exports of soybean meal account for 20% to 30% of total production. 

Soybean oil refineries are also generally located close to soybean processing plants. Oil is shipped throughout the U.S. and for export. The USDA estimates that approximately 64% of domestic oil production is used in food, feed and industrial applications, 25% in biodiesel production, and 11% is exported. 

Soybean crushing and refining margins are cyclical, characteristic of a mature, competitive industry. While the price of soybeans may fluctuate substantially from year to year, the prices of meal and oil generally track that of soybeans, although not necessarily on a one-for-one basis; therefore, margins can be variable. 

The soybean industry continues diligently to introduce soy-based products as bio-based substitutes for various petroleum-based products. These products include biodiesel, soy ink, lubricants, candles and plastics. Biodiesel, a substitute for standard, petroleum-based diesel fuel, has experienced slow but erratic growth in the U.S. From the late-1990s to 2008, biodiesel experienced steady growth, only to stagnate between 2008 and 2010 due to overcapacity in the industry, price volatility in the petroleum oil market, and volatile input costs. Since 2011, the biodiesel market returned to a growth phase following the expansion of the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program and resumption of the biodiesel blenders&#8217; tax credit. 

Products &#38; Services 

Soybean Processing 

We process soybeans at our two crushing plants to extract the soybean oil from the protein and fiber portions of the soybean. Approximately 80% of a soybean bushel is processed and sold as soybean meal or hulls. The remaining percentage of the soybean is extracted as crude soybean oil. The crude soybean oil may be sold directly to customers, or we may process the crude into refined soybean oil for future sale. 

Polyurethane 

Until December 2011, we produced a bio-based polyol called Soyol &#174; &#32;which was used in industrial applications for the polyurethane industry. We sold Soyol &#174; &#32;to USSC, our then wholly-owned subsidiary, which, in turn, marketed and sold Soyol &#174; &#32;and polyurethane resin systems to customers. In December 2011, we closed USSC's operations because of poor financial performance, ultimately dissolving USSC on December 7, 2012. 

Raw Materials and Suppliers 

We purchase soybeans for processing from local soybean producers and elevators, of which there has been adequate supply. In 2015, producers in South Dakota grew and harvested approximately 235 million bushels, compared to 230 million in 2014,182 million in 2013, 141 million bushels in 2012, and 150 million bushels in 2011. Of this amount, we processed 29.9 million bushels in 2015, compared to 28.2 million in 2014, 27.2 million in 2013, 26.2 million bushels in 2012, and 24.4 million bushels of soybeans in 2011. We control the flow of soybeans into our facilities with a combination of pricing and contracting options. Threats to our soybean supply include weather, changes in government programs, and competition from other processors and export markets. 

Utilities 

Volga, South Dakota 

We use natural gas and electricity to operate the crushing and refining plants in Volga, South Dakota. Natural gas is used in the boilers for processing heat and for drying soybeans. NorthWestern Corporation of Sioux Falls, South Dakota, provides for the delivery of natural gas to us on an interruptible basis. We are at risk to adverse price fluctuations in the natural gas market, but we have the capability to use fuel oil and biofuel as a backup for natural gas if delivery is interrupted or market conditions dictate. We also employ forward contracting to offset some of this risk. Our electricity is supplied by the City of Volga, South Dakota. 

Miller, South Dakota 

We use electricity to operate the mechanical press plant in Miller, South Dakota, as natural gas distribution lines are not located in the area. Our electricity is provided by NorthWestern Corporation of Sioux Falls, South Dakota. 

Employees 

We currently employ approximately 108 individuals, all but six of whom are full-time. We have no unions or other collective bargaining agreements. 

Sales, Marketing and Customers 

Our soybean meal is primarily sold to resellers, feed mills, and livestock producers as livestock feed. The meal is primarily sold to customers in the local area (typically within 200 miles of our Volga facility), Western U.S., and Canada. Prior to the addition of our deodorizer in March 2011, we sold our oil primarily as crude soybean oil to various companies in the refining industry which typically process the oil for human consumption. Following the installation of the deodorizer in March 2011, we began selling refined oil directly to the food industry for human consumption and to the biodiesel industry.

On June 1, 2014, our rail line was sold by CP to RCP&#38;E, which is owned and operated by Genesee &#38; Wyoming, Inc. 

All of our assets and operations are domiciled in the U.S., and all of the products sold are produced in the U.S. 

Dependence upon a Single Customer 

None. 

Competition 

We are in direct competition with several other soybean processing companies in the U.S., many of which have significantly greater resources than we do. The U.S. soybean processing industry is comprised primarily of 16 different companies operating 63 plants in the U.S. It is a mature, consolidated and vertically-integrated industry with four companies controlling nearly 84% of the processing industry. Those four companies are Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), 

Bunge, Cargill and Ag Processing (AGP). The U.S. vegetable oil (including soybean oil) refining industry is divided between oilseed processors and independent vegetable oil refiners. The oilseed processors operate approximately 83% of the vegetable oil refining capacity in the U.S., and ADM, Bunge, Cargill and AGP operate approximately 68% of the oil refining capacity. The three largest independent vegetable oil refiners are ACH Foods (in joint venture with ADM), Smuckers (Proctor &#38; Gamble), and ConAgra (Hunt-Wesson). 

We currently operate the only soybean processing plants in South Dakota. AGP, however, recently announced plans to build another plant in northeast South Dakota. We believe that our processing facilities represent approximately 7% of the total soybean processing capacity in the upper Midwest and about 1.3% in the U.S. We plan to maintain our competitive position in the market by producing high quality products and operating highly efficient operations at the lowest possible cost, and adding value to our products. In May 2011 we completed construction of a soybean oil deodorizer. The deodorization unit allows us to further refine the soybean oil into a fully-refined salad oil. This gives us a greatly expanded customer base to which to market the oil, increasing our competitive position in the processing industry.
