 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160;

Company Overview and Principal Products and Services 

&#160;

Perma-Fix Environmental Services, Inc. (the Company, which may be referred to as we, us, or our), a Delaware corporation incorporated in December of 1990, is an environmental and environmental technology know-how company, which provides services through our three reporting segments as discussed below, Treatment, Services, and Medical. 

&#160; 

On April 4, 2014, the Company completed the acquisition of a controlling interest in a Polish Company, a publicly traded shell company on the NewConnect (alternative share market run by the Warsaw Stock Exchange) in Poland and sold to the Polish shell all of the shares of Perma-Fix Medical Corporation, a Delaware corporation organized by the Company (incorporated in January 2014). Perma-Fix Medical Corporation&#8217;s only asset was a worldwide license granted by the Company to use, develop and market the new process and technology developed by the Company in the production of Technetium-99 (&#8220;Tc-99m&#8221;) for medical diagnostic applications. Tc-99m is the most widely used medical isotope in the world. Since the acquired shell company (now named Perma-Fix Medical S.A. or &#8220;PF Medical&#8221;) did not meet the definition of a business under Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) 805, &#8220;Business Combinations&#8221;, the transaction was accounted for as a capital transaction. PF Medical, our majority-owned Polish subsidiary (of which we own approximately 60.5%), continues to perform research and development (&#8220;R&#38;D&#8221;) of its new medical isotope production technology. Currently, nearly all of the world&#8217;s supply of Tc-99m is generated using highly enriched uranium at a small number of highly specialized reactors . Maintenance and unexpected shutdown of these reactors have in the past, created supply shortages throughout the world and the supply shortages are expected to continue as one of the specialized reactors is expected to cease production of and go off-line in the near future. PF Medical&#8217;s new medical isotope production technology does not require the use of uranium which is expected to improve safety and can use standard research and commercial reactors, thereby eliminating the need for special purpose reactors, thus improving the reliability of supply. As of December 31, 2015, PF Medical has not generated any revenue as it is primarily in the R&#38;D stage. In accordance with ASC 280, &#8220;Segment Reporting,&#8221; the Company has determined that the operations of PF Medical meet the definition of a reportable segment. Accordingly, all of the historical numbers presented in the consolidated financial statements have been recast to include the operations of PF Medical as a separate reportable segment (&#8220;Medical Segment&#8221;) . 

&#160; 

We have grown through acquisitions and internal growth. Our goal is to continue to focus on the efficient operation of our facilities and on-site activities, to continue to evaluate strategic acquisitions, to continue the R&#38;D of innovative technologies to expand company service offering and to treat nuclear waste, mixed waste, and industrial waste. In addition, our majority-owned subsidiary, PF Medical, continues to dedicate resources to the R&#38;D of its new medical isotope production technology and to take the necessary steps for eventual submittal of this technology for U.S. Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;) and other regulatory approval and commercialization of this technology. The Company continues to focus on expansion into both commercial and international markets to help offset the uncertainties of government spending in the USA, from which a significant portion of the Company&#8217;s revenue is derived. This includes new services, new customers and increased market share in our current markets. 

&#160; 

Segment Information and Foreign and Domestic Operations and Sales 

The Company has three reportable segments. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) ASC 280, &#8220;Segment Reporting&#8221;, we define an operating segment as: 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

a business activity from which we may earn revenue and incur expenses; 

&#9679; 

whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker &#8220;(CODM&#8221;) to make decisions about resources to be allocated and assess its performance; and 

&#9679; 

for which discrete financial information is available 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

TREATMENT SEGMENT reporting includes: 

&#160; 

&#160; - 

nuclear, low-level radioactive, mixed (waste containing both hazardous and low-level radioactive waste), hazardous and non-hazardous waste treatment, processing and disposal services primarily through four uniquely licensed (Nuclear Regulatory Commission or state equivalent) and permitted (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;) or state equivalent) treatment and storage facilities held by the following subsidiaries: Perma-Fix of Florida, Inc. (&#8220;PFF&#8221;), Diversified Scientific Services, Inc., (&#8220;DSSI&#8221;), Perma-Fix Northwest Richland, Inc. (&#8220;PFNWR&#8221;), and East Tennessee Materials &#38; Energy Corporation (&#8220;M&#38;EC&#8221;). The presence of nuclear and low-level radioactive constituents within the waste streams processed by this segment creates different and unique operational, processing and permitting/licensing requirements; and 

&#160; - 

R&#38;D activities to identify, develop and implement innovative waste processing techniques for problematic waste streams. 

&#160; 

For 2015, the Treatment Segment accounted for $41,318,000 or 66.2% of total revenue from continuing operations, as compared to $42,343,000 or 74.2% of total revenue from continuing operations for 2014. See &#8220;&#8211; Dependence Upon a Single or Few Customers&#8221; for further details and a discussion as to our Segments&#8217; contracts with the federal government or with others as a subcontractor to the federal government. 

&#160;

&#160; - 

a company owned equipment calibration and maintenance laboratory that services, maintains, calibrates, and sources (i.e., rental) of health physics, IH and customized nuclear, environmental, and occupational safety and health (&#8220;NEOSH&#8221;) instrumentation; 

&#160; 

For 2015, the Services Segment accounted for $21,065,000 or 33.8% of total revenue from continuing operations, as compared to $14,722,000 or 25.8% of total revenue from continuing operations for 2014. See &#8220; &#8211; Dependence Upon a Single or Few Customers&#8221; for further details and a discussion as to our Segments&#8217; contracts with the federal government or with others as a subcontractor to the federal government 

&#160; 

MEDICAL SEGMENT reporting includes: R&#38;D costs for the new medical isotope production technology from our majority-owned Polish subsidiary, PF Medical. The Medical Segment has not generated any revenue as it continues to be primarily in the R&#38;D stage. R&#38;D costs consist primarily of employee salaries and benefits, laboratory costs, third party fees, and other related costs associated with the development of new technology. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Our Treatment and Services Segments provide services to research institutions, commercial companies, public utilities, and governmental agencies nationwide, including the U.S. Department of Energy (&#8220;DOE&#8221;) and U.S. Department of Defense (&#8220;DOD&#8221;). The distribution channels for our services are through direct sales to customers or via intermediaries. 

&#160; 

Our corporate office is located at 8302 Dunwoody Place, Suite 250, Atlanta, Georgia 30350. 

&#160; 

Foreign Revenue 

Our consolidated revenue from continuing operations for 2015 and 2014 included approximately $199,000 or 0.3% and $147,000 or 0.3%, respectively, from our United Kingdom operation, Perma-Fix UK Limited (&#8220;PF UK Limited&#8221;). 

&#160; 

Our consolidated revenue from continuing operations for 2015 and 2014 included approximately $279,000 or 0.4% and $1,855,000 or 3.3%, respectively, from customers located in Canada. 

&#160; 

Importance of Patents, Trademarks and Proprietary Technology 

We do not believe we are dependent on any particular trademark in order to operate our business or any significant segment thereof. We have received registration to May 2022 and December 2020, for the service marks &#8220;Perma-Fix Environmental Services&#8221; and &#8220;Perma-Fix&#8221;, respectively. In addition, we have received registration for three service marks for our Safety &#38; Ecology Holdings Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively known as &#8220;Safety and Ecology Corporation&#8221; or &#8220;SEC&#8221;) to periods ranging from 2016 to 2017. 

&#160; 

We are active in the R&#38;D of technologies that allow us to address certain of our customers&#39; environmental needs. To date, our R&#38;D efforts have resulted in the granting of thirteen active patents and the filing of several applications for which patents are pending. These thirteen active patents have remaining lives ranging from approximately three to sixteen years. These active patents granted to the Company include a patent for the new technology for the production of Tc-99m for certain types of medical applications, which we have granted a worldwide exclusive license to a U.S. subsidiary of PF Medical. This patent is effective through March 2032. 

&#160; 

PF Medical has completed successful scale-up of its technology in producing Tc-99m. These tests have confirmed that its proprietary technology has produced clinically useful doses of Tc-99m. PF Medical plans to conduct additional tests in the near future as part of its multi-step validation and fine tuning of its Tc-99m technology. 

&#160; 

Permits and Licenses 

Waste management service companies are subject to extensive, evolving and increasingly stringent federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations. Such federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations govern our activities regarding the treatment, storage, processing, disposal and transportation of hazardous, non-hazardous and radioactive wastes, and require us to obtain and maintain permits, licenses and/or approvals in order to conduct certain of our waste activities. We are dependent on our permits and licenses discussed below in order to operate our businesses. Failure to obtain and maintain our permits or approvals would have a material adverse effect on us, our operations, and financial condition. The permits and licenses have terms ranging from one to ten years, and provided that we maintain a reasonable level of compliance, renew with minimal effort, and cost. Historically, there have been no compelling challenges to the permit and license renewals. We believe that these permit and license requirements represent a potential barrier to entry for possible competitors. 

&#160; 

PFF, located in Gainesville, Florida, operates its hazardous, mixed and low-level radioactive waste activities under a RCRA (&#8220;Resource Conservation and Recovery Act&#8221;) Part B permit, Toxic Substances Control Act (&#8220;TSCA&#8221;) authorization, Restricted RX Drug Distributor-Destruction license, and a radioactive materials license issued by the State of Florida. 

&#160; 

DSSI, located in Kingston, Tennessee, conducts mixed and low-level radioactive waste storage and treatment activities under RCRA Part B permits and a radioactive materials license issued by the State of Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation. Co-regulated TSCA Polychlorinated Biphenyl (&#8220;PCB&#8221;) wastes are also managed for PCB destruction under the EPA Approval effective June 2008. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

M&#38;EC, located in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, performs hazardous, low-level radioactive and mixed waste storage and treatment operations under a RCRA Part B permit and a radioactive materials license issued by the State of Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation. Co-regulated TSCA PCB wastes are also managed under EPA Approvals applicable to site-specific treatment units . 

&#160; 

PFNWR, located in Richland, Washington, operates a low-level radioactive waste processing facility as well as a mixed waste processing facility. Radioactive material processing is authorized under radioactive materials licenses issued by the State of Washington and mixed waste processing is additionally authorized under a RCRA Part B permit with TSCA authorization issued jointly by the State of Washington and the EPA. 

&#160; 

The combination of a RCRA Part B hazardous waste permit, TSCA authorization, and a radioactive materials license, as held by PFF, DSSI M&#38;EC, and PFNWR are very difficult to obtain for a single facility and make these facilities unique. 

&#160; 

PF Medical, our majority-owned Polish subsidiary, owns 100% of a U.S. subsidiary, Perma-Fix Medical Corporation (&#8220;PFMC&#8221;). PFMC holds a license granted to it by the Company to use, develop and market a new process and technology in the production of Tc-99m for medical diagnostic applications. PFMC&#8217;s only asset was this license granted to PFMC by the Company. PF Medical must complete development of its Tc-99m medical diagnostic technology and obtain approvals as to its Tc-99m medical diagnostic application from a certain U.S. governmental agency before it can market its process in the U.S. and may be required to obtain approvals from certain foreign governmental authorities before it can market its process in those respective foreign countries. 

&#160; 

Backlog 

The Treatment Segment of our Company maintains a backlog of stored waste, which represents waste that has not been processed. The backlog is principally a result of the timing and complexity of the waste being brought into the facilities and the selling price per container. As of December 31, 2015, our Treatment Segment had a backlog of approximately $4,698,000, as compared to approximately $9,228,000 as of December 31, 2014. Additionally, the time it takes to process waste from the time it arrives may increase due to the types and complexities of the waste we are currently receiving. We typically process our backlog during periods of low waste receipts, which historically has been in the first or fourth quarter. 

&#160; 

Dependence Upon a Single or Few Customers 

Our Treatment and Services Segments have significant relationships with the federal government, and continue to enter into contracts, directly as the prime contractor or indirectly for others as a subcontractor, with the federal government. The contracts that we are a party to with the federal government or with others as a subcontractor to the federal government generally provide that the government may terminate or renegotiate the contracts on 30 days notice, at the government&#39;s election. Our inability to continue under existing contracts that we have with the federal government (directly or indirectly as a subcontractor) could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. 

&#160; 

We performed services relating to waste generated by the federal government representing approximately $36,105,000 or 57.9% of our total revenue from continuing operations during 2015, as compared to $34,780,000 or 60.9% of our total revenue from continuing operations during 2014. 

&#160; 

Revenue generated by one of the customers (non-government related and excluded from above) in the Services Segment accounted for 10% or more of the total revenues generated from continuing operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015:

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

As our revenues are project/event based where the completion of one contract with a specific customer may be replaced by another contract with a different customer from year to year, we do not believe the loss of one specific customer from one year to the next will generally have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. 

&#160; 

Competitive Conditions 

The Treatment Segment&#8217;s largest competitor is EnergySolutions (&#8220;ES&#8221;) which operates treatment and disposal facilities in Oak Ridge, TN and Clive, UT. Waste Control Specialists (&#8220;WCS&#8221;), which has licensed disposal capabilities in Andrews, TX, has also emerged as a competitor in the treatment market with increasing market share. Perma-Fix now has two options for disposal of treated nuclear waste and thus mitigates prior risk of EnergySolutions providing the only outlet for disposal. Recently, ES signed a definitive agreement to acquire WCS. In the event that this acquisition of WCS by ES is completed, ES will again become the owner of the only privately owned disposal sites for treated commercially generated nuclear waste. In such event, if ES should refuse to accept our nuclear and mixed waste or make demands on us that are unreasonable or cease operations at its sites, such may have a material adverse effect on us for commercial wastes. The Treatment Segment treats and disposes of DOE generated wastes largely at DOE owned sites and thus this potential acquisition should not have any significant adverse impact on our Treatment Segment. Smaller competitors are also present in the market place; however, we believe they do not present a significant challenge at this time. Our Treatment Segment currently solicits business primarily on a North American basis with both government and commercial clients; however, we are also focusing on emerging international markets for additional work. 

&#160; 

We believe that the permitting and licensing requirements, and the cost to obtain such permits, are barriers to the entry of hazardous waste and radioactive and mixed waste activities as presently operated by our waste treatment subsidiaries. If the permit requirements for hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal (&#8220;TSD&#8221;) activities and/or the licensing requirements for the handling of low level radioactive matters are eliminated or if such licenses or permits were made less rigorous to obtain, we believe such would allow companies to enter into these markets and provide greater competition. 

&#160; 

Our Services Segment is engaged in highly competitive businesses in which a number of our government contracts and some of our commercial contracts are awarded through competitive bidding processes. The extent of such competition varies according to the industries and markets in which our customers operate as well as the geographic areas in which we operate. The degree and type of competition we face is also often influenced by the project specification being bid on and the different specialty skill sets of each bidder for which our Services Segment competes, especially projects subject to the governmental bid process. We also have the ability to prime federal government small business procurements (small business set asides). Large businesses are more willing to team with small businesses in order to be part of these often substantial procurements. There are a number of qualified small businesses in our market that will provide intense competition that may provide a challenge to our ability to maintain strong growth rates and acceptable profit margins. For international business there are additional competitors, many from within the country the work is to be performed, making winning work in foreign countries more challenging. If our Services Segment is unable to meet these competitive challenges, it could lose market share and experience an overall reduction in its profits. 

&#160; 

Our Medical Segment operation consists of R&#38;D activities for a new medical isotope production technology at our PF Medical, our majority-owned Polish subsidiary. Due to the world-wide shortage of Tc-99m resulting from limited special purpose reactors and the safety and environmental concerns associated with the current production methodology, a number of companies are also pioneering new methods in the production of medical isotope technology. The path to commercialization of a new medical isotope production technology is tedious, expensive, and is subject to extensive government regulations. Some of these companies, including NorthStar Medical Radioisotopes and Shine Medical Technologies, have entered into this potential market earlier than us, and may be further along in the developmental and commercialization stages. In addition, some companies have greater resources, including funding from government programs and collaboration with others, in the development of medical isotope production technology. If PF Medical is not able to successfully commercialize its new medical isotope technology in order to generate revenues, such may have a material impact to our financial results. See &#8220;Business&#8212;Importance of Patents, Trademarks and Proprietary Technology&#8221; for discussion of current status of development of technology for the production of Tc-99m. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Certain Environmental Expenditures and Potential Environmental Liabilities 

Environmental Liabilities 

We have three remediation projects, which are currently in progress at our Perma-Fix of Dayton, Inc. (&#8220;PFD&#8221;), Perma-Fix of Memphis, Inc. (&#8220;PFM&#8221;), and Perma-Fix South Georgia, Inc. (&#8220;PFSG&#8221;) subsidiaries, which are all included within our discontinued operations. These remediation projects principally entail the removal/remediation of contaminated soil and, in most cases, the remediation of surrounding ground water. Remediation activities at our Perma-Fix of Michigan, Inc. subsidiary (&#8220;PFMI&#8221;) in Brownstown, Michigan, were completed in 2015. These remediation activities are closely reviewed and monitored by the applicable state regulators. 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015, we had total accrued environmental remediation liabilities of $900,000, of which $9,000 is recorded as a current liability, which reflects a decrease of $116,000 from the December 31, 2014 balance of $1,016,000. The net decrease of $116,000 represents payments on remediation projects at PFSG and PFM totaling approximately $78,000 and a reduction in reserve of $38,000 due to completion of remediation activities at our PFMI location. 

&#160; 

No insurance or third party recovery was taken into account in determining our cost estimates or reserves. 

&#160; 

The nature of our business exposes us to significant cost to comply with governmental environmental laws, rules and regulations and risk of liability for damages. Such potential liability could involve, for example, claims for cleanup costs, personal injury or damage to the environment in cases where we are held responsible for the release of hazardous materials; claims of employees, customers or third parties for personal injury or property damage occurring in the course of our operations; and claims alleging negligence or professional errors or omissions in the planning or performance of our services. In addition, we could be deemed a responsible party for the costs of required cleanup of any property, which may be contaminated by hazardous substances generated or transported by us to a site we selected, including properties owned or leased by us. We could also be subject to fines and civil penalties in connection with violations of regulatory requirements. 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

Innovation and technical know-how by our operations is very important to the success of our business. Our goal is to discover, develop and bring to market innovative ways to process waste that address unmet environmental needs. We conduct research internally, and also through collaborations with other third parties. The majority of our research activities are performed as we receive new and unique waste to treat. Our competitors also devote resources to research and development and many such competitors have greater resources at their disposal than we do. PF Medical continues to commit significant resources to the R&#38;D of its medical isotope production technology and to take the necessary steps for eventual submittal of this technology for FDA and other regulatory approval and commercialization of this technology. We have estimated that during 2015 and 2014, we spent approximately $2,302,000 and $1,315,000, respectively, in research and development activities, of which approximately $2,114,000 and $759,000, respectively, were spent by our Medical Segment for the R&#38;D of its medical isotope production technology. 

&#160; 

Number of Employees 

In our service-driven business, our employees are vital to our success. We believe we have good relationships with our employees. As of December 31, 2015, we employed approximately 262 employees, of whom 258 are full-time employees and four are part-time/temporary employees. 

&#160; 

Governmental Regulation &#160; 

Environmental companies, such as us, and their customers are subject to extensive and evolving environmental laws and regulations by a number of national, state and local environmental, safety and health agencies, the principal of which being the EPA. These laws and regulations largely contribute to the demand for our services. Although our customers remain responsible by law for their environmental problems, we must also comply with the requirements of those laws applicable to our services. We cannot predict the extent to which our operations may be affected by future enforcement policies as applied to existing laws or by the enactment of new environmental laws and regulations. Moreover, any predictions regarding possible liability are further complicated by the fact that under current environmental laws we could be jointly and severally liable for certain activities of third parties over whom we have little or no control. Although we believe that we are currently in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to fines, penalties or other liabilities or could be adversely affected by existing or subsequently enacted laws or regulations. The principal environmental laws affecting our customers and us are briefly discussed below. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended (&#8220;RCRA&#8221;) 

RCRA and its associated regulations establish a strict and comprehensive permitting and regulatory program applicable to companies, such as us, that treat, store or dispose of hazardous waste. The EPA has promulgated regulations under RCRA for new and existing treatment, storage and disposal facilities including incinerators, storage and treatment tanks, storage containers, storage and treatment surface impoundments, waste piles and landfills. Every facility that treats, stores or disposes of hazardous waste must obtain a RCRA permit or must obtain interim status from the EPA, or a state agency, which has been authorized by the EPA to administer its program, and must comply with certain operating, financial responsibility and closure requirements. 

&#160; 

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (&#8220;CERCLA,&#8221; also referred to as the &#8220;Superfund Act&#8221;) 

CERCLA governs the cleanup of sites at which hazardous substances are located or at which hazardous substances have been released or are threatened to be released into the environment. CERCLA authorizes the EPA to compel responsible parties to clean up sites and provides for punitive damages for noncompliance. CERCLA imposes joint and several liabilities for the costs of clean up and damages to natural resources. 

&#160; 

Health and Safety Regulations 

The operation of our environmental activities is subject to the requirements of the OSHA and comparable state laws. Regulations promulgated under OSHA by the Department of Labor require employers of persons in the transportation and environmental industries, including independent contractors, to implement hazard communications, work practices and personnel protection programs in order to protect employees from equipment safety hazards and exposure to hazardous chemicals. 

&#160; 

Atomic Energy Act 

The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 governs the safe handling and use of Source, Special Nuclear and Byproduct materials in the U.S. and its territories. This act authorized the Atomic Energy Commission (now the Nuclear Regulatory Commission &#8220;USNRC&#8221;) to enter into &#8220;Agreements with States to carry out those regulatory functions in those respective states except for Nuclear Power Plants and federal facilities like the VA hospitals and the DOE operations.&#8221; The State of Florida (with the USNRC oversight), Office of Radiation Control, regulates the permitting and radiological program of the PFF facility, and the State of Tennessee (with the USNRC oversight), Tennessee Department of Radiological Health, regulates permitting and the radiological program of the DSSI and M&#38;EC facilities. The State of Washington (with the USNRC oversight) Department of Health, regulates permitting and the radiological operations of the PFNWR facility. 

&#160; 

Other Laws 

Our activities are subject to other federal environmental protection and similar laws, including, without limitation, the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act and the TSCA. Many states have also adopted laws for the protection of the environment which may affect us, including laws governing the generation, handling, transportation and disposition of hazardous substances and laws governing the investigation and cleanup of, and liability for, contaminated sites. Some of these state provisions are broader and more stringent than existing federal law and regulations. Our failure to conform our services to the requirements of any of these other applicable federal or state laws could subject us to substantial liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on us, our operations and financial condition. In addition to various federal, state and local environmental regulations, our hazardous waste transportation activities are regulated by the U.S. Department of Transportation, the Interstate Commerce Commission and transportation regulatory bodies in the states in which we operate. We cannot predict the extent to which we may be affected by any law or rule that may be enacted or enforced in the future, or any new or different interpretations of existing laws or rules.
