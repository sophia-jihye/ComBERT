Business 

Overview 

Incorporated in Delaware in 2007, we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel proprietary therapeutics based on hypoxia inducible factor, or HIF, biology and the commercialization of these products for patients with serious unmet medical needs. HIF is the primary regulator of the production of red blood cells, or RBCs, in the body and a potentially novel mechanism for the treatment of anemia secondary to chronic kidney disease, or CKD. Pharmacologic modulation of the HIF pathway may also have broader therapeutic applications in acute renal failure, organ protection, ischemia-reperfusion injury, cancer, ophthalmology, and inflammatory diseases.

Anemia is a serious medical condition in which blood is deficient in RBCs and hemoglobin, each of which is critical in delivering oxygen to tissue. Anemia generally exists when hemoglobin, a protein in RBCs that carries oxygen, is less than 13 g/dL in men or 12 g/dL in women. Untreated anemia is associated with chronic fatigue, increased risk of progression of multiple diseases and death. Anemia is common in patients with CKD, cancer, heart failure, inflammatory diseases and other critical illnesses, as well as in the elderly.

More than 30 million people in the United States have CKD, with estimates that over 1.8 million of these patients suffer from anemia. Anemia from these indications is currently treated by injectable recombinant erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, or rESAs,&#8212;including Epogen &#174; , Procrit &#174; and Aranesp &#174; &#8212; with iron supplementation or RBC transfusion. Based on the reported revenues of companies that market and sell rESAs, we estimate that global sales of injectable rESAs were $7.0 billion in 2014; the vast majority of which were for renal indications.

rESAs are designed to stimulate production of RBCs by binding directly to and saturating erythropoietin, or EPO, receptors. While injectable rESAs and transfusions may be effective in raising hemoglobin levels, they carry significant potential side effects and need to be delivered subcutaneously or intravenously. In particular, injectable rESAs may lead to thrombosis, stroke, myocardial infarction and death. These risks are described in black box warnings on the prescribing information of all products marketed in this class. These safety concerns, which became evident starting in 2006, have led to a significant reduction in the use of injectable rESAs. Today, anemia is either not treated or inadequately treated in the majority of non-dialysis dependent CKD patients. As a result, we believe that a safe, effective, oral therapeutic option will take significant market share and meaningfully grow the market in patients not requiring dialysis. 

Given the burdens of the current standard of care and costs associated with administering an injectable rESA, we believe our lead product candidate, vadadustat, formerly known as AKB-6548, is a promising cost-effective alternative for the treatment of anemia in CKD. Vadadustat is being developed as a once-daily, oral therapy and has successfully completed Phase 2 development demonstrating that vadadustat can safely and predictably raise hemoglobin levels in patients with anemia related to CKD. Vadadustat works by a differentiated mechanism of action that we believe has the potential to be safer than that of injectable rESAs and may offer additional beneficial therapeutics effects beyond anemia including delaying CKD progression. This novel mechanism of action is referred to as HIF prolyl-hydroxylase, or HIF-PH, inhibition. Instead of binding directly to the EPO receptors on cells in the bone marrow, vadadustat leads to activation of critical pathways for hemoglobin and RBC production. This approach mimics the physiological adjustment made by the body when exposed to reduced oxygen levels at higher altitudes.

We recently commenced Phase 3 development of vadadustat in non-dialysis patients. Positive results from our Phase 2b study in non-dialysis CKD patients demonstrated that vadadustat raised hemoglobin levels with no safety signal observed. In December 2015, we began dosing patients in our Phase 3 vadadustat program in non-dialysis patients with anemia related to CKD, PRO 2 TECT, after obtaining feedback from United States and European regulatory authorities regarding the design of the program. If the results from the PRO 2 TECT program support the results observed across our previous clinical studies, including 29,000 days of patient exposure, we anticipate submitting a New Drug Application, or NDA, to the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for vadadustat in 2019.

We have also completed a Phase 2 study of vadadustat for the treatment of anemia in patients undergoing dialysis, which found that vadadustat, dosed either once daily or three times per week, maintained stable hemoglobin levels following conversion from rESA therapy with no safety signal observed. We expect to initiate our Phase 3 vadadustat program in dialysis-dependent CKD patients, INNO 2 VATE, in 2016, anticipating full enrollment by early 2018.

&#160;

&#160;

We have engaged Quintiles, Inc., or Quintiles, as our primary clinical res earch organization, or CRO, for the PRO 2 TECT and INNO 2 VATE programs. We expect the cost of the Phase 3 program to be in the range of $80,000 to $85,000 per patient and we plan to enroll approximately 3,100 patients in the PRO 2 TECT program and approximately 2,600 patients in the INNO 2 VATE program. 

A subset of dialysis-dependent CKD patients have shown an inadequate hemoglobin response despite receiving high doses of rESAs. Previous studies have shown that rESA hyporesponsiveness is associated with poor clinical outcomes including increased mortality risk. By increasing iron mobilization, in addition to increasing erythropoietin levels, vadadustat may allow for a more consistent hemoglobin response in these patients. We expect to generate clinical data in hyporesponsive dialysis-dependent patients by 2017.

If approved by regulatory authorities, we plan to commercialize vadadustat in the United States for the treatment of anemia in patients with CKD. These patients are primarily treated by approximately 7,000 nephrologists, and we believe we can reach most of this market with a specialty sales force of approximately 125 people. In Japan and certain other Asian countries, we plan to commercialize vadadustat through our recently announced collaboration with Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation, or Mitsubishi Tanabe. We intend to seek one or more collaborators to commercialize vadadustat in additional markets. &#160; 

Our second clinical candidate, AKB-6899, is designed as a small molecule HIF-PH inhibitor with potential therapeutic benefit in oncology and ophthalmology. AKB-6899 has demonstrated the ability in vitro to reduce vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF, levels in the presence of hypoxia. In several preclinical mouse models, AKB-6899 has been active in reducing tumor growth and development of metastases. We opened an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, with the FDA at the end of 2015. We expect to commence clinical development of AKB-6899 in 2016 and anticipate completion of the Phase 1 study in oncology in late 2017.

We are led by a team of experienced biopharmaceutical executives with a background in developing and commercializing drugs for the treatment of renal and metabolic disorders. John P. Butler, our CEO, was previously President of Genzyme Corporation&#8217;s renal division which grew to over $1 billion in annual revenue under his leadership, and was Chairman of the Board of the American Kidney Fund, the leading patient advocacy organization for kidney disease patients. Earlier in his career, Mr. Butler held sales and marketing positions at Amgen, working on the early commercial launch of injectable rESAs in the renal anemia market.

Our Strategy 

Our strategy is to develop and deliver novel therapeutics for patients based on HIF biology, beginning with vadadustat for patients with anemia secondary to CKD. The key elements of our strategy are to: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Complete the development of vadadustat for anemia secondary to CKD . We initiated our PRO 2 TECT program in 2015, and expect to initiate the INNO 2 VATE program in 2016. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Obtain regulatory approval of vadadustat for anemia secondary to CKD in the United States, Europe and other markets . We anticipate submitting an NDA in the United States and MAA in Europe for vadadustat by the end of 2019 if the Phase 3 data are favorable. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Commercialize vadadustat in the United States and other territories . We will establish a specialty sales and marketing organization to commercialize vadadustat in the United States. In Japan and certain other Asian countries, we plan to commercialize vadadustat through our collaboration with Mitsubishi Tanabe. We intend to seek one or more collaborators to commercialize vadadustat in additional markets. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Advance AKB-6899 into clinical development. We plan to commence clinical development of AKB-6899, a second HIF-PH inhibitor product candidate, with potential therapeutic benefit in oncology and ophthalmology. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Diversify our pipeline in kidney disease and other HIF-modulated diseases. We expect to grow our pipeline organically and through in-licensing or acquisitions. Reflecting our strategic strengths in both HIF biology and renal disease, we plan to develop therapeutics for the treatment of renal conditions managed by nephrologists, and medical conditions that can be treated or prevented through HIF modulation. 

&#160;

&#160;

Our Product Candidates 

The following chart depicts our HIF-based product candidates, their indications and their current development. 

&#160;

&#160;

Anemia Overview 

Anemia is a serious medical condition in which blood is deficient in RBCs and hemoglobin, leading to inadequate oxygen delivery to tissues and cells throughout the body. RBCs are normally formed in the bone marrow from precursor or progenitor cells. EPO, a hormonal factor primarily produced in the kidney and liver, binds to and activates the EPO receptor on these precursor cells. The activation of the EPO receptor stimulates these cells to divide, differentiate into RBCs that contain hemoglobin, and mobilize into circulation. Hemoglobin is an iron-containing protein in RBCs that transports oxygen to the tissues of the body. 

Anemia generally exists when hemoglobin is less than 13 g/dL in men and 12 g/dL in women. Anemia is common in patients with CKD, cancer, heart failure, inflammatory diseases and other critical illnesses, as well as in the elderly. Untreated anemia is associated with chronic fatigue, increased risk of progression of multiple diseases and death. Increased morbidity (largely due to cardiovascular disease) and mortality are well recognized complications of anemia in patients with CKD. Successful treatment of anemia significantly improves patients&#8217; quality of life and is associated with decreased cardiovascular morbidity, less frequent hospitalizations, and lower mortality risk. 

&#160;

&#160;

Chronic Kidney Disease 

CKD, a common cause of anemia, is a condition in which the kidneys are progressively damaged to the point that they cannot properly filter the blood circulating in the body. This damage causes waste products to build up in the patient&#8217;s blood leading to other health problems, including anemia, cardiovascular and bone disease. CKD patients are classified by the degree of their loss of kidney function as measured by the glomerular filtration rate, or GFR, and albuminuria, the level of protein in urine. As illustrated in the table below, CKD affects more than 30 million people in the United States and the prevalence of anemia increases with the severity of CKD. 

&#160;

&#160;

There are many causes of CKD, the most common of which are diabetes mellitus and hypertension. The prevalence and incidence of CKD is increasing in all segments of the U.S. population, particularly in patients over 65. Risk factors for the development of CKD include concomitant diseases (hypertension, diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease), lifestyle factors (tobacco use and inactivity), family history, aging, and prenatal factors (maternal diabetes mellitus, low birth weight and small-for-gestational-age status). According to a Lancet article published in May 2013, projected worldwide population changes suggest that the potential number of cases of CKD, specifically end-stage, will increase disproportionately in developing countries, such as Japan, China and India, where the numbers of elderly people are expanding. This effect will be enhanced further if the trends of increasing hypertension and diabetes prevalence persist, competing causes of death&#8212;such as stroke and cardiovascular diseases&#8212;are reduced, and access to treatment does not improve. 

The prevalence and severity of anemia in CKD increases as renal function deteriorates. Three principal factors contribute to the development of anemia as CKD progresses: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Peritubular fibroblasts, a type of cell in the kidney, are designed to sense the amount of oxygen carried by the blood. These cells secrete EPO to adjust the production of RBCs and maintain circulating oxygen levels at normal physiologic levels. As kidney disease progresses, the number of peritubular fibroblasts is reduced and EPO secretion is significantly decreased. This decline in EPO leads to a reduction in RBC production. 

&#160;

&#183; 

CKD leads to a shorter average life span for RBCs (70 days) as compared to healthy individuals (90 to 120 days), requiring increased RBC production to keep RBC levels consistent with those of a healthy individual. 

&#160;

&#183; 

The availability of iron to the bone marrow is impaired. Iron is a required component in the formation of hemoglobin, and is essential for the transport of oxygen to the tissues of the body. 

As CKD progresses, the combined effect of decreased RBC production from lower EPO signaling, increased rate of RBC destruction, and reduced iron availability to the bone marrow results in the increased prevalence and severity of anemia. 

&#160;

&#160;

Current Treatments Leave a Substantial Unmet Need &#160; 

Injectable rESAs are currently the standard of care for treating anemia in patients with CKD and must be administered intravenously or subcutaneously along with iron supplements. Based on the reported revenues of companies that market and sell rESAs, we estimate that global sales of injectable rESAs were $7.0 billion in 2014 , as compared to an estimated $12.0 billion in 2006. The 2013 revenues generated in the United States were an estimated $3.6 billion, the vast majority of which were for renal indications . In 2006, data on the risks of rESA use among these patients started to become available, forcing physicians to balance serious safety concerns against the efficacy of rESAs. The safety concerns with injectable rESA use include increased risk of cardiovascular disease as well as a potentially increased rate of tumor progression in patients with cancer. We believe that the decline in market revenue since 2007 is a direct result of these increased safety concerns, as well as reimbursement pressures, and that an opportunity exists for a safer, well-tolerated alternative to replace injectable rESAs as the standard of care for anemia secondary to CKD.

As a result of the safety concerns related to rESA use, patients have been forced to live with lower hemoglobin levels, higher rates of transfusions, and more intravenous iron, or IV iron, use. As a result of the increased use of IV iron and RBC transfusions, patients are also subject to safety risks related to these alternative treatments to injectable rESAs. The risks of RBC transfusions include the development of antibodies to foreign antigens, which may negatively impact candidacy for kidney transplantation, transmission of blood-borne pathogens, and iron overload with chronic transfusions. The risks of IV iron include hypersensitivity reactions, including fatal anaphylactic-type reactions. 

Currently, there is no scientific consensus regarding the cause of the adverse cardiovascular outcomes associated with the use of injectable rESAs to normalize hemoglobin levels. The results of the four major randomized, controlled clinical trials on the treatment of anemia secondary to CKD with rESAs and adjunctive iron supplementation (Normal Hematocrit Trial/NHCT, CREATE, CHOIR and TREAT) all showed an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes. These results were surprising at the time and contradicted the extensive body of data from observational studies that showed reduced mortality and improved health outcomes to be associated with higher hemoglobin levels. 

A number of critical post-hoc analyses of the data from randomized controlled clinical trials have shifted attention to the potential of dose-related toxicity of injectable rESAs in CKD patients as a contributing factor to the reported adverse cardiovascular outcomes, instead of the achieved hemoglobin levels. The graphs below highlight these findings. The first chart explores the relative risk of serious cardiovascular adverse events, including death, hospitalization for heart failure, stroke or myocardial infarction based upon the hemoglobin achieved during the study as well as the weekly injectable rESA dose. The data clearly show that the risk of adverse cardiovascular events was greatest in those patients receiving the highest injectable rESA doses, regardless of the hemoglobin level that was achieved. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The second graph explores the probability of reaching one of several adverse events (death, stroke, heart failure or myocardial infarction) over time for two different groups: 

&#160;

&#183; 

patients who achieve the target hemoglobin level with a low injectable rESA dose, and 

&#160;

&#183; 

patients who do not reach the target hemoglobin level, but receive a higher injectable rESA dose in an effort to reach the target level. 

Both graphs demonstrate that patients achieving higher hemoglobin levels on lower injectable rESA doses have better outcomes than patients receiving higher injectable rESA doses despite lower achieved hemoglobin levels. Therefore, higher injectable rESA doses, not the achieved hemoglobin level, appears to be most strongly correlated with adverse outcomes. 

&#160;

&#160;

The significant safety risks associated with rESAs are outlined in a black-box warning in their prescribing information. This warning arose from numerous events highlighting the safety concerns of injectable rESAs and the response by the FDA, as highlighted below. 

&#160;

&#183; 

In 2007, as a result of concerns associated with administering injectable rESAs to target higher hemoglobin levels, the FDA required that revised warnings, including black-box warnings, be added to the labels of marketed injectable rESAs advising physicians to monitor hemoglobin levels and use the lowest dose of injectable rESA, and increase the hemoglobin concentration to the lowest level sufficient to avoid the need for RBC transfusions. 

&#160;

&#183; 

In November 2007, the FDA found evidence that the use of injectable rESAs to increase hemoglobin to more than 12 g/dL can stimulate progression of some cancers. As a result, injectable rESAs were required to contain black-box labeling for this risk. Following this change in labeling, the use of injectable rESAs in cancer patients has declined significantly. 

&#160;

&#183; 

In late 2009, Amgen announced the results from the Trial to Reduce Cardiovascular Endpoints with Aranesp Therapy, or TREAT, its large, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study of patients with CKD (not requiring dialysis), anemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus. In this study, Aranesp was used to treat anemia to a target hemoglobin level of 13 g/dL, which was higher than the 10 g/dL - 12 g/dL range previously approved by the FDA in the label. Study results 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

failed to show a benefit compared to the placebo control group with regard to composite of time to all-cause mortality or cardiovascular morbidity (including heart failure, heart attack, stroke, or hospitalization for myocardial ischemia) and composite of time to all-cause mortality or chron ic renal replacement therapy. In addition, higher rates of stroke were reported among patients in the 13 g/dL target group compared to the placebo control group. Finally, among a subgroup of patients with a history of cancer at baseline, a statistically si gnificant increase in deaths from cancer was observed in the Aranesp-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

In January 2010, FDA officials published an editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine noting that a number of randomized trials, including TREAT, had attempted to show that using injectable rESAs to raise hemoglobin concentrations to higher targets improves clinical outcomes, but instead suggested the opposite. Accordingly, the article indicated that more conservative hemoglobin targets (well below 12 g/dL), more frequent hemoglobin monitoring, and more cautious dosing should be evaluated. 

&#160;

&#183; 

In February 2010, the FDA required that injectable rESAs be prescribed and used under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to ensure the safe use of the drugs. As part of the REMS, a medication guide explaining the risks and benefits of injectable rESAs must be provided to all patients receiving injectable rESAs for all indications, and the FDA imposed reporting and monitoring obligations on the manufacturers to ensure compliance. 

&#160;

&#183; 

In June 2011, the FDA cited increased risks of cardiovascular events as a basis for more conservative dosing guidelines for use of injectable rESAs in CKD patients and announced related changes to injectable rESA labeling. The FDA removed the prior target hemoglobin range of 10-12 g/dL, and recommended that CKD patients initiate treatment when the hemoglobin level is less than 10 g/dL and reduce or interrupt dosing if the hemoglobin level approaches or exceeds 10 g/dL for non-dialysis patients and 11 g/dL for dialysis patients. The FDA also required Amgen to conduct additional clinical trials to explore dosing strategies to minimize hemoglobin variability, rates of change and excursions. 

We believe there is now substantial evidence to suggest that EPO level, not hemoglobin, is the cause of the safety issues in the above trials. 

Vadadustat as a Potential Solution 

We are developing our lead product candidate, vadadustat, to be a best-in-class HIF-PH inhibitor for the treatment of anemia secondary to CKD. Vadadustat may potentially offer: &#160; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Once-a-day therapy delivered orally; 

&#160;

&#183; 

A dosing regimen that restores the normal diurnal EPO pattern; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Robust pharmacodynamics and substantially lower peak EPO levels than with injectable rESAs; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Predictable, meaningful and sustained improvements in hemoglobin levels; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

Reduced administration of IV or oral iron supplementation to patients treated for anemia secondary to CKD. 

Novel Mechanism of Action, Which Mimics the Body&#8217;s Natural Physiologic Response 

Vadadustat is designed to work by a mechanism of action that differs from injectable rESAs. This novel mechanism of action is referred to as HIF-PH inhibition. Instead of binding directly to and saturating the EPO receptors in the bone marrow for prolonged periods of time, HIF-PH inhibitors act by simulating the body&#8217;s natural response to anemia. HIF is the primary regulator of the production of RBCs and acts by simulating the body&#8217;s natural response to lower levels of oxygen, or hypoxia. In response to hypoxia, a coordinated adaptive response occurs resulting in both an increase in RBC production and enhancement of the delivery of iron to the bone marrow, ensuring the incorporation of iron into hemoglobin necessary for new RBC production. This is very similar to the natural adaptive response that is induced when a person ascends in altitude. At higher altitudes, lower levels of oxygen circulating in the blood stream lead to reduction in HIF-PH activity which increases intracellular levels of HIF &#97; proteins (HIF1 &#97; and HIF2 &#97; ). 

Both HIF1 &#97; and HIF2 &#97; protein levels in cells are adjusted by the activity of the HIF-PH enzymes, which target the HIF &#97; proteins for degradation. HIF1 &#97; helps cells survive under very low oxygen conditions, whereas HIF2 &#97; helps cells to adapt to modest changes in oxygen, such that would occur with a change in altitude from sea level to up to 7,500 feet. 

When HIF &#97; is stabilized, it travels to the nucleus of the cell, where it binds to the protein HIF&#223;. When bound together, they induce the production of EPO and iron transfer proteins. With continued stabilization of HIF &#97; (either by staying at higher altitude or by the 

&#160;

&#160;

administration of a HIF-PH inhibitor), the level of hemoglobin and RBCs will rise in order to increase the amount of oxygen circulating in the blood. 

By inhibiting HIF-PH, vadadustat leads to increased production of hemoglobin and RBCs, while maintaining normal levels of EPO. In addition, we believe that vadadustat&#8217;s mechanism of action provides for the ability to induce a more prominent HIF2 &#97; response (as naturally occurs with a moderate increase in altitude), and restores the normal diurnal pattern of EPO, which is the normal rise and fall of EPO during the each day. 

This mechanism of action is illustrated in the graphic below. 

&#160;

&#160;

Potential Best-in-Class Profile 

We believe vadadustat has compelling clinical data demonstrating a potential best-in-class profile with several potential safety and efficacy advantages over current injectable rESA therapy for the treatment of anemia secondary to CKD. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Vadadustat significantly increases and maintains hemoglobin levels in CKD patients with anemia. We have successfully completed two Phase 2 trials in non-dialysis patients with CKD which demonstrated that vadadustat significantly increased hemoglobin levels. In the first study (CI-0005), vadadustat was shown to raise hemoglobin in a dose-dependent manner compared to baseline and across all treatment arms (p &#60; 0.0001). In the second study (CI-0007), vadadustat effectively increased hemoglobin while minimizing hemoglobin excursions &#179; 13.0 g/dL. Only 4.3% of patients on vadadustat had any hemoglobin excursion &#179; 13.0 g/dL. In addition, a Phase 2 trial (CI-0011) in dialysis patients with CKD who were converted from existing ESA therapy to vadadustat demonstrated the desired outcome of maintaining stable hemoglobin levels. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Vadadustat restores the normal diu rnal variation of EPO. Instead of binding directly to and saturating the EPO receptor for prolonged periods, as is the case with current injectable ESA therapies, vadadustat acts by simulating the body&#8217;s natural response to hypoxia by stabilizing HIF &#97; . Vad adustat allows for an enhancement in the normal diurnal variation in EPO without continuous elevation of EPO levels. The approximate EPO exposures that are achieved with vadadustat compared with doses of Aranesp&#174; and Epogen&#174; is depicted in the graph below . &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Oral, once-daily dosing . As demonstrated in non-dialysis CKD patients, vadadustat offers flexible once-daily oral dosing that provides a more gradual and reliable means of hemoglobin titration and maintenance. This was demonstrated in the Phase 2 clinical trial in dialysis dependent CKD patients, where vadadustat maintained stable hemoglobin levels in patients converting from ESA therapy. Vadadustat also offers improved convenience for patients as compared to injectable ESAs. This convenience may increase access to anemia therapy and improve patient compliance. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Improve mobilization of iron supply to the bone marrow for RBC production. In clinical trials, vadadustat has demonstrated improved iron mobilization and an increase in total iron binding capacity. As a result, unlike injectable rESAs which do not increase iron mobilization, vadadustat offers the added potential benefit of reducing the amount of supplemental iron required by anemic CKD patients. The potential for an IV iron sparing effect of vadadustat will be assessed in the INNO 2 VATE program. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Differentiated safety profile. Vadadustat&#8217;s novel mechanism of action offers the potential opportunity to reduce the risk for cardiovascular and thrombotic events relative to injectable ESAs since CV risks have been associated with a supraphysiological increase in EPO levels and excessive hemoglobin fluctuations and/or excursions. The incidence of cardiovascular adverse events on vadadustat as compared with ESAs will be assessed in the global Phase 3 program. Furthermore, the risk of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) observed with recombinant ESAs is not expected with vadadustat. 

Vadadustat Clinical Development Overview

Akebia is developing vadadustat as oral therapy for the treatment of anemia in CKD subjects who are not on dialysis and in subjects who are on dialysis. A summary of completed and ongoing clinical and clinical pharmacokinetic studies is presented in Table 1.

To date, the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic responses of vadadustat have been demonstrated in:

&#160;

&#183; 

eight completed Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers (CI&#8209;0001, CI&#8209;0002, CI&#8209;0006, CI&#8209;0008, CI&#8209;0010, CI&#8209;0012, CI&#8209;0013, and CI-0019); 

&#160;

&#183; 

one completed Phase 1 study in dialysis-dependent CKD subjects (CI&#8209;0009); 

&#160;

&#183; 

three completed Phase 2a studies in non-dialysis CKD subjects with GFR Categories G3-G5 CKD (CI&#8209;0003, CI&#8209;0004, and CI&#8209;0005); 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

one completed Phase 2b study in non-dialysis CKD subjects with GFR Categories G3-G5 CKD (CI &#8209;0007); and &#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

one completed Phase 2 study in dialysis-dependent CKD subjects (CI&#8209;0011). 

In the 14 studies completed to date, 512 unique subjects have received vadadustat, including 164 healthy volunteers (male and female) and 348 subjects with CKD (242 with non-dialysis CKD with GFR categories G3a/b, G4, and G5 for up to 20 weeks and 106 subjects with dialysis-dependent CKD for up to 16 weeks). A total of more than 29,000 patient days of exposure to vadadustat has been accrued to date. The adverse effect, or AEs, most frequently reported with vadadustat and which occurred more frequently in subjects on vadadustat than in subjects on placebo have predominantly been nausea and diarrhea. Generally these symptoms have been mild to moderate in severity, non-serious, and resolved on vadadustat therapy, although they have led to discontinuation of vadadustat in some subjects.

Early Clinical Studies (CI-0001 to CI-0004, and CI-0006): 

An IND was filed for vadadustat for the treatment of anemia associated with CKD on July 17, 2009. Under the IND, we may investigate vadadustat in subjects who are not on dialysis and in subjects who are on dialysis. The early clinical studies (CI-0001 through CI-0004) for vadadustat were designed to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the compound, starting in healthy male volunteers and progressing to CKD patients with anemia. In healthy males, we demonstrated that vadadustat can be dosed daily, and that it induces the desired pharmacodynamics effect, specifically: 

&#160;

- 

the induction of enhanced diurnal EPO secretion from a single dose; 

&#160;

- 

an increase in new RBC production by day 5 of dosing; and 

&#160;

- 

an increase in hemoglobin levels by day 10 of dosing. 

Subsequently, we demonstrated a similar induction of a diurnal EPO response in CKD patients. This was followed by a 28-day, dose-titration study to establish the necessary dosing information for increasing hemoglobin levels. Throughout these studies, vadadustat was generally well tolerated. There were no serious adverse events, or SAEs, and treatment emergent adverse events, or TEAEs, were limited in number and duration. 

The most common potentially drug-related AEs in our clinical trials were gastro-intestinal disorders, including diarrhea, nausea and constipation. The design and results of each of the 14 completed studies is provided in the following table followed by a more detailed description of three Phase 2 studies in non-dialysis (CI-0005 and CI-0007) and dialysis-dependent (CI-0011) CKD patients treated for up to 20 weeks.

The timing of administration of vadadustat doses (pre- or post-hemodialysis (HD)) did not notably affect pharmacokinetics of vadadustat and two measured glucuronide metabolites. HD procedure had minimal impact on the clearance of vadadustat. AEs assessed as related included diarrhea (n=2), frequent bowel movements (n=2), and abdominal pain (n=1). One subject with a diabetic foot ulcer experienced the SAEs of limb abscess and osteomyelitis, 7 days post dosing, and were assessed as unrelated to vadadustat by the investigator.

Vadadustat did not have a meaningful effect on any ECG parameters. An effect on the QTcF interval exceeding 10 msec could be confidently excluded and the effects on heart rate, PR interval, and QRS interval were small and clinically not relevant. Vadadustat, at therapeutic (600 mg) and supratherapeutic (1200 mg) doses, was well tolerated, and the number of subjects with at least 1 AE in each of these groups was balanced (24.5% vs 26.5%, respectively). All AEs were mild in severity. Nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, and dizziness occurred with a frequency of 5% or more in subjects on vadadustat compared to placebo, but with no apparent dose effect. No discontinuations or SAE occurred.

Vadadustat test and reference tablet formulations demonstrated bioequivalence following administration of a single 150 mg dose under fasting conditions.

Vadadustat AUC and C max were reduced by 20% and 28%, respectively, when a single 150 mg dose of the test formulation of vadadustat tablets was administered with food compared to the test tablet formulation administered under fasting conditions. These differences are not considered to be clinically meaningful and, thus, vadadustat Phase 3 tablets can be administered without regard to meals. 

Both tablet formulations were well tolerated. AEs that occurred in more than 2 subjects included diarrhea. No SAE occurred.

The total exposure of celecoxib increased by approximately 12% following co-administration with vadadustat while the C max of celecoxib increased by approximately 60% when co-administered with vadadustat. Since the potential for interaction is based on total exposure (AUC), it was concluded that vadadustat does not inhibit CYP2C9 to any appreciable extent and, therefore, there is no clinically significant effect of vadadustat on drugs that are CYP2C9 substrates. Vadadustat was well-tolerated and no SAE occurred.

Vadadustat significantly increased HGB levels in subjects compared to baseline in all dose groups and compared to placebo. The HGB increase occurred without increasing predose EPO levels (prior to daily vadadustat dose). There were no apparent differences in the types of AEs across dosing groups or with placebo; 9.7% and 5.3% of subjects had an SAE in the total vadadustat and placebo groups, respectively, and all were assessed as unrelated to study drug by investigators. One subject treated with vadadustat had a non-fatal acute myocardial infarction (MI). One subject died of cardiac arrest after being hospitalized for azotemia due to progression of CKD.

The study achieved its primary endpoint, confirming that the once-daily, oral therapy can successfully increase and maintain HGB levels. 54.9% of patients who received vadadustat met the primary endpoint versus 10.3% in the placebo group (p&#60;0.0001; achieving or maintaining a mean HGB &#8805;11.0 g/dL or increasing HGB by &#8805;1.2 g/dL above the pre-treatment value as measured by the mean HGB value at weeks 19 and 20). AEs were balanced overall between the vadadustat and placebo treatment groups (74.6% and 73.6%, respectively). Diarrhea, nausea, hyperkalemia, and hypertension were reported more frequently in the vadadustat than the placebo group. Angioedema occurred in 2 subjects in the vadadustat group. More subjects had SAEs in the vadadustat group than the placebo group (23.9% and 15.3%, respectively), and this difference was explained by differences in how renal events were reported by investigators. One MI occurred in the placebo group, and none in the vadadustat group. One CVA occurred in the vadadustat group and none in the placebo group. Three subjects died, and the causes of death were reported as ischemic heart disease, sudden cardiac death, and cardiac arrest.

CI-0005: Positive Phase 2a Proof of Concept Trial in Non-Dialysis CKD Patients 

CI-0005 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial of vadadustat in non-dialysis patients with CKD GFR categories G3, G4 and G5 designed to evaluate the change in hemoglobin levels over 42 days. The study enrolled 91 CKD patients who received either placebo or one of the following 4 vadadustat doses once daily: 240 mg, 370 mg, 500 mg, or 630 mg. The primary endpoint for the trial was the mean absolute change in hemoglobin from baseline. 

All doses of vadadustat significantly increased hemoglobin in a dose-dependent manner compared with placebo (p&#60;0.0001). The mean increase in hemoglobin in vadadustat treated patients ranged from 0.7 to 1.4 g/dL, while placebo-treated patients experienced a mean decrease in hemoglobin of 0.1 g/dL. The dose-dependent increases in hemoglobin occurred even though, per protocol, 26% of patients receiving the 630 mg vadadustat dose and 11% of patients in the 500 mg vadadustat dose group had their dose reduced due to a hemoglobin increase &#62; 1.5 g/dL by Day 28. No patient&#8217;s hemoglobin level exceeded 13 g/dL during the study. 

Increases in hemoglobin in the vadadustat group were associated with an increase in reticulocytes and total iron binding capacity, or TIBC, and a decrease in serum hepcidin and ferritin as observed in healthy volunteers, serum EPO levels returned to baseline levels prior the next daily dose of vadadustat, indicating that vadadustat increase hemoglobin without chronically elevating EPO. 

Vadadustat was generally well tolerated with 34 subjects (47.2%) in the vadadustat groups and 11 subjects (57.9%) in the placebo group reporting an adverse event. Adverse events were evenly distributed across the dose groups. Ten subjects (13.9%) treated with vadadustat and one placebo subject (5.3%) had AEs that were considered study drug related. The most frequently reported adverse events in either treatment group were: anemia (placebo, 10.5%), nausea (500 mg, 11.8%) and placebo, (10.5%), urinary tract infection (240 mg, 11.1%), hyperkalemia (500 mg, 17.6%), hypoglycemia (630 mg, 10.5%), headache (240 mg, 11.1%), hypertension (630 mg, 10.5%) and placebo (15.8%), and hypotension (placebo, 10.5%). There were eight serious adverse events (vadadustat 9.7% vs. placebo 5.3%) reported and all were considered unrelated to the study drug. These included fluid overload (placebo patient), gastroenteritis, hypoglycemic event, dizziness, triple vessel coronary artery disease with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, hypertensive crisis, ventricular pacemaker lead replacement, and azotemia (uremia). One subject died after being hospitalized with uremia due to progression of her CKD and acute pulmonary edema. Following a complicated hospital course, the patient developed sustained ventricular tachycardia resulting in a cardiac arrest. 

VEGF is necessary for the maintenance of healthy kidney function and is regulated by HIF1 &#97; . Clinical studies have shown that increased VEGF levels are potentially linked to increased growth of tumors in patients with cancer. Vadadustat provides for the ability to induce a more prominent HIF2 &#97; response, and consistent with this mechanism, no change in VEGF levels were observed from baseline for any of the vadadustat dose groups. The results of this study were reported at the American Society of Nephrology meeting in November 2012.

Phase 2b Study (CI-0007) in Non-Dialysis CKD Patients 

We have completed a Phase 2b study of vadadustat in subjects with anemia secondary to CKD not requiring dialysis. This double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled study evaluated the efficacy and safety of vadadustat over 20 weeks of dosing in 210 subjects (138 vadadustat and 72 placebo) with CKD stages 3-5. Subjects were enrolled into one of three groups: (1) ESA na&#239;ve with hemoglobin &#8804;10.5 g/dL, (2) previously treated with ESA with hemoglobin &#8804;10.5 g/dL, or (3) actively treated with ESA with hemoglobin &#8805;9.5 and &#8804;12.0 g/dL and randomized (2:1) to once daily vadadustat or placebo. The primary endpoint was the percent of subjects with either a mean hemoglobin of &#8805;11.0 g/dL or an increase in hemoglobin by &#8805;1.2 g/dL from baseline. A protocol-defined dose adjustment algorithm was used to achieve the primary endpoint and to minimize hemoglobin excursions &#8805;13 g/dL. 

The mean age was 66 years, ~75% of subjects had diabetes mellitus and the mean estimated glomerular filtration rate, or eGFR, was 25 mL/min/1.73m 2 . 54.9% of vadadustat treated subjects compared to 10.3% of placebo treated subjects met the primary endpoint (p=0.0001). Only 4.3% of subjects in the vadadustat group had any hemoglobin excursion &#8805;13.0 g/dL. Group 3 placebo treated subjects experienced a decline in the mean hemoglobin within the first 2 weeks, whereas subjects randomized to vadadustat maintained a stable hemoglobin throughout the study. Increases in hemoglobin in the vadadustat group were associated with an increase in reticulocytes and TIBC and a decrease in serum hepcidin and ferritin. There was no difference between the vadadustat and placebo groups in vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF, levels during the study. 

Vadadustat was generally well tolerated with similar percentages of subjects experiencing AEs in vadadustat treated and placebo groups (74.6% vs. 73.6%). There was an increase in renal related SAEs reported in the vadadustat-treated subjects (vadadustat 9.4% vs. placebo 2.8%), however, the number of subjects requiring dialysis, an objective measure of the severity of renal disease, was similar in the two treatment groups (vadadustat 8.0% vs. placebo 9.7%). Overall AEs for renal and urinary disorders was balanced (vadadustat 14.5% vs. placebo 13.9%). The disparity in renal SAEs was likely related to variability in reporting between investigators (reasons included proceeding to dialysis in association with a SAE that was not reported in the renal category, or proceeding to 

&#160;

dialysis without being c onsidered an SAE). Other differences, favoring either vadadustat or placebo, in AEs were as follows: nausea and diarrhea (vadadustat 10.1% vs. placebo 4.2%); gastrointestinal hemorrhage (vadadustat 0.0% vs. placebo 5.6%); upper respiratory tract infection (vadadustat 1.4% vs. placebo 6.9%); hyperkalemia (vadadustat 5.1% vs. placebo 0.0%); and hypertension (vadadustat 8.0% vs. placebo 2.8%). There were three deaths in vadadustat-treated subjects and no deaths in the placebo group. This was the expected numbe r of subject deaths based on previous studies in similar populations. 

In summary vadadustat achieved the desired outcomes of raising and maintaining hemoglobin and increasing iron mobilization, while minimizing hemoglobin excursions &#8805;13 g/dL. The results of this study were reported in various scientific meetings in 2015, including the World Congress of Nephrology meeting in March 2015.

Phase 2 Study in Dialysis-Dependent Patients (CI-0011) 

We recently completed a multi-center, open-label, 16-week trial to assess the hemoglobin response, safety, and tolerability of vadadustat in dialysis dependent CKD patients. The trial enrolled 94 hemodialysis patients (hemoglobin 9 - 12 g/dL), who were maintained on ESAs prior to study entry. Patients were converted from ESA to vadadustat, and assigned to 1 of 3 dose cohorts: 300 mg once daily (QD); 450 mg QD; or 450 mg three times weekly (TIW). For each dose cohort, the mean hemoglobin level at study entry was compared to the average at weeks 7 and 8, and to the average at weeks 15 and 16. To evaluate hemoglobin response to each of the dose regimens, during the first eight weeks of this study patients were to remain on the prescribed starting dose, or decreased if necessary to control hemoglobin. Beginning at week eight, the dose of vadadustat could be increased or decreased to maintain hemoglobin levels as needed. Intravenous iron use was allowed. 

The underlying patient demographics and profile of these CKD patients were well-balanced across the three cohorts, and reflective of the US dialysis dependent CKD population as reported in the literature. Mean age was 58 years, average time on dialysis was 4.6 years, and the most common cause of end-stage renal disease was diabetes mellitus and/or hypertension. Baseline hemoglobin levels were similar (10.4-10.6 g/dL) in all three cohorts and the serum ferritin levels indicated that the patients were iron replete at study entry and throughout the study.

The trial achieved its primary endpoint of maintaining stable hemoglobin levels over 16 weeks, across all three cohorts of patients converting from ESAs to vadadustat. The study supports both daily and three times weekly vadadustat dosing regimens as viable options for patients. Consistent with previous studies, all three starting dose regimens improved iron mobilization, as reflected by increases in TIBC and serum iron, and decreases in serum ferritin and hepcidin levels. Only one subject in the 300mg QD cohort had a single hemoglobin excursion to 13.1 g/dL.

Adverse events were balanced across the three cohorts. There were no discernible trends in the frequency of AEs or SAEs by dose cohort. SAEs were reported in 13 subjects (13.8%), which was within the expected range (13 - 17 subjects) for this patient population. No SAEs were reported as related to vadadustat and no deaths occurred during the study.

The results of this trial demonstrate that vadadustat maintained hemoglobin levels in dialysis-dependent CKD subjects who were converted from existing ESA therapy to vadadustat. Only one subject had a single hemoglobin rise to 13.1 g/dL. Vadadustat was generally well tolerated and the frequency and type of SAEs were consistent with those expected in a dialysis-dependent CKD population. The results of this study were reported at the American Society of Nephrology meeting in November 2015.

In both the PRO 2 TECT and INNO 2 VATE Phase 3 programs, the primary efficacy endpoint will be the mean change in hemoglobin between baseline (mean pretreatment hemoglobin) and the primary evaluation period, concluding non-inferiority (NI) when the upper 95% confidence interval of the hazard ratio (vadadustat/ESA) does not exceed the NI margin. Both the PRO 2 TECT and INNO 2 VATE programs will include the primary safety endpoint of the assessment of major adverse cardiovascular endpoints, or MACE, with a comparison of vadadustat to an ESA. MACE is defined as the composite endpoint of all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke. To assess MACE, a pooled analysis of time to first MACE event from the two Phase 3 studies in each program will be performed, concluding NI when the upper 95% confidence interval of the hazard ratio (vadadustat/ESA) does not exceed the NI margin. The assessment of MACE will also allow for determination of superiority for the composite or individual MACE components. 

Overall, the non-dialysis dependent CKD and dialysis-dependent CKD Phase 3 programs will enroll approximately 5,700 CKD patients; approximately 2,850 patients receiving vadadustat and approximately 2,850 patients receiving an ESA. We have engaged Quintiles as our primary CRO for the PRO 2 TECT and INNO 2 VATE programs. We expect the cost of the Phase 3 program to be in the range of $80,000 to $85,000 per patient and we plan to enroll approximately 3,100 patients in PRO 2 TECT and approximately 2,600 patients in INNO 2 VATE.

In December 2015, we began dosing patients in our Phase 3 vadadustat program in non-dialysis patients with anemia related to CKD, PRO 2 TECT, after obtaining feedback from United States and European regulatory authorities regarding the design of the program. If the results from the PRO 2 TECT Phase 3 program support the results observed across our previous clinical studies, we anticipate submitting an NDA to the FDA for vadadustat in 2019. We expect to initiate our Phase 3 vadadustat program in dialysis-dependent CKD patients, INNO 2 VATE, in 2016, and also anticipating submitting an NDA to FDA in 2019. &#160; 

Additional Studies 

We have completed a thorough QT, or TQT, study in accordance with FDA guidance to ensure that vadadustat does not affect the cardiac conduction cycle (CI-0010). A lengthened QT interval is a biomarker for certain ventricular arrhythmias and a risk factor for sudden death. The results from this study confirm that vadadustat does not alter cardiac repolarization intervals in healthy volunteers following a single dose of up to 1200 mg. 

In addition, a clinical study was conducted to evaluate the effect of vadadustat on celecoxib, a substrate for the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9. The results of the study showed that the co-administration of vadadustat resulted in a minimal (12%) increase in the exposure (AUC) of celecoxib while the C max of celecoxib increased by approximately 60% when co-administered with vadadustat. Since the potential for interaction is based on total exposure (AUC), it was concluded that vadadustat does not inhibit CYP2C9 to any appreciable extent and, therefore, there is no clinically significant effect of vadadustat on drugs that are CYP2C9 substrates (e.g., losartan, rosuvastatin). Vadadustat was well-tolerated and no SAE occurred.

The results of a standard battery of tests that evaluate for mutations in cells or animals have indicated that vadadustat does not cause mutations that could lead to cancer. However, to satisfy the expected regulatory requirement, carcinogenicity assessments (two years of dosing in rats, and six months of dosing in a transgenic mouse model) will be conducted. The 2-year rat carcinogenicity study was initiated in Q2 2015 and the six month transgenic mouse study will commence in Q2 2016. Embryo-fetal development studies have been conducted in rats and rabbits, and a fertility study has been conducted in rats with no notable findings. A peri-postnatal development study in rats is currently ongoing.

&#160;

In order to complete the registration package for drug approval, we plan to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety of vadadu stat in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment. In addition clinical studies are also planned to evaluate the potential of vadadustat to interact with drugs that are substrates of enzymes CYP2B6 and CYP2C8. Clinical studies will also be conduct ed to determine the effect of vadadustat on substrates of transporters such as P-gp, BCRP, OAT1, OAT3 and OATP1B1 . 

AKB-6899 

Our second clinical candidate, AKB-6899, is designed as a small molecule HIF-PH inhibitor with potential therapeutic application in oncology and ophthalmology. AKB-6899 has demonstrated the ability in vitro to reduce VEGF levels in the presence of hypoxia while stimulating the production of soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1, or sVEGFr1. sVEGFr1 sequesters VEGF to inhibit VEGF signaling and thereby can decrease tumor growth. Moreover, AKB-6899 inhibits the expression of phosphoglycerate kinase, or PGK, which has been associated with the growth of cancerous tumors. In several preclinical mouse models, AKB-6899 has been active in reducing tumor growth and metastases, and has improved survival. We opened an IND with the FDA at the end of 2015. We expect to commence clinical development of AKB-6899 in 2016 and anticipate completion of the Phase 1 study in oncology in late 2017.

Manufacturing and Supply 

Vadadustat is a small-molecule that is manufactured from readily available commercial starting materials. We have no internal manufacturing capabilities and rely on third-party contract manufacturers to produce all lots of drug substance and drug products. 

We entered into a Master Services Agreement with Evonik Corporation, or Evonik, pursuant to which Evonik shall further develop and manufacture vadadustat drug substance for use in our Phase 3 development program for vadadustat and other clinical trials. Evonik is currently manufacturing vadadustat at commercially relevant scale. 

The drug substance can be readily formulated into compressed tablets using common manufacturing processes. Tablets have been made at several different potencies with excellent drug product pharmaceutical properties and a fast, reproducible dissolution rate. We entered into a Master Services Agreement with Gregory Pharmaceutical Holdings, Inc. (d/b/a UPM Pharmaceuticals Inc., or UPM), pursuant to which UPM shall further develop and manufacture the drug product for use in our Phase 3 development program for vadadustat and other clinical trials. UPM is currently manufacturing vadadustat tablets at commercially relevant scale.

In our agreements with third-party manufacturers, we retain ownership of our intellectual property and generally own and/or are licensed rights to processes, developments, data, results and other intellectual property relating to our products and generated during the course of the manufacturer&#8217;s performance under the agreement.

AKB-6899 will be entering clinical development in 2016. A scalable manufacturing route has been used to synthesize GMP material required for non-clinical and clinical development. A capsule formulation has been manufactured for use in clinical trials. We have contracted with several contract manufacturing organizations for the supply of drug substance and finished product to meet our needs for pre-clinical toxicology and early clinical development of AKB-6899. We expect to continue to rely on third-party contract manufacturers for the supply of AKB-6899 drug substance and drug product for the foreseeable future.

Intellectual Property

The proprietary nature of, and protection for, our product candidates and our discovery programs, processes and know-how are important to our business. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. Additionally, we may benefit from a variety of statutory frameworks in the United States, Europe and other countries that provide periods of non-patent-based exclusivity for qualifying molecules. See &#8220;&#8212;Regulatory Matters.&#8221; 

Our commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining patent protection of our current and future product candidates, methods of their use and the methods used to develop and manufacture them, as well as successfully defending these patents against third-party challenges. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products depends on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents that cover these activities. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our product candidates, discovery programs and processes. Even once patents successfully issue, 

&#160;

third parties may challenge the validity, enforceability, inventorship, or scope thereof, which may result in such patents being narrowed, inv alidated or held unenforceable. For this and more comprehensive risks related to our intellectual property, please see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.&#8221; 

Our patent estate, on a worldwide basis, includes 64 allowed applications and issued patents and approximately 81 pending utility and provisional patent applications, with pending and issued claims relating to our current clinical stage candidate vadadustat as well as other product candidates, including AKB-6899. We also hold three patents that claim the crystal of a protein-ligand complex of EGLN-1 as well as methods for identifying compounds that bind to EGLN-1. 

Individual patents extend for varying periods of time depending on the date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued from applications filed in the United States are effective for 20 years from the earliest non-provisional filing date. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period, however, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest international filing date. Patent term recapture for loss of term as a result of the regulatory review period is available in some foreign jurisdictions. Our issued patents and pending applications with respect to our composition of matter, methods of treatment, and pharmaceutical compositions are expected to expire in 2027 or 2028 (depending on eligibility for patent term adjustment) and our pending applications with respect to processes for manufacturing vadadustat, dosing regimens, formulations, and various other aspects relating to the treatment of anemia using vadadustat are expected to expire between 2032 and 2034, exclusive of possible patent term adjustments or extensions; however, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product by product basis, from country to country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of extensions of patent term, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent. 

Changes in either the patent laws or interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries can diminish our ability to protect our inventions and enforce our intellectual property rights. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth or enforceability of claims that may be granted in our patents or in third-party patents. The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for our drugs and technology will depend on our success in obtaining effective claims and enforcing those claims once granted. We do not know whether any of the patent applications that we may file or license from third parties will result in the issuance of any patents. The issued patents that we own or may receive in the future may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with sufficient protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may be able to independently develop and commercialize similar drugs or duplicate our technology, business model or strategy without infringing our patents. Because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a drug we may develop, it is possible that, before any of our drugs can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of any such patent. The patent positions for our most advanced programs are summarized below. 

Vadadustat Patent Portfolio 

We hold five issued patents and one pending application covering the composition of matter, method of treating anemia, and pharmaceutical compositions of vadadustat in the United States, one issued patent in Europe (registered in most countries of the European Patent Convention), and additional patents issued or pending in many other major jurisdictions worldwide, including Japan, China, South Korea, Brazil, Mexico, Russia, Israel and India. The expected expiration date for these composition of matter patents is 2028 plus any extensions or adjustments of term available under national law. 

In July of 2011, a third party filed an opposition to our issued European Patent No. 2044005 (the &#8217;005 Patent). During the oral proceedings, which took place on April 10, 2013, the Opposition Division of the European Patent Office maintained the &#8217;005 Patent on the basis of the third auxiliary request filed during the oral proceedings. This decision resulted in the maintenance of a claim directed to a compound chosen from a group of eight compounds, including vadadustat, as well as claims to compositions and methods for treating various diseases, including, but not limited to, anemia. Both parties have appealed the decision of the Opposition Division and final resolution of the opposition proceedings will likely take a number of years. We cannot be assured of the breadth of the claims that will remain in the &#8217;005 Patent or that the patent will not be revoked in its entirety. 

We also hold patents and patent applications directed to processes for manufacturing vadadustat, dosing regimens, formulations, polymorphs, and various other aspects relating to the treatment of anemia using vadadustat that are expected to expire between 2032 and 2034 exclusive of possible patent term extensions. 

&#160;

AKB-6899 Patent Portfolio 

We hold four issued patents and one pending application covering the AKB-6899 composition of matter and pharmaceutical compositions or methods of use in the United States, and additional patents issued or pending in many other major jurisdictions worldwide, including Europe, Japan, China, South Korea, Brazil, Mexico, Russia and India. The expected expiration date for these composition of matter patents is 2028 plus any extensions or adjustments of term available under national law. 

We hold one issued patent that covers the treatment of anemia by administration of AKB-6899, which is expected to expire in 2028. We also hold, either alone or jointly, one issued patent and one pending application covering various methods, including, but not limited to, the treatment of cancer by administration of AKB-6899 in the United States and additional patent applications are pending in many other major jurisdictions worldwide, including Japan, China, South Korea, Mexico, Russia, Israel and India. The expected expiration dates for these method of treatment patent applications are expected to be 2032 exclusive of possible patent term extensions or adjustments. We hold one pending patent application in the United States and approximately 30 pending patent applications worldwide directed to treatment or prevention of ocular conditions using AKB-6899, and one pending patent application in the United States and approximately 30 pending patent applications worldwide directed to dosing regimens of AKB-6899. The expected expiration date of this ocular patent application is 2035, and the expected expiration date of this dosing patent application is 2034, exclusive of possible patent term extensions or adjustments. We also hold two pending patent application directed to polymorphs of vadadustat and AKB-6899 in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. The expected expiration dates of these polymorph patent applications are 2034 for vadadustat and 2036 for AKB-6899 exclusive of possible patent term extensions or adjustments.

Know-How 

In addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, employees and consultants and invention assignment provisions in the confidentiality agreements with our employees. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment provisions, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed by our employees. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. 

To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. 

Third-Party Filings 

We are aware of certain U.S. patents issued to FibroGen, Inc., or FibroGen, directed to, among other things, purportedly new methods of using previously known heterocyclic carboxamide compounds for purposes of treating or affecting specified conditions. We do not believe these currently issued FibroGen U.S. patents conflict with our intellectual property rights; nor do we make any admission that any of such patents are valid or enforceable. Under U.S. law, a person may be able to patent a discovery of a new way to use a previously known compound, even if such compound itself is patented, provided, the newly discovered use is novel and non-obvious. Such a method-of-use patent, however, if valid, only protects the use of a claimed compound for the specified methods claimed in the patent. This type of patent does not prevent persons from using the compound for any previously known use of the compound. Further, this type of patent does not prevent persons from making and marketing the compound for an indication that is outside the scope of the patented method. We are not aware of any valid U.S. patents issued to FibroGen that claim methods of using any of our product candidates for purposes of inhibiting HIF-PHs for the treatment of anemia secondary to CKD. 

As explained in more detail below, we have had some positive developments in our opposition and invalidity proceedings against FibroGen. With regard to the opposition that we filed in Europe against FibroGen&#8217;s European Patent No. 1463823, or the &#8217;823 patent, the European Opposition Division issued a non-binding preliminary opinion that none of FibroGen&#8217;s &#8217;823 patent claims meet the requirements for patentability. In an oral proceeding which took place March 8 and 9, 2016, the European Opposition Division confirmed that the patent as granted did not meet the requirements for patentability under the European Patent Convention and, therefore, revoked the patent in its entirety. Likewise, with regard to the invalidity proceeding that we filed in Japan against certain claims of FibroGen&#8217;s Japanese Patent No. 4804131, or the &#8217;131 patent, which is the Japanese counterpart to the &#8217;823 patent, the JPO issued a preliminary decision finding all of the challenged claims to be invalid. FibroGen subsequently amended the claims and the JPO accepted the amendments. The resulting FibroGen &#8217; 131 patent does not cover vadadustat or any pyridine carboxamide compounds. To date, FibroGen has been unsuccessful in its attempts to obtain a patent in the United States covering the same claim scope as it obtained in Europe and Japan in the &#8217;823 and &#8217;131 patents. In the event FibroGen were to obtain such patents in the United States, we may decide to challenge them like we have done in Europe and Japan. On May 13, May 20, and July 6, 2015, we also filed oppositions to FibroGen&#8217;s European Patent Nos. 2322153, 2322155, and 1633333 respectively, requesting the patents be revoked in their entirety.

&#160;

&#160;

In June 2013, the European Patent Office granted the &#8217;823 patent to FibroGen. The &#8217;823 patent claims, among other things, the use of a heterocyclic carboxamide compound selected from the group consisting of pyridine carboxamides, quinoline carboxamides, isoquinoline carboxamides, cinnoline carboxamides, and beta-carboline carboxamides that inhibits HIF-PH enzyme activity in the manufacture of a medicament for increasing endogenous EPO in the prevention, pretreatment, or treatment of anemia. On December 5, 2013, we filed an opposition with the European Patent Office to the &#8217;823 patent requesting that the &#8217;823 patent be revoked in its entirety. The European Opposition Division scheduled oral proceedings for March 8, 2016 and also issued a non-binding preliminary opinion that none of the &#8217;823 patent&#8217;s claims met the requirements for patentability. In an oral proceeding which took place March 8 and 9, 2016, the European Opposition Division confirmed that the patent as granted did not meet the requirements for patentability under the European Patent Convention and, therefore, revoked the patent in its entirety. If FibroGen appeals the decision of the European Opposition Division, final resolution of the appeal will likely take two to three years. While, for the reasons set forth in our opposition, we maintain that the &#8217;823 patent should be revoked in its entirety, the ultimate outcome of any appeal remains uncertain. If FibroGen appeals the decision of the European Opposition Division and the Technical Board of Appeal at the European Patent Office decides not to revoke the &#8217;823 patent in its entirety, or only certain claims of the &#8217;823 patent and any surviving claims are determined to encompass our intended use of vadadustat, we may not be able to commercialize vadadustat in the European Union for its intended use, which could materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.

In August 2011, the Japanese Patent Office granted the &#8217;131 patent to FibroGen. The &#8217;131 patent claimed, among other things, the use of certain heterocyclic carboxamides selected from the group consisting of pyridine carboxamides, quinoline carboxamides, and isoquinoline carboxamides to treat anemia, wherein the heterocyclic carboxamides also suppress HIF prolyl-hydroxylase. On June 2, 2014, we filed an invalidity proceeding in the Japanese Patent Office challenging the validity of the &#8217;131 patent and requesting that certain claims be revoked in their entirety. An oral hearing before the Japanese Patent Office was held on February 9, 2015, and on May 11, 2015 the Japanese Patent Office issued a preliminary decision finding all of the challenged claims to be invalid. In response, FibroGen filed a request for correction in which it requested that the &#8217; 131 patent claims be amended to exclude pyridine carboxamides from their scope. On November 18, 2015 , Akebia received the final trial decision from the JPO in which it accepted FibroGen&#8217;s requested claim amendments. As a result of the JPO&#8217;s decision and FibroGen&#8217;s subsequent amendments, the FibroGen &#8217; 131 patent does not cover vadadustat or any pyridine carboxamide compounds .

In August 2014, the European Patent Office granted European Patent Nos. 2322153, 2322155, and 1633333 (the &#8217;153 patent, the &#8217;155 patent, and the &#8217;333 patent, respectively) to FibroGen. These related patents claim, among other things, various compounds that either stabilize HIF&#945; or inhibit a HIF hydroxylase or a HIF prolyl hydroxylase for treating or preventing various conditions, including, inter alia , iron deficiency, microcytosis associated with iron deficiency, anemia of chronic disease, anemia wherein the subject has a transferrin saturation of less than 20%, anemia refractory to treatment with exogenously administered EPO, and microcytosis in microcytic anemia. On May 13, May 20, and July 6, 2015, we filed oppositions to the &#8217;155 patent, the &#8217;333 patent, and the &#8217;153 patent, respectively, requesting that the patents be revoked in their entireties. While, for the reasons set forth in our oppositions, we believe that the &#8217;153 patent, the &#8217;155 patent, and the &#8217;333 patent should be revoked in their entireties, the ultimate outcomes of the oppositions remains uncertain.

Competition 

We operate in highly competitive segments of the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical markets. We face competition from many different sources, including commercial pharmaceutical and biotechnology enterprises, academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, product development, manufacturing and marketing resources than us. Large pharmaceutical companies have extensive experience in clinical testing and obtaining regulatory approval for drugs. These companies also have significantly greater research capabilities than us. Many universities and private and public research institutes are active in CKD research, some in direct competition with us. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. The key competitive factors affecting the success of vadadustat, if approved, are likely to be its efficacy, convenience and safety profile. 

If vadadustat is approved and launched commercially, competing drugs may include EPOGEN &#174; and Aranesp &#174; (commercialized by Amgen), Procrit &#174; and Eprex &#174; (commercialized by Johnson &#38; Johnson) and Mircera &#174; (commercialized by Roche Holding Ltd., or Roche). We may face competition from potential new anemia therapies. There are several other HIF product candidates in various stages of active development for anemia indications that may be in direct competition with vadadustat if and when they are approved and launched commercially. These candidates are being developed by such companies as FibroGen, in partnership with AstraZeneca PLC in the United States and China and with Astellas Pharma Inc. in Europe and Asia, Japan Tobacco International, GlaxoSmithKline plc and Bayer HealthCare AG. FibroGen/Astellas Pharma Inc., in particular, is currently in Phase 3 clinical development of its product candidate, roxadustat (FG-4592). Some of these product candidates may enter the market as early as 2017. In addition, certain companies are developing potential new therapies for renal-related diseases that could potentially reduce rESA utilization and thus 

&#160;

limit the market for vadadustat if and when it is approved and launched commercially. Such therapies include hepcidin lowering therapies, like PRS-080 from Pieris Pharmaceuticals. Other new therapies are in development for the treatment of conditions inclusive of renal anemia, like sotatercept from Acceleron Pharma Inc. that may impact the market for anemia-targeted treatment. 

Since rESAs are biologic products, the introduction of biosimilars into the rESA market in the United States will constitute additional competition for vadadustat if we are able to obtain approval for and commercially launch our product. A biosimilar product is a follow-on version of an existing, branded biologic product. The patents for the existing, branded product must expire in a given market before biosimilars may enter that market without risk of being sued for patent infringement. In addition, an application for a biosimilar product cannot be approved by the FDA until 12 years after the existing, branded product was approved under a Biologics License Application, or BLA. The patents for epoetin alfa, an rESA, expired in 2004 in the European Union, and the remaining patents expired between 2012 and 2015 in the United States. Several biosimilar versions of rESAs are available for sale in the European Union and biosimilar versions of rESAs are currently being pursued in the United States, which will compete with vadadustat if it is approved and marketed, and will likely drive down prices for rEPO, which could also adversely affect our reimbursement. 

In the dialysis market, it is typical to compete for and enter into long-term supply agreements with the major operators of dialysis clinics in the United States. In particular, two of the largest operators of dialysis clinics in the United States, DaVita Inc., or DaVita, and Fresenius, account for more than half of the rESA sales in the U.S. dialysis market. We believe that it may be challenging to enter into or expand upon long or short-term supply agreements with DaVita, Fresenius or other operators of dialysis clinics. 

Regulatory Matters 

The FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in state and local jurisdictions and in other countries impose substantial and burdensome requirements upon companies involved in the clinical development, manufacture, marketing, labeling and packaging, storage, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, advertising and promotion, pricing, and export and import of drugs. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Moreover, failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may result in, among other things, warning letters, clinical holds, civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of products, injunction, disbarment, partial or total suspension of production or withdrawal of the product from the market. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. 

U.S. Government Regulation 

In the United States, the FDA regulates drug products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FD&#38;C Act, and the FDA&#8217;s implementing regulations. If we fail to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements at any time during the drug development process, clinical testing, approval process or after approval, we may become subject to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA&#8217;s refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any FDA enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. FDA approval is required before any new unapproved drug or dosage form, including a new use of a previously approved drug, can be marketed in the United States. 

The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves: 

&#160;

&#183; 

completion of extensive nonclinical laboratory tests, nonclinical animal studies and formulation studies performed in accordance with the FDA&#8217;s current Good Laboratory Practice, or cGLP, regulations; 

&#160;

&#183; 

submission to the FDA of an IND application which must become effective before human clinical trials in the United States may begin; 

&#160;

&#183; 

approval by an IRB or ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated; 

&#160;

&#183; 

performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug candidate for each proposed indication; 

&#160;

&#183; 

submission to the FDA of an NDA; 

&#160;

&#183; 

satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with current cGMP regulations; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

satisfactory completion of a potential review by an FDA advisory committee, if applicable; and &#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing, sale or commercial shipment of the drug in the United States. 

The manufacturing, nonclinical testing, clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, stability and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. 

The results of nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and a proposed clinical trial protocol, and other information, are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human studies. Some nonclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted, but an IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin in the United States. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions relating to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Accordingly, submission of an IND may or may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. A separate amendment to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. 

Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with cGCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be used. Each protocol in the United States must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee for each medical center proposing to conduct a clinical trial must also review and approve a plan for any clinical trial before it can begin at that center and the IRB must monitor the clinical trial until it is completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and clinical trial results to public registries. 

A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of an NDA so long as the clinical trial is conducted in compliance with an international guideline for the ethical conduct of clinical research known as the Declaration of Helsinki, as set out in the FDA regulations or with the laws and regulations of the country or countries in which the clinical trial is performed, whichever provides the greater protection to the participants in the clinical trial. 

Government Regulation Outside U.S.

In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. 

Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application, or CTA, much like the IND, prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In Europe, for example, a CTA must be approved by each country&#8217;s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country&#8217;s requirements, the clinical trial may proceed. Outside of the United States, each clinical trial to be conducted in a given country requires submission and approval of a unique CTA. 

The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with cGCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug under European Union regulatory systems, we must submit a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA). The application used to file the NDA in the United States is similar to that required in Europe, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements. 

An approved Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) is required in Europe prior to submission of the MAA. Ideally, the pediatric studies in both the U.S. PSP and the EU PIP will be identical, but some differences may be required to meet the respective regulatory requirements (e.g., waiver age). The PIP outlines the study designs and timing of the pediatric program. The EMA Pediatric 

&#160;

Committee (PDCO) and the FDA&#8217;s Office of Pediatric Therapeut ics have frequent discussions about pediatric drug development, including discussions about specific drugs. Often, these discussions are conducted in an attempt to harmonize pediatric drug development across the two jurisdictions. However, this cannot be guaranteed. 

For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 

If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.

Clinical Trials 

Clinical trials are typically conducted in three or four phases, which may overlap or be combined: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Phase 1: Clinical trials are initially conducted in a limited population of subjects to test the drug candidate for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion in healthy humans or, on occasion, in patients with severe problems or life threatening diseases to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Phase 2: Clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to evaluate dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage, identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, and evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the drug for specific targeted indications in patients with the disease or condition under study. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Phase 3: Clinical trials are typically conducted when Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrate that a dose range of the product candidate is effective and has an acceptable safety profile. Phase 3 clinical trials are commonly referred to as &#8220;pivotal&#8221; studies, which typically denotes a study which presents the data that the FDA or other relevant regulatory agencies will use to determine whether or not to approve a drug. Phase 3 clinical trials are generally undertaken with large numbers of patients, such as groups of several hundred to several thousand, to further evaluate dosage, to provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population at multiple, geographically-dispersed clinical trial sites. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Phase 4: In some cases, FDA may condition approval of an NDA for a product candidate on the sponsor&#8217;s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials after NDA approval. In other cases, a sponsor may voluntarily conduct additional clinical trials post-approval to gain more information about the drug. Such post approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials. 

The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides recommendations for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study. A sponsor may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate. 

Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal testing and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the drug in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 

New Drug Applications 

The clinical trials, together with the results of nonclinical studies and extensive manufacturing information and information on the composition of the drug, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug for one or more specified indications. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a drug is safe and effective for its intended use. 

Once the NDA submission has been accepted for review, under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), the FDA has a goal of responding to standard review NDAs within ten months after the 60-day filing review period, but this timeframe is often extended. The first indication of the FDA&#8217;s review progress is provided at the mid-cycle review. This typically occurs five months after the 

&#160;

NDA is accepted for review. However, the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. 

Before approving an application, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the finished drug product, and sometimes the active drug ingredient, is manufactured, and will not approve the drug unless cGMP compliance is satisfactory. The FDA may also inspect the sites at which the clinical trials were conducted to assess their compliance, and will not approve the drug unless compliance with GCP requirements is satisfactory. 

After the FDA evaluates the NDA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter (CRL). An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete but the application is not yet ready for approval. A CRL may require additional clinical data and/or other significant, expensive, and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies and/or manufacturing. Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret data. The FDA could also approve the NDA with a REMS to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to ensure safe use, such as restricted distribution programs, patient registries or other risk minimization tools. The FDA may also condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct one or more post-market studies or clinical trials. Such post-market testing may include Phase 4 clinical trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product&#8217;s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. 

An approved Pediatric Study Plan (PSP) is required for vadadustat under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) prior to submission of the NDA. The PSP outlines the study designs and timing of the pediatric program. Once the PSP is approved, Akebia and FDA will have reached agreement on the pediatric studies necessary for vadadustat, any deferrals from pediatric data to be included in the NDA, and any waivers of pediatric age ranges in which vadadustat need not be studied.

Once the FDA approves an NDA, or supplement thereto, the FDA may withdraw the approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems are identified after the drug reaches the market. Where a withdrawal may not be appropriate, the FDA still may seize existing inventory of such drug or request a recall of any drug already on the market. In addition, the FDA has the authority to prevent or limit further marketing of a drug based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. 

After regulatory approval of a drug is obtained, companies are subject to a number of post-approval requirements. For example, there are reporting obligations regarding certain adverse events received and production problems. Companies are also required to report updated safety and efficacy information and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling. Drugs may be marketed only for the FDA approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by the FDA. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in warning letters, adverse publicity, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for uses that are not described in the product&#8217;s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers&#8217; communications regarding off-label use. 

Further, if there are any modifications to the drug, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement, which may require the applicant to develop additional data or conduct additional nonclinical studies and clinical trials. As with new NDAs, the review process is often significantly extended by the FDA requests for additional information or clarification. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP requirements after approval to ensure and preserve the long term identity, strength, quality, and purity of the drug product. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP requirements, which imposes extensive procedural, substantive and record-keeping requirements. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements, and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP requirement and other aspects of regulatory compliance. 

&#160;

The testing and approval processes require substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take several years to complete. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all. Even if we believe a clinical trial has demonstr ated safety and efficacy of one of our drug candidates for the treatment of a disease, the results may not be satisfactory to the FDA. Nonclinical and clinical data may be interpreted by the FDA in different ways, which could delay, limit or prevent regula tory approval. We may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to secure necessary governmental approvals which could delay or preclude us from marketing drugs. The FDA may limit the indications for use or place other conditions on any approvals that could restrict the commercial application of the drugs. 

Fraud and Abuse Laws 

In the United States, the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale and promotion of drug products and medical devices are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice, state Attorneys General, and other state and local government agencies. 

These laws include the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf) to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order, or prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, the PPACA, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and criminal healthcare fraud statutes created by HIPAA. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. Moreover, the PPACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act. 

Although we would not submit claims directly to payors, drug manufacturers can be held liable under the federal False Claims Act, which prohibits anyone from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. The government may deem manufacturers to have &#8220;caused&#8221; the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. In addition, our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state, and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. Penalties for a False Claims Act violation include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, and, although the federal False Claims Act is a civil statute, conduct that results in a False Claims Act violation may also implicate various federal criminal statutes. If the government were to allege that we were, or convict us of, violating these false claims laws, we could be subject to a substantial fine and may suffer a decline in our stock price. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring actions under the federal False Claims Act and certain states have enacted laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act. 

In addition to the laws described above, the PPACA also imposed new reporting requirements on drug manufacturers for payments made to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission. Drug manufacturers were required to begin collecting data on August 1, 2013 and are required to submit reports to CMS by the 90 th day of each subsequent calendar year. 

In addition, many states have adopted laws similar to the federal laws discussed above. Some of these state prohibitions apply to the referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any insurer, not just federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. There has also been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians. Certain states mandate implementation of compliance programs, impose restrictions on drug manufacturers&#8217; marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians. Because we intend to commercialize products that could be reimbursed under a federal healthcare program and other governmental healthcare programs, we plan to develop a comprehensive compliance program that establishes internal controls to facilitate adherence to the rules and program requirements to which we will or may become subject. Although compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Due to the breadth of and ambiguities in these laws, the absence of guidance in the form of regulations or court decisions, and the potential for additional legal or regulatory change in this area, it is possible that our future sales and marketing practices and/or our future relationships with physicians might be challenged under these laws. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management&#8217;s attention from the operation of our business. 

&#160;

Third-Party Coverage and Reimbursement 

Sales of pharmaceutical products depend in significant part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement by third-party payors, such as state and federal governments, including Medicare and Medicaid, and commercial managed care providers. In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payors. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for vadadustat will be made on a payor by payor basis. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our product candidates to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover our product candidates could reduce physician utilization of our products once approved and have a material adverse effect on our future sales, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, a payor&#8217;s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. 

Healthcare Reform 

In March 2010, the PPACA was enacted, which includes measures that have or will significantly change the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions of PPACA of greatest importance to the pharmaceutical industry are the following: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Effective in 2010, PPACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers&#8217; rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs and biologic agents from 15.1% of average manufacturer price, or AMP, to 23.1% of AMP and adding a new rebate calculation for &#8220;line extensions&#8221; (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. 

&#160;

&#183; 

PPACA also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization as of 2010 and by expanding the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits, to be phased-in by 2014. CMS has proposed to expand Medicaid rebate liability to the territories of the United States as well. 

&#160;

&#183; 

In addition, PPACA provides for the public availability of retail survey prices and certain weighted average AMPs under the Medicaid program. The implementation of this requirement by the CMS may also provide for the public availability of pharmacy acquisition cost data, which could negatively impact our sales. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Effective in 2010, PPACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although, under the current state of the law, with the exception of children&#8217;s hospitals, these newly eligible entities will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs when used for the orphan indication. In addition, as 340B drug pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could result in an increase in the required 340B discounts. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Effective in 2011, PPACA imposed a requirement on manufacturers of branded drugs and biologic agents to provide a 50% discount off the negotiated price of branded drugs dispensed to Medicare Part D patients in the coverage gap (i.e., &#8220;donut hole&#8221;). 

&#160;

&#183; 

Effective in 2011, PPACA imposed an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs, although this fee would not apply to sales of certain products approved exclusively for orphan indications. 

&#160;

&#183; 

As of 2010, a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute was established pursuant to PPACA to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. The research conducted by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute may affect the market for certain pharmaceutical products. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

PPACA created the Independent Payment Advisory Board which, beginning in 2014, will have authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program to reduce expenditures by the program that could result in reduced payments for prescription drugs. Unde r certain circumstances, these recommendations will become law unless Congress enacts legislation that will achieve the same or greater Medicare cost savings. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

PPACA established the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. Funding has been allocated to support the mission of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation from 2011 to 2019. 

Certain details regarding the implementation of PPACA are yet to be determined and, the full effect that PPACA would have on our business is not fully understood. In addition, we expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future. Because we anticipate that a significant proportion of patients eligible for vadadustat will be covered by Medicare Part D, any government healthcare reform measures which limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services could result in reduced demand for our products once approved or additional pricing pressures. 

Other Regulations 

We are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future.

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 64 employees, 63 of whom were full-time, 13 of whom hold Ph.D. or M.D. degrees, 39 of whom were engaged in research and development activities and 25 of whom were engaged in business development, finance, information systems, facilities, human resources or administrative support. None of our employees are represented by any collective bargaining unit. We believe that we maintain good relations with our employees. 

Facilities 

Our corporate headquarters are located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. We currently lease approximately 39,411 square feet of office space in Cambridge, Massachusetts under a lease that expires on August 31, 2026. We believe that our existing facilities are adequate to meet our current needs, and that suitable additional alternative spaces will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms for our future growth.
