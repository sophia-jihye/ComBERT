 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

The disclosures in this Item 1 are qualified by the disclosures below in Item 1A, &#147;Risk Factors,&#148; and Item 7, &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation,&#148; and in other cautionary statements set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

General 

Horizon Bancorp (&#147;Horizon&#148; or the &#147;Company&#148;) is a registered bank holding company incorporated in Indiana and headquartered in Michigan City, Indiana. Horizon provides a broad range of banking services in Northern and Central Indiana and Southwestern and Central Michigan through its bank subsidiary, Horizon Bank, N.A. (the &#147;Bank&#148;) and other affiliated entities and Horizon Risk Management, Inc. Horizon operates as a single segment, which is commercial banking. Horizon&#146;s common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol HBNC. The Bank was chartered as a national banking association in 1873 and has operated continuously since that time. The Bank is a full-service commercial bank offering commercial and retail banking services, corporate and individual trust and agency services and other services incident to banking. Horizon Risk Management, Inc. is a captive insurance company incorporated in Nevada and was formed as a wholly owned subsidiary of Horizon. 

On July 1, 2015, Horizon completed the acquisition of Peoples Bancorp, an Indiana corporation (&#147;Peoples&#148;) and the Bank&#146;s acquisition of Peoples Federal Savings Bank of DeKalb County (&#147;Peoples FSB&#148;), through mergers effective July 1, 2015. Under the terms of the acquisition, the exchange ratio was 0.95 shares of Horizon common stock and $9.75 in cash for each outstanding share of Peoples common stock. Peoples shareholders owning fewer than 100 shares of common stock received $33.14 in cash for each common share. Peoples shares outstanding at the closing were 2,311,858, and the shares of Horizon common stock issued to Peoples shareholders totaled 2,192,202. Horizon&#146;s stock price was $25.32 per share at the close of business on July 1, 2015. Based upon these numbers, the total value of the consideration for the acquisition was $78.1 million. As a result of the acquisition, the Company will have an opportunity to increase its deposit base and reduce transaction costs. The Company also expects to reduce cost through economies of scale. 

On April 3, 2014 Horizon completed its acquisition of SCB Bancorp, Inc. (&#147;Summit&#148;) and the Bank&#146;s acquisition of Summit Community Bank, through mergers effective as of that date. Under the final terms of the acquisition, the exchange ratio was 0.4904 shares of Horizon&#146;s common stock and $5.15 in cash for each share of Summit common stock outstanding. Summit shares outstanding at the closing were 1,164,442, and the shares of Horizon common stock issued to Summit shareholders totaled 570,820. Horizon&#146;s stock price was $22.23 per share at the close of business on April 3, 2014. Based upon these numbers, the total value of the consideration for the acquisition was $18.9 million (not including the retirement of Summit debt). As a result of the acquisition, the Company experienced, and expects to continue to experience, increases in its deposit base, reductions in transaction costs and reduced costs through economies of scale. 

On July 17, 2012, Horizon completed its acquisition of Heartland Bancshares, Inc. (&#147;Heartland&#148;) and Heartland&#146;s wholly owned subsidiary, Heartland Community Bank (&#147;Heartland Bank&#148;). Heartland was merged into Horizon, and Heartland Bank was merged into the Bank. The exchange ratio was 0.81 shares of Horizon&#146;s common stock for each share of 

&#160;

&#160;

Heartland common stock outstanding. Horizon acquired the 1,442,449 outstanding shares of Heartland common stock in exchange for 1,168,383 shares of Horizon common stock, which had a market price of $16.83 per share at the close of business on July 17, 2012. Horizon also purchased and retired all shares of preferred stock that Heartland had issued pursuant to the Troubled Asset Relief Program Capital Purchase Program (&#147;TARP&#148;). Based upon the $16.83 market price and the TARP preferred stock purchase, the total value of the consideration for the acquisition was $26.9 million. As a result of the acquisition, the Company experienced, and expects to continue to experience, increases in its deposit base, reductions in transaction costs and reduced costs through economies of scale. 

The Bank maintains 46 full service offices. At December 31, 2015, the Bank had total assets of $2.65 billion and total deposits of $1.88 billion. The Bank has wholly-owned direct and indirect subsidiaries: Horizon Investments, Inc. (&#147;Horizon Investments&#148;), Horizon Properties, Inc. (&#147;Horizon Properties&#148;), Horizon Insurance Services, Inc. (&#147;Horizon Insurance&#148;) and Horizon Grantor Trust. Horizon Investments manages the investment portfolio of the Bank. Horizon Properties manages the real estate investment trust. Horizon Insurance is used by the Company&#146;s Wealth Management to sell certain insurance products. Horizon Grantor Trust holds title to certain company owned life insurance policies . 

Horizon formed Horizon Bancorp Capital Trust II in 2004 (&#147;Trust II&#148;) and Horizon Bancorp Capital Trust III in 2006 (&#147;Trust III&#148;) for the purpose of participating in pooled trust preferred securities offerings. The Company assumed additional debentures as the result of the acquisition of Alliance Financial Corporation in 2005, which formed Alliance Financial Statutory Trust I (&#147;Alliance Trust&#148;). The Company also assumed additional debentures as the result of the acquisition of American Trust &#38; Savings Bank (&#147;American&#148;) in 2010, which formed Am Tru Statutory Trust I (&#147;Am Tru Trust&#148;). The Company also assumed additional debentures as the result of the Heartland transaction, which formed Heartland (IN) Statutory Trust II (&#147;Heartland Trust&#148;). See Note 15 of the Consolidated Financial Statements included at Item 8 for further discussion regarding these previously consolidated entities that are now reported separately. 

The business of Horizon is not seasonal to any material degree. No material part of Horizon&#146;s business is dependent upon a single or small group of customers, the loss of any one or more of which would have a materially adverse effect on the business of Horizon. In 2015, revenues from loans accounted for 63.3% of the total consolidated revenue, and revenues from investment securities accounted for 11.1% of total consolidated revenue.

In Johnson County Indiana, where Horizon acquired the branches of Heartland Bank, the Bank enjoys a 12.19% market share as the third largest of the 19 institutions in that county. In Berrien County, Michigan, Horizon was the fourth largest of the 11 bank and thrift institutions with a 7.90% market share. Horizon&#146;s market share of deposits in Lake County, Indiana was just over 1% at 1.74%, a little over 1% at 1.08% in Kalamazoo County, Michigan, and less than 1% in each of St. Joseph, Elkhart, Marion, and Hamilton Counties in Indiana. The branches of the Bank acquired in the acquisition of Summit Community Bank are located in Ingham County, Michigan and have a 2.70% market share.

Regulation and Supervision 

As a bank holding company and a financial holding company, the Company is subject to extensive regulation, supervision, and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &#147;Federal Reserve Board&#148; or &#147;Federal Reserve&#148;) as its primary federal regulator. The Bank, as a nationally chartered bank, is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (&#147;OCC&#148;) as its primary federal regulator and, as to certain matters, by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#147;FDIC&#148;). Both federal and state law extensively regulate various aspects of the banking business, such as reserve requirements, truth-in-lending and truth-in-savings disclosures, equal credit opportunity, fair credit reporting, trading in securities and other aspects of banking operations. Branching by the Bank is subject to the jurisdiction and requires notice to, or the prior approval of, the OCC. The Dodd-Frank Act permits the establishment of de novo branches in states where such branches could be opened by a state bank chartered by that state. The consent of the state is no longer required. The supervision, regulation and examination of Horizon and the Bank by the regulatory agencies are intended primarily for the protection of depositors rather than for Horizon&#146;s shareholders. 

Horizon also is subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as administered by the SEC. Horizon&#146;s common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Global Select Stock Market under the trading symbol &#147;HBNC,&#148; and Horizon is subject to the NASDAQ rules applicable to listed companies. 

Included below is a brief summary of significant aspects of the laws, regulations and policies applicable to Horizon and the Bank. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes, regulations and policies that are referenced and is not intended to be an exhaustive description of the statutes, regulations and policies applicable to the business of Horizon and the Bank. Also, such statutes, regulations and policies are continually under review by Congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies. A change in statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to Horizon and the Bank could have a material effect on Horizon&#146;s business, financial condition and results of operations. 

The Bank Holding Company Act 

The Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (&#147;BHC Act&#148;), generally limits the business in which a bank holding company and its subsidiaries may engage to banking or managing or controlling banks and those activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto. Bank holding companies, such as Horizon, that qualify as, and elect to be, financial holding companies, however, may engage in any activity, or acquire and retain the shares of a company engaged in any activity, that is either (i) financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity (as determined by the Federal Reserve Board in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury) or (ii) complementary to a financial activity and does not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally (as solely determined by the Federal Reserve Board), without prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. Activities that are financial in nature include securities underwriting and dealing, insurance underwriting and making merchant banking investments. 

&#160;

&#160;

For a bank holding company to remain qualified as a financial holding company, the company and all of its depository institution subsidiaries must be &#147;well capitalized&#148; and &#147;well managed.&#148; To commence any new activity permitted by the BHC Act or to acquire a company engaged in any new activity permitted by the BHC Act, each insured depository institution subsidiary of the financial holding company must have received a rating of at least &#147;satisfactory&#148; in its most recent examination under the Community Reinvestment Act. The Federal Reserve Board has the power to order any bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when the Federal Reserve Board has reasonable grounds to believe that continuation of such activity or such ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness, safety or stability of any bank subsidiary of the bank holding company. 

Federal Reserve Board policy has historically required bank holding companies to act as a source of financial and management strength for their subsidiary banks. The Dodd-Frank Act, which was signed into law on July 21, 2010, codified this policy. Under this requirement, Horizon is required to act as a source of financial strength to the Bank and to commit resources to support the Bank in circumstances in which Horizon might not otherwise do so. For this purpose, &#147;source of financial strength&#148; means Horizon&#146;s ability to provide financial assistance to the Bank in the event of the Bank&#146;s financial distress. 

The BHC Act, the Bank Merger Act and other federal and state statutes regulate acquisitions of banks and bank holding companies. The BHC Act requires the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before a bank holding company may acquire more than a 5% voting interest or substantially all assets of any bank or bank holding company. Under the Bank Merger Act, the prior approval of the OCC or another federal banking agency is required for the Bank to merge with another bank or purchase the assets or assume the deposits of another bank. In reviewing applications seeking approval for mergers and other acquisition transactions, the bank regulatory authorities will consider, among other things, the competitive effect and public benefits of the transactions, the capital position of the combined organization, the risks to the stability of the U.S. banking or financial system, the applicant&#146;s performance record under the Community Reinvestment Act and the effectiveness of the subject organizations in combating money laundering activities. 

Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (the &#147;FDICIA&#148;), a bank holding company is required to guarantee the compliance of any insured depository institution subsidiary that may become &#147;undercapitalized&#148; (as defined in FDICIA) with the terms of any capital restoration plan filed by such subsidiary with its appropriate federal bank regulatory agency. 

Bank holding companies are required to comply with the Federal Reserve&#146;s risk-based capital guidelines. The FDIC and the OCC also have risk-based capital ratio guidelines to which depository institutions under their respective supervision are subject. The guidelines establish a systematic analytical framework that makes regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banking organizations. Risk-based capital ratios are determined by allocating assets and specified off-balance sheet commitments to four risk weighted categories, with higher levels of capital being required for the categories perceived as representing greater risk. For Horizon&#146;s regulatory capital ratios and regulatory requirements as of December 31, 2015, see the information in &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#148; in Item 7 below, which is incorporated herein by reference. 

National Bank Act 

As a national bank, the Bank is subject to the provisions of the National Bank Act. The Bank is supervised, regulated, and examined by the OCC, and is subject to the rules and regulations of the OCC, Federal Reserve, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (&#147;CFPB&#148;) and the FDIC. 

Deposit Insurance and Assessments 

The Bank&#146;s deposits are insured to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund (&#147;DIF&#148;) of the FDIC. Generally, deposits are insured up to the statutory limit of $250,000. Banks are subject to deposit insurance premiums and assessments to maintain the DIF. A bank&#146;s deposit insurance premium assessment rate depends on the capital category and supervisory category to which it is assigned. The FDIC has authority to raise or lower assessment rates on insured banks in order to achieve statutorily required reserve ratios in the DIF and to impose special additional assessments. 

&#160;

H ORIZON B ANCORP 

&#160;

The Dodd-Frank Act has resulted in significant changes to the FDIC&#146;s deposit insurance system. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC is authorized to set the reserve ratio for the DIF at no less than 1.35%, and must achieve the 1.35% designated reserve ratio by September 30, 2020. The FDIC must offset the effect of the increase in the minimum designated reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35% on insured depository institutions of less than $10 billion and may declare dividends to depository institutions when the reserve ratio at the end of a calendar quarter is at least 1.5%, although the FDIC has the authority to suspend or limit such permitted dividend declarations. In December 2010, the FDIC adopted a final rule setting the designated reserve ratio for the deposit insurance fund at 2% of estimated insured deposits. 

Also as a consequence of the Dodd-Frank Act, the assessment base for deposit insurance premiums was changed, effective April 1, 2011, from adjusted domestic deposits to average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity. Tangible equity for this purpose means Tier 1 capital. Effective April 1, 2011, the initial base assessment rates were as follows: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; For small Risk Category I banks, such as Horizon, the rates range from 5-9 basis points. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The rates for small institutions in Risk Categories II, III and IV are 14, 23 and 35 basis points, respectively. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; For large institutions and large, highly complex institutions, the rate schedule ranges from 5 to 35 basis points. Adjustments are made to the initial assessment rates based on long-term unsecured debt, depository institution debt, and brokered deposits. Horizon&#146;s FDIC deposit insurance expense increased slightly during 2015 compared to 2014. The FDIC continued to offset the regular insurance assessments until the earlier of the exhaustion of an institution&#146;s prepaid assessments or June 30, 2013. Any prepaid assessment remaining after collection of the amount due on June 30, 2013, was returned to the institution. The FDIC returned to the Bank $2.0 million in prepaid assessments. 

The FDIC may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution if the FDIC determines, after a hearing, that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe and unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, order or any condition imposed in writing by, or written agreement with, the FDIC. The FDIC may also suspend deposit insurance temporarily during the hearing process for a permanent termination of insurance if the institution has no tangible capital. 

FDIC-insured institutions are also subject to the requirement to pay assessments to the FDIC to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation (&#147;FICO&#148;), an agency of the Federal government established to recapitalize the predecessor to the Savings Association Insurance Fund (&#147;SAIF&#148;). These assessments will continue until the FICO bonds are repaid between 2017 and 2019. The FICO assessment rate was 0.60 basis points for each $100 of insured deposits for each quarter of 2015, except for the third quarter when it was 0.58 basis points. For the first quarter of 2016, the FICO assessment rate is 0.58 basis points for each $100 in domestic deposits maintained at an institution. 

Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders 

Horizon and the Bank are subject to the Federal Reserve Act, which restricts financial transactions between banks, affiliated companies and their executive officers, including limits on credit transactions between these parties. The statute prescribes terms and conditions for bank affiliate transactions deemed to be consistent with safe and sound banking practices, and restricts the types of collateral security permitted in connection with a bank&#146;s extension of credit to an affiliate. 

Effective July 21, 2011, among other changes, the Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the exceptions under Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act for transactions with financial subsidiaries and expanded the scope of transactions treated as &#147;covered transactions&#148; to include derivatives transactions and securities repurchase agreements. The Dodd-Frank Act also expands the types of transactions subject to insider lending limits. 

Capital Regulation 

The federal bank regulatory authorities have adopted risk-based capital guidelines for banks and bank holding companies that are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banks and bank holding companies and account for off-balance sheet items. Risk-based capital ratios are determined by allocating assets and specified off-balance sheet commitments to risk weighted categories consisting primarily of 0%, 20%, 50%, 100% or 150%, but also including 250% and beyond, with higher levels of capital being required for the categories perceived as representing greater risk. 

&#160;

H ORIZON B ANCORP 

&#160;

The capital guidelines divide a bank holding company&#146;s or bank&#146;s capital into two tiers. The first tier (&#147;Tier I&#148;) includes common equity, certain non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, less goodwill and certain other intangible assets (except mortgage servicing rights and purchased credit card relationships, subject to certain limitations). Supplementary capital (&#147;Tier II&#148;) includes, among other items, cumulative perpetual and long-term limited-life preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, certain hybrid capital instruments, term subordinated debt and the allowance for loan and lease losses, subject to certain limitations, less required deductions. Also required by the regulations is the maintenance of a leverage ratio designed to supplement the risk-based capital guidelines. This ratio is computed by dividing Tier I capital, net of all intangibles, by the quarterly average of total assets. Pursuant to the regulations, banks must maintain capital levels commensurate with the level of risk, including the volume and severity of problem loans to which they are exposed. 

In July 2013, the federal banking agencies approved final rules to be phased in from 2015 to 2019 implementing the U.S. Basel Committee on Banking Supervision&#146;s capital framework (&#147;Basel III&#148;) for all U.S. banks and for bank holding companies. Under these final rules, minimum requirements have increased for both the quantity and quality of capital held by Horizon and the Bank. The rules include a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%, a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0% (increased from 4.0%), a total capital ratio of 8 % (unchanged from prior rules) and a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%. The final rules also require a common equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets, which is in addition to the other minimum risk-based capital standards in the rule. Institutions that do not maintain the required capital conservation buffer will become subject to progressively more stringent limitations on the percentage of earnings that can be paid out in dividends or used for stock repurchases and on the payment of certain bonuses to senior executive management. The capital conservation buffer requirement will be phased in over three years beginning in 2016. The capital conservation buffer requirement effectively raises the minimum required common equity Tier 1 capital ratio to 7.0%, the Tier 1 capital ratio to 8.5%, and the total capital ratio to 10.5% on a fully phased-in basis.

The final rules also introduced other changes, including an increase in the capital required for certain categories of assets, including higher-risk construction real estate loans and certain exposures related to securitizations. The final rules allow banking organizations with less than $15 billion in assets as of December 31, 2010, to retain non-qualifying Tier 1 capital trust preferred securities issued prior to May 19, 2010, subject generally to a limit of 25% of Tier 1 capital. 

These new minimum capital ratios became effective for Horizon on January 1, 2015, and will be fully phased-in on January 1, 2019. Horizon&#146;s management believes that, as of December 31, 2015, Horizon and the Bank would meet all capital adequacy requirements under the Basel III capital rules on a fully phased-in basis, as if such requirements were currently in effect. 

The following is a summary of Horizon&#146;s and the Bank&#146;s regulatory capital and capital requirements at December 31, 2015.

&#160;

The Dodd-Frank Act also requires the Federal Reserve to set minimum capital levels for bank holding companies that are as stringent as those required for insured depository subsidiaries, except that bank holding companies with less than $1 billion in assets are exempt from these capital requirements. 

Dividends 

Dividends received from the Bank are the primary source of Horizon&#146;s revenues. The Bank&#146;s payment of dividends, without prior regulatory approval, is subject to regulatory limitations. The National Bank Act requires the Bank to obtain the prior approval of the OCC for the payment of dividends if the total of all dividends declared by it in one year would exceed its net profits for the current year plus its retained net profits for the two preceding years, less any required transfers to surplus. In addition, the Bank may only pay dividends to the extent that its retained net profits (including the portion transferred to surplus) exceed the Bank&#146;s undivided profits after deducting statutory bad debt in excess of the Bank&#146;s allowance for loan losses. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, the Bank is prohibited from paying any dividends, making other distributions or paying any management fees if, after such payment, it would fail to satisfy its minimum capital requirements. 

In 2011, Horizon issued 12,500 shares of Senior Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series B (the &#147;Series B Preferred Stock&#148;) to the U. S. Department of the Treasury (the &#147;Treasury&#148;). The issuance to the Treasury of the Series B Preferred Stock resulted in the imposition of limitations on Horizon&#146;s ability to pay dividends. Under the terms of the Series B Preferred Stock, no repurchases may be effected, and no dividends may be declared or paid on preferred shares ranking pari passu with the Series B Preferred Stock, junior preferred shares, or other junior securities, including the common stock, during the current quarter and for the next three quarters following the failure to declare and pay dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock, except that, in any such quarter in which the dividend is paid, dividend payments on shares ranking pari passu may be paid to the extent necessary to avoid any resulting material covenant breach. Effective February 1, 2016, Horizon redeemed all the Series B Preferred Stock and, accordingly, the restrictions imposed on the payment of dividends by the outstanding Series B Preferred Stock will no longer have any effect. 

Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action 

Federal law provides the federal banking regulators with broad powers to require an undercapitalized financial institution to take prompt corrective action to resolve the institution&#146;s problems. The extent of the regulators&#146; powers depends on whether the institution in question is &#147;well capitalized,&#148; &#147;adequately capitalized,&#148; &#147;undercapitalized,&#148; &#147;significantly undercapitalized,&#148; or &#147;critically undercapitalized,&#148; as defined by regulation. Depending upon the capital category to which an institution is assigned, the regulators&#146; corrective powers include: (i) requiring the submission of a capital restoration plan; (ii) placing limits on asset growth and restrictions on activities; (iii) requiring the institution to issue additional capital stock (including additional voting stock) or to be acquired; (iv) restricting transactions with affiliates; (v) restricting the interest rate the institution may pay on deposits; (vi) ordering a new election of directors of the institution; (vii) requiring that senior executive officers or directors be dismissed; (viii) prohibiting the institution from accepting deposits from correspondent banks; (ix) requiring the institution to divest certain subsidiaries; (x) prohibiting the payment of principal or interest on subordinated debt; and (xi) ultimately, appointing a receiver for the institution. New prompt corrective action requirements became effective January 1, 2015 and increased the capital level requirements necessary to qualify as &#147;well capitalized.&#148; At December 31, 2015, the Bank was categorized as &#147;well capitalized,&#148; meaning that the Bank&#146;s total risk-based capital ratio exceeded 10%, the Bank&#146;s Tier I risk-based capital ratio exceeded 8%, the Bank&#146;s common equity Tier I risk-based capital ratio exceeded 6.5%, the Bank&#146;s leverage ratio exceeded 5%, and the Bank was not subject to a regulatory order, agreement or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. 

Anti-Money Laundering and the USA Patriot Act 

Horizon is subject to the provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, which contains anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws and requires financial institutions to implement additional policies and procedures with respect to, or additional measures designed to address, any or all of the following matters, among others: money laundering, suspicious activities and currency transaction reporting, and currency crimes. 

&#160;

&#160;

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 

Horizon also is subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the &#147;Sarbanes-Oxley Act&#148;), which revised the laws affecting corporate governance, accounting obligations and corporate reporting. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act applies to all companies with equity or debt securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In particular, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act established: (i) new requirements for audit committees, including independence, expertise and responsibilities; (ii) additional responsibilities regarding financial statements for the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the reporting company; (iii) new standards for auditors and regulation of audits; (iv) increased disclosure and reporting obligations for the reporting company and its directors and executive officers; and (v) new and increased civil and criminal penalties for violation of the securities laws. Management expects that significant additional efforts and expense will continue to be required to comply with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. 

Pursuant to the final rules adopted by the SEC to implement Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Horizon is required to include in each Form 10-K it files a report of management on Horizon&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. The internal control report must include a statement of management&#146;s responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate control over financial reporting of Horizon, identify the framework used by management to evaluate the effectiveness of Horizon&#146;s internal control over financial reporting and provide management&#146;s assessment of the effectiveness of Horizon&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. This Annual Report on Form 10-K also includes an attestation report issued by Horizon&#146;s registered public accounting firm on Horizon&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. For fiscal years prior to the year ended December 31, 2012, Horizon was not an &#147;accelerated filer&#148; and, therefore, Horizon was exempt from the attestation report requirements. 

Financial System Reform &#150; The Dodd-Frank Act and the CFPB 

The Dodd-Frank Act, which was signed into law in 2010, significantly changed the regulation of financial institutions and the financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act includes provisions affecting large and small financial institutions alike, including several provisions that have profoundly affected how community banks, thrifts, and small bank and thrift holding companies are regulated. Among other things, these provisions eliminated the Office of Thrift Supervision and transferred its functions to the other federal banking agencies, relaxed rules regarding interstate branching, allowed financial institutions to pay interest on business checking accounts, changed the scope of federal deposit insurance coverage and imposed new capital requirements on bank and thrift holding companies. 

The Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB as an independent bureau within the Federal Reserve System with broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Truth in Lending Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Consumer Financial Privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, and certain other statutes. In July 2011, many of the consumer financial protection functions formerly assigned to the federal banking and other designated agencies transferred to the CFBP. The CFBP has a large budget and staff, and has the authority to implement regulations under federal consumer protection laws and enforce those laws against financial institutions. The CFPB has examination and primary enforcement authority over depository institutions with $10 billion or more in assets. Smaller institutions are subject to rules promulgated by the CFPB but continue to be examined and supervised by the federal banking regulators for consumer compliance purposes. The CFPB also has authority to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive practices in connection with offering consumer financial products. Additionally, the CFPB is authorized to collect fines and provide consumer restitution in the event of violations, engage in consumer financial education, track consumer complaints, request data, and promote the availability of financial services to underserved consumers and communities. 

The CFPB has indicated that mortgage lending is an area of supervisory focus and that it will concentrate its examination and rulemaking efforts on the variety of mortgage-related topics required under the Dodd-Frank Act, including minimum standards for the origination of residential mortgages. The CFPB has published several final regulations impacting the mortgage industry, including rules related to ability-to-repay, mortgage servicing, escrow accounts, and mortgage loan originator compensation. The ability-to-repay rule makes lenders liable if they fail to assess a borrower&#146;s ability to repay under a prescribed test, but also creates a safe harbor for so called &#147;qualified mortgages.&#148; Failure to comply with the ability-to-repay rule may result in possible CFPB enforcement action and special statutory damages plus actual, class action, and attorneys&#146; fees damages, all of which a borrower may claim in defense of a foreclosure action at any time. Horizon&#146;s management is assessing the impact of these requirements on its mortgage lending business. 

&#160;

H ORIZON B ANCORP 

&#160;

The Dodd-Frank Act contains numerous other provisions affecting financial institutions of all types, many of which may have an impact on the operating environment of Horizon in substantial and unpredictable ways. Horizon has incurred higher operating costs in complying with the Dodd-Frank Act, and expects higher costs to continue for the foreseeable future. Horizon&#146;s management continues to review rules and regulations adopted pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act and assess their probable impact on the business, financial condition and results of operations of Horizon. 

Other Regulation 

In addition to the matters discussed above, the Bank is subject to additional regulation of its activities, including a variety of consumer protection regulations affecting its lending, deposit, and collection activities and regulations affecting secondary mortgage market activities. 

Effect of Governmental Monetary Policies 

The Bank&#146;s earnings are affected by domestic economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government and its agencies. The Federal Reserve&#146;s monetary policies have had, and are likely to continue to have, an important impact on the operating results of commercial banks through its power to implement national monetary policy in order, among other things, to curb inflation or combat a recession. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve have major effects upon the levels of bank loans, investments and deposits through its open market operations in United States government securities and through its regulation of the discount rate on borrowings of member banks and the reserve requirements against member bank deposits. It is not possible to predict the nature or impact of future changes in monetary and fiscal policies. 

Federal Home Loan Bank (&#147;FHLB&#148;) System 

The Bank is a member of the FHLB of Indianapolis, which is one of twelve regional FHLBs. Each FHLB serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region. The FHLB is funded primarily from funds deposited by banks and savings associations and proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB system. It makes loans to members (i.e., advances) in accordance with policies and procedures established by the Board of Directors of the FHLB. All FHLB advances must be fully secured by sufficient collateral as determined by the FHLB. The Federal Housing Finance Board (&#147;FHFB&#148;), an independent agency, controls the FHLB System, including the FHLB of Indianapolis. 

As a member of the FHLB, the Bank is required to purchase and maintain stock in the FHLB of Indianapolis in an amount equal to at least 1% of its aggregate unpaid residential mortgage loans, home purchase contracts, or similar obligations at the beginning of each year. At December 31, 2015, the Bank&#146;s investment in stock of the FHLB of Indianapolis was $10.1 million. The FHLB imposes various limitations on advances such as limiting the amount of certain types of real estate related collateral to 30% of a member&#146;s capital and limiting total advances to a member. Interest rates charged for advances vary depending upon maturity, the cost of funds to the FHLB of Indianapolis and the purpose of the borrowing. 

The FHLBs are required to provide funds for the resolution of troubled savings associations and to contribute to affordable housing programs through direct loans or interest subsidies on advances targeted for community investment and low and moderate income housing projects. For the year ended December 31, 2015, dividends paid by the FHLB of Indianapolis to the Bank totaled approximately $370,000, for an annualized rate paid in dividends of 4.2%. 

Limitations on Rates Paid for Deposits; Restrictions on Brokered Deposits 

FDIC regulations restrict the interest rates that less than well-capitalized insured depository institutions may pay on deposits and also restrict the ability of such institutions to accept brokered deposits. These regulations permit a &#147;well capitalized&#148; depository institution to accept, renew or roll over brokered deposits without restriction, and an &#147;adequately capitalized&#148; depository institution to accept, renew or roll over brokered deposits with a waiver from the FDIC (subject to certain restrictions on payments of rates). The regulations prohibit an &#147;undercapitalized&#148; depository institution from accepting, renewing or rolling over brokered deposits. These regulations contemplate that the definitions of &#147;well 

&#160;

H ORIZON B ANCORP 

&#160;

capitalized,&#148; &#147;adequately capitalized&#148; and &#147;undercapitalized&#148; will be the same as the definitions adopted by the agencies to implement the prompt corrective action provisions of FDICIA. Management does not believe that these regulations will have a materially adverse effect on the Bank&#146;s current operations. 

Legislative Initiatives 

Additional legislative and administrative actions affecting the banking industry may be considered by the United States Congress, state legislatures and various regulatory agencies, including those referred to above. It cannot be predicted with certainty whether such legislative or administrative action will be enacted or the extent to which the banking industry in general or Horizon and its affiliates will be affected.

&#160; Discussion of Non-Accrual Policy 

&#160;

&#160; 1. From time to time, the Bank obtains information which may lead management to believe that the collection of payments may be doubtful on a particular loan. In recognition of such, it is management&#146;s policy to convert the loan from an &#147;earning asset&#148; to a non-accruing loan. Further, it is management&#146;s policy to place a commercial loan on a non-accrual status when delinquent in excess of 90 days or it has had the accrual of interest discontinued by management. The officer responsible for the loan, the Chief Credit Officer and the senior commercial loan workout officer must review all loans placed on non-accrual status. &#160;

&#160;

&#160; 2. Potential Problem Loans: Impaired and non-accrual loans for which the discounted cash flows or collateral value exceeded the carrying value of the loan totaled $16.7 million and $22.4 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014. The allowance for impaired and non-accrual loans included in the Bank&#146;s allowance for loan losses totaled $2.5 million and $3.2 million at those respective dates. The average balance of impaired loans during 2015 and 2014 was $7.1 million and $5.3 million. 

&#160;

&#160; 3. Foreign Outstandings: None. 

&#160;

&#160; 4. Loan Concentrations: As of December 31, 2015, there are no significant concentrations of loans exceeding 10% of total loans. See Item III A above for a listing of the types of loans by concentration. 

&#160;

D. Other Interest-Bearing Assets There are no other interest-bearing assets as of December 31, 2015, which would be required to be disclosed under Item III C.1 or 2 if such assets were loans.
