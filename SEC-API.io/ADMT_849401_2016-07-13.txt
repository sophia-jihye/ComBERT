 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

COMPANY OVERVIEW 

&#160; 

The Company is a technology-based developer and manufacturer of diversified lines of products and derives revenue from the production and sale of electronics for medical devices and other applications; environmentally safe chemical products for industrial, medical and cosmetic uses; and, research, development, regulatory and engineering services. 

&#160; 

The Company is a corporation that was organized under the laws of the State of Delaware on November 24, 1969. Our operations are conducted through ADM Tronics Unlimited, Inc. ("ADM") and its subsidiary Sonotron Medical Systems, Inc. ("SMI"). 

&#160; 

COMPANY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES 

&#160; 

ELECTRONICS FOR MEDICAL DEVICES AND OTHER APPLICATIONS 

&#160; 

We develop and manufacture electronic technologies for non-invasive, electrotherapeutic and diagnostic medical devices as well as for veterinary and other applications. The products are manufactured at our Northvale facility which is an FDA-Registered Medical Device Manufacturing facility. We develop and manufacture our own proprietary products as well as on a contract basis for other companies. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

CONTRACT MANUFACTURING 

&#160; 

The Company derives revenues from contract manufacturing of electronic medical and other devices from its previous affiliate Montvale Technologies, Inc. (formerly known as Ivivi Technologies, Inc.) ("ITI"), Ivivi Health Sciences, LLC ("IHS") and other customers. As of March 31, 2016, we had approximately $106,500 of back-log for electronic products. 

&#160; 

SONOTRON TECHNOLOGY 

&#160; 

SMI, a majority-owned subsidiary of ADM, has developed a technology, known as the Sonotron Technology, to treat subjects suffering from the pain of inflammatory joint conditions. Although some of the devices utilizing this technology are commercially available for the treatment of animals, none of such devices have received clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA") for human application in the United States. Pursuant to a manufacturing agreement, the Company is the exclusive manufacturer of the Sonotron devices. The Sonotron Technology is the subject of a United States patent (the "Sonotron Patent"), which expired in April 2016. 

&#160; 

ENVIRONMENTALLY SAFE CHEMICAL PRODUCTS FOR INDUSTRIAL USES 

&#160; 

We develop, manufacture and sell chemical products to industrial users. Such products consist primarily of the following: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Water-based primers and adhesives; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Water-based coatings and resins; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Water-based chemical additives; and 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Anti-static conductive paints, coating and other products. 

&#160; 

Water-based primers and adhesives are chemical compounds used to bind different plastic films, metal foils and papers. Examples are the binding of polyethylene to polyester, nylon, vinyl, aluminum, polypropylene, paper and cellophane. Our water-based primers and adhesives are similar in function to solvent-based primers that are widely used to bind plastic films, papers and foils. Solvent-based systems have come under criticism since they have been found to be highly pollutant, dangerous to health and generally caustic in nature. Based upon our experience since 1969, including information furnished to us by certain of our customers, we believe that water-based systems have no known polluting effects and pose no known health hazards. There can, of course, be no assurance that any governmental restrictions will not be imposed on our water-based products or that such products will be accepted as replacements for solvent based products. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Water-based coatings and resins for the printing industry are used to impart properties to the printed substrate. Our coatings and resins can be used to coat printed material for glossy or aesthetic appeal to make such material virtually impervious to certain types of grease and to impart other characteristics required or desired for various products and specifications. 

&#160; 

Certain of our water-based chemical additives are used to impart properties to inks and other chemical products used in the food packaging and printing industries. These additives are used for their ability to improve the performance of such products. 

&#160; 

Through Anti-Static Industries, the assets of which were acquired in July, 2009, we now develop and manufacture a full-line of anti-static products for commercial and industrial use through a division of our company that we refer to as &#8220;Antistatic Industries&#8221;. Antistatic Industries develops and distributes proprietary conductive paints, coatings and other products and accessories which can be used by electronics, computer, pharmaceutical and chemical companies to prevent, reduce or eliminate static electricity. Many industries are concerned with static electricity as it can be hazardous to personnel and damage corporate facilities, computers, electronic equipment and valuable parts. Antistatic Industries has a wide range of products including paints, hoses, garments, floor mats, rugs, strapping, tapes, hook-and-loop, adhesive products and many other specialized items, all with conductive properties. Antistatic Industries has also pioneered low volatile organic compound conductive and antistatic paint and coating formulations that can be used as replacements for paints and coatings made from hazardous solvents. Antistatic Industries seeks to continually develop new products through research and development for new and current customers to aid in their quest for maximum protection with less waste and rejects in their manufacturing processes by reducing or eliminating static electricity. 

&#160; 

None of our chemical products are protected by patents, although the names of some of such products have been protected by trademarks. We do not believe that any such trademarks are material to our business. As of March 31, 2016, the dollar amount of backlog orders for our chemical products believed by us to be firm was not material. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

MEDICAL AND COSMETIC PRODUCTS 

&#160; 

The Company has developed several medical and cosmetic topical products. The Company&#8217;s proprietary water-based, adhesive and related topical formulations are used for maxillofacial prosthetic medical applications and for professional makeup applications primarily for special makeup effects for film, TV and theatrical productions. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, REGULATORY AND ENGINEERING SERVICES 

&#160; 

The Company provides research, development, regulatory and engineering services to unaffiliated customers for the design, development and manufacturing of medical devices, electronics and other technologies and products (the &#8220;Engineering Services&#8221;). The Engineering Services are provided by the Company to customers both on a fee-for-services basis and on a project basis. 

&#160; 

CUSTOMERS 

&#160; 

During the year ended March 31, 2016, one customer accounted for 44% of our net income. During the year ended March 31, 2015, two customers accounted for 38% of our net revenue. As of March 31, 2016 and 2016, one customer represented 43% of our accounts receivable. The loss of these major customers could have a material impact on our operations and cash flow. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION 

&#160; 

A majority of our product sales are distributed to customers directly from our headquarters in Northvale, NJ. Customers place purchase orders with us and products are then shipped via common carrier delivery on an "FOB shipping point" basis. A portion of the sales are accomplished through distributors who place purchase orders with us for certain quantities of our products which are shipped by common carrier to the distributor&#39;s respective warehouses. These stocking distributors then ship product to the ultimate customer via common carrier from their inventory of our products. Our contract manufacturing customers place orders with us for certain quantities of their products they desire to have us manufacture, typically providing a deposit with each order. Engineering Services are provided through written agreements with customers both on a fee-for-services basis and a project basis. 

&#160; 

MANUFACTURER AND SUPPLIERS 

&#160; 

MANUFACTURER 

&#160; 

ADM manufactures its electronic and chemical products and SMI and other customers&#8217; electronic products at its facilities located in Northvale, New Jersey. 

&#160; 

ADM warranties the products it manufactures for SMI against defects in material and workmanship for a period of 90 days after the completion of manufacture. After such 90-day period, ADM has agreed to provide repair services for the products at its customary hourly repair rate plus the cost of any parts, components or items necessary to repair the products. 

&#160; 

Under contract manufacturing agreements, all inventions, patentable or otherwise, trade secrets, discoveries, ideas, writings, technology, know-how, improvements or other advances or findings relating to the entities&#39; products and technologies shall be and become the exclusive proprietary and confidential information of such entity or any person to whom such entity may have assigned rights therein. ADM has no rights in any such proprietary or confidential information and is prohibited from using or disclosing any of such proprietary or confidential information for its own benefit or purposes, or for the benefit or purpose of any other person other than the entity without such entity&#39;s prior written consent. ADM has also agreed to cooperate with each entity in securing for it any patents, copyrights, trademarks or the like which it may seek to obtain in connection therewith. If ADM breaches any of the confidentiality agreements contained in the manufacturing agreement, or if these agreements are not sufficient to protect the entity&#39;s technology or are found to be unenforceable, the entity&#39;s competitors could acquire and use information that it considers to be our trade secrets and the entity may not be able to compete effectively. 

&#160; 

Since ADM is the exclusive manufacturer of all of SMI&#39;s current and future products under the manufacturing agreement, if the operations of ADM are interrupted or if orders or orders of other customers of the Company exceed our manufacturing capabilities, we may not be able to deliver products on time and the entities may not be able to deliver their respective products to their respective customers on time. Under the terms of the manufacturing agreement, if ADM is unable to perform its obligations thereunder or is otherwise in breach of any provision thereof, SMI has the right, without penalty, to engage third parties to manufacture some or all of its products. In addition, if SMI elects to utilize a third-party manufacturer to supplement the manufacturing being completed by ADM, SMI has the right to require us to accept delivery of the products from these third-party manufacturers, finalize the manufacture of the products to the extent necessary to comply with FDA regulations and ensure that the design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process have been met. 

&#160; 

As a manufacturer of medical devices, ADM is required to comply with quality requirements, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process. In addition, our manufacturing facility is required to be registered as a medical device manufacturing facility with the FDA and is subject to inspection by the FDA. The Company has been registered by the FDA as a Registered Medical Device Establishment since 1988 allowing it to manufacture medical devices in accordance with procedures outlined in FDA regulations, which include quality control and related activities. Such registration is renewable annually and although we do not believe that the registration will fail to be renewed by the FDA, there can be no assurance of such renewal. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

SUPPLIERS 

&#160; 

We purchase the raw materials, parts, components and other items required to manufacture our products. We rely on a limited number of suppliers for such raw materials, parts, components and other items. Although there are many suppliers for each of these raw materials, parts, components and other items, we are dependent on a limited number of suppliers for many of the significant raw materials and components due to our customers&#8217; requirements. We do not have any long-term or exclusive purchase commitments with any of our suppliers. The failure to maintain existing relationships with suppliers or to establish new relationships in the future could also negatively affect our ability to obtain raw materials and components used in the products in a timely manner. If we are unable to obtain ample supply of product from our existing suppliers or alternative sources of supply, we may be unable to satisfy orders which could reduce our revenues and adversely affect relationships with our customers. Accordingly, in order to satisfy its customers&#39; needs, we have maintained an inventory ranging, in dollar amounts, from 15% to 30% of sales of chemical products in the form of either raw materials or finished goods. 

&#160; 

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 

&#160; 

During our fiscal years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, research and development expenses with respect to company-sponsored research and development activities were approximately $91,774 and $38,055 respectively, which were incurred in our chemical business. During such fiscal years, we did not expend any funds on customer-sponsored research and development activities with respect thereto. 

&#160; 

COMPETITION 

&#160; 

Our businesses are highly competitive and substantially all of our competitors possess greater experience, financial resources, operating history and marketing capabilities than us. Although we do not believe that there are one or more dominant competitors in such industries, there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively compete with any or all of our competitors on the basis of price, service or otherwise. Competitors may be better able to withstand a change in conditions and throughout the economy as a whole. In addition, current and anticipated future consolidation among our competitors and customers may cause us to lose market share as well as put downward pressure on pricing. Furthermore, there is a trend in industry toward relocation of manufacturing facilities to lower-cost regions such as Asia. Such relocation may permit some of our competitors to lower their costs and improve their competitive position. If we do not compete successfully, our business, operating margins, financial condition, cash flows and profitability could be adversely affected. 

&#160; 

Our results of operations depend, in part, on our ability to expand our product offerings. We are committed to remaining a competitive producer and believe that our portfolio of new or re-engineered products is strong. However, we may not be able to develop new products, re-engineer existing products successfully or bring them to market in a timely manner. While we believe that the products, pricing and services we offer customers are competitive, we may not be able to continue to attract and retain customers to which we sell our products. 

&#160; 

INSURANCE 

&#160; 

The Company may be exposed to potential product liability claims by those who use our products. Therefore, we maintain a general liability insurance policy, which includes aggregate product liability coverage of $3,000,000 for certain of our products. We believe that our present insurance coverage is adequate for the types of products we currently market. There can be no assurance, however, that such insurance will be sufficient to cover potential claims or that the present level of coverage will be available in the future at a reasonable cost. 

&#160; 

EMPLOYEES 

&#160; 

As of March 31, 2016, we had 16 full-time employees and 6 part-time employees. As of such date, we had one salaried employee in an executive or managerial position. We believe our relationship with our employees is good.
