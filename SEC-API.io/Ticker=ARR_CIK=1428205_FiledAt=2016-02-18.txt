Our Company 

We are an externally managed Maryland corporation incorporated in 2008, managed by ACM, an investment advisor registered with the SEC (see Note 9 &#32;and Note 14 &#32;to the consolidated financial statements). We invest in residential mortgage backed securities issued or guaranteed by a U.S. GSE, such as the Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or guaranteed by Ginnie Mae (collectively, Agency Securities). We also may invest in other securities backed by residential mortgages for which the payment of principal and interest is not guaranteed by a GSE or government agency (collectively, Non-Agency Securities). While we remain committed to investing in Agency Securities for so long as an adequate supply and pricing exists, we have the flexibility to invest in Non-Agency Securities and respond to changes in GSE policy as needed. At December 31, 2015 &#32;and December 31, 2014 , Agency Securities accounted for 100% &#32;of our securities portfolio. Our securities portfolio consists primarily of Agency Securities backed by fixed rate home loans. From time to time, a portion of our assets may be invested in Agency Securities backed by hybrid adjustable rate and adjustable rate home loans as well as unsecured notes and bonds issued by GSEs, U.S. Treasuries and money market instruments, subject to certain income tests we must satisfy for our qualification as a REIT. 

&#160; 

We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code. Our qualification as a REIT depends on our ability to meet, on a continuing basis, various complex requirements under the Code relating to, among other things, the sources of our gross income, the composition and values of our assets, our distribution levels and the concentration of ownership of our capital stock. We believe that we are organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification as a REIT under the Code and our manner of operations enables us to meet the requirements for taxation as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. 

&#160; 

As a REIT, we will generally not be subject to federal income tax on the REIT taxable income that we currently distribute to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, we will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates. Even if we qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we may still be subject to some federal, state and local taxes on our income. 

Our Strategies 

Our primary goal is to provide an attractive risk adjusted return on stockholders&#8217; equity by acquiring Agency Securities, financing our acquisitions in the capital markets, using targeted leverage ratios and employing risk management. We seek to achieve this goal through the thoughtful and opportunistic application of our asset acquisition, leverage and interest rate management strategies. 

Our Assets 

Since our formation, our assets have been invested in Agency Securities or money market instruments, primarily deposits at federally chartered banks. 

Our Borrowings 

We borrow against our Agency Securities using repurchase agreements. Our borrowings generally have maturities that may range from one month or less, up to one year, although occasionally we may enter into longer dated borrowing agreements to more closely match the rate adjustment period of our Agency Securities. At December 31, 2015 &#32;and December 31, 2014 , our total repurchase indebtedness was approximately $11,570,481 &#32;and $13,881,921 , respectively, with a weighted average maturity of 38 days &#32;and 60 days , respectively. Depending on market conditions, we may enter into additional repurchase arrangements with similar maturities or a committed borrowing facility. Our borrowings are generally between six and ten times the amount of our total stockholders&#8217; equity, but we are not limited to that range. The level of our borrowings may vary periodically depending on 

market conditions. In addition, certain of our MRAs and master swap agreements contain a restriction that prohibits our leverage from exceeding twelve times our stockholders&#8217; equity as well as termination events in the case of significant reductions in equity capital. 

Our Hedging 

We use derivatives to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our cost of funding consistent with our REIT tax requirements. These techniques primarily consist of entering into interest rate swap contracts, swaptions, basis swaps and purchasing or selling Futures Contracts and may also include entering into interest rate cap or floor agreements, purchasing put and call options on securities or securities underlying Futures Contracts, or entering into forward rate agreements. Although we are not legally limited to our use of hedging, we intend to limit our use of derivative instruments to only those techniques described above and to enter into derivative transactions only with counterparties that we believe have a strong credit rating to help limit the risk of counterparty default or insolvency. These transactions are not entered into for speculative purposes. 

To the extent that changes in the swap and futures rates correlate with changes in mortgage rates, changes in the fair values of our derivatives will tend to offset changes in the fair values of our Agency Securities. The actual extent of such offset will depend on the relative size of our portfolios of derivatives and Agency Securities and the actual correlation of rate changes. However, changes in the fair value of our derivatives are reported in net income, while changes in the fair values of our Agency Securities are reported directly in our total stockholders&#8217; equity. Therefore, earnings reported in accordance with GAAP will fluctuate even in situations where our derivatives are operating as intended. As a result of this mark-to-market accounting treatment, our reported results of operations are likely to fluctuate far more than if we used cash flow hedge accounting. Comparisons with companies that use cash flow hedge accounting for all or part of their derivative activities may not be meaningful. 

Our Manager 

&#160; 

We are externally managed by ACM, pursuant to the Management Agreement (see Note 9 &#32;and Note 14 &#32;to the consolidated financial statements). ACM manages our day-to-day operations, subject to the direction and oversight of the Board. The Management Agreement runs through June 18, 2022 and is thereafter automatically renewed for an additional five-year term unless terminated under certain circumstances. Either party must provide 180 days prior written notice of any such termination. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the Management Agreement, ACM is entitled to receive a management fee payable monthly in arrears. Currently, the monthly management fee is 1/12th of the sum of (a) 1.5% of gross equity raised up to $1.0 billion plus (b) 0.75% of gross equity raised in excess of $1.0 billion. The cost of repurchased stock and any dividend representing a return of capital for tax purposes will reduce the amount of gross equity raised used to calculate the monthly management fee. At December 31, 2015 , December 31, 2014 &#32;and December 31, 2013 , the effective management fee was 1.049% , 1.028% &#32;and 1.026% &#32;based on gross equity raised of $2,507,505 , $2,697,223 &#32;and $2,769,661 , respectively. The ACM monthly management fee is not calculated based on the performance of our assets. Accordingly, the payment of our monthly management fee may not decline in the event of a decline in our earnings and may cause us to incur losses. We are also responsible for any costs and expenses that ACM incurred solely on behalf of ARMOUR other than the various overhead expenses specified in the terms of the Management Agreement. ACM is further entitled to receive a termination fee from us under certain circumstances. Our total management fee expense for the year ended &#32; December 31, 2015 , was $27,292 &#32;compared to $27,857 &#32;for the year ended &#32; December 31, 2014 &#32;and $28,141 &#32;for the year ended &#32; December 31, 2013 , respectively. 

&#160; 

We are required to take actions as may be reasonably required to permit and enable ACM to carry out its duties and obligations. We are also responsible for any costs and expenses that ACM incurred solely on our behalf other than the various overhead expenses specified in the terms of the Management Agreement. For the years ended December 31, 2015 , December 31, 2014 &#32;and December 31, 2013 , we reimbursed ACM $1,921 , $2,204 &#32;and $1,550 , respectively, for other expenses incurred on our behalf. In consideration of our 2012 results, in 2013, we also elected to make a restricted stock award to our executive officers and other ACM employees through ACM. The award vests through 2017 and resulted in our recognizing stock based compensation expense of $623 , $900 &#32;and $1,097 &#32;for the years ended December 31, 2015 , December 31, 2014 &#32;and December 31, 2013 . 

Other Activities 

If, when applicable, ACM and the Board determine that additional funding is required, we may raise such funds through equity offerings (including preferred equity), unsecured debt securities, convertible securities (including warrants, preferred equity and debt) or the retention of cash flow (subject to provisions in the Code concerning taxability of undistributed REIT taxable income) or a combination of these methods. 

&#160; 

In the event that ACM and the Board determine that we should raise additional equity capital, we have the authority, without stockholder approval, to issue additional stock in any manner and on such terms and for such consideration as we deem appropriate, at any time. 

On March 5, 2014, our Board increased the authorization under our common stock repurchase program (the &#8220;Repurchase Program&#8221;) to 50,000 &#32;shares of our common stock outstanding (on a pre-reverse stock split basis). On July 28, 2015, our Board of Directors increased the number of shares of common stock authorized for repurchase under our Repurchase Program to an aggregate of 9,000 &#32;shares on a post-reverse stock split basis, effective August 3, 2015. Under the Repurchase Program, shares may be purchased in the open market, including block trades, through privately negotiated transactions, or pursuant to a trading plan separately adopted in the future. The timing, manner, price and amount of any repurchases will be at our discretion, subject to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and related rules. We are not required to repurchase any shares under the Repurchase Program and it may be modified, suspended or terminated at any time for any reason. We do not intend to purchase shares from our Board or other affiliates. Under Maryland law, such repurchased shares are treated as authorized but unissued. During the years &#32;ended December 31, 2015 , December 31, 2014 &#32;and December 31, 2013 , we repurchased 7,510 &#32;shares, 600 &#32;shares and 2,096 &#32;shares of our common stock under the Repurchase Program for an aggregate cost of $159,600 , $18,362 &#32;and $72,694 , respectively. At December 31, 2015 , there were 1,874 &#32;authorized shares remaining under the Repurchase Program. 

Real Estate Investment Trust Requirements 

We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code. As a REIT, we will generally not be subject to federal income tax on the REIT taxable income that we currently distribute to our stockholders. We also must satisfy other ongoing REIT requirements under the Code, including meeting certain asset, income and stock ownership tests. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, we will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates. Even if we qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we may still be subject to some federal, state and local taxes on our income. 

Distributions 

In order to maintain our qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we are required to timely distribute, with respect to each year at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain. To satisfy these requirements, we presently intend to continue to make regular cash distributions of all or substantially all of our taxable income to holders of our stock out of assets legally available for such purposes. We are not restricted from using the proceeds of equity or debt offerings to pay dividends, but we do not intend to do so. The timing and amount of any dividends we pay to holders of our stock will be at the discretion of our Board and will depend upon various factors, including our earnings and financial condition, maintenance of REIT status, applicable provisions of MGCL and such other factors as our Board deems relevant. Dividends in excess of REIT taxable income for the year (including taxable income carried forward from the previous year) will generally not be taxable to common stockholders. 

Investment Company Act of 1940 Exclusion 

&#160; 

We conduct our business so as not to become regulated as an investment company under the 1940 Act. We rely on the exclusion provided by Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the 1940 Act as interpreted by the staff of the SEC. To qualify for this exclusion we must invest at least 55% of our assets in &#8220;mortgages and other liens on and interest in real estate&#8221; or &#8220;qualifying real estate interests&#8221; and at least 80% of our assets in qualifying real estate interests and &#8220;real estate related assets.&#8221; In satisfying this 55% requirement we treat Agency Securities issued with respect to an underlying pool of mortgage loans in which we hold all of the certificates issued by the pool (&#8220;whole pool&#8221; securities) as qualifying real estate interests. We currently treat Agency Securities in which we hold less than all of the certificates issued by the pool (&#8220;partial pool&#8221; securities) as real estate related assets and not qualifying real estate interests. 

There can be no assurance that the laws and regulations governing the 1940 Act status of REITs, including guidance and interpretations from the SEC staff regarding the Section 3(c)(5)(C) exclusion, will not change in a manner that adversely affects our operations or business. For example, such changes might require us to employ less leverage in financing certain of our mortgage related investments and we may be precluded from acquiring certain types of higher yielding securities. The net effect of these factors would be to lower our net interest income. If we fail to qualify for an exclusion from registration as an investment company or an exclusion from the definition of an investment company, our ability to use leverage would be substantially reduced. Our business will be materially and adversely affected if we fail to qualify for an exclusion from regulation under the 1940 Act. 

Compliance with NYSE Corporate Governance Standards 

&#160; 

We comply with the corporate governance standards of the NYSE. Our Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee are comprised entirely of independent directors and a majority of our directors are &#8220;independent&#8221; in accordance with the rules of the NYSE. 

Competition 

&#160; 

Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to acquire assets with favorable margins over our borrowing costs. In acquiring Agency Securities, we compete with mortgage REITs, mortgage finance and specialty finance companies, savings and loan associations, banks, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, mutual funds, institutional investors, investment banking firms, other lenders, governmental bodies and other entities. Many of these organizations have greater financial resources and access to lower costs of capital than we do. Some of these entities may not be subject to the same regulatory constraints that we are (i.e., REIT compliance or maintaining an exclusion under the 1940 Act). In addition, there are numerous mortgage REITs with similar asset acquisition objectives, including Agency Securities and others may be organized in the future. The effect of the existence of additional REITs may be to increase competition for the available supply of mortgage assets suitable for purchase. An increase in competition for financing could adversely affect the availability and cost of our financing. 

Employees 

&#160; 

We are managed by ACM pursuant to the Management Agreement between us and ACM. We do not have any employees. As of December 31, 2015 , ACM had 19 &#32;employees.
