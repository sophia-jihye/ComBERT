Overview 

As used in this Form 10-K, &#8220;MetLife,&#8221; the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our&#8221; and &#8220;us&#8221; refer to MetLife, Inc., a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1999, its subsidiaries and affiliates. 

We have grown to become a global provider of life insurance, annuities, employee benefits and asset management. Through our subsidiaries and affiliates, we hold leading market positions in the United States, Japan, Latin America, Asia, Europe and the Middle East. Over the past several years, we have grown our core businesses, as well as successfully executed on our growth strategy. This has included completing a number of transactions that have resulted in the acquisition and, in some cases, divestiture of certain businesses while also further strengthening our balance sheet to position MetLife for continued growth. 

We are also one of the largest institutional investors in the U.S. with a $508.2 billion general account portfolio invested primarily in investment grade corporate bonds, structured finance securities, mortgage loans and U.S. Treasury and agency securities, as well as real estate and corporate equity, at December 31, 2015 . Over the past several years, we have further diversified and strengthened our general account portfolio. 

Our well-recognized brand, leading market positions, competitive and innovative product offerings and financial strength and expertise should help drive future growth and enhance shareholder value, building on a long history of fairness, honesty and integrity. Over the course of the next several years, we will pursue the following objectives to position the Company for continued growth and achieve our vision of being recognized as the leading global life insurance and employee benefits provider:

Grow consideration of and preference for MetLife&#8217;s brand in key markets 

MetLife is organized into six segments, reflecting three broad geographic regions: Retail; Group, Voluntary &#38; Worksite Benefits; Corporate Benefit Funding; and Latin America (collectively, the &#8220;Americas&#8221;); Asia; and Europe, the Middle East and Africa (&#8220;EMEA&#8221;). In addition, the Company reports certain of its results of operations in Corporate &#38; Other. See &#8220;&#8212; Segments and Corporate &#38; Other&#8221; and Note 2 &#32;of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Company&#8217;s segments and Corporate &#38; Other. See also &#8220;&#8212; Other Key Information&#8221; for information on the Company&#8217;s announcement of its plan to pursue the separation of a substantial portion of its Retail segment, which is organized into two U.S. businesses, Life &#38; Other and Annuities, as well as certain portions of its Corporate Benefit Funding segment and Corporate &#38; Other (the &#8220;Separation&#8221;). &#32;Management continues to evaluate the Company&#8217;s segment performance and allocated resources and may adjust related measurements in the future to better reflect segment profitability. 

In the U.S., we provide a variety of insurance and financial services products, including life, dental, disability, property &#38; casualty, guaranteed interest, stable value and annuities, through both proprietary and independent retail distribution channels, as well as at the workplace. 

Outside the U.S., we provide life, medical, dental, credit and other accident &#38; health insurance, as well as annuities, endowment and retirement &#38; savings products to both individuals and groups. We believe these businesses will continue to grow more quickly than our U.S. businesses. 

Revenues derived from any customer did not exceed 10% of consolidated premiums, universal life and investment-type product policy fees and other revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 . Financial information, including revenues, expenses, operating earnings, and total assets by segment, as well as premiums, universal life and investment-type product policy fees and other revenues by major product groups, is provided in Note 2 &#32;of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Operating revenues and operating earnings are performance measures that are not based on accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;). See &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures&#8221; for definitions of such measures. 

For financial information related to revenues, total assets, and goodwill balances by geographic region, see Notes 2 &#32;and 11 &#32;of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Other Key Information 

On January 12, 2016, the Company announced its plan to pursue the Separation. The Company is currently evaluating structural alternatives for the proposed Separation, including a public offering of shares in an independent, publicly traded company, a spin-off, or a sale. The completion of a public offering would depend on, among other things, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) filing and review process, as well as market conditions. Any Separation that might occur will be subject to the satisfaction of various conditions and approvals, including approval of any transaction by the MetLife, Inc. Board of Directors, satisfaction of any applicable requirements of the SEC, and receipt of insurance and other regulatory approvals and other anticipated conditions. 

In November 2014, MetLife Insurance Company of Connecticut (&#8220;MICC&#8221;), a wholly-owned subsidiary of MetLife, Inc., re-domesticated from Connecticut to Delaware, changed its name to MetLife Insurance Company USA and merged with its subsidiary, MetLife Investors USA Insurance Company (&#8220;MLI-USA&#8221;), and its affiliate, MetLife Investors Insurance Company (&#8220;MLIIC&#8221;), each a U.S. insurance company that issued variable annuity products in addition to other products, and Exeter Reassurance Company, Ltd. (&#8220;Exeter&#8221;), a former offshore, captive reinsurance subsidiary of MetLife, Inc. and affiliate of MICC that mainly reinsured guarantees associated with variable annuity products (the &#8220;Mergers&#8221;). The surviving entity of the Mergers was MetLife Insurance Company USA (&#8220;MetLife USA&#8221;). See &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Executive Summary &#8212; Other Key Information &#8212; Significant Events&#8221; for further information on the Mergers. 

In October 2013, MetLife, Inc. completed its acquisition of Administradora de Fondos de Pensiones Provida S.A. (&#8220;ProVida&#8221;), the largest private pension fund administrator in Chile based on assets under management and number of pension fund contributors. The acquisition of ProVida supports the Company's growth strategy in emerging markets and further strengthens the Company's overall position in Chile. See Note 3 &#32;of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Certain international subsidiaries have a fiscal year cutoff of November 30 th . Accordingly, the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements reflect the assets and liabilities of such subsidiaries as of November 30, 2015 &#32;and 2014 &#32;and the operating results of such subsidiaries for the years ended November 30, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 . The Company is in the process of converting to calendar year reporting for these subsidiaries. These conversions are expected to be substantially complete in the first quarter of 2016. The impact of the conversions on our financial statements to date has been de minimis and, therefore, has been reported in net income in the quarter of conversion. 

Segments and Corporate &#38; Other 

Americas 

Product Overview 

Our businesses in the Americas offer a broad range of protection products and services aimed at serving the financial needs of our customers throughout their lives. These products are sold to individuals and corporations, as well as other institutions, and their respective employees. 

Retail 

Our Retail segment is organized into two U.S. businesses: Life &#38; Other and Annuities. 

Life &#38; Other 

Our Life &#38; Other insurance products and services include variable life, universal life, term life and whole life products. Life &#38; Other products and services also include individual disability income products and personal lines property &#38; casualty insurance, including private passenger automobile, homeowners and personal excess liability insurance. Additionally, through broker-dealer affiliates, the Company offers a full range of mutual funds and other securities products. 

The major products within Life &#38; Other are as follows: 

Variable Life. &#32;Variable life products provide insurance coverage through a contract that gives the policyholder flexibility in investment choices and, depending on the product, in premium payments and coverage amounts, with certain guarantees. Most importantly, with variable life products, premiums and account balances can be directed by the policyholder into a variety of separate account investment options or directed to the Company&#8217;s general account. In the separate account investment options, the policyholder bears the entire risk of the investment results. We collect specified fees for the management of the investment options. The policyholder&#8217;s cash value reflects the investment return of the selected investment options, net of management fees and insurance-related and other charges. In some instances, third-party money management firms manage these investment options. With some products, by maintaining a certain premium level, policyholders may have the advantage of various guarantees that may protect the death benefit from adverse investment experience. 

Universal Life. &#32;Universal life products provide insurance coverage on the same basis as variable life, except that premiums, and the resulting accumulated balances, are allocated only to the Company&#8217;s general account. We credit premiums to an account maintained for the policyholder. Premiums are credited net of specified expenses. Interest is credited to the policyholder&#8217;s account at interest rates we determine, subject to specified minimums. Specific charges are made against the policyholder&#8217;s account for the cost of insurance protection and for expenses. With some products, by maintaining a certain premium level, policyholders may have the advantage of various guarantees that may protect the death benefit from adverse investment experience. 

Term Life. &#32;Term life products provide a guaranteed benefit upon the death of the insured for a specified time period in return for the periodic payment of premiums. Specified coverage periods range from one year to 30 years, but in no event are they longer than the period over which premiums are paid. Death benefits may be level over the period or decreasing. Premiums may be guaranteed at a level amount for the coverage period or may be non-level and non-guaranteed. Term insurance products are sometimes referred to as pure protection products, in that there are typically no savings or investment elements. Term contracts expire without value at the end of the coverage period when the insured party is still living. 

Whole Life. &#32;Whole life products provide a guaranteed benefit upon the death of the insured in return for the periodic payment of a fixed premium over a predetermined period. Premium payments may be required for the entire life of the contract period, to a specified age or period, and may be level or change in accordance with a predetermined schedule. Whole life insurance includes policies that provide a participation feature in the form of dividends. Policyholders may receive dividends in cash or apply them to increase death benefits, increase cash values available upon surrender or reduce the premiums required to maintain the contract in-force. Because the use of dividends is specified by the policyholder, this group of products provides significant flexibility to individuals to tailor the product to suit their specific needs and circumstances, while at the same time providing guaranteed benefits. 

Disability. &#32;Disability products provide a benefit in the event of the disability of the insured. In most instances, this benefit is in the form of monthly income paid until the insured reaches age 65. In addition to income replacement, the product may be used to provide for the payment of business overhead expenses for disabled business owners or mortgage payment protection. 

Property &#38; Casualty. &#32;These products include personal lines property &#38; casualty insurance offered to individuals through a variety of retail distribution channels, including independent agents, property &#38; casualty specialists, and the MetLife Premier Client Group. 

Auto insurance policies provide coverage for private passenger automobiles, utility automobiles and vans, motorcycles, motor homes, antique or classic automobiles and trailers. We also offer traditional coverage such as liability, uninsured motorist, no fault or personal injury protection, as well as collision and comprehensive insurance. 

Homeowners&#8217; insurance policies provide protection for homeowners, renters, condominium owners and residential landlords against losses arising out of damage to dwellings and contents from a wide variety of perils, as well as coverage for liability arising from ownership or occupancy. Other insurance includes personal excess liability (protection against losses in excess of amounts covered by other liability insurance policies), and coverage for recreational vehicles and boat owners. Most of our homeowners&#8217; policies are traditional insurance policies for dwellings, providing protection for loss on a &#8220;replacement cost&#8221; basis. These policies also provide additional coverage for reasonable, normal living expenses incurred by policyholders that have been displaced from their homes. 

Other. &#32;Additionally, through our broker-dealer affiliates, we offer a full range of mutual funds and other securities products. The elimination of transactions from activity between the segments within the Americas occurs within Life &#38; Other. 

Annuities 

Our Annuities business offers a variety of variable and fixed annuities that are primarily sold to individuals and tax-qualified groups in the education, healthcare and not-for-profit sectors. 

The major products within Annuities are as follows: 

Variable Annuities. &#32;Variable annuities provide for both asset accumulation and asset distribution needs. Variable annuities allow the contractholder to make deposits into various investment options in a separate account, as determined by the contractholder. The risks associated with such investment options are borne entirely by the contractholder, except where guaranteed minimum benefits are involved. In certain variable annuity products, contractholders may also choose to allocate all or a portion of their account to the Company&#8217;s general account and are credited with interest at rates we determine, subject to specified minimums. In addition, contractholders may also elect certain minimum death benefit and minimum living benefit guarantees for which additional fees are charged and where asset allocation restrictions may apply. 

Fixed and Indexed Annuities. &#32;Fixed annuities provide for both asset accumulation and asset distribution needs. Fixed annuities do not allow the same investment flexibility provided by variable annuities, but provide guarantees related to the preservation of principal and interest credited. Deposits made into deferred annuity contracts are allocated to the Company&#8217;s general account and are credited with interest at rates we determine, subject to specified minimums. Credited interest rates are guaranteed not to change for certain limited periods of time, ranging from one to 10 years. Fixed income annuities provide a guaranteed monthly income for a specified period of years and/or for the life of the annuitant. Additionally, the Company has recently begun issuing indexed annuities which allow the contractholder to participate in returns from equity indices. 

Group, Voluntary &#38; Worksite Benefits 

We have built a leading position in the U.S. group insurance market through long-standing relationships with many of the largest corporate employers in the U.S. 

Our Group, Voluntary &#38; Worksite Benefits insurance products and services include life, dental, group short- and long-term disability, property &#38; casualty, long-term care, accidental death and dismemberment (&#8220;AD&#38;D&#8221;), critical illness, vision and accident &#38; health coverages, as well as prepaid legal plans. We also sell administrative services-only (&#8220;ASO&#8221;) arrangements to some employers. Under such ASO arrangements, the employer is at risk, as we have not issued an insurance policy. We pay claims funded by the employer and perform other administrative services on behalf of the employer. 

The major products within Group, Voluntary &#38; Worksite Benefits are as follows: 

Life. &#32;Life insurance products and services include variable life, universal life, and term life products. These are similar to the products offered by the Retail Life &#38; Other business except we offer group insurance products as employer-paid benefits or as voluntary benefits where all or a portion of the premiums are paid by the employee. These life insurance products and services also include employee paid supplemental life and are offered as standard products or may be tailored to meet specific customer needs. 

Dental. &#32;Dental products provide insurance and ASO arrangements that assist employees, retirees and their families in maintaining oral health while reducing out-of-pocket expenses and providing superior customer service. Dental plans include the Preferred Dentist Program and the Dental Health Maintenance Organization. 

Disability. &#32;Disability products provide a benefit in the event of the disability of the insured. In most instances, this benefit is in the form of monthly income paid until the insured reaches age 65. 

Property &#38; Casualty. &#32;These products include personal lines property &#38; casualty insurance offered directly to employees at their employer&#8217;s worksite through a variety of distribution channels, including independent agents, property &#38; casualty specialists and direct marketing. The property &#38; casualty products offered by the Group, Voluntary &#38; Worksite business are the same products offered by the Retail property &#38; casualty business. 

Long-term Care. &#32;Long-term care products provide protection against the potentially high costs of long-term care services. They generally pay benefits to insureds who need assistance with activities of daily living or have a cognitive impairment. Although we discontinued the sale of these products in 2010, we continue to support our existing policyholders. 

Corporate Benefit Funding 

The Corporate Benefit Funding segment provides funding and financing solutions that help institutional customers mitigate and manage liabilities primarily associated with their qualified, nonqualified and welfare employee benefit programs using a spectrum of life and annuity-based insurance and investment products. 

The major products within Corporate Benefit Funding are as follows: 

Stable Value Products. &#32;We offer general account guaranteed interest contracts, separate account guaranteed interest contracts, and similar products used to support the stable value option of defined contribution plans. We also offer private floating rate funding agreements that are used for money market funds, securities lending cash collateral portfolios and short-term investment funds. 

General account guaranteed interest contracts are designed to provide stable value investment options within tax-qualified defined contribution plans. Traditional general account guaranteed interest contracts integrate a general account fixed or determinable fixed maturity investment with a general account guarantee of liquidity at contract value for participant transactions. 

Separate account guaranteed interest contracts are available to defined contribution plan sponsors. These contracts integrate market value returns on separate account investments with a general account guarantee of liquidity at contract value to the extent the separate account assets are not sufficient. The contracts do not have a fixed maturity date and are terminable by each party on notice. 

Private floating rate funding agreements are generally privately-placed, unregistered investment contracts issued as general account obligations. Interest is credited based on an external index, generally the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate (&#8220;LIBOR&#8221;). Contracts may contain put provisions (of 90 days or longer) that allow for the contractholder to receive the account balance prior to the stated maturity date. 

Pension Risk Transfers. &#32;We offer general account and separate account annuity products, generally in connection with the termination of defined benefit pension plans. These risk transfer products include single premium buyouts that allow for full or partial transfers of pension liabilities. 

General account annuity products include nonparticipating contracts. Under nonparticipating contracts, group annuity benefits may be purchased for retired and terminated employees or employees covered under terminating or ongoing pension plans. Both immediate and deferred annuities may be purchased by a single premium at issue. There are generally no cash surrender rights, with some exceptions including certain contracts that include liabilities for cash balance pension plans. 

Separate account annuity products include both participating and non-participating contracts. Under participating contracts, group annuity benefits are purchased for retired, terminated, or active employees covered under active or terminated pension plans. Both immediate and deferred fixed annuities are purchased with a single premium. Under some contracts, additional annuities may be periodically purchased at then current purchase rates. The assets supporting the guaranteed benefits for each contract are held in a separate account. Some contracts require the contractholder to make periodic payments to cover investment and insurance expenses. The Company fully guarantees benefit payments and is ultimately responsible for all benefit payments. The non-participating contracts have economic features similar to our general account product, but offer the added protection of an insulated separate account. Under U.S. GAAP, these annuity contracts are treated as general account products. 

Institutional Income Annuities. &#32;These general account contracts are available for purchasing guaranteed payout annuities for employees upon retirement or termination of employment. These annuities can be either life contingent or non-life contingent. These annuities are nonparticipating, do not provide for any loan or cash surrender value and, with few exceptions, do not permit future considerations. 

Torts and Settlements. &#32; We offer innovative strategies for complex litigation settlements, primarily structured settlement annuities. 

Structured settlement annuities are customized annuities designed to serve as an alternative to a lump sum payment in a lawsuit initiated because of personal injury, wrongful death, or a workers&#8217; compensation claim or other claim for damages. Surrenders are generally not allowed, although commutations are permitted in certain circumstances. Guaranteed payments consist of life contingent annuities, term certain annuities and lump sums. 

Capital Markets Investment Products. &#32;Products we offer include funding agreements, funding agreement-backed notes and funding agreement-backed commercial paper. We also issue funding agreements to receive Federal Home Loan Bank (&#8220;FHLB&#8221;) advances and through a program with the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (&#8220;Farmer Mac&#8221;). 

Funding agreement-backed notes are part of a medium term note program, under which funding agreements are issued to a special-purpose trust that issues marketable notes in U.S. dollars or foreign currencies. The proceeds of the issuance of a series of notes are used by the trust to acquire a funding agreement with matching interest and maturity payment terms from the Company. The notes are underwritten and marketed by major investment banks&#8217; broker-dealer operations and are sold to institutional investors. 

Funding agreement-backed commercial paper is issued by a special purpose limited liability company which deposits the proceeds under a master funding agreement issued to it by Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (&#8220;MLIC&#8221;) or MetLife USA. The commercial paper receives the same short-term credit rating as MLIC or MetLife USA and is marketed by major investment banks&#8217; broker-dealer operations. The program allows for funding agreement-backed commercial paper to be issued in U.S. dollars or foreign currencies. 

Through the Farmer Mac program, funding agreements have been issued by MLIC to Farmer Mac, as well as to certain special purpose entities (&#8220;SPEs&#8221;) that have issued debt securities for which payment of interest and principal is secured by such funding agreements, and such debt securities are also guaranteed as to payment of interest and principal by Farmer Mac. 

Other Corporate Benefit Funding Products and Services. &#32;We offer specialized life insurance products and funding agreements designed specifically to provide solutions for funding postretirement benefits and company-, bank- or trust-owned life insurance used to finance nonqualified benefit programs for executives.

Operations

Our retail life, disability and annuities products targeted to individuals are sold via sales forces, comprised of MetLife employees, as well as third-party organizations. Our group and corporate benefit funding products are sold via sales forces primarily comprised of MetLife employees. Personal lines property &#38; casualty insurance products are directly marketed to employees at their employer&#8217;s worksite. Personal lines property &#38; casualty insurance products are also marketed and sold to individuals by independent agents, property &#38; casualty specialists through a direct marketing channel, and via sales forces comprised of MetLife employees.

In Latin America, we market our products and services through a multi-distribution strategy which varies by geographic region and stage of market development. 

Retail Distribution 

Retail products are sold through a diverse set of distribution networks in order to maximize penetration in the market place. These include our MetLife Premier Client Group, third-party organizations and property &#38; casualty specialists.

Additionally, wholesalers sell through financial intermediaries, including regional broker-dealers, brokerage firms, financial planners and banks. 

We market and sell property &#38; casualty products through independent agents, property &#38; casualty specialists, and the MetLife Premier Client Group. In recent years, we have increased the number of independent agents appointed to sell these products. 

Group, Voluntary &#38; Worksite Benefits Distribution 

Group, Voluntary &#38; Worksite Benefits distributes its products and services through a sales force that is segmented by the size of the target customer. Marketing representatives sell either directly to corporate and other group customers or through an intermediary, such as a broker or consultant. In addition, voluntary products are sold by specialists. Employers have been emphasizing voluntary products and, as a result, we have increased our focus on communicating and marketing to employees in order to further foster sales of those products. 

We are a leading provider of personal lines property &#38; casualty insurance products offered to employees at their employer&#8217;s worksite. Marketing representatives market personal lines property &#38; casualty insurance products to employers through a variety of means, including broker referrals and cross-selling to group customers. Once permitted by the employer, MetLife commences marketing efforts to employees, enabling them to purchase coverage and to request payroll deduction over the telephone. 

We have entered into several operating joint ventures and other arrangements with third parties to expand the marketing and distribution opportunities of Group, Voluntary &#38; Worksite Benefits products and services. We also sell our group products and services through sponsoring organizations and affinity groups and provide life and dental coverage to certain employees of the U.S. Government. 

Corporate Benefit Funding Distribution 

Corporate Benefit Funding products and services are distributed through dedicated sales teams and relationship managers. Products may be sold directly to benefit plan sponsors and advisors or through brokers, consultants or other intermediaries. In addition, these sales professionals work with individual, group and global distribution areas to better reach and service customers, brokers, consultants and other intermediaries. 

Latin America Distribution 

Latin America&#8217;s distribution channels include captive agents, direct marketing (&#8220;sponsored and direct to customer&#8221;), large multinational brokers and small and medium-sized brokers, direct and group sales forces (mostly for group policies without broker intermediation), and worksite marketing. The region has an exclusive and captive agency distribution network also selling a variety of individual life, accident &#38; health, and pension products. In the direct marketing channel, we work with sponsors and telesales representatives selling mainly accident &#38; health and individual life products directly to consumers. We currently work with active brokers with registered sales of group and individual life, accident &#38; health, group medical, dental and pension products. 

Asia

Operations 

We operate throughout Asia, with our largest operation in Japan. 

Sales Distribution 

Our Asia operations are geographically diverse with developed and emerging markets. We market our products and services through a multi-channel distribution strategy including career agency, bancassurance, direct marketing, brokerage, other third-party distribution and e-commerce. 

Japan&#8217;s multi-channel distribution strategy consists of captive agents, independent agents, bancassurance, direct marketing and brokers. While face-to-face channels continue to be core to Japan&#8217;s business, other channels, including bancassurance and direct marketing, have become a critical part of Japan&#8217;s distribution strategy. Our Japan operation has maintained its position in bancassurance due to its strong distribution relationship with Japan&#8217;s mega banks, trust banks and various regional banks, as well as with the Japan Post. The direct marketing channel is supported by an industry-leading marketing platform, state-of-the-art call center infrastructure and its own campaign management system. Our direct marketing operations, the largest of which is in Japan, deploy both broadcast marketing approaches (e.g. direct response TV, web-based lead generation) and traditional direct marketing techniques such as inbound and outbound telemarketing. 

Outside of Japan, our distribution strategies differ by country but generally utilize a combination of captive agents, bancassurance relationships and direct marketing. Throughout the region, our Asia operation leverages its expertise in direct marketing operations management to conduct its own campaigns and provide those direct marketing capabilities to third-party sponsors. While not a significant part of the region&#8217;s overall business, sales of group life and pension business are primarily achieved through independent brokers and an employee sales force.

Retirement and Savings Products. We offer fixed annuity products and pension products, including group pension programs in select markets. In Poland and Romania, we offer through specialized pension companies a savings oriented pension product under the mandatory privatized social security systems. 

Credit Insurance. We offer credit insurance policies designed to fulfill certain obligations in the event of the policyholder&#8217;s death. 

Operations 

We operate in several countries across EMEA, with our largest operations in the Gulf and Poland. 

Sales Distribution 

Our EMEA operations are geographically diverse with a mix of developed and emerging markets. We hold leading positions in several markets in the Middle East and Central &#38; Eastern Europe, &#32;and focus on attractive niche segments in more developed markets. Emerging markets represent a significant part of the region&#8217;s overall earnings. Our businesses in EMEA employ a multi-channel distribution strategy, including captive and independent agency, bancassurance and direct-to-consumer. 

Corporate &#38; Other 

Overview 

The Company reports certain of its results of operations in Corporate &#38; Other. Corporate &#38; Other contains the excess capital, as well as certain charges and activities, not allocated to the segments, including external integration costs, internal resource costs for associates committed to acquisitions, enterprise-wide strategic initiative restructuring charges, various start-up businesses (including expatriate benefits insurance and our investment management business through which we offer fee-based investment management services to institutional clients) and certain run-off businesses. Corporate &#38; Other also includes assumed reinsurance of certain variable annuity products from our former operating joint venture in Japan. Under this in-force reinsurance agreement, we reinsure living and death benefit guarantees issued in connection with variable annuity products. Additionally, Corporate &#38; Other includes interest expense related to the majority of the Company&#8217;s outstanding debt and expenses associated with certain legal proceedings and income tax audit issues. Corporate &#38; Other also includes the elimination of intersegment amounts, which generally relate to intersegment loans, which bear interest rates commensurate with related borrowings. 

Policyholder Liabilities 

We establish, and carry as liabilities, actuarially determined amounts that are calculated to meet policy obligations when a policy matures or is surrendered, an insured dies or becomes disabled or upon the occurrence of other covered events, or to provide for future annuity payments. Our liabilities for future policy benefits and claims are established based on estimates by actuaries of how much we will need to pay for future benefits and claims. For life insurance and annuity products, we calculate these liabilities based on assumptions and estimates, including estimated premiums to be received over the assumed life of the policy, the timing of the event covered by the insurance policy, the amount of benefits or claims to be paid and the investment returns on the investments we make with the premiums we receive. We establish liabilities for claims and benefits based on assumptions and estimates of losses and liabilities incurred. Amounts for actuarial liabilities are computed and reported in the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. For more details on policyholder liabilities see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates &#8212; Liability for Future Policy Benefits&#8221; and &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Policyholder Liabilities.&#8221; 

Pursuant to applicable insurance laws and regulations, MetLife, Inc.&#8217;s insurance subsidiaries, including affiliated captive reinsurers, establish statutory reserves, reported as liabilities, to meet their obligations on their respective policies. These statutory reserves are established in amounts sufficient to meet policy and contract obligations, when taken together with expected future premiums and interest at assumed rates. Statutory reserves and actuarial liabilities for future policy benefits generally differ based on accounting guidance. 

U.S. state insurance laws and regulations require certain MetLife entities to submit to superintendents of insurance, with each annual report, an opinion and memorandum of a &#8220;qualified actuary&#8221; that the statutory reserves and related actuarial amounts recorded in support of specified policies and contracts, and the assets supporting such statutory reserves and related actuarial amounts, make adequate provision for their statutory liabilities with respect to these obligations. See &#8220;&#8212; Regulation &#8212; U.S. Regulation &#8212; Insurance Regulation &#8212; Policy and Contract Reserve Adequacy Analysis.&#8221; 

Insurance regulators in many of the non-U.S. countries in which we operate require certain MetLife entities to prepare a sufficiency analysis of the reserves presented in the locally required regulatory financial statements, and to submit that analysis to the regulatory authorities. See &#8220;&#8212; Regulation &#8212; International Regulation.&#8221; 

Underwriting and Pricing 

Our Global Risk Management Department (&#8220;GRM&#8221;) contains a dedicated unit, the primary responsibility of which is the development of product pricing standards and independent pricing and underwriting oversight for MetLife&#8217;s insurance businesses. Further important controls around management of underwriting and pricing processes include regular experience studies to monitor assumptions against expectations, formal new product approval processes, periodic updates to product profitability studies and the use of reinsurance to manage our exposures, as appropriate. See &#8220;&#8212; Reinsurance Activity.&#8221; 

Underwriting 

Underwriting generally involves an evaluation of applications by a professional staff of underwriters and actuaries, who determine the type and the amount of insurance risk that we are willing to accept. We employ detailed underwriting policies, guidelines and procedures designed to assist the underwriter to properly assess and quantify such risks before issuing policies to qualified applicants or groups. 

Insurance underwriting considers not only an applicant&#8217;s medical history, but also other factors such as financial profile, foreign travel, vocations and alcohol, drug and tobacco use. Group underwriting generally evaluates the risk characteristics of each prospective insured group, although with certain voluntary products and for certain coverages, members of a group may be underwritten on an individual basis. We generally perform our own underwriting; however, certain policies are reviewed by intermediaries under guidelines established by us. Generally, we are not obligated to accept any risk or group of risks from, or to issue a policy or group of policies to, any employer or intermediary. Requests for coverage are reviewed on their merits and a policy is not issued unless the particular risk or group has been examined and approved in accordance with our underwriting guidelines. 

The underwriting conducted by our remote underwriting offices and intermediaries, as well as our corporate underwriting office, is subject to periodic quality assurance reviews to maintain high standards of underwriting and consistency. Such offices are also subject to periodic external audits by reinsurers with whom we do business. 

We have established oversight of the underwriting process that facilitates quality sales and serves the needs of our customers, while supporting our financial strength and business objectives. Our goal is to achieve the underwriting, mortality and morbidity levels reflected in the assumptions in our product pricing. This is accomplished by determining and establishing underwriting policies, guidelines, philosophies and strategies that are competitive and suitable for the customer, the agent and us. 

For our property &#38; casualty business, our underwriting function has six principal aspects: evaluating potential voluntary and worksite employer accounts and independent agencies; establishing guidelines for the binding of risks; reviewing coverage bound by agents; underwriting potential insureds, on a case by case basis, presented by agents outside the scope of their binding authority; pursuing information necessary in certain cases to enable issuance of a policy within our guidelines; and ensuring that renewal policies continue to be written at rates commensurate with risk. Subject to very few exceptions, agents in each of the distribution channels have binding authority for risks which fall within our published underwriting guidelines. Risks falling outside the underwriting guidelines may be submitted for approval to the underwriting department; alternatively, agents in such a situation may call the underwriting department to obtain authorization to bind the risk themselves. In most states, we generally have the right within a specified period (usually the first 60 days) to cancel any policy. 

We continually review our underwriting guidelines in light of applicable regulations and to ensure that our policies remain competitive and supportive of our marketing strategies and profitability goals. 

Pricing 

Product pricing reflects our pricing standards, which are consistent for our global businesses. GRM, as well as regional finance and product teams are responsible for pricing and oversight for all of our insurance businesses. Product pricing is based on the expected payout of benefits calculated through the use of assumptions for mortality, morbidity, expenses, persistency and investment returns, as well as certain macroeconomic factors, such as inflation. Investment-oriented products are priced based on various factors, which may include investment return, expenses, persistency and optionality and possible variability of results. For certain products, pricing may include prospective and retrospective experience rating features. Prospective experience rating involves the evaluation of past experience for the purpose of determining future premium rates and we bear all prior year gains and losses. Retrospective experience rating also involves the evaluation of past experience for the purpose of determining the actual cost of providing insurance for the customer; however, the contract includes certain features that allow us to recoup certain losses or distribute certain gains back to the policyholder based on actual prior years&#8217; experience. 

Rates for group insurance and voluntary &#38; worksite products (with the exception of property &#38; casualty products) are based on anticipated earnings and expenses for the book of business being underwritten. Renewals are generally reevaluated annually or biannually and are repriced to reflect actual experience on such products. Products offered by Corporate Benefit Funding are priced on demand. Pricing reflects expected investment returns, as well as mortality, longevity and expense assumptions appropriate for each product. This business is generally nonparticipating and illiquid, as policyholders have few or no options or contractual rights to cash values. 

Rates for individual life insurance products are highly regulated and generally must be approved by the regulators of the jurisdictions in which the product is sold. Generally, such products are renewed annually and may include pricing terms that are guaranteed for a certain period of time. Individual disability income products are based on anticipated results for the occupation being underwritten. Fixed and variable annuity products are also highly regulated and approved by the respective regulators. Such products generally include penalties for early withdrawals and policyholder benefit elections to tailor the form of the product&#8217;s benefits to the needs of the opting policyholder. We periodically reevaluate the costs associated with such options and will periodically adjust pricing levels on our guarantees. Further, from time to time, we may also reevaluate the type and level of guarantee features currently being offered. 

For our property &#38; casualty business, our ability to set and change rates is subject to regulatory oversight. Rates for our major lines of property &#38; casualty insurance are based on our proprietary database, rather than relying on rating bureaus. We determine prices in part from a number of variables specific to each risk. The pricing of personal lines insurance products takes into account, among other things, the expected frequency and severity of losses, the costs of providing coverage (including the costs of acquiring policyholders and administering policy benefits and other administrative and overhead costs such as reinsurance), competitive factors and profit considerations. The major pricing variables for personal lines insurance include characteristics of the insured property, such as age, make and model or construction type, as well as characteristics of the insureds, such as driving record and loss experience, and the insured&#8217;s personal financial management. As a condition of our license to do business in each state, we, like all other personal lines insurers, are required to write or share the cost of private passenger automobile and homeowners insurance for higher risk individuals who would otherwise be unable to obtain such insurance. This &#8220;involuntary&#8221; market, also called the &#8220;shared market,&#8221; is governed by the applicable laws and regulations of each state, and policies written in this market are generally written at rates higher than standard rates and typically afford less coverage. 

We continually review our pricing guidelines in light of applicable regulations and to ensure that our policies remain competitive and supportive of our marketing strategies and profitability goals. 

Reinsurance Activity 

We enter into reinsurance agreements primarily as a purchaser of reinsurance for our various insurance products and also as a provider of reinsurance for some insurance products issued by third parties. We participate in reinsurance activities in order to limit losses, minimize exposure to significant risks, and provide additional capacity for future growth. We enter into various agreements with reinsurers that cover individual risks, group risks or defined blocks of business, primarily on a coinsurance, yearly renewable term, excess or catastrophe excess basis. These reinsurance agreements spread risk and minimize the effect of losses. The extent of each risk retained by us depends on our evaluation of the specific risk, subject, in certain circumstances, to maximum retention limits based on the characteristics of coverages. We also cede first dollar mortality risk under certain contracts. In addition to reinsuring mortality risk, we reinsure other risks, as well as specific coverages. We obtain reinsurance for capital requirement purposes and also when the economic impact of the reinsurance agreement makes it appropriate to do so. 

Under the terms of the reinsurance agreements, the reinsurer agrees to reimburse us for the ceded amount in the event a claim is paid. Cessions under reinsurance agreements do not discharge our obligations as the primary insurer. In the event that reinsurers do not meet their obligations under the terms of the reinsurance agreements, reinsurance recoverable balances could become uncollectible. 

We reinsure our business through a diversified group of well-capitalized, highly rated reinsurers. We analyze recent trends in arbitration and litigation outcomes in disputes, if any, with our reinsurers. We monitor ratings and evaluate the financial strength of our reinsurers by analyzing their financial statements. In addition, the reinsurance recoverable balance due from each reinsurer is evaluated as part of the overall monitoring process. Recoverability of reinsurance recoverable balances is evaluated based on these analyses. We generally secure large reinsurance recoverable balances with various forms of collateral, including secured trusts, funds withheld accounts and irrevocable letters of credit. Additionally, we enter into reinsurance agreements for risk and capital management purposes with several affiliated captive reinsurers. Captive reinsurers are affiliated insurance companies licensed under specific provisions of insurance law of their respective jurisdictions, such as the Special Purpose Financial Captive law adopted by several states including Vermont and Delaware, and have a very narrow business plan that specifically restricts the majority or all of their activity to reinsuring business from their affiliates. See &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Liquidity and Capital Resources &#8212; The Company &#8212; Capital &#8212; Affiliated Captive Reinsurance Transactions.&#8221; 

Americas - Excluding Latin America 

For our Retail Life &#38; Other insurance products, we have historically reinsured the mortality risk primarily on an excess of retention basis or on a quota share basis. We currently reinsure 90% of the mortality risk in excess of $2 million for most products. In addition to reinsuring mortality risk as described above, we reinsure other risks, as well as specific coverages. Placement of reinsurance is done primarily on an automatic basis and also on a facultative basis for risks with specified characteristics. On a case by case basis, we may retain up to $20 million per life and reinsure 100% of amounts in excess of the amount we retain. We evaluate our reinsurance programs routinely and may increase or decrease our retention at any time. 

For our Retail Annuities business, we reinsure a portion of the living and death benefit guarantees issued in connection with our variable annuities. Under these reinsurance agreements, we pay a reinsurance premium generally based on fees associated with the guarantees collected from policyholders, and receive reimbursement for benefits paid or accrued in excess of account values, subject to certain limitations. 

For our Group, Voluntary &#38; Worksite Benefits segment, we generally retain most of the risk and only cede particular risk on certain client arrangements. The majority of our reinsurance activity within this segment relates to the following client agreements: 

&#8226; 

Employer sponsored captive programs: through these programs, employers buy a group life insurance policy with the condition that a portion of the risk is reinsured back to a captive insurer sponsored by the client. 

&#8226; 

Risk-sharing agreements: through these programs, clients require that we reinsure a portion of the risk back to third parties, such as minority-owned reinsurers. 

&#8226; 

Multinational pooling: through these agreements, employers buy many group insurance policies which are aggregated in a single insurer via reinsurance. 

The risks ceded under these agreements are generally quota shares of group life and disability policies. The cessions vary from 50% to 90% of all the risks of the policies. 

For our property &#38; casualty business within both the Retail and Group, Voluntary &#38; Worksite Benefits segments, we purchase reinsurance to manage our exposure to large losses (primarily catastrophe losses) and to protect statutory surplus. We cede losses and premiums based upon the exposure of the policies subject to reinsurance. To manage exposure to large property &#38; casualty losses, we purchase property catastrophe, casualty and property per risk excess of loss reinsurance protection. 

For our Corporate Benefit Funding segment, we have periodically engaged in reinsurance activities on an opportunistic basis. There were no such transactions during the periods presented. 

Latin America, Asia and EMEA 

For certain life insurance products, we currently reinsure risks in excess of $5 million to external reinsurers on a yearly renewable term basis. We may also reinsure certain risks with external reinsurers depending upon the nature of the risk and local regulatory requirements. 

For selected large corporate clients, we reinsure group employee benefits or credit insurance business with various client-affiliated reinsurance companies, covering policies issued to the employees or customers of the clients. Additionally, we cede and assume risk with other insurance companies when either company requires a business partner with the appropriate local licensing to issue certain types of policies in certain countries. In these cases, the assuming company typically underwrites the risks, develops the products and assumes most or all of the risk. 

We also have reinsurance agreements in-force that reinsure a portion of the living and death benefit guarantees issued in connection with variable annuity products. Under these agreements, we pay reinsurance fees associated with the guarantees collected from policyholders, and receive reimbursement for benefits paid or accrued in excess of account values, subject to certain limitations. 

Corporate &#38; Other 

We reinsure through 100% quota share reinsurance agreements certain run-off long-term care and workers&#8217; compensation business written by MetLife USA. 

Corporate &#38; Other also has a reinsurance agreement in-force to reinsure the living and death benefit guarantees issued in connection with certain variable annuity products. Under this agreement, we receive reinsurance fees associated with the guarantees collected from policyholders, and provide reimbursement for benefits paid or accrued in excess of account values, subject to certain limitations. 

Catastrophe Coverage 

We have exposure to catastrophes which could contribute to significant fluctuations in our results of operations. We use excess reinsurance agreements, under which the direct writing company reinsures risk in excess of a specific dollar value for each policy within a class of policies, to provide greater diversification of risk and minimize exposure to larger risks. Such excess reinsurance agreements include retention reinsurance agreements and quota share reinsurance agreements. Retention reinsurance agreements provide for a portion of a risk to remain with the direct writing company, and quota share reinsurance agreements provide for the direct writing company to transfer a fixed percentage of all risks of a class of policies. Our life insurance products, particularly group life, subject us to catastrophe risk which we do not reinsure other than through our ongoing mortality reinsurance program which transfers risk at the individual policy level. For the Americas, excluding Latin America, we use excess of retention and quota share reinsurance agreements to provide greater diversification of risk and minimize exposure to larger risks. Currently, for Latin America, Asia and EMEA, we purchase catastrophe coverage to insure risks within certain countries deemed by management to be exposed to the greatest catastrophic risks.

Overview 

In the U.S., our life insurance companies are regulated primarily at the state le vel with some products and services also subject to federal regulation. I n addition, MetLife, Inc. and its U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation under the insurance holding company laws of various U.S. jurisdictions. As a non-bank systemically important financial institution (&#8220;non-bank SIFI&#8221;), MetLife, Inc. is also subject to regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &#8220;Federal Reserve Board&#8221;) and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (collectively, with the Federal Reserve Board, the &#8220;Federal Reserve&#8221;) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;). Furthermore, some of MetLife&#8217;s operations, products and services are subject to consumer protection laws, securities, broker-dealer and investment adviser regulations, environmental and unclaimed property laws and regulations, and to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (&#8220;ERISA&#8221;). See &#8220; &#8212; &#32;U.S. Regulation.&#8221; 

Our international insurance operations are principally regulated by insurance regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which they are located or operate. In addition, our investment and pension companies outside of the U.S. are subject to oversight by the relevant securities, pension and other authorities of the countries in which the companies operate. Our non-U.S. insurance businesses are also subject to current and developing solvency regimes which impose various capital and other requirements. As a global systemically important insurer (&#8220;G-SII&#8221;), MetLife, Inc. may also become subject to additional capital requirements. See &#8220; &#8212; &#32;International Regulation.&#8221; 

U.S. Regulation 

Insurance Regulation 

State insurance regulation generally aims at supervising and regulating insurers, with the goal of protecting policyholders and ensuring that insurance companies remain solvent. Insurance regulators have increasingly sought information about the potential impact of activities in holding company systems as a whole, and some jurisdictions have adopted laws and regulations enhancing &#8220;group-wide&#8221; supervision, as supported by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners&#8217; (&#8220;NAIC&#8221;) Solvency Modernization Initiative. See &#8220;&#8212; NAIC&#8221; for information regarding group-wide supervision. 

Each of MetLife&#8217;s insurance subsidiaries operating in the United States is licensed and regulated in each U.S. jurisdiction where it conducts insurance business. The extent of such regulation varies, but most jurisdictions have laws and regulations governing the financial aspects and business conduct of insurers. State laws in the U.S. grant insurance regulatory authorities broad administrative powers with respect to, among other things: 

&#8226; 

licensing companies and agents to transact business; 

&#8226; 

calculating the value of assets to determine compliance with statutory requirements; 

&#8226; 

mandating certain insurance benefits; 

&#8226; 

regulating certain premium rates; 

&#8226; 

reviewing and approving certain policy forms; 

&#8226; 

regulating unfair trade and claims practices, including through the imposition of restrictions on marketing and sales practices, distribution arrangements and payment of inducements, and identifying and paying to the states benefits and other property that is not claimed by the owners; 

&#8226; 

regulating advertising; 

&#8226; 

protecting privacy; 

&#8226; 

establishing statutory capital and reserve requirements and solvency standards; 

&#8226; 

specifying the conditions under which a ceding company can take credit for reinsurance in its statutory financial statements (i.e., reduce its reserves by the amount of reserves ceded to a reinsurer); 

&#8226; 

fixing maximum interest rates on insurance policy loans and minimum rates for guaranteed crediting rates on life insurance policies and annuity contracts; 

&#8226; 

adopting and enforcing suitability standards with respect to the sale of annuities and other insurance products; 

&#8226; 

approving changes in control of insurance companies; 

&#8226; 

restricting the payment of dividends and other transactions between affiliates; and 

&#8226; 

regulating the types, amounts and valuation of investments. 

Each insurance subsidiary is required to file reports, generally including detailed annual financial statements, with insurance regulatory authorities in each of the jurisdictions in which it does business, and its operations and accounts are subject to periodic examination by such authorities. These subsidiaries must also file, and in many jurisdictions and in some lines of insurance obtain regulatory approval for, rules, rates and forms relating to the insurance written in the jurisdictions in which they operate. 

State and federal insurance and securities regulatory authorities and other state law enforcement agencies and attorneys general from time to time make inquiries regarding compliance by MetLife, Inc. and its insurance subsidiaries with insurance, securities and other laws and regulations regarding the conduct of our insurance and securities businesses. We cooperate with such inquiries and take corrective action when warranted. See Note 21 &#32;of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Holding Company Regulation 

Insurance holding company laws and regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but generally require a controlled insurance company (insurers that are subsidiaries of insurance holding companies) to register with state regulatory authorities and to file with those authorities certain reports, including information concerning its capital structure, ownership, financial condition, certain intercompany transactions and general business operations. The NAIC adopted revisions to the NAIC Insurance Holding Company System Model Act (&#8220;Model Holding Company Act&#8221;) and the Insurance Holding Company System Model Regulation (&#8220;Regulation&#8221;) in December 2010 and December 2014. The Model Holding Company Act and Regulation serve as a basis for action by the states. See &#8220;&#8212; NAIC&#8221; for further information on the Model Holding Company Act and Regulation. 

State insurance statutes also typically place restrictions and limitations on the amount of dividends or other distributions payable by insurance company subsidiaries to their parent companies, as well as on transactions between an insurer and its affiliates. Dividends in excess of prescribed limits and transactions above a specified size between an insurer and its affiliates require the approval of the insurance regulator in the insurer&#8217;s state of domicile. See &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Liquidity and Capital Resources &#8212; MetLife, Inc. &#8212; Liquidity and Capital Sources &#8212; Dividends from Subsidiaries.&#8221; See also &#8220;Dividend Restrictions&#8221; in Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding such limitations, as well as an amendment to the New York Insurance Law permitting MLIC to pay stockholder dividends to MetLife, Inc. in any calendar year without prior insurance regulatory clearance under one of two alternative formulations during 2016 and going forward. 

Federal Initiatives 

Although the insurance business in the United States is primarily regulated by the states, federal initiatives often have an impact on our business in a variety of ways. From time to time, federal measures are proposed which may significantly affect the insurance business. These areas include financial services regulation, securities regulation, derivatives regulation, pension regulation, health care regulation, privacy, tort reform legislation and taxation. In addition, various forms of direct and indirect federal regulation of insurance have been proposed from time to time, including proposals for the establishment of an optional federal charter for insurance companies. See &#8220;&#8212;Health Care Regulation&#8221; and &#8220;Risk Factors &#8212; Regulatory and Legal Risks &#8212; Our Insurance and Brokerage Businesses Are Highly Regulated, and Changes in Regulation and in Supervisory and Enforcement Policies May Reduce Our Profitability and Limit Our Growth.&#8221; 

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (&#8220;Dodd-Frank&#8221;) effected the most far-reaching overhaul of financial regulation in the U.S. in decades. The full impact of Dodd-Frank on us will depend on the numerous rulemaking initiatives required or permitted by Dodd-Frank and the various studies mandated by Dodd-Frank, many of which remain to be completed. 

Dodd-Frank established the Federal Insurance Office (&#8220;FIO&#8221;) within the Department of the Treasury, which has the authority to participate in the negotiations of international insurance agreements with foreign regulators for the U.S., as well as to collect information about the insurance industry and recommend prudential standards. While not having a general supervisory or regulatory authority over the business of insurance, the director of this office performs various functions with respect to insurance, including serving as a non-voting member of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (&#8220;FSOC&#8221;) and making recommendations to the FSOC regarding insurers to be designated for more stringent regulation. On December 12, 2013, the FIO issued a report, mandated by Dodd-Frank, which, among other things, urged the states to modernize and promote greater uniformity in insurance regulation. However, the report also discussed potential federal solutions if states failed to modernize and improve regulation and some of the report&#8217;s recommendations, for instance, favored a greater federal role in monitoring financial stability and identifying issues or gaps in the regulation of large national and internationally active insurers. 

Dodd-Frank also includes provisions that impact the investments and investment activities of MetLife, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including the federal regulation of such activities. Until the various final regulations are promulgated pursuant to Dodd-Frank, and perhaps for some time thereafter, the full impact of Dodd-Frank on such activities will remain unclear. Such provisions and regulations include, but are not limited to, the potential application of enhanced prudential standards and other restrictions, including the regulation of proprietary trading and sponsoring or investing in hedge funds or private equity funds, to non-bank SIFIs, all of which affect MetLife, Inc. as the FSOC has designated it as a non-bank SIFI. See &#8220;&#8212; Regulation as a Non-Bank SIFI.&#8221; 

Health Care Regulation 

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (&#8220;PPACA&#8221;), signed into law on March 23, 2010, and The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, signed into law on March 30, 2010 (together, the &#8220;Affordable Care Act&#8221;), imposes obligations on MetLife as an enterprise, and as a provider of non-medical health insurance benefits and as a purchaser s &#32;of certain of these products. In 2014, we became subject to an excise tax called the &#8220;health insurer fee,&#8221; the cost of which is primarily passed on to group purchasers of certain of our dental and vision insurance products. Additionally, with respect to dental insurance products sold to groups with 50 or fewer employees, we have changed certain of our product offerings in response to the Affordable Care Act. The cost of these product changes will also be reflected in our pricing of such products. The Affordable Care Act and its related regulations have already resulted in increased and unpredictable costs to provide certain products and may have additional adverse effects. See &#8220;Risk Factors &#8212; Regulatory and Legal Risks &#8212; Legislative and Regulatory Activity in Health Care and Other Employee Benefits Could Affect our Profitability as a Provider of Life Insurance, Annuities, and Non-Medical Health Insurance Benefit Products.&#8221; It has also harmed our competitive position, as the Affordable Care Act has a disparate impact on our products compared to products offered by our not-for-profit competitors. 

On July 14, 2014, the District of Columbia (&#8220;DC&#8221;) adopted a law that imposes an assessment on health insurers doing business in DC, including those that issue non-medical health-related products that are not subject to regulation under the Affordable Care Act. While the financial impact to the Company of DC&#8217;s action will be minimal, if other states decide to successfully adopt this model, there could be an impact on product pricing and sales. Currently 16 states and DC have created their own public healthcare exchanges. One other state (Connecticut) has levied an assessment and other states may also consider levying assessments on both medical and non-medical health insurers to fund their healthcare exchanges. On June 25, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court, in the King v. Burwell decision, upheld the payment of tax credits to individuals who purchase coverage in states that have a federally facilitated exchange rather than a state exchange. Had the Supreme Court not upheld this payment, it is likely more states would have been compelled to create their own exchanges and possibly assess insurers for the fees of running these exchanges. 

The Preservation of Access to Care for Medicare Beneficiaries and Pension Relief Act of 2010 also includes certain provisions for defined benefit pension plan funding relief. As part of our Corporate Benefit Funding segment, we offer general account and separate account group annuity products that enable a plan sponsor to transfer these risks, often in connection with the termination of defined benefit pension plans. See &#8220;Risk Factors &#8212; Regulatory and Legal Risks &#8212; Legislative and Regulatory Activity in Health Care and Other Employee Benefits Could Affect our Profitability as a Provider of Life Insurance, Annuities, and Non-Medical Health Insurance Benefit Products&#8221; for further information regarding the potential effect of such regulation. 

Guaranty Associations and Similar Arrangements 

Most of the U.S. jurisdictions in which our insurance subsidiaries are admitted to transact business require life, health and property &#38; casualty insurers doing business within the jurisdiction to participate in guaranty associations, which are organized to pay certain contractual insurance benefits owed pursuant to insurance policies issued by impaired, insolvent or failed insurers. These associations levy assessments, up to prescribed limits, on all member insurers in a particular state on the basis of the proportionate share of the premiums written by member insurers in the lines of business in which the impaired, insolvent or failed insurer is engaged. Some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets. 

In the past five years, the aggregate assessments levied against MetLife have not been material. We have established liabilities for guaranty fund assessments that we consider adequate. See Note 21 &#32;of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the insolvency assessments. 

Insurance Regulatory Examinations and Other Activities 

As part of their regulatory oversight process, state insurance departments conduct periodic detailed examinations of the books, records, accounts, and business practices of insurers domiciled in their states. State insurance departments also have the authority to conduct examinations of non-domiciliary insurers that are licensed in their states. Except as otherwise disclosed in Note 21 &#32;of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, during the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , MetLife did not receive any material adverse findings resulting from state insurance department examinations of its insurance subsidiaries. 

Regulatory authorities in a small number of states, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (&#8220;FINRA&#8221;) and, occasionally, the SEC, have had investigations or inquiries relating to sales of individual life insurance policies or annuities or other products by MLIC, MetLife USA, New England Life Insurance Company, General American Life Insurance Company (&#8220;GALIC&#8221;), and broker-dealer, MetLife Securities, Inc. These investigations often focus on the conduct of particular financial services representatives and the sale of unregistered or unsuitable products or the misuse of client assets. Over the past several years, these and a number of investigations by other regulatory authorities were resolved for monetary payments and certain other relief, including restitution payments. We may continue to resolve investigations in a similar manner. 

In addition, claims payment practices by insurance companies have received increased scrutiny from regulators. See Note 21 &#32;of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding retained asset accounts and unclaimed property inquiries and related litigation. 

We also received an inquiry relating to licensing. See Note 21 &#32;of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the settlement of a licensing matter with the New York State Department of Financial Services (the &#8220;Department of Financial Services&#8221;) and the District Attorney, New York County, and a related amendment to the New York Insurance Law. 

State insurance regulators and the NAIC are also investigating the use of affiliated captive reinsurers and offshore entities to reinsure insurance risks. The NAIC contracted with Rector &#38; Associates to study captives and recommend additional regulation. Rector &#38; Associates issued recommendations in June 2014, modifying its report which was released for comment in late February 2014 (as modified, the &#8220;Rector Report&#8221;). The Rector Report was adopted by an NAIC task force on June 30, 2014 and by an NAIC executive committee on August 17, 2014. As a result, a number of NAIC working groups have adopted and may continue to adopt additional regulations on captives. It is premature to project the impact, if any, of any such regulations on MetLife. 

Like many life insurance companies, we utilize captive reinsurers to satisfy reserve and capital requirements related to universal life and term life insurance policies. Insurance regulators in a few states, including New York and California, have imposed a moratorium on new reinsurance transactions between life insurers domiciled in those states and captive reinsurers. We will continue to evaluate product modifications, pricing structure and alternative means of managing risks, capital and statutory reserves. We expect the discontinued use of captive reinsurance on new reserve financing transactions would not have a material impact on our future consolidated financial results. See &#8220;Risk Factors &#8212; Regulatory and Legal Risks &#8212; Our Insurance and Brokerage Businesses Are Highly Regulated, and Changes in Regulation and in Supervisory and Enforcement Policies May Reduce Our Profitability and Limit Our Growth.&#8221; As a result of the Mergers, we no longer cede any U.S. variable annuity guarantee risks to a captive reinsurer. Instead, our reinsured U.S. variable annuity risks that were previously reinsured by captives are now reinsured by MLIC, MetLife USA, or third parties. For more information on our use of captive reinsurers see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Liquidity and Capital Resources &#8212; The Company &#8212; Capital &#8212; Affiliated Captive Reinsurance Transactions&#8221; and Note 16 &#32;of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The International Association of Insurance Supervisors (&#8220;IAIS&#8221;) has encouraged U.S. insurance supervisors, such as the Department of Financial Services, to establish Supervisory Colleges for U.S.-based insurance groups with international operations, including MetLife, to facilitate cooperation and coordination among the insurance groups&#8217; supervisors and to enhance the member regulators&#8217; understanding of an insurance group&#8217;s risk profile. MetLife, Inc. was the subject of Supervisory College meetings in prior years chaired by the Department of Financial Services and attended by MetLife&#8217;s key U.S. and international insurance regulators. Because MetLife, Inc. is now supervised as a non-bank SIFI, an April 2015 Supervisory College was co-chaired by the Department of Financial Services and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and attended by MetLife&#8217;s key U.S. and international regulators, including the FDIC, which has joint authority with the Federal Reserve Board over the resolution plan that MetLife will be required to submit. The next meeting is scheduled for June 2016 and will be chaired by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. See &#8220;&#8212; Regulation as a Non-Bank SIFI &#8212; Enhanced Prudential Standards for Non-Bank SIFIs&#8221; below. We have not received any reports or recommendations from the Supervisory College meetings, and we do not expect any outcome of the meetings to have a material adverse effect on our business. 

Policy and Contract Reserve Adequacy Analysis 

Annually, our U.S. insurance subsidiaries, including affiliated captive reinsurers, are required to conduct an analysis of the adequacy of all statutory reserves. In each case, a qualified actuary must submit an opinion which states that the statutory reserves make adequate provision, according to accepted actuarial standards of practice, for the anticipated cash flows required by the contractual obligations and related expenses of the U.S. insurance subsidiary. The adequacy of the statutory reserves is considered in light of the assets held by the insurer with respect to such reserves and related actuarial items including, but not limited to, the investment earnings on such assets, and the consideration anticipated to be received and retained under the related policies and contracts. The Company may increase reserves in order to submit an opinion without qualification. Since inception of this requirement, our U.S. insurance subsidiaries which are required by their states of domicile to provide these opinions have provided such opinions without qualifications. 

NAIC 

The NAIC is an organization, the mission of which is to assist state insurance regulatory authorities in serving the public interest and achieving the insurance regulatory goals of its members, the state insurance regulatory officials. Through the NAIC, state insurance regulators establish standards and best practices, conduct peer reviews, and coordinate their regulatory oversight. The NAIC provides standardized insurance industry accounting and reporting guidance through its Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual (the &#8220;Manual&#8221;). However, statutory accounting principles continue to be established by individual state laws, regulations and permitted practices. Changes to the Manual or modifications by the various state insurance departments may impact the statutory capital and surplus of MetLife, Inc.&#8217;s U.S. insurance subsidiaries. 

The Model Holding Company Act and Regulation include a new requirement that the ultimate controlling person of a U.S. insurer file an annual enterprise risk report with the lead state of the insurer identifying risks likely to have a material adverse effect upon the financial condition or liquidity of the insurer or its insurance holding company system as a whole. To date, all of the states where MetLife has domestic insurers have enacted a version of the revised Model Holding Company Act, including the enterprise risk reporting requirement. In December 2014, the NAIC adopted amendments to the Model Holding Company Act that would authorize state insurance commissioners to act as global group-wide supervisors for internationally active insurance groups, as well as other insurers who choose to opt in for the group-wide supervision. The amendments create a selection process for the group-wide supervisor, extend confidentiality protection to communications with the group-wide supervisor, and outline the duties of the group-wide supervisor. To date, a number of jurisdictions have adopted laws and regulations enhancing group-wide supervision. 

The NAIC has concluded its &#8220;Solvency Modernization Initiative,&#8221; which was designed to review the U.S. financial regulatory system and all aspects of financial regulation affecting insurance companies. Though broad in scope, the NAIC&#8217;s Solvency Modernization Initiative focused on: (1) capital requirements; (2) corporate governance and risk management; (3) group supervision; (4) statutory accounting and financial reporting; and (5) reinsurance. In furtherance of this initiative, the NAIC adopted the Corporate Governance Annual Filing Model Act and Regulation at its August 2014 meeting. The new model, which requires insurers to make an annual confidential filing regarding their corporate governance policies, is expected to become effective in 2016. In addition, in September 2012, the NAIC adopted the Risk Management and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment Model Act (&#8220;ORSA&#8221;), which has been enacted by our insurance subsidiaries&#8217; domiciliary states. ORSA requires that insurers maintain a risk management framework and conduct an internal own risk and solvency assessment of the insurer&#8217;s material risks in normal and stressed environments. The assessment must be documented in a confidential annual summary report, a copy of which must be made available to regulators as required or upon request. MetLife&#8217;s first ORSA summary report was submitted on behalf of the enterprise in December 2015. 

In December 2012, the NAIC approved a new valuation manual containing a principles-based approach to life insurance company reserves. Principles-based reserving is designed to better address reserving for products, including the current generation of products for which the current formulaic basis for reserve determination does not work effectively. The principles-based approach will not become effective unless it is enacted into law by a minimum number of state legislatures. Insurance commissioners of certain states (e.g., New York) oppose or do not actively support the principles-based reserve approach. 

We cannot predict the capital and reserve impacts or compliance costs, if any, that may result from the above initiatives. 

Surplus and Capital; Risk-Based Capital 

Insurers are required to maintain their capital and surplus at or above minimum levels. Regulators have discretionary authority, in connection with the continued licensing of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries, to limit or prohibit an insurer&#8217;s sales to policyholders if, in their judgment, the regulators determine that such insurer has not maintained the minimum surplus or capital or that the further transaction of business will be hazardous to policyholders. Most of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to risk-based capital (&#8220;RBC&#8221;) requirements. RBC is based on a formula calculated by applying factors to various asset, premium, claim, expense and statutory reserve items. The formula takes into account the risk characteristics of the insurer and is calculated on an annual basis. The major categories of risk involved are asset risk, insurance risk, interest rate risk, market risk and business risk. The formula is used as an early warning regulatory tool to identify possible inadequately capitalized insurers for purposes of initiating regulatory action, and not as a means to rank insurers generally. State insurance laws provide insurance regulators the authority to require various actions by, or take various actions against, insurers whose total adjusted capital does not meet or exceed certain RBC levels. As of the date of the most recent annual statutory financial statements filed with insurance regulators, the total adjusted capital of each of our subsidiaries subject to these requirements was in excess of each of those RBC levels. See &#8220;Statutory Equity and Income&#8221; in Note 16 &#32;of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Liquidity and Capital Resources &#8212; The Company &#8212; Capital &#8212; Statutory Capital and Dividends.&#8221; 

While not required by or filed with insurance regulators, we calculate internally defined combined RBC ratios (&#8220;Combined RBC Ratios&#8221;), which are determined by dividing the sum of total adjusted capital for MetLife, Inc.&#8217;s principal U.S. insurance subsidiaries, excluding American Life Insurance Company (&#8220;American Life&#8221;), by the sum of company action level RBC for such subsidiaries. We calculate Combined RBC Ratios based on NAIC capital and reserving requirements (&#8220;NAIC-Based Combined RBC Ratios&#8221;). We also calculate Combined RBC Ratios derived from the statutory-basis financial statements as filed with insurance regulators (&#8220;Statement-Based Combined RBC Ratios&#8221;), which include additional capital requirements as required by the Department of Financial Services for the Company&#8217;s New York domiciled insurance subsidiaries. 

Our NAIC-Based Combined RBC Ratios were 537% and 437% at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our Statement-Based Combined RBC Ratios were 513% and 398% at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Higher total adjusted capital coupled with lower company action level RBC resulted in an increase of 100 points in the NAIC-Based Combined RBC Ratio at December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 and contributed to the increase of 115 points in the Statement-Based Combined RBC Ratio at December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014. In addition, the reserve relief from the Department of Financial Services discussed below also contributed to this increase in the Statement-Based Combined RBC Ratio. 

Combined statutory net income of MetLife, Inc.&#8217;s U.S. insurance subsidiaries, excluding American Life, was $3.2 billion (see Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and $2.3 billion on a statement-basis and NAIC-basis, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015. In both cases, statutory net income was the primary driver of the increase in total adjusted capital. In addition, statutory net income on a statement-basis benefited from the release of asset adequacy reserves at MLIC as discussed below. This was partially offset by an increase in reserves at MetLife USA. Also, on February 24, 2016, MetLife, Inc. paid a cash capital contribution of $1.5 billion to MetLife USA, which is included in MetLife USA statutory capital as of December 31, 2015 and also increased total adjusted capital. This capital contribution was made in contemplation of the proposed Separation. See Note 23 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The additional MetLife USA capital was not required to meet any regulatory solvency or liquidity targets but rather is intended to support the anticipated standalone ratings of the insurance subsidiaries of the new company. This net increase in total adjusted capital was partially offset by dividends to MetLife, Inc. and unrealized investment losses of $2.3 billion and $0.8 billion, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Benefits from the shifting of the investment portfolio to asset classes with lower risk charges resulted in lower company action level RBC. This was coupled with lower market risk charges on variable annuity reserves, since in 2015 reserves were increased sufficiently to cover this market risk charge to RBC. 

In addition to the aforementioned drivers of the increase in the NAIC-Based Combined RBC Ratio, the increase in the Statement-Based Combined RBC Ratios of 115 points was driven by Department of Financial Services Special Considerations Letters (each, an &#8220;SCL&#8221;) in 2015 and 2014, which lowered MLIC&#8217;s statement-based statutory capital and surplus at December 31, 2015 and 2014 by $0.5 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, compared to NAIC-based statutory capital and surplus. The 2015 SCL provided meaningful relief to MLIC as compared to the 2014 SCL as it included, among other things, a provision that allowed insurers to seek approval to aggregate the results of their life, annuity and health businesses to satisfy asset adequacy testing requirements. This enabled MLIC to release asset adequacy reserves for long-term care and market value adjusted annuities of $0.7 billion and $0.2 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2015 and to avoid an estimated additional $0.3 billion of reserve strengthening that would have been required at December 31, 2015. 

Effective December 31, 2013, the Department of Financial Services discontinued its most recent amendment to Regulation 147 which governed the valuation of life insurance policies. The amendment reflected changes made in 2013 by the NAIC to Actuarial Guideline 38 (which impacts the valuation of universal and variable life policies with secondary guarantees (&#8220;ULSG&#8221;)). As a result of this action, New York licensed insurers are required to comply with a prior version of the regulation. As of December 31, 2015, statutory reserves on in-force ULSG, net of reinsurance, exceed NAIC requirements by $103 million for MLIC and $26 million for MetLife Reinsurance Company of Vermont (&#8220;MRV&#8221;). The change in the regulation has a minimal reserve impact on new sales of ULSG products. 

We are not aware of any NAIC adoptions that would have a material impact on the RBC of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries. 

Regulation of Investments 

Each of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries is subject to state laws and regulations that require diversification of our investment portfolios and limit the amount of investments in certain asset categories, such as below investment grade fixed income securities, real estate equity, other equity investments, and derivatives. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations would cause investments exceeding regulatory limitations to be treated as non-admitted assets for purposes of measuring surplus and, in some instances, would require divestiture of such non-qualifying investments. We believe that the investments made by each of MetLife, Inc.&#8217;s U.S. insurance subsidiaries complied, in all material respects, with such regulations at December 31, 2015 . 

Regulation as a Non-Bank SIFI 

On December 18, 2014, the FSOC designated MetLife, Inc. as a non-bank SIFI subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve and to enhanced supervision and prudential standards. See &#8220;&#8212; Enhanced Prudential Standards for Non-Bank SIFIs.&#8221; 

On January 13, 2015, MetLife, Inc. filed an action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia asking the court to review and rescind the FSOC&#8217;s designation of MetLife, Inc. as a non-bank SIFI. The court held oral argument on the parties&#8217; cross motions for summary judgment on February 10, 2016. On January 12, 2016, MetLife, Inc. announced its plan to pursue the Separation. See Note 23 &#32;of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. See also &#8220;Risk Factors &#8212; Regulatory and Legal Risks &#8212; Our Insurance and Brokerage Businesses Are Highly Regulated, and Changes in Regulation and in Supervisory and Enforcement Policies May Reduce Our Profitability and Limit Our Growth &#8212; U.S Regulation &#8212; Regulation of MetLife, Inc. as a Non-Bank SIFI&#8221; regarding the potential impact of the proposed Separation on MetLife, Inc.&#8217;s or the new company&#8217;s status as a non-bank SIFI. 

Regulation of MetLife, Inc. as a non-bank SIFI could materially and adversely affect our business. For example, although the Federal Reserve Board has not yet determined the enhanced capital requirements that will apply to MetLife, those capital requirements may adversely affect our ability to compete with other insurers that are not subject to those requirements, and our ability to issue guarantees could be constrained. In addition, as a non-bank SIFI, MetLife, Inc. needs to obtain Federal Reserve approval before directly or indirectly acquiring, merging or consolidating with a financial company having more than $10 billion of assets or acquiring 5% or more of any voting class of securities of a bank or bank holding company and, depending on the extent of the combined company&#8217;s liabilities, is subject to additional restrictions regarding its ability to merge. The Federal Reserve also has the right to require any of our insurance companies, or insurance company affiliates, to take prompt action to correct any financial weaknesses. 

Together with other non-bank SIFIs, MetLife, Inc. is subject to a number of Dodd-Frank requirements including responsibility to pay certain assessments and other charges (i) equal to the total expenses the Federal Reserve Board thinks is necessary for its supervision of bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies with assets of $50 billion or more, and non-bank SIFIs, and (ii) in connection with the Financial Research Fund within the U.S. Department of Treasury that funds the Office of Financial Research, an agency established by Dodd-Frank to improve the quality of financial data available to policymakers and facilitate more robust and sophisticated analysis of the financial system. 

Enhanced Prudential Standards for Non-Bank SIFIs 

In December 2011, in accordance with Dodd-Frank, the Federal Reserve Board proposed a rule that would have applied a set of prudential standards to non-bank SIFIs, including enhanced RBC requirements, leverage limits, liquidity requirements, single counterparty exposure limits, governance requirements for risk management, stress test requirements, special debt-to-equity limits for certain companies, and early remediation procedures. While the final rule did not apply to non-bank SIFIs, the Federal Reserve Board has indicated that it plans to apply enhanced prudential standards to non-bank SIFIs by rule or order, enabling it to more appropriately tailor the standards to non-bank SIFIs and will provide affected non-bank SIFIs with notice and the opportunity to comment prior to determination of their enhanced prudential standards. Accordingly, the manner in which these proposed standards might apply to MetLife, Inc. remains unclear. 

In particular, the Federal Reserve Board has not determined the requirements that will govern the amount and composition of capital that MetLife, Inc. is required to hold. Legislation was signed into law on December 18, 2014 relieving the Federal Reserve Board from certain provisions in Dodd-Frank that it believed constrained its ability to tailor capital rules for insurers that are non-bank SIFIs. See &#8220;Risk Factors &#8212; Regulatory and Legal Risks &#8212; Our Insurance and Brokerage Businesses Are Highly Regulated, and Changes in Regulation and in Supervisory and Enforcement Policies May Reduce Our Profitability and Limit Our Growth &#8212; U.S. Regulation &#8212; Regulation of MetLife, Inc. as a Non-Bank SIFI.&#8221; On September 30, 2014, the Federal Reserve Board announced that it would begin a quantitative impact study (&#8220;QIS&#8221;) to evaluate the potential effects of its revised regulatory capital framework on savings and loan holding companies and non-bank financial companies supervised by the Federal Reserve that are substantially engaged in insurance underwriting activity (insurance holding companies). The Federal Reserve Board conducted the QIS in order to enable it to design a capital framework for insurance holding companies it supervises; however, because the QIS was designed prior to the December 18, 2014 statutory change, the Federal Reserve has said the data collected has limitations and that they may seek additional data in the future. MetLife, Inc. voluntarily participated in the QIS. 

Stress testing requirements have been implemented, which will, once capital requirements for non-bank SIFIs are determined, require non-bank SIFIs to undergo three stress tests each year: an annual supervisory stress test conducted by the Federal Reserve and two company-run stress tests (an annual test which coincides with the timing of the supervisory stress test, and a mid-cycle test). Companies will be required to take the results of the stress tests into consideration in their annual capital planning and resolution and recovery planning. As a non-bank SIFI, MetLife, Inc.&#8217;s competitive position and its ability to pay dividends, repurchase common stock or other securities or engage in other transactions that could affect its capital or need for capital could be adversely affected by any additional capital requirements that might be imposed as a result of the stress testing requirements, as well as enhanced prudential standards, other measures imposed as a result of the enactment of Dodd-Frank and other regulatory initiatives. 

Non-bank SIFIs are required to submit a resolution plan setting forth how the company could be resolved under the Bankruptcy Code in the event of material financial distress. Resolution plans have to be resubmitted annually and promptly following any event, occurrence, change in conditions or circumstances, or other change that results in, or could reasonably be foreseen to have, a material effect on the resolution plan. A failure to submit a &#8220;credible&#8221; resolution plan could result in the imposition of a variety of measures, including additional capital, leverage, or liquidity requirements, and forced divestiture of assets or operations. As a non-bank SIFI, MetLife, Inc. will be required to submit a resolution plan by December 31, 2016, unless the Federal Reserve Board and FDIC require a different due date. 

In addition, if it were determined that MetLife, Inc. posed a substantial threat to U.S. financial stability, the applicable federal regulators would have the right to require it to take one or more other mitigating actions to reduce that risk, including limiting its ability to merge with or acquire another company, terminating activities, restricting its ability to offer financial products or requiring it to sell assets or off-balance sheet items to unaffiliated entities. Enhanced standards would also permit, but not require, regulators to establish requirements with respect to contingent capital, enhanced public disclosures and short-term debt limits. These standards are described as being more stringent than those otherwise imposed on bank holding companies; however, the Federal Reserve is permitted to apply them on an institution-by-institution basis, depending on its determination of the institution&#8217;s level of risk. 

Orderly Liquidation Authority 

Under the provisions of Dodd-Frank relating to the resolution or liquidation of certain types of financial institutions, if MetLife, Inc. or another financial institution were to become insolvent or were in danger of defaulting on its obligations, it could be compelled to undergo liquidation with the FDIC as receiver. For this new regime to be applicable, a number of determinations would have to be made, including that a default by the affected company would have serious adverse effects on financial stability in the U.S. While under this new regime an insurance company would be resolved in accordance with state insurance law, if the FDIC were to be appointed as the receiver for another type of company (including an insurance holding company such as MetLife, Inc.), the liquidation of that company would occur under the provisions of the new liquidation authority, and not under the Bankruptcy Code, which ordinarily governs liquidations. The FDIC&#8217;s purpose under the liquidation regime is to mitigate the systemic risks the institution&#8217;s failure poses, which is different from that of a bankruptcy trustee under the Bankruptcy Code. In such a liquidation, the holders of such company&#8217;s debt could in certain respects be treated differently than under the Bankruptcy Code. As required by Dodd-Frank, the FDIC has established rules relating to the priority of creditors&#8217; claims and the potentially dissimilar treatment of similarly situated creditors. These provisions could apply to some financial institutions whose outstanding debt securities we hold in our investment portfolios. Dodd-Frank also provides for the assessment of bank holding companies with assets of $50 billion or more, non-bank SIFIs, and other financial companies with assets of $50 billion or more, to cover the costs of liquidating any financial company subject to the new liquidation authority. 

Volcker Rule 

Under the Volcker Rule, Dodd-Frank authorizes through rulemaking additional capital requirements and quantitative limits on proprietary trading and sponsoring or investing in funds (hedge funds and private equity funds) that rely on certain exemptions from the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the &#8220;Investment Company Act&#8221;), by a non-bank SIFI. Regulations defining and governing such requirements and limits on non-bank SIFIs have not been proposed and were not addressed in the final regulations issued on December 10, 2013 implementing the Volcker Rule for insured depository institutions and their affiliates (&#8220;Volcker Rule Regulations&#8221;). After designation as a non-bank SIFI, a non-bank SIFI will have a two-year period, subject to further extension by the Federal Reserve Board, to conform to any such requirements and limits that may be set forth in final regulations applicable to non-bank SIFIs. Subject to safety and soundness determinations as part of rulemaking that could require additional capital requirements and quantitative limits, Dodd-Frank provides that the exemptions under the Volcker Rule also are available to exempt any additional capital requirements and quantitative limits on non-bank SIFIs. The Volcker Rule Regulations provide an exemption, subject to certain requirements, for trading activities and fund sponsorship and investments by a regulated insurance company and its affiliates solely for the general account or separate account of such insurance company. Until final regulations applicable to non-bank SIFIs have been promulgated, it is unclear whether MetLife, Inc., as a non-bank SIFI, may have to alter any of its future activities to comply. 

ERISA Considerations 

We provide products and services to certain employee benefit plans that are subject to ERISA or the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#8220;Code&#8221;). As such, our activities are subject to the restrictions imposed by ERISA and the Code, including the requirement under ERISA that fiduciaries must perform their duties solely in the interests of ERISA plan participants and beneficiaries, and that fiduciaries may not cause a covered plan to engage in certain prohibited transactions. The applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code are subject to enforcement by the Department of Labor (&#8220;DOL&#8221;), the Internal Revenue Service and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. 

The prohibited transaction rules of ERISA and the Code generally restrict the provision of investment advice to ERISA plans and participants and Individual Retirement Accounts (&#8220;IRAs&#8221;) if the investment recommendation results in fees paid to the individual advisor, his or her firm or their affiliates that vary according to the investment recommendation chosen. 

The DOL proposed new regulations in April 2015 that would substantially expand the definition of &#8220;investment advice&#8221; and thereby broaden the circumstances under which MetLife, in providing investment advice with respect to ERISA plans, plan participants or IRAs, could be deemed a fiduciary under ERISA or the Code. Pursuant to the proposal, any communications with plans, plan participants and IRA holders, including the marketing of products, and marketing of investment management or advisory services, could be deemed fiduciary investment advice, thus, causing increased exposure to fiduciary liability. The DOL also proposed amendments to its prohibited transaction exemptions, and proposed a new exemption, that would apply more onerous disclosure and contract requirements to, and increase fiduciary requirements and fiduciary liability exposure in respect of, transactions involving ERISA plans, plan participants and IRAs. 

If the new DOL proposals become final, MetLife may find it necessary to change sales representative and/or broker compensation and may limit the assistance or advice they can provide. Sales to middle income investors would be unlikely to generate fees sufficient to offset the increased cost of providing advice under the rules, if adopted as proposed. Under the rules as proposed, MetLife could reduce its risk of exposure to fiduciary liability by electing not to engage in the concurrent manufacturing and distribution of certain products, including individual annuity products. Further, if the proposed rules apply to welfare benefit plans, they will disrupt settled practices in the marketing and sales of welfare benefit plan insurance products. 

In addition, the DOL has issued a number of regulations that increase the level of disclosure that must be provided to plan sponsors and participants. The participant disclosure regulations and the regulations which require service providers to disclose fee and other information to plan sponsors took effect in 2012. In &#32; John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company v. Harris Trust and Savings Bank &#32; (1993), the U.S. Supreme Court held that certain assets in excess of amounts necessary to satisfy guaranteed obligations under a participating group annuity general account contract are &#8220;plan assets.&#8221; Therefore, these assets are subject to certain fiduciary obligations under ERISA, which requires fiduciaries to perform their duties solely in the interest of ERISA plan participants and beneficiaries. On January 5, 2000, the Secretary of Labor issued final regulations indicating, in cases where an insurer has issued a policy backed by the insurer&#8217;s general account to or for an employee benefit plan, the extent to which assets of the insurer constitute plan assets for purposes of ERISA and the Code. The regulations apply only with respect to a policy issued by an insurer on or before December 31, 1998 (&#8220;Transition Policy&#8221;). No person will generally be liable under ERISA or the Code for conduct occurring prior to July 5, 2001, where the basis of a claim is that insurance company general account assets constitute plan assets. An insurer issuing a new policy that is backed by its general account and is issued to or for an employee benefit plan after December 31, 1998 will generally be subject to fiduciary obligations under ERISA, unless the policy is a guaranteed benefit policy. 

The regulations indicate the requirements that must be met so that assets supporting a Transition Policy will not be considered plan assets for purposes of ERISA and the Code. These requirements include detailed disclosures to be made to the employee benefits plan and the requirement that the insurer must permit the policyholder to terminate the policy on 90 days&#8217; notice and receive without penalty, at the policyholder&#8217;s option, either (i) the unallocated accumulated fund balance (which may be subject to market value adjustment) or (ii) a book value payment of such amount in annual installments with interest. We have taken and continue to take steps designed to ensure compliance with these regulations. 

Consumer Protection Laws 

Numerous federal and state laws affect MetLife, Inc.&#8217;s earnings and activities, including federal and state consumer protection laws. As part of Dodd-Frank, Congress established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (&#8220;CFPB&#8221;) to supervise and regulate institutions that provide certain financial products and services to consumers. Although the consumer financial services subject to the CFPB&#8217;s jurisdiction generally exclude insurance business of the kind in which we engage, the CFPB does have authority to regulate non-insurance consumer services we provide. 

In August 2013, MetLife Bank, National Association (&#8220;MetLife Bank&#8221;) merged with and into MetLife Home Loans LLC (&#8220;MLHL&#8221;), its former subsidiary, with MLHL as the surviving, non-bank entity. The sole purpose of MLHL is to wind-down the limited remaining activities and fulfill remaining obligations and duties of MetLife Bank, some of which subject MLHL to certain federal consumer financial protection laws and certain state laws. 

Regulation of Over-the-Counter Derivatives 

Dodd-Frank includes a framework of regulation of the over-the-counter (&#8220;OTC&#8221;) derivatives markets which requires clearing of certain types of transactions currently traded OTC and imposes additional costs, including new reporting and margin requirements, and will likely impose additional regulation on the Company, including new capital requirements. Our costs of risk mitigation are increasing under Dodd-Frank. For example, Dodd-Frank imposes requirements, including the requirement to pledge initial margin (i) for &#8220;OTC-cleared&#8221; transactions (OTC derivatives that are cleared and settled through central clearing counterparties) entered into after June 10, 2013, and (ii) for &#8220;OTC-bilateral&#8221; transactions (OTC derivatives that are bilateral contracts between two counterparties) entered into after the phase-in period; these requirements will be applicable to us in 2020 because the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the &#8220;OCC&#8221;), the Federal Reserve Board, FDIC, Farm Credit Administration and Federal Housing Finance Agency (collectively, the &#8220;Prudential Regulators&#8221;) and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (&#8220;CFTC&#8221;) adopted final margin requirements for non-centrally cleared derivatives during the fourth quarter of 2015, which are broadly consistent with the requirements published by the Bank of International Settlements and International Organization of Securities. These increased margin requirements, combined with increased capital charges for our counterparties and central clearinghouses to hold non-cash collateral, will require increased holdings of cash and highly liquid securities with lower yields causing a reduction in income. Centralized clearing of certain OTC derivatives exposes us to the risk of a default by a clearing member or clearinghouse with respect to our cleared derivative transactions. We use derivatives to mitigate a wide range of risks in connection with our businesses, including the impact of increased benefit exposures from certain of our annuity products that offer guaranteed benefits. We have always been subject to the risk that hedging and other management procedures might prove ineffective in reducing the risks to which insurance policies expose us or that unanticipated policyholder behavior or mortality, combined with adverse market events, could produce economic losses beyond the scope of the risk management techniques employed. Any such losses could be increased by higher costs of writing derivatives (including customized derivatives) and the reduced availability of customized derivatives that might result from the implementation of Dodd-Frank and comparable international derivatives regulations. 

Dodd-Frank also expanded the definition of &#8220;swap&#8221; and mandated the SEC and CFTC (collectively, the &#8220;Commissions&#8221;) to study whether &#8220;stable value contracts&#8221; should be treated as swaps. Pursuant to the new definition and the Commissions&#8217; interpretive regulations, products offered by our insurance subsidiaries other than stable value contracts might also be treated as swaps, even though we believe otherwise. Should such products become regulated as swaps, we cannot predict how the rules would be applied to them or the effect on such products&#8217; profitability or attractiveness to our clients. 

Securities, Broker-Dealer and Investment Adviser Regulation 

Some of our subsidiaries and their activities in offering and selling variable insurance products are subject to extensive regulation under the federal securities laws administered by the SEC. These subsidiaries issue variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies through separate accounts that are registered with the SEC as investment companies under the Investment Company Act. Each registered separate account is generally divided into sub-accounts, each of which invests in an underlying mutual fund which is itself a registered investment company under the Investment Company Act. In addition, the variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies issued by these registered separate accounts are registered with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933. Other subsidiaries are registered with the SEC as broker-dealers under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (&#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;), and are members of, and subject to regulation by, FINRA. Further, some of our subsidiaries are registered as investment advisers with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, and are also registered as investment advisers in various states, as applicable. Certain variable contract separate accounts sponsored by our subsidiaries are exempt from registration, but may be subject to other provisions of the federal securities laws. 

Federal and state securities regulatory authorities and FINRA from time to time make inquiries and conduct examinations regarding compliance by MetLife, Inc. and its subsidiaries with securities and other laws and regulations. We cooperate with such inquiries and examinations and take corrective action when warranted. 

Federal and state securities laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investors in the securities markets and generally grant regulatory agencies broad rulemaking and enforcement powers, including the power to limit or restrict the conduct of business for failure to comply with such laws and regulations. We may also be subject to similar laws and regulations in the foreign countries in which we provide investment advisory services, offer products similar to those described above, or conduct other activities. 

Environmental Considerations 

As an owner and operator of real property, we are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Inherent in such ownership and operation is also the risk that there may be potential environmental liabilities and costs in connection with any required remediation of such properties. In addition, we hold equity interests in companies that could potentially be subject to environmental liabilities. We routinely have environmental assessments performed with respect to real estate being acquired for investment and real property to be acquired through foreclosure. We cannot provide assurance that unexpected environmental liabilities will not arise. However, based on information currently available to us, we believe that any costs associated with compliance with environmental laws and regulations or any remediation of such properties will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. 

Unclaimed Property 

We are subject to the laws and regulations of states and other jurisdictions concerning identification, reporting and escheatment of unclaimed or abandoned funds, and are subject to audit and examination for compliance with these requirements. See Note 21 &#32;of the Notes of the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

International Regulation 

Regulation of our insurance operations outside of the U.S. includes minimum capital, solvency and operational requirements. The authority of our international operations to conduct business is subject to licensing requirements, permits and approvals, and these authorizations are subject to modification and revocation. Periodic examinations of insurance company books and records, financial reporting requirements, market conduct examinations and policy filing requirements are among the techniques used by regulators to supervise our non-U.S. insurance businesses. We also have investment and pension companies in certain foreign jurisdictions that provide mutual fund, pension and other financial products and services. Those entities are subject to securities, investment, pension and other laws and regulations. In some jurisdictions, some of our insurance products are considered &#8220;securities&#8221; under local law and may be subject to local securities regulations and oversight by local securities regulators. 

Our international operations are exposed to increased political, legal, financial, operational and other risks. See &#8220;Risk Factors &#8212; Risks Related to Our Business &#8212; Our International Operations Face Political, Legal, Operational and Other Risks, Including Exposure to Local and Regional Economic Conditions, That Could Negatively Affect Those Operations or Our Profitability&#8221; and &#8220;Risk Factors &#8212; Regulatory and Legal Risks &#8212; Our Insurance and Brokerage Businesses Are Highly Regulated, and Changes in Regulation and in Supervisory and Enforcement Policies May Reduce Our Profitability and Limit Our Growth.&#8221; Changes in the laws and regulations that affect our customers and independent sales intermediaries or their operations also may affect our business relationships with them and their ability to purchase or distribute our products. Such actions may negatively affect our business in these jurisdictions. For example, a new tax on assets in Poland became effective on January 1, 2016. This legislation applies to insurers, banks and branches of foreign banks and insurers. We expect this legislation to have a negative impact on our business in Poland, but we do not expect it to have a material impact on our overall business. In addition, a tax reform bill was enacted in Chile on September 29, 2014 which includes, among other things, a gradual increase in the corporate tax rate from 20% to 27%, with a taxpayer election that limits the corporate tax rate to 25% but eliminates the taxable profits fund, an exemption on taxes on corporate income that is reinvested. See &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Results of Operations &#8212; Segment Results and Corporate &#38; Other &#8212; EMEA&#8221; for a discussion of a write-down of deferred policy acquisition costs (&#8220;DAC&#8221;) and value of business acquired (&#8220;VOBA&#8221;) associated with our EMEA business and &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Results of Operations &#8212; Segment Results and Corporate &#38; Other &#8212; Latin America&#8221; for information regarding the impact on our Latin America business of this tax legislation in Chile. Also pending in Chile are changes to its pension system: a bill to create a state-owned pension company was introduced and a Presidential Advisory Committee was created to draft a reform proposal of the pension system. The committee issued a series of recommendations in September 2015, but the reform proposal has not been finalized and may still change further if a bill results from their recommendations. It is premature to predict the impact of such reforms on our pension business in Chile. 

Part of our international insurance operations may be subject to assessments, generally based on their proportionate share of business written in the relevant jurisdiction, for certain obligations to policyholders and claimants resulting from the insolvency of insurance companies. See &#8220;&#8212;Japan.&#8221; Annually, many of our international insurance operations are required to conduct an analysis of the sufficiency of all statutory reserves. In most of those cases, a locally qualified actuary must submit an analysis of the likelihood that the reserves make good and sufficient provision for the associated contractual obligations and related expenses of the insurer. Local regulatory and actuarial standards for this vary widely; the required implied certainty of the signing actuary&#8217;s opinion varies equally widely. 

We expect the scope and extent of regulation outside of the U.S., as well as regulatory oversight, generally, to continue to increase. The regulatory environment in the countries in which we operate and changes in laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 

Solvency Regimes 

Solvency II 

Our insurance business throughout the European Economic Area (&#8220;EEA&#8221;) is subject to Solvency II, which consists of two inter-linked directives: Solvency II and Omnibus II. Solvency II was adopted by European authorities in 2009. It codifies and harmonizes regulation for insurance undertakings established in the European Union (&#8220;EU&#8221;). It provides a framework for new risk management practices, solvency capital standards and disclosure requirements. Omnibus II, amending Solvency II, was adopted in April 2014. It contains provisions that adapt Solvency II to the new supervisory architecture establishing the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (&#8220;EIOPA&#8221;) and includes a package of measures to facilitate the provision of insurance products with long-term guarantees. Both directives became effective on January 1, 2016. 

Leading up to Solvency II&#8217;s effective date, EIOPA published Interim Guidelines aimed at increasing preparedness of both supervisors and insurers. The Interim Guidelines were applicable since January 1, 2014 and included certain reporting and organizational requirements with which we have complied in accordance with the requirements of our local regulators. Leading up to the effective date of both directives in 2016, the European authorities continued to establish supporting rules and guidance that implemented the legislation. Our operations within the EEA are prepared to comply with such requirements. 

Other Solvency Regimes 

Our insurance business in Mexico will be impacted by Mexico&#8217;s insurance law reform, adopted in February 2013. The reform, which became fully effective on January 1, 2016, envisions a Solvency II-type regulatory framework, instituting changes to reserve and capital requirements and corporate governance and fostering greater transparency. 

In Chile, the law implementing Solvency II-like regulation is currently in the studies stage. However, the Chilean insurance regulator has already issued two resolutions, one for governance, and the other for risk management and control framework requirements. MetLife Chile has already implemented governance changes and risk policies to comply with these resolutions. In January 2015, the regulator requested an impact study considering the third draft of the regulation for RBC requirements which was submitted in May 2015. In November 2015, the local regulator issued a draft regulation which requires Insurance undertakings to implement a risk appetite framework and produce an &#8220;Own Risk and Solvency Assessment.&#8221; A fourth impact study will be performed during 2016. The new solvency and supervisory regime is expected to be in force in 2017. 

In China, the business of our joint venture (as well as the industry) will be impacted by China Risk Oriented Solvency System (&#8220;C-ROSS&#8221;), a new risk-based solvency regime. Like Solvency II, C-ROSS focuses on risk management and has three pillars (strengthen quantitative capital requirements, enhance qualitative supervision and establish a governance and market discipline process). China Insurance Regulatory Commission announced on January 26, 2016 that C-ROSS became effective as of January 1, 2016. Beginning in the first quarter of 2016, after one year&#8217;s parallel run of both old solvency and C-ROSS calculations, C-ROSS solvency will become the mandated reporting for the industry. 

Global Systemically Important Insurers 

The IAIS, an association of insurance supervisors and regulators and a member of the Financial Stability Board (&#8220;FSB&#8221;), and an international entity established to coordinate, develop and promote regulatory, supervisory and other financial sector policies in the interest of financial stability, is participating in the FSB&#8217;s initiative to identify and manage global systemically important financial institutions. The IAIS has published a methodology to assess the systemic relevance of global insurers and a framework of policy measures to be applied to G-SIIs and, on this basis, the FSB again so designated MetLife, Inc. The FSB will continue to update the list annually. The IAIS plans to evaluate and, if necessary, update the assessment methodology every three years. 

Current standards call for G-SIIs to be subject to higher loss absorbency requirements (&#8220;HLA&#8221;). Given the absence of a common global base on which to calculate HLA for insurers, the FSB directed the IAIS to develop basic capital requirements (&#8220;BCR&#8221;). The first version of the IAIS HLA framework was endorsed by the FSB and the G20 in September and November 2015, respectively. This first version applies specified factors to exposures of BCR components with an emphasis on non-traditional and non-insurance activities. G-SIIs will begin reporting BCR and HLA results to their group-wide supervisors as of June 2016 on a confidential basis to allow for refinement of the BCR and HLA until fully adopted and implemented in 2019. The FSB endorsed the first version of HLA, noting that further revision will be necessary before implementation to reflect ongoing work on the G-SII assessment methodology and the definition of non-traditional and non-insurance activity. In November 2015, the IAIS published consultations for stakeholder comment on both topics. MetLife submitted comments in January 2016. The IAIS plans to incorporate any changes to the assessment methodology in the 2016 G-SII assessment update. 

In addition, on December 17, 2014, the IAIS released a first exposure draft of a risk-based global insurance capital standard (&#8220;ICS&#8221;) which will apply to all internationally active insurance groups, including G-SIIs. A second exposure draft is scheduled to be published for comment in June 2016. The IAIS expects to publish an interim version of the ICS by the end of 2019 for implementation by individual jurisdictions with the further goal of reaching an ultimate ICS at some later date. 

The FSB and IAIS propose that national authorities consider additional requirements for G-SIIs, which include preparation of a systemic risk management plan, preparation of a recovery and resolution plan, enhanced liquidity planning and management, more intensive supervision, closer coordination among regulators through global supervisory colleges led by a regulator with group-wide supervisory authority, and a policy bias in favor of separation of non-traditional insurance and non-insurance activities from traditional insurance activities. The IAIS proposals would need to be implemented by legislation or regulation in each applicable jurisdiction, and the impact on MetLife, Inc. of such proposals is uncertain. 

Japan 

Our operations in Japan are subject to regulation and examination by Japan&#8217;s Financial Services Agency (&#8220;FSA&#8221;). Our operations in Japan are required to file with the FSA annual reports for each fiscal year (ending March 31) which include financial statements. These annual reports are not prepared on a U.S. GAAP basis. Similar to the U.S., Japanese law provides that insurers in Japan must maintain specified solvency standards for the protection of policyholders and to support the financial strength of licensed insurers. As of December 31, 2015, the date of our most recent regulatory filing in Japan, the solvency margin ratio of our Japan operations was in excess of four times the 200% solvency margin ratio that would require corrective action. Most Japanese life insurers maintain a solvency margin ratio well in excess of the legally mandated minimum. 

A portion of the annual earnings of our Japan operations may be repatriated each year, and may further be distributed to MetLife, Inc. as a dividend. We may determine not to repatriate profits from the Japan operations or to repatriate a reduced amount in order to maintain or improve the solvency margin of the Japan operations or for other reasons. In addition, the FSA may limit or not permit profit repatriations or other transfers of funds to the U.S. if such transfers would be detrimental to the solvency or financial strength of our Japan operations or for other reasons. 

Our operations in Japan are subject to assessments to cover obligations to policyholders in the event of insolvency of other insurance companies. Under the Japanese Insurance Business Law, all licensed life insurers in Japan are assessed on an annual basis by the Life Insurance Policyholders Protection Corporation of Japan. These assessments are aggregated across all licensed life insurers in Japan and, in the event of a life insurance company insolvency, are used to satisfy certain obligations to policyholders and claimants of such insolvent company. 

Company Ratings 

Insurer financial strength ratings represent the opinions of rating agencies, including A.M. Best Company (&#8220;A.M. Best&#8221;), Fitch Ratings (&#8220;Fitch&#8221;), Moody&#8217;s Investors Service (&#8220;Moody&#8217;s&#8221;) and Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s Ratings Services (&#8220;S&#38;P&#8221;), regarding the ability of an insurance company to meet its financial obligations to policyholders and contractholders. 

Rating Stability Indicators 

Rating agencies use an &#8220;outlook statement&#8221; of &#8220;positive,&#8221; &#8220;stable,&#8221; &#8216;&#8216;negative&#8217;&#8217; or &#8220;developing&#8221; to indicate a medium- or long-term trend in credit fundamentals which, if continued, may lead to a rating change. A rating may have a &#8220;stable&#8221; outlook to indicate that the rating is not expected to change; however, a &#8220;stable&#8221; rating does not preclude a rating agency from changing a rating at any time, without notice. Certain rating agencies assign rating modifiers such as &#8220;CreditWatch&#8221; or &#8220;under review&#8221; to indicate their opinion regarding the potential direction of a rating. These ratings modifiers are generally assigned in connection with certain events such as potential mergers, acquisitions, dispositions or material changes in a company&#8217;s results, in order for the rating agency to perform its analysis to fully determine the rating implications of the event. 

Insurer Financial Strength Ratings 

The following insurer financial strength ratings represent each rating agency&#8217;s opinion of MetLife, Inc.&#8217;s principal insurance subsidiaries&#8217; ability to pay obligations under insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their terms and are not evaluations directed toward the protection of investors in MetLife, Inc.&#8217;s securities. Insurer financial strength ratings are not statements of fact nor are they recommendations to purchase, hold or sell any security, contract or policy. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. 

Our insurer financial strength ratings at the date of this filing are indicated in the following table. See &#8220; &#8212; &#32;Rating Agency Actions&#8221; below for information relating to the impact on our insurer financial strength ratings of the announcement of the proposed Separation. Additional information about financial strength ratings can be found on the respective websites of the rating agencies.

See &#8220;Risk Factors &#8212; Risks Related to Our Business &#8212; A Downgrade or a Potential Downgrade in Our Financial Strength or Credit Ratings Could Result in a Loss of Business and Materially Adversely Affect Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#8221; See also &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Liquidity and Capital Resources &#8212; The Company &#8212; Capital &#8212; Rating Agencies&#8221; for an in depth description of the impact of a ratings downgrade. 

Rating Agency Actions 

In response to the announcement by MetLife, Inc. on January 12, 2016 of its plan to pursue the Separation, the rating agencies in the table above took the following actions: 

&#8226; 

On January 14, 2016, A.M. Best placed the insurance financial strength ratings of MetLife, Inc.&#8217;s rated primary life/health insurance subsidiaries under review with developing implications. 

&#8226; 

On January 13, 2016, Fitch placed the insurance financial strength rating for GALIC and MetLife USA on &#8220;Rating Watch Negative.&#8221; The other ratings remain on stable outlook. 

&#8226; 

On January 13, 2016, Moody&#8217;s placed the insurance financial strength ratings of all of MetLife, Inc.&#8217;s rated operating subsidiaries on review for downgrade except American Life which remains on stable outlook . 

&#8226; 

On January 13, 2016, S&#38;P downgraded the insurance financial strength rating for GALIC and MetLife USA and revised their outlook from &#8220;stable&#8221; to &#8220;negative.&#8221; The other ratings remain on stable outlook. 

See Note 23 &#32;of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the proposed Separation. 

Competition 

We believe that competition faced by our segments is based on a number of factors, including service, product features, scale, price, financial strength, claims-paying ratings, credit ratings, e-business capabilities and name recognition. We compete globally with a large number of other insurance companies, as well as non-insurance financial services companies, such as banks, broker-dealers and asset managers, for individual consumers, employer and other group customers, as well as agents and other distributors of insurance and investment products. Some of these companies offer a broader array of products, have more competitive pricing or, with respect to other insurance companies, have higher claims paying ability ratings. In the U.S. and Japan, we compete with a large number of domestic and foreign-owned life insurance companies, many of which offer products in categories on which we focus. Elsewhere, we compete with the foreign insurance operations of large U.S. insurers and with global insurance groups and local companies in particular areas in which they are active. Many of our group insurance products are underwritten annually and, accordingly, there is a risk that group purchasers may be able to obtain more favorable terms from competitors rather than renewing coverage with us. 

We believe that the continued volatility of the financial markets, its impact on the capital position of many competitors, and subsequent actions by regulators and rating agencies have altered the competitive environment. In particular, we believe that these factors have highlighted financial strength as the most significant differentiator from the perspective of some customers and certain distributors. We believe the Company is well positioned to compete in this environment. In particular, the Company distributes many of its individual products through other financial institutions such as banks and broker-dealers. These distribution partners are currently placing greater emphasis on the financial strength of the company whose products they sell. In addition, the financial market turbulence has highlighted the extent of the risk associated with certain variable annuity products and has led us, along with many companies in our industry, to re-examine the pricing and features of the products offered. The effects of current market conditions may also lead to consolidation in the life insurance industry. Although we cannot predict the ultimate impact of these conditions, we believe that the strongest companies will enjoy a competitive advantage as a result of the current circumstances. 

Competition for employees in our industry is intense, and we need to be able to attract and retain the highly skilled people with knowledge of our business and industry experience to support our business. We must attract and retain productive sales representatives to sell our insurance, annuities and investment products. Insurance companies compete for sales representatives with demonstrated ability. We compete with other insurance companies for sales representatives primarily on the basis of our financial position, support services and compensation and product features. See &#8220;&#8212; Segments and Corporate &#38; Other&#8221; for information on sales distribution. In selected global markets, we continue to undertake several initiatives to grow our career agency forces, while continuing to enhance the efficiency and production of our sales representatives. These initiatives may not succeed in attracting and retaining productive agents. Sales of individual insurance, annuities and investment products and our results of operations and financial position could be materially adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in attracting and retaining productive agents. 

Numerous aspects of our business are subject to regulation. Legislative and other changes affecting the regulatory environment can affect our competitive position within the life insurance industry and within the broader financial services industry. See &#8220;&#8212; Regulation.&#8221; 

Employees 

At December 31, 2015 , we had approximately 69,000 employees. We believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory.
