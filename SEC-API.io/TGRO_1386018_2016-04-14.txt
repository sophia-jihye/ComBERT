Business of Issuer 

On May 26, 2010, Fortunato Villamagna and David Taylor resigned from the Board of Directors and Ken Liebscher was appointed President/CEO and Howard Bouch was appointed Secretary and CFO. 

On October 27, 2010 we entered into a co-development agreement with Black Hawk Exploration, (BHWX), in which we, after an investment of $400,000 by the Company in a new well in Black Hawk&#8217;s Cowley County lease, we will earn a 40% working interest in the # 1 Baker well, BHWX will receive a 50% interest in the new well and TGRO will have the right to participate in the nine-well rework program at the Cowley Prospect. BHWX will receive a 20% interest in any other new well TGRO drills on Black Hawk&#8217;s current or future Cowley County, Kansas leases and Black Hawk has the option to invest in each additional new well drilled by TGRO on a prorated basis up to an additional 30%. 

&#160; 

On November 29 the Company expanded its original agreement and entered into a co-development agreement with Black Hawk Exploration covering approximately 2,553 acres of oil and gas leases in Cowley County, Kansas. BHWX owns 100% of the leases within the Prospect Area and has an undivided 81.5% working interest in and to the oil and gas leases and their previous 10 shut-in oil and gas wells. 

&#160; 

The joint agreement includes in one shut-in oil/gas well, the #1 Baker, located on the Keith Baker lease. Also subject to joint development is a 100% interest in 9 other oil wells previously shut-in. The Company&#8217;s program calls for re-working all 10 locations directly or in joint venture with Black Hawk and returning all of them to cash flow production. 

&#160; 

On February. 4, 2011, we retained International IR Inc. (IRR) to provide media services. IIR is a strategic consulting firm that works primarily with emerging growth companies in the resource sector. IIR will focus on providing multiple information platforms to TGRO&#8217;s shareholders and advise as well as negotiate on behalf of the Company, acquisition, exploration and joint venture agreements and strategies. 

&#160; 

On February 9, 2011, - we acquired a 100% interest in three Oil and Gas leases totaling 400 acres in Southern Kansas, comprised of three historically productive properties. Our Geologist has reviewed the Holman #2, #3, #4, and #5; the Adams #1 and the Glasse wells commonly known as the Wise #1 and Roberts #1 and have recommended a seven-well exploration and production study. All the leases acquired by the parties covering lands within the prospect area are owned 100% by TGRO with an undivided eighty-one and one-half percent (81.5%) working interest in the oil and gas leases described. The Company issued a Note and 250,000 shares of its common stock in the acquisition. We will require an investment of $400,000 to initiate putting these wells back into production. Management believes this can be accomplished and is considering various options to acquire this funding, but has not yet entered into an agreement to do so. 

&#160; 

On May 4, 2014 we acquired 30% WI in the DeFore and Stalnaker leases in Cowley County from a Company affiliated with the President of our Company. For $10,000. The Company paid $400,000 for their share of drilling two wells on the leases. The DeFore 16-1 well went on line in January 2015. The Stalnaker 17-1 is being evaluated for fracking and expected to start producing oil in the second quarter of 2015. 

The Company will continue to evaluate shut in wells in the states of Kansas and Oklahoma with intention of putting historically productive wells back into production at the least cost. We will then need to enter into private placement agreements to fund the programs.
