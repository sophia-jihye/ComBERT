 ITEM 1. BUSINESS GENERAL 

Wesbanco, Inc. (&#147;WesBanco&#148;), a bank holding company incorporated in 1968 and headquartered in Wheeling, West Virginia, offers a full range of financial services including retail banking, corporate banking, personal and corporate trust services, brokerage services, mortgage banking and insurance. WesBanco offers these services through two reportable segments, community banking and trust and investment services. For additional information regarding WesBanco&#146;s business segments please refer to Note 22, &#147;Business Segments&#148; in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

At December 31, 2015, WesBanco operated one commercial bank, Wesbanco Bank, Inc. (&#147;WesBanco Bank&#148; or the &#147;Bank&#148;), through 141 offices, one loan production office and 129 ATM machines located in West Virginia, Ohio, and western Pennsylvania. Total assets of WesBanco Bank as of December 31, 2015 approximated $8.5 billion. WesBanco Bank also offers trust and investment services and various alternative investment products including mutual funds and annuities. The market value of assets under management of the trust and investment services segment was approximately $3.6 billion as of December 31, 2015. These assets are held by WesBanco Bank in fiduciary or agency capacities for its customers and therefore are not included as assets on WesBanco&#146;s Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

On February 10, 2015, WesBanco completed the acquisition of ESB Financial Corporation (&#147;ESB&#148;), a Pennsylvania thrift holding company based in Ellwood City, Pennsylvania with $1.9 billion in assets and 23 branches. The transaction has expanded WesBanco&#146;s franchise in the Pittsburgh and western Pennsylvania region. 

WesBanco offers additional services through its non-banking subsidiaries, WesBanco Insurance Services, Inc. (&#147;WesBanco Insurance&#148;), a multi-line insurance agency specializing in property, casualty, life and title insurance, with benefit plan sales and administration for personal and commercial clients; and WesBanco Securities, Inc. (&#147;WesBanco Securities&#148;), a full service broker-dealer, which also offers discount brokerage services. 

WesBanco Asset Management, Inc., which was incorporated in 2002, holds certain investment securities and loans in a Delaware-based subsidiary. 

WesBanco Properties, Inc. holds certain commercial real estate properties. The commercial property is leased to WesBanco Bank and to certain non-related third parties. 

WesBanco has eight capital trusts which are all wholly-owned trust subsidiaries formed for the purpose of issuing trust preferred securities (&#147;Trust Preferred Securities&#148;) and lending the proceeds to WesBanco. For more information regarding WesBanco&#146;s issuance of trust preferred securities please refer to Note 11, &#147;Junior Subordinated Debt Owed to Unconsolidated Subsidiary Trusts&#148; in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

In connection with WesBanco&#146;s acquisition of ESB on February 10, 2015, WesBanco acquired ESB&#146;s wholly owned subsidiary AMSCO, Inc., (&#147;AMSCO&#148;). AMSCO engages in the management of certain real estate development and construction of 1-4 family residential units through seven joint venture partnerships. For more information please refer to Note 8, &#147;Investments in Limited Partnerships&#148; in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

WesBanco Bank&#146;s Investment Department also serves as investment adviser to a family of mutual funds, namely the &#147;WesMark Funds&#148;. The fund family is comprised of the WesMark Growth Fund, the WesMark Balanced Fund, the WesMark Small Company Growth Fund, the WesMark Government Bond Fund, and the WesMark West Virginia Municipal Bond Fund. 

As of December 31, 2015, none of WesBanco&#146;s subsidiaries were engaged in any operations in foreign countries, and none had transactions with customers in foreign countries. 

&#160; 

EMPLOYEES 

There were 1,633 full-time equivalent employees employed by WesBanco and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2015. None of the employees were represented by collective bargaining agreements. WesBanco believes its employee relations to be satisfactory. 

WEB SITE ACCESS TO WESBANCO&#146;S FILINGS WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION 

All of WesBanco&#146;s electronic filings for 2015 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#147;SEC&#148;), including this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, are made available at no cost on WesBanco&#146;s website, www.wesbanco.com, in the &#147;About Us&#148; section through the &#147;Investor Relations&#148; link as soon as reasonably practicable after WesBanco files such material with, or furnishes it to, the SEC. WesBanco&#146;s SEC filings are also available through the SEC&#146;s website at www.sec.gov.

COMPETITION 

Competition in the form of price and service from other banks, including local, regional and national banks and financial companies such as savings and loans, internet banks, payday lenders, money services businesses, credit unions, finance companies, brokerage firms and other non-banking companies providing various regulated and non-regulated financial services and products, is intense in most of the markets served by WesBanco and its subsidiaries. WesBanco&#146;s trust and investment services segment receives competition from commercial banks, trust companies, mutual fund companies, investment advisory firms, law firms, brokerage firms and other financial services companies. As a result of consolidation within the financial services industry, mergers between, and the expansion of, financial institutions both within and outside of WesBanco&#146;s major markets have provided significant competitive pressure in those markets. Many of WesBanco&#146;s competitors have greater resources and, as such, may have higher lending limits and may offer other products and services that are not provided by WesBanco. WesBanco generally competes on the basis of superior customer service and responsiveness to customer needs, available loan and deposit products, rates of interest charged on loans, rates of interest paid for deposits, and the availability and pricing of trust, brokerage and insurance services. As a result of WesBanco&#146;s expansion into certain larger Ohio and Pennsylvania metropolitan markets, it has faced entrenched larger bank competitors with an already existing customer base that may far exceed WesBanco&#146;s initial entry position into those markets. As a result, WesBanco may be forced to compete more aggressively for loans, deposits, trust and insurance products in order to grow its market share, potentially reducing its current and future profit potential from such markets. 

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION 

As a bank holding company and a financial holding company under federal law, WesBanco is subject to supervision and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (&#147;Federal Reserve Board&#148;) under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the &#147;BHCA&#148;), and is required to file with the Federal Reserve Board reports and other information regarding its business operations and the business operations of its subsidiaries. WesBanco also is required to obtain Federal Reserve Board approval prior to acquiring, directly or indirectly, ownership or control of certain voting shares of other banks, as described below. Since WesBanco is both a bank holding company and a financial holding company, WesBanco can offer customers virtually any type of service that is financial in nature or incidental thereto, including banking and activities closely related to banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both underwriting and agency) and merchant banking. 

&#160; 

As indicated above, WesBanco presently operates one bank subsidiary, WesBanco Bank. The Bank is a West Virginia banking corporation and is not a member bank of the Federal Reserve System. It is subject to examination and supervision by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the &#147;FDIC&#148;) and the West Virginia Division of Financial Institutions. The deposits of WesBanco Bank are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC. WesBanco&#146;s non-bank subsidiaries are subject to examination and supervision by the Federal Reserve Board and examination by other federal and state agencies, including, in the case of certain securities activities, regulation by the SEC, the Financial Institution Regulatory Authority (&#147;FINRA&#148;), the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board and the Securities Investors Protection Corporation. WesBanco Bank maintains one designated financial subsidiary, WesBanco Insurance, which, as indicated above, is a multi-line insurance agency specializing in property, casualty, life and title insurance, with benefit plan sales and administration for personal and commercial clients. 

WesBanco is also under the jurisdiction of the SEC and certain state securities commissions for matters relating to the offering and sale of its securities. WesBanco is subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as administered by the SEC. WesBanco is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (the &#147;NASDAQ&#148;) under the trading symbol &#147;WSBC&#148; and is subject to the rules of the NASDAQ for listed companies. 

Under the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, as amended (the &#147;Riegle-Neal Act&#148;), a bank holding company may acquire banks in states other than its home state, subject to certain limitations. The Riegle-Neal Act also authorizes banks to merge across state lines, thereby creating interstate banking. Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#147;Dodd-Frank Act&#148;), banks are also permitted to establish de novo branches across state lines to the same extent that a state-chartered bank in each host state would be permitted to open branches. 

Under the BHCA, prior Federal Reserve Board approval is required for WesBanco to acquire more than 5% of the voting stock of any bank. In determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition, federal banking regulators will consider, among other factors, the effect of the acquisition on competition, the public benefits expected to be received from the acquisition, the projected capital ratios and levels on a post-acquisition basis, and the acquiring institution&#146;s record of addressing the credit needs of the communities it serves, including the needs of low and moderate income neighborhoods, consistent with safe and sound operation of the bank, under the Community Reinvestment Act, as amended (the &#147;CRA&#148;). 

HOLDING COMPANY REGULATIONS 

As indicated above, WesBanco has one state bank subsidiary, WesBanco Bank, as well as non-bank subsidiaries, which are described further in &#147;Item 1. Business&#151;General&#148; section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The subsidiary bank is subject to affiliate transaction restrictions under federal law, which limit &#147;covered transactions&#148; by the subsidiary bank with the parent and any non-bank subsidiaries of the parent, which are referred to in the aggregate in this paragraph as &#147;affiliates&#148; of the subsidiary bank. &#147;Covered transactions&#148; include loans or extensions of credit to an affiliate (including repurchase agreements), purchases of or investments in securities issued by an affiliate, purchases of assets from an affiliate, the acceptance of securities issued by an affiliate as collateral for a loan or extension of credit, the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate, certain transactions that involve borrowing or lending securities, and certain derivative transactions with an affiliate. Such covered transactions between the subsidiary bank and any single affiliate are limited in amount to 10% of the subsidiary bank&#146;s capital and surplus, and, with respect to covered transactions with all affiliates in the aggregate, are limited in amount to 20% of the subsidiary bank&#146;s capital and surplus. Furthermore, such loans or extensions of credit, guarantees, acceptances and letters of credit, and any credit exposure resulting from securities borrowing or lending transactions or derivatives transactions, are required to be secured by collateral at all times in amounts specified by law. In addition, all covered transactions must be conducted on terms and conditions that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices. 

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Act requires a bank holding company to act as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary bank. Under this source of strength requirement, the Federal Reserve Board may require a bank holding company to make capital infusions into a troubled subsidiary bank, and may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices for failure to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank. A capital infusion conceivably could be required at a time when WesBanco may not have the resources to provide it. 

PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS 

Dividends from the subsidiary bank are a significant source of funds for payment of dividends to WesBanco&#146;s shareholders. For the year ended December 31, 2015, WesBanco declared cash dividends to its common shareholders of approximately $35.4 million. 

As of December 31, 2015, WesBanco Bank was &#147;well capitalized&#148; under the definition in Section 325.103 of the FDIC Regulations. Therefore, as long as the Bank remains &#147;well capitalized&#148; or even becomes &#147;adequately capitalized,&#148; there would be no basis under Section 325.105 to limit the ability of the Bank to pay dividends because it had not become undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized. Beginning January 1, 2016, WesBanco Bank and WesBanco will be subject to &#147;capital buffer&#148; rules, which will require WesBanco and WesBanco Bank to have capital levels above the regulatory minimums in order to pay dividends (discussed below in connection with the Basel III initiative under &#147;Item 1. Business&#151;Capital Requirements&#148;). 

All financial institutions are subject to the prompt corrective action provisions set forth in Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the &#147;FDI Act&#148;) and the provisions set forth in Section 325.105 of the FDIC Regulations. Immediately upon a state non-member bank receiving notice, or being deemed to have notice, that the bank is undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized, as defined in Section 325.103 of the FDIC Regulations, the bank is precluded from being able to pay dividends to its shareholders based upon the requirements in Section 38(d) of the FDI Act, 12. U.S.C. &#167; 1831o(d). 

In addition, with respect to possible dividends by the Bank, under Section 31A-4-25 of the West Virginia Code, the prior approval of the West Virginia Commissioner of Banking would be required if the total of all dividends declared by the Bank in any calendar year would exceed the total of the Bank&#146;s net profits for that year combined with its retained net profits of the preceding two years. Further, Section 31A-4-25 limits the ability of a West Virginia banking institution to pay dividends until the surplus fund of the banking institution equals the common stock of the banking institution and if certain specified amounts of recent profits of the banking institution have not been carried to the surplus fund. 

If, in the opinion of the applicable regulatory authority, a bank under its jurisdiction is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice which, depending on the financial condition of the bank, could include the payment of dividends, such authority may require, after notice and hearing, that such bank cease and desist from such practice. The Federal Reserve Board has issued policy statements which provide that insured banks and bank holding companies should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings. Under applicable law, bank regulatory agency approval is required if the total of all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar year exceeds the available retained earnings or exceeds the aggregate of the bank&#146;s net profits (as defined by regulatory agencies) for that year and its retained net profits for the preceding two years. As of December 31, 2015, under FDIC regulations, WesBanco could receive, without prior regulatory approval, a dividend of up to $51.3 million from WesBanco Bank. Additional information regarding dividend restrictions is set forth in Note 20, &#147;Regulatory Matters,&#148; in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

On February 24, 2009, the Federal Reserve Division of Banking Supervision and Regulation issued a letter providing direction to bank holding companies on the payment of dividends, capital repurchases and capital redemptions. Although the letter largely reiterates longstanding Federal Reserve supervisory policies, it emphasizes the need for a bank holding company to review various factors when considering the declaration of a dividend or taking action that would reduce regulatory capital provided by outstanding financial instruments. These factors include the potential need to increase loan loss reserves, write down assets and reflect declines in asset values in 

&#160; 

equity. In addition, the bank holding company should consider its past and anticipated future earnings, the dividend payout ratio in relation to earnings, and adequacy of regulatory capital before any action is taken. The consideration of capital adequacy should include a review of all known factors that may affect capital in the future. 

In certain circumstances, defined by regulation relating to levels of earnings and capital, advance notification to, and in some circumstances, approval by the regulator could be required to declare a dividend or repurchase or redeem capital instruments. 

FDIC INSURANCE 

FDIC insurance premiums are assessed by the FDIC using a risk-based approach that places insured institutions into categories based on capital and risk profiles. In 2015, WesBanco Bank paid deposit insurance premiums of $4.1 million, compared to $3.0 million and $3.4 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. The increase from prior years was due to a larger assessment base from the ESB acquisition. WesBanco Bank&#146;s capital, net income and loan quality financial ratios used to calculate the assessment rate have continually improved, leading to a decrease in the assessment rate. 

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS 

The Federal Reserve Board has issued risk-based capital ratio and leverage ratio guidelines for bank holding companies. The risk-based capital ratio guidelines establish a systematic analytical framework that makes regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banking organizations, takes off-balance sheet exposures into explicit account in assessing capital adequacy, and minimizes disincentives to holding liquid, low-risk assets. Under the guidelines and related policies, bank holding companies must maintain capital sufficient to meet both a risk-based asset ratio test and a leverage ratio test on a consolidated basis. The risk-based ratio is determined by allocating assets and specified off-balance sheet commitments into four weighted categories, with higher weightings being assigned to categories perceived as representing greater risk. A bank holding company&#146;s capital is then divided by total risk-weighted assets to yield the risk-based ratio. The leverage ratio is determined by relating core capital to total assets adjusted as specified in the guidelines. The Bank is subject to substantially similar capital requirements. 

The federal regulatory authorities&#146; risk-based capital guidelines are based upon agreements reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the &#147;Basel Committee&#148;). The Basel Committee is a committee of central banks and bank supervisors and regulators from the major industrialized countries that develops broad policy guidelines for use by each country&#146;s supervisors in determining the supervisory policies they apply. In December 2010, the Basel Committee issued a strengthened set of international capital and liquidity standards for banks and bank holding companies, known as &#147;Basel III.&#148; In July 2013, the U.S. federal banking agencies issued a joint final rule that implements the Basel III capital standards and establishes the minimum capital levels required under the Dodd-Frank Act. The rule was effective January 1, 2015 subject to a transition period providing for full implementation on January 1, 2019. 

Generally, under the applicable guidelines, a financial institution&#146;s capital is divided into common equity Tier 1 (&#147;CET1&#148;), total Tier 1 and Tier 2. CET1 includes common shares and retained earnings less goodwill, intangible assets subject to limitation and certain deferred tax assets subject to limitation. In addition under the final capital rule, an institution may make a one-time, permanent election to continue to exclude accumulated other comprehensive income from capital. If an institution does not make this election, unrealized gains and losses will be included in the calculation of its CET1. Total Tier 1 is comprised of CET1 and certain restricted capital instruments, including qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock and qualifying trust preferred securities, in their Tier 1 capital, up to a limit of 25% of Tier 1 capital. (See below within this section for more information regarding the capital treatment of trust preferred securities.) 

Tier 2, or supplementary capital, includes, among other things, portions of trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock not otherwise counted in Tier 1 capital, as well as perpetual preferred stock, 

&#160; 

intermediate-term preferred stock, hybrid capital instruments, perpetual debt, mandatory convertible debt securities, term subordinated debt, unrealized holding gains on equity securities, and the allowance for loan and lease losses, all subject to certain limitations. &#147;Total capital&#148; is the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. The amount of Tier 2 capital that exceeds the amount of Tier 1 capital must be excluded from the total capital calculation. 

The Federal Reserve Board has established the following minimum capital levels banks and bank holding companies are required to maintain: (i) CET1 of at least 4.5%, (ii) Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6%, (iii) total capital ratio (Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital) of at least 8%; and (iv) a non-risk-based leverage ratio (Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets) of 4%. Additionally, when the final capital rule is fully implemented, it will require an institution to maintain a 2.5% common equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer over the minimum risk-based capital requirements to avoid restrictions on the ability to pay dividends, discretionary bonuses to executive officers, and engage in share repurchases. 

Failure to meet applicable capital guidelines could subject a financial institution to a variety of enforcement remedies available to the federal regulatory authorities, including limitations on the ability to pay dividends, the issuance by the regulatory authority of a capital directive to increase capital, and the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, as well as to the measures described below under &#147;Prompt Corrective Action&#148; as applicable to undercapitalized institutions. 

As of December 31, 2015, WesBanco&#146;s CET1, Tier 1 and total capital to risk-adjusted assets ratios were 11.66%, 13.35% and 14.11%, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, WesBanco Bank also had capital in excess of the minimum requirements. Neither WesBanco nor the Bank had been advised by the appropriate federal banking regulator of any specific leverage ratio applicable to it. As of December 31, 2015, WesBanco&#146;s leverage ratio was 9.38%. 

As of December 31, 2015, WesBanco had $106.2 million in junior subordinated debt on its Consolidated Balance Sheets presented as a separate category of long-term debt. For regulatory purposes, Trust Preferred Securities totaling $103.0 million underlying such junior subordinated debt were included in Tier 1 capital as of December 31, 2015, in accordance with regulatory reporting requirements. In 2013, the federal banking agencies amended capital requirements to generally exclude trust preferred securities from Tier 1 capital. A grandfather provision, however, permits bank holding companies with consolidated assets of less than $15 billion, such as WesBanco, to continue counting existing trust preferred securities as Tier 1 capital until they mature. The final Basel III capital rule permanently grandfathers trust preferred securities issued before May 19, 2010 for institutions of less than $15 billion in size, subject to a 25% limit of Tier 1 capital. The amount of trust preferred securities and certain other elements in excess of the limit could be included in Tier 2 capital, subject to restrictions. For more information regarding trust preferred securities, please refer to Note 11, &#147;Junior Subordinated Debt Owed to Unconsolidated Subsidiary Trusts&#148; in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The risk-based capital standards of the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC specify that evaluations by the banking agencies of a bank&#146;s capital adequacy will include an assessment of the exposure to declines in the economic value of the bank&#146;s capital due to changes in interest rates. These banking agencies issued a joint policy statement on interest rate risk describing prudent methods for monitoring such risk that rely principally on internal measures of exposure and active oversight of risk management activities by senior management. 

PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION 

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (&#147;FDICIA&#148;) requires federal banking regulatory authorities to take &#147;prompt corrective action&#148; with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For these purposes, FDICIA establishes five capital tiers: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized. 

An institution is deemed to be &#147;well-capitalized&#148; if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8% or greater, a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5% or greater, and a new common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5% or greater, and is not subject to a regulatory order, agreement, or directive to meet and 

&#160; 

maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. An institution is deemed to be &#147;adequately capitalized&#148; if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% or greater, generally a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4% or greater, and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5% or greater, and the institution does not meet the definition of a &#147;well-capitalized&#148; institution. An institution that does not meet one or more of the &#147;adequately capitalized&#148; tests is deemed to be &#147;undercapitalized.&#148; If the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 6%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio that is less than 4%, or a Tier 1 leverage ratio that is less than 3%, it is deemed to be &#147;significantly undercapitalized.&#148; Finally, an institution is deemed to be &#147;critically undercapitalized&#148; if it has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2%. At December 31, 2015, WesBanco Bank had capital levels that met the &#147;well-capitalized&#148; standards under FDICIA and its implementing regulations. 

FDICIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution, including payment of a cash dividend, or paying any management fee to its holding company, if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized. Undercapitalized institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration plan. If any depository institution subsidiary of a holding company is required to submit a capital restoration plan, the holding company would be required to provide a limited guarantee regarding compliance with the plan as a condition of approval of such plan by the appropriate federal banking agency. If an undercapitalized institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized. Significantly undercapitalized institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets, and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. Critically undercapitalized institutions may not, beginning 60 days after becoming critically undercapitalized, make any payment of principal or interest on their subordinated debt and/or trust preferred securities. In addition, critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to appointment of a receiver or conservator within 90 days of becoming critically undercapitalized. 

GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT 

Under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the &#147;GLB Act&#148;), banks are no longer prohibited from associating with, or having management interlocks with, a business organization engaged principally in securities activities. By qualifying as a &#147;financial holding company,&#148; as authorized under the GLB Act, which WesBanco has done, a bank holding company acquires new powers not otherwise available to it. As indicated above, WesBanco has elected to become a financial holding company under the GLB Act. It also has qualified a subsidiary of the Bank as a financial subsidiary under the GLB Act. 

Financial holding company powers relate to &#147;financial activities&#148; that are determined by the Federal Reserve Board, in coordination with the Secretary of the Treasury, to be financial in nature, incidental to an activity that is financial in nature, or complementary to a financial activity, provided that the complementary activity does not pose a safety and soundness risk. The GLB Act itself defines certain activities as financial in nature, including but not limited to: underwriting insurance or annuities; providing financial or investment advice; underwriting, dealing in, or making markets in securities; merchant banking, subject to significant limitations; insurance company portfolio investing, subject to significant limitations; and any activities previously found by the Federal Reserve Board to be closely related to banking. 

National and state banks are permitted under the GLB Act, subject to capital, management, size, debt rating, and CRA qualification factors, to have &#147;financial subsidiaries&#148; that are permitted to engage in financial activities not otherwise permissible. However, unlike financial holding companies, financial subsidiaries may not engage in insurance or annuity underwriting; developing or investing in real estate; merchant banking (for at least five years); or insurance company portfolio investing. 

DODD-FRANK ACT 

The Dodd-Frank Act contains numerous and wide-ranging reforms to the structure of the U.S. financial system. Portions of the Dodd-Frank Act are effective at different times, and many of the provisions are general 

&#160; 

statements directing regulators to draft more detailed rules. Although the full scope of the Dodd-Frank Act&#146;s impact remains somewhat unclear, management expects that it will, over time, reduce revenue and increase expenses. 

Bank holding companies will be subjected to increased capital requirements (discussed above under &#147;Item 1. Business&#151;Capital Requirements&#148;). A provision known as the Volcker Rule limits WesBanco&#146;s ability to engage in proprietary trading, as well as its ability to sponsor or invest in hedge funds or private equity funds. In December 2013, U.S. federal banking agencies issued joint final rules implementing this provision. The rules were effective April 1, 2014, and WesBanco is expected to bring its activities and investments into full compliance by July 21, 2017. Additionally, an interim final rule was issued in January 2014 that exempts investments in certain collateralized debt obligations backed primarily by trust preferred securities from the provisions of the Volcker Rule. This interim final rule issued in January 2014 did not have a material impact on WesBanco for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

The Dodd-Frank Act makes several changes affecting the securitization markets, which may affect a bank&#146;s ability or desire to use those markets to meet funding or liquidity needs. One of these changes calls for federal regulators to adopt regulations requiring the sponsor of a securitization to retain at least 5% of the credit risk, with exceptions for &#147;qualified residential mortgages.&#148; 

Publicly traded companies are required by the Dodd-Frank Act to give shareholders an advisory vote on executive compensation, and, in some cases, golden parachute arrangements. Further, SEC and NASDAQ rulemaking under the Dodd-Frank Act requires NASDAQ-listed companies to have a compensation committee composed entirely of independent directors. WesBanco&#146;s compensation committee members currently satisfy the independence criteria. The Dodd-Frank Act also calls for regulators to issue new rules relating to incentive-based compensation arrangements deemed excessive, and proxy access by shareholders. 

All banks and other insured depository institutions will have increased authority to open new branches across state lines (discussed above under &#147;Item 1. Business&#151;Supervision and Regulation&#148;). A provision authorizing insured depository institutions to pay interest on checking accounts will likely increase WesBanco&#146;s interest expenses. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the &#147;CFPB&#148;), created by the Dodd-Frank Act, has the authority to write rules implementing numerous consumer protection laws applicable to all banks (discussed below under &#147;Item 1. Business&#151;Consumer Protection Laws&#148;). 

CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS 

In connection with its lending and leasing activities, all banks are subject to a number of federal and state laws designed to protect consumers and promote lending and other financial services to various sectors of the economy and population. These laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act (&#147;TILA&#148;), the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (&#147;RESPA&#148;), the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, and, in some cases, their respective state law counterparts. The new CFPB created by the Dodd-Frank Act now has consolidated authority to write regulations implementing these and other laws. WesBanco&#146;s other subsidiaries that provide services relating to consumer financial products and services will also be subject to the CFPB&#146;s regulations. As an institution with assets of less than $10 billion, WesBanco Bank will continue to be examined by the FDIC for compliance with these rules. Relating to mortgage lending, the Dodd-Frank Act authorized the CFPB to issue new regulations governing the ability to repay (&#147;ATR&#148;), qualified mortgages (&#147;QM&#148;), mortgage servicing, appraisals and compensation of mortgage lenders, all of which have been issued and have taken effect. They limit the mortgage products offered by the Bank and have an impact on timely enforcement of delinquent mortgage loans. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Reserve Board to write rules to limit debit card interchange fees to those &#147;reasonable and proportional&#148; to the cost of transactions, which were effective on October 1, 2011. Even though the limits on debit card interchange fees apply only to institutions with more than $10 billion in assets, market forces may over time limit debit card interchange fees as a source of revenue for all banks, including smaller banks like WesBanco Bank.

Federal law currently contains extensive customer privacy protection provisions. Under these provisions, a financial institution must provide to its customers, at the inception of the customer relationship and annually thereafter, the institution&#146;s policies and procedures regarding the handling of customers&#146; nonpublic personal financial information. These provisions also provide that, except for certain limited exceptions, an institution may not provide such personal information to unaffiliated third parties unless the institution discloses to the customer that such information may be so provided and the customer is given the opportunity to opt out of such disclosure. Federal law makes it a criminal offense, except in limited circumstances, to obtain or attempt to obtain customer information of a financial nature by fraudulent or deceptive means. 

The CRA requires WesBanco Bank&#146;s primary federal bank regulatory agency, the FDIC, to assess WesBanco Bank&#146;s record in meeting the credit needs of the communities served by the bank, including low and moderate-income neighborhoods and persons. Institutions are assigned one of four ratings: &#147;Outstanding,&#148; &#147;Satisfactory,&#148; &#147;Needs to Improve&#148; or &#147;Substantial Noncompliance.&#148; This assessment is reviewed when a bank applies to merge or consolidate with or acquire the assets or assume the liabilities of an insured depository institution, or to open or relocate a branch office. WesBanco Bank&#146;s current CRA rating is &#147;Outstanding&#148; as a result of an FDIC exam in 2013. 

SECURITIES REGULATION 

WesBanco&#146;s full service broker-dealer subsidiary, WesBanco Securities, is registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC and in the states in which it does business. WesBanco Securities also is a member of FINRA. WesBanco Securities is subject to regulation by the SEC, FINRA and the securities administrators of the states in which it is registered. WesBanco Securities is a member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, which in the event of the liquidation of a broker-dealer, provides protection for customers&#146; securities accounts held by WesBanco Securities of up to $500,000 for each eligible customer, subject to a limitation of $250,000 for claims for cash balances. 

In addition, WesBanco Bank&#146;s Investment Department serves as an investment adviser to a family of mutual funds and is registered as an investment adviser with the SEC and in some states. 

The Dodd-Frank Act also directed the CFPB to integrate the mortgage loan disclosures under TILA and RESPA. The CFPB issued new integrated disclosures rules (&#147;TRID&#148;) which became effective October 3, 2015, and which have combined the prior good faith estimate and truth in lending disclosure form into a new form, the loan estimate. They have also combined the HUD-1 and final truth in lending disclosure forms into a new form, the closing disclosure. The new rule is extremely complex (approximately 1900 pages), contains significant uncertainties as to penalties, some of which can be quite material, contains prohibitions against correcting even technical mistakes, creates uncertainty regarding last minute changes in the transaction and has triggered significant ambiguity in compliance. Thus for covered transactions and most closed-end consumer credit transactions secured by real property, the TRID rules have presented significant and ongoing challenges to real estate lenders. 

ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING INITIATIVES AND THE USA PATRIOT ACT 

A major focus of governmental policy on financial institutions in recent years has been aimed at combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the &#147;USA Patriot Act&#148;) substantially broadened the scope of United States anti-money laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations, creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the United States. The United States Treasury Department has issued various implementing regulations which apply certain requirements of the USA Patriot Act to financial institutions, such as WesBanco Bank and WesBanco&#146;s broker-dealer subsidiary. These regulations impose obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their customers. Failure of WesBanco and its subsidiaries to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal and reputational consequences for WesBanco and its subsidiaries.
