Proprietary Products 

&#160; 

We developed and commercialize in the U.S. products designed to address the unmet needs of patients suffering from addiction and schizophrenia. 

&#160; 

ARISTADA 

&#160; 

ARISTADA (aripiprazole lauroxil) is an extended-release injectable suspension for the treatment of schizophrenia, which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;), and commercially launched by us, in October 2015. ARISTADA is the first of our products to utilize our proprietary LinkeRx technology. ARISTADA is a prodrug; once in the body, ARISTADA is likely converted by enzyme-mediated hydrolysis to N-hydroxymethyl aripiprazole, which is then hydrolyzed to aripiprazole. ARISTADA is the first atypical antipsychotic with once-monthly and six-week dosing options for delivering and maintaining therapeutic levels of medication in the body through an intramuscular injection. ARISTADA possesses three dosing options (441 mg, 662 mg and 882 mg) packaged in a ready-to-use, pre-filled product format. We developed, manufacture and commercialize ARISTADA in the U.S. 

&#160; 

What is schizophrenia? 

&#160; 

Schizophrenia is a chronic, severe and disabling brain disorder. The disease is marked by positive symptoms (hallucinations and delusions) and negative symptoms (depression, blunted emotions and social withdrawal), as well as by disorganized thinking. An estimated 2.4 million Americans over the age of 18 have schizophrenia in a given year, with men and women affected equally. Worldwide, it is estimated that one person in every 100 develops schizophrenia. Studies have demonstrated that as many as 75% of patients with schizophrenia have difficulty taking their oral medication on a regular basis, which can lead to worsening of symptoms. 

&#160; 

VIVITROL 

&#160; 

VIVITROL (naltrexone for extended-release injectable suspension) is the only once &#8209;monthly , non-addictive, injectable medi cation approved in the U.S., Russia and certain of the CIS for the treatment of alcohol dependence and for the prevention of relapse to opioid dependence, following opioid detoxification. VIVITROL uses our polymer &#8209;based microsphere injectable extended &#8209;release technology to deliver and maintain therapeutic medication levels in the body through one injection every four weeks. We developed, manufacture and commercialize VIVITROL in the U.S., and Cilag commercializes VIVITROL in Russia and certain countries of the CIS. 

&#160; 

What are opioid dependence and alcohol dependence? 

&#160; 

Opioid dependence is a serious and chronic brain disease characterized by compulsive, prolonged self-administration of opioid substances that are not used for a medical purpose. According to the 201 4 U.S. National Survey on Drug Use and Health, an estimated 2.3 million people aged 18 or older were dependent on pain relievers or heroin in the U.S. 

&#160; 

Alcohol dependence is a serious and chronic brain disease characterized by cravings for alcohol, loss of control over drinking, withdrawal symptoms and an increased tolerance for alcohol. Nearly 18 million people aged 18 or older in the U.S. are dependent on or abuse alcohol. Adherence to medication is particularly challenging with this patient population. 

&#160; 

Products Using Our Proprietary Technologies 

&#160; 

We have granted licenses under our proprietary technologies to enable third parties to develop, commercialize and, in some cases, manufacture products for which we receive royalties and/or manufacturing revenues. Such arrangements include the following: 

&#160;

&#160; 

Schizophrenia is a chronic, severe and disabling brain disorder. The disease is marked by positive symptoms (hallucinations and delusions) and negative symptoms (depression, blunted emotions and social withdrawal), as well as by disorganized thinking. An estimated 2.4 million Americans over the age of 18 have schizophrenia in a given year, with men and women affected equally.

Studies have demonstrated that as many as 75% of patients with schizophrenia have difficulty taking their oral medication on a regular basis, which can lead to worsening of symptoms. 

&#160; 

What is bipolar I disorder? 

&#160; 

Bipolar I disorder is a brain disorder that causes unusual shifts in a person&#8217;s mood, energy and ability to function. It is often characterized by debilitating mood swings, from extreme highs (mania) to extreme lows (depression). Bipolar I disorder is characterized based on the occurrence of at least one manic episode, with or without the occurrence of a major depressive episode. Bipolar disorder is believed to affect approximately 5.7 million American adults, or about 2.6% of the U.S. population aged 18 and older in a given year. The median age of onset for bipolar disorder is 25 years. 

&#160; 

What is schizoaffective disorder? 

&#160; 

Schizoaffective disorder is a condition in which a person experiences a combination of schizophrenia symptoms, such as delusions, hallucinations or other symptoms characteristic of schizophrenia, and mood disorder symptoms, such as mania or depression. Schizoaffective disorder is a serious mental illness that affects 

&#160;

about one in 100 people. 

&#160; 

AMPYRA/FAMPYRA 

&#160; 

AMPYRA (dalfampridine)/FAMPYRA (fampridine), to our knowledge, is the first treatment approved in the U.S. and in over 50 countries across Europe, Asia and the Americas to improve walking in adults with MS who have walking disability, as demonstrated by an increase in walking speed. Extended-release dalfampridine tablets are marketed and sold by Acorda in the U.S. under the trade name AMPYRA and by Biogen outside the U.S. under the trade name FAMPYRA. In July 2011, the European Medicines Agency ("EMA") conditionally approved FAMPYRA in the EU for the improvement of walking in adults with MS. This authorization was renewed as of August 2015. AMPYRA and FAMPYRA incorporate our oral controlled-release technology. AMPYRA and FAMPYRA are manufactured by us. 

&#160; 

What is multiple sclerosis? 

&#160; 

MS is a chronic, usually progressive, disease in which the immune system attacks and degrades the function of nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord. These nerve fibers consist of long, thin fibers, or axons, surrounded by a myelin sheath, which facilitates the transmission of electrical impulses. In MS, the myelin sheath is damaged by the body&#8217;s own immune system, causing areas of myelin sheath loss, also known as demyelination. This damage, which can occur at multiple sites in the CNS, blocks or diminishes conduction of electrical impulses. People with MS may suffer impairments in any number of neurological functions. These impairments vary from individual to individual and over the course of time, depending on which parts of the brain and spinal cord are affected, and often include difficulty walking. Individuals vary in the severity of the impairments they suffer on a day &#8209;to &#8209;day basis, with impairments becoming better or worse depending on the activity of the disease on a given day. 

&#160; 

BYDUREON 

&#160; 

BYDUREON (exenatide extended-release for injectable suspension) is approved in the U.S. and the EU for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. From August 2012 until February 2014, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company ("Bristol-Myers") and AstraZeneca co-developed and marketed BYDUREON through their diabetes collaboration. In February 2014, AstraZeneca assumed sole responsibility for the development and commercialization of BYDUREON. BYDUREON, a once-weekly formulation of exenatide, the active ingredient in BYETTA, uses our polymer-based microsphere injectable extended-release technology. BYDUREON is manufactured by AstraZeneca. 

&#160; 

BYDUREON Pen 2 mg, a pre &#8209;filled, single &#8209;use pen injector that contains the same formulation and dose as the original BYDUREON single &#8209;dose tray, is available in the U.S. , certain countries in the EU and Japan. &#160; 

&#160; 

What is type 2 diabetes? 

&#160; 

Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce or properly use insulin. Diabetes can result in serious health complications, including cardiovascular, kidney and nerve disease. Diabetes is believed to affect nearly 26 million people in the U.S. and an estimated 382 million adults worldwide. Approximately 90 &#8209;95% of those affected have type 2 diabetes. An estimated 80% of people with type 2 diabetes are overweight or obese. Data indicate that weight loss (even a modest amount) supports patients in their efforts to achieve and sustain glycemic control. 

&#160; 

Key Development Programs 

&#160; 

Our research and development is focused on leveraging our formulation expertise and proprietary product platforms to develop novel, competitively advantaged medications designed to enhance patient outcomes in major CNS di sorders, such as schizophrenia, addiction, depression and MS . &#160; As part of our ongoing research and development efforts, we have devoted, and will continue to devote, significant resources to conducting clinical studies to advance the development of new pharmaceutical products. The discussion below highlights our key current research and development programs. Drug development involves a high degree of risk and investment, and the status, timing and scope of our development programs are subject to change. Important factors that could adversely affect our drug development efforts are discussed in &#8220;Item 1A&#8212;Risk Factors.&#8221; Refer to the &#8220;Patents and Proprietary Rights&#8221; section of this Annual Report for information

ALKS 5461 

&#160; 

ALKS 5461 is a proprietary, oral investigational medicine in development for the treatment of MDD in patients who have an inadequate response to standard antidepressant therapies. ALKS 5461 is composed of samidorphan in combination with buprenorphine. Samidorphan, formerly referred to as ALKS 33, is a proprietary oral opioid modulator characterized by limited hepatic metabolism and durable pharmacologic activity in modulating brain opioid receptors. ALKS 5461 acts as a balanced neuromodulator in the brain and represents a new approach with a novel mechanism of action for treating MDD. In October 2013, the FDA granted Fast Track status for ALKS 5461 for the adjunctive treatment of MDD in patients with inadequate response to standard antidepressant therapies. 

&#160; 

In January 2015, we announced topline results from FORW ARD-1, one of a series of supportive clinical studies in the FORWARD phase 3 pivotal program designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of two titration schedules of ALKS 5461. Data from FORWARD-1 confirmed the safety and tolerability of ALKS 5461 in both titration schedules evaluated&#8212;one-week and two-week dose escalation schedules. These findings were consistent with the safety and tolerability profile seen in the phase 2 study of ALKS 5461 completed in 2013. In addition, the exploratory efficacy analyses showed that ALKS 5461 reduced depressive symptoms from baseline in patients who received either of the two titration schedules. These data supported the one-week titration schedule being utilized in the phase 3 efficacy studies in the FORWARD program. In December 2015, we also announced positive topline results from a human abuse potential study of ALKS 5461. 

&#160; 

In January 2016, we announced the topline results of FORWARD-3 and FORWARD-4, two phase 3 clinical studies of ALKS 5461 in MDD. &#160; Neither of the two studies met the prespecified primary efficacy endpoint, which compared ALKS 5461 to placebo on the change from baseline on the Montgomery&#8212;&#197;sberg Depression Rating Scale (&#8220;MADRS&#8221;). 

&#160; 

FORWARD-4 tested two dose levels of ALKS 5461 (2mg/2mg and 0.5mg/0.5mg) compared to placebo. There was a clear trend toward efficacy with the 2mg/2mg dose of ALKS 5461 on the primary endpoint, and post hoc analyses achieved statistical significance for the entire 2mg/2mg dose group on the MADRS endpoint. Based on these analyses, we believe that FORWARD-4 provides supportive evidence of the efficacy of ALKS 5461 in the treatment of MDD. FORWARD-3 tested ALKS 5461 (2mg/2mg) compared to placebo. Placebo response was greater than that observed in FORWARD-4 and no treatment effect of ALKS 5461 was observed. 

&#160; 

FORWARD-5, the third pivotal efficacy study in the FORWARD program, is ongoing, testing two dose levels of ALKS 5461 (2mg/2mg and 1mg/1mg). FORWARD-5 shares common design features with FORWARD-4. Knowledge gained from FORWARD-3 and FORWARD-4 will be used to inform FORWARD-5. 

&#160; 

In the case of a clear positive outcome for FORWARD-5, we will consult with the FDA to determine whether the evidence provided by it and the previously completed successful, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2 study, together with supportive evidence from FORWARD-4, collectively could provide substantial evidence of efficacy for ALKS 5461 for the adjunctive treatment of MDD. 

&#160; 

ALKS 3831 

&#160; 

ALKS 3831 is a novel, proprietary oral investigational medicine designed as a broad-spectrum antipsychotic for the treatment of schizophrenia. ALKS 3831 is composed of samidorphan in combination with the established antipsychotic drug olanzapine, which is generally available under the name ZYPREXA. ALKS 3831 is designed to 

&#160;

provide the strong efficacy of olanzapine and a differentiated safety profile with favorable weight and metabolic properties and to have utility in the treatment of schizophrenia in patients with co-occurring alcohol use disorder. 

&#160; 

In January 2015, we announced data from the first phase of a randomized, dose ranging, six-month phase 2 study of ALKS 3831 designed to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of ALKS 3831 in the treatment of schizophrenia and its attenuation of weight gain, compared to olanzapine. ALKS 3831 met the primary endpoint of the study, demonstrating equivalence to olanzapine in reduction from baseline in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (&#8220;PANSS&#8221;) total scores at week 12. Results showed that ALKS 3831 also met the secondary endpoint of demonstrating a lower mean percent weight gain compared to olanzapine at week 12 in the full study population, and a lower mean percent weight gain compared to olanzapine at week 12 in a pre-specified subset of patients who gained weight during the one-week olanzapine lead-in. 

&#160; 

In April 2015, we announced data from the completed, six-month, randomized, dose-ranging phase 2 study of ALKS 3831. Patients who received ALKS 3831 during the first phase of the study, which lasted for three months, continued to receive the same dose of ALKS 3831, and patients who had received olanzapine during the first phase were switched to ALKS 3831. Data from the completed study supported and extended the initial positive results showing ALKS 3831&#8217;s favorable efficacy and mean weight gain profile and demonstrated for the first time that switching patients from olanzapine to ALKS 3831 resulted in a cessation of mean weight gain. 

&#160; 

In December 2015, we announced the commencement of ENLIGHTEN-1, the first of two planned phase 3 studies from the ENLIGHTEN pivotal program for ALKS 3831. ENLIGHTEN-1 is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind phase 3 study to evaluate the antipsychotic efficacy of ALKS 3831 compared to placebo over four weeks in patients experiencing acute exacerbation of schizophrenia. &#160; In February 2016, we announced the initiation of ENLIGHTEN-2, a phase 3 study assessing weight gain with ALKS 3831 compared to olanzapine in patients with schizophrenia over a six month period. The ENLIGHTEN pivotal program will also include supportive studies to evaluate the pharmacokinetic and metabolic profile of ALKS 3831, as well as long-term safety. We expect to use safety and efficacy data from the ENLIGHTEN pivotal program to serve as the basis for a NDA to be submitted to the FDA, pending study results. 

&#160; 

ALKS 8700 

&#160; 

ALKS 8700 is an oral, novel and proprietary monomethyl fumarate ("MMF") molecule in development for the treatment of MS. ALKS 8700 is designed to rapidly and efficiently convert to MMF in the body and to offer differentiated features as compared to the currently marketed dimethyl fumarate, TECFIDERA. In May 2015, we presented positive results from a phase 1, randomized, double-blind clinical study of ALKS 8700, designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and single-dose pharmacokinetics of several oral formulations of ALKS 8700 compared to both placebo and active control groups. Data from the study showed that ALKS 8700 provided MMF exposures comparable to TECFIDERA, with less variability and favorable gastrointestinal tolerability. The most common adverse events were flushing and gastrointestinal-related. 

&#160; 

Following a meeting with the FDA, we announced in October 2015 our plans to file a 505(b)(2) NDA using pharmacokinetic bridging data from studies comparing ALKS 8700 and TECFIDERA and a two-year, multicenter, open-label study designed to assess the safety of ALKS 8700, which we initiated in December 2015. Additionally, we plan to initiate a randomized, head-to-head phase 3 study of the gastrointestinal tolerability of ALKS 8700 compared to TECFIDERA in mid-2016. 

&#160; 

In October 2015, we also announced data from a randomized, double-blind phase 1 comparative pharmacokinetic study evaluating plasma MMF levels achieved by the administration of single doses of ALKS 8700 and TECFIDERA. Initial data from this study showed that ALKS 8700 met the pharmacokinetic criteria for bioequivalence to TECFIDERA. The most common adverse events for ALKS 8700 in the study were flushing, dizziness and constipation. Based on these results, we have selected the ALKS 8700 dose to be used in the registration program. We will need to conduct additional preclinical studies and pharmacokinetic studies to further support pharmacokinetic comparability to TECFIDERA. We expect to complete ALKS 8700 registrational studies and file the NDA in 2018. 

&#160; 

ALKS 6428 

&#160;

&#160; 

ALKS 6428 is a n oral formulation of naltrexone designed to help physicians transition patients from physical dependence on op ioids to antagonist therapy. This transition process include s doses of naltrexone in conjuncti on with buprenorphine during a seven-day treatment period. Upon successful completion of the transition process , physicians would then be able to administer VIVITROL. In September 2015, we initiated a phase 3 study evaluating the safety, tolerabili ty and efficacy of ALKS 6428 in patients with opioid dependence. 

&#160; 

Aripiprazole Lauroxil Two-Month Dose 

&#160; 

Aripiprazole lauroxil is an injectable atypical antipsychotic, available as ARISTADA with once-monthly and six-week dosing options for the treatment of schizophrenia, in development with a two-month dosing interval. In February 2016, we announced positive topline results from a randomized, open-label, pharmacokinetic study evaluating a two-month dosing interval of aripiprazole lauroxil extended-release injectable suspension for the treatment of schizophrenia. Based on these phase 1 results, we plan to submit a supplemental New Drug Application (&#8220;NDA&#8221;) to the FDA in the second half of 2016. 

&#160; 

ALKS 7119 

&#160; 

ALKS 7119 is a novel, proprietary investigational medicine that has a multivalent mechanism of action that acts on key receptors in the brain involved in several CNS diseases, including agitation in Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, MDD and others. In January 2016, we announced the initiation of a phase 1, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single ascending doses of ALKS 7119 in healthy subjects. Results from this phase 1 study are expected in the second half of 2016. 

&#160; 

RDB 1450 

&#160; 

RDB 1450, formerly referred to as RDB 1419, is our selective effector cell activator (&#8220;SECA&#8221;) that is designed to harness a patient&#8217;s immune system to preferentially activate and increase the number of tumor killing immune cells. &#160; SECA proteins selectively target immune cells to avoid expansion of immune regulatory cells which interfere with the anti-tumor response. SECA molecules are engineered using our proprietary fusion protein technology platform to modulate the natural mechanism of action of a biologic product. Based on feedback from the FDA, we now plan to file an Investigational New Drug application with the FDA in the first quarter of 2016 and begin phase 1 clinical trials in the second quarter of 2016.

The know &#8209;how royalty is payable for the later of 15 years from first commercial sale of a product in each individual country or March 31, 2019 , subject in each case to the expiry of the license agreement. These royalty payments may be reduced in any country based on patent litigation or on competing products achieving certain minimum sales thresholds. The license agreement expires upon the later of (i) March 31, 2019 or (ii) the expiration of the last of the patents subject to the agreement. After expiration, Janssen retains a non &#8209;exclusive, royalty &#8209;free license to develop, manufacture and commercialize the products. 

&#160; 

Janssen may terminate the license agreement in whole or in part upon three months&#8217; notice to us. We and Janssen have the right to terminate the agreement upon a material breach of the other party, which is not cured within a certain time period, or upon the other party&#8217;s bankruptcy or insolvency. 

&#160; 

RISPERDAL CONSTA 

&#160; 

Under a product development agreement, we collaborated with Janssen on the development of RISPERDAL CONSTA. Under the development agreement, Janssen provided funding to us for the development of RISPERDAL CONSTA, and Janssen is responsible for securing all necessary regulatory approvals for the product. 

&#160; 

Under license agreements, we granted Janssen and an affiliate of Janssen exclusive worldwide licenses to use and sell RISPERDAL CONSTA. Under our license agreements with Janssen, we receive royalty payments equal to 2.5% of Janssen&#8217;s net sales of RISPERDAL CONSTA in each country where the license is in effect based on the quarter when the product is sold by Janssen. This royalty may be reduced in any country based on lack of patent coverage and significant competition from generic versions of the product. Janssen can terminate the license agreements upon 30 days&#8217; prior written notice to us. Either party may terminate the license agreements by written notice following a breach which continues for 90 days after the delivery of written notice thereof or upon the other party&#8217;s insolvency. The licenses granted to Janssen expire on a country &#8209;by &#8209;country basis upon the later of (i) the expiration of the last patent claiming the product in such country or (ii) 15 years after the date of the first commercial sale of the product in such country, provided that in no event will the license granted to Janssen expire later than the twentieth anniversary of the first commercial sale of the product in such country, with the exception of certain countries where the fifteen &#8209;year limitation shall pertain regardless. After expiration, Janssen retains a non &#8209;exclusive, royalty &#8209;free license to manufacture, use and sell RISPERDAL CONSTA. 

&#160; 

We exclusively manufacture RISPERDAL CONSTA for commercial sale. Under our manufacturing and supply agreement with Janssen, we record manufacturing revenues when product is shipped to Janssen, based on a 

&#160;

percentage of Janssen&#8217;s net unit sales price for RISPERDAL CONSTA for the calendar year. This percentage is determined based on Janssen&#8217;s unit demand for the calendar year and varies based on the volume of units shipped, with a minimum manufacturing fee of 7.5%. The manufacturing and supply agreement terminates on expiration of the license agreements. In addition, either party may terminate the manufacturing and supply agreement upon a material breach by the other party, which is not resolved within 60 days after receipt of a written notice specifying the material breach or upon written notice in the event of the other party&#8217;s insolvency or bankruptcy. Janssen may terminate the agreement upon six months&#8217; written notice to us. In the event that Janssen terminates the manufacturing and supply agreement without terminating the license agreements, the royalty rate payable to us on Janssen&#8217;s net sales of RISPERDAL CONSTA would increase from 2.5% to 5.0%. 

&#160; 

Acorda 

&#160; 

Under an amended and restated license agreement, we granted Acorda an exclusive worldwide license to use and sell and, solely in accordance with our supply agreement, to make or have made, AMPYRA/FAMPYRA. We receive certain commercial and development milestone payments, license revenues and a royalty of approximately 10% based on net sales of AMPYRA/FAMPYRA by Acorda and its sub &#8209;licensee, Biogen . This royalty payment may be reduced in any country based on lack of patent coverage, competing products achieving certain minimum sales thresholds, and whether we manufacture the product. 

&#160; 

In June 2009, we entered into an amendment of the amended and restated license agreement and the supply agreement with Acorda and, pursuant to such amendment, consented to the subl icense by Acorda to Biogen of Acorda&#8217;s rights to use and sell FAMPYRA in certain territories outside of the U.S. (to the extent that such rights were to be sublicensed to Biogen pursuant to its separate collaboration and license agreement with Acorda). Under this amendment, we agreed to modify certain terms and conditions of the amended and restated license agreement and the supply agreement with Acorda to reflect the sub license by Acorda to Biogen . 

&#160; 

Acorda has the right to terminate the amended and restated license agreement upon 90 days&#8217; written notice. We have the right to terminate the amended and restated license agreement for countries in which Acorda fails to launch a product within a specified time after obtaining the necessary regulatory approval or fails to file regulatory approvals within a commercially reasonable time after completion of, and receipt of positive data from, all preclinical and clinical studies required for filing a marketing authorization application. Either party has the right to terminate the amended and restated license agreement by written notice following a material breach of the other party, which is not cured within a certain time period, or upon the other party&#8217;s entry into bankruptcy or dissolution proceedings. If we terminate Acorda&#8217;s license in any country, we are entitled to a license from Acorda of its patent rights and know &#8209;how relating to the product as well as the related data, information and regulatory files, and to market the product in the applicable country, subject to an initial payment equal to Acorda&#8217;s cost of developing such data, information and regulatory files and to ongoing royalty payments to Acorda. Subject to the termination of the amended and restated license agreement, licenses granted under the license agreement terminate on a country &#8209;by &#8209;country basis on the later of (i) September 26, 2018 or (ii) the expiration of the last to expire of our patents or the existence of a threshold level of competition in the marketplace. 

&#160; 

Under our commercial manufacturing supply agreement with Acorda, we manufacture and supply AMPYRA/FAMPYRA for Acorda (and its sub &#8209;licensee). Under the terms of the agreement, Acorda may obtain up to 25% of its total annual requirements of product from a second &#8209;source manufacturer. We receive manufacturing royalties equal to 8% of net selling price for all product manufactured by us and a compensating payment for product manufactured and supplied by a third party. We may terminate the commercial manufacturing supply agreement upon 12 months&#8217; prior written notice to Acorda, and either party may terminate the commercial manufacturing supply agreement following a material and uncured breach of the commercial manufacturing supply agreement or amended and restated license agreement or the entry into bankruptcy or dissolution proceedings by the other party. In addition, subject to early termination of the commercial manufacturing supply agreement noted above, the commercial manufacturing supply agreement terminates upon the expiry or termination of the amended and restated license agreement. 

&#160; 

We are entitled to receive the following milestone payments under our amended and restated license agreement with Acorda for each of the third and fourth new indications of the product developed thereunder: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

initiation of a phase 3 clinical trial: $1.0 million; 

&#183; 

acceptance of an NDA by the FDA: $1.0 million; 

&#183; 

approval of the NDA by the FDA: $1.5 million; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

the first commercial sale: $1.5 million. 

&#160; 

In January 2011, we entered into a development and supplemental agreement to our amended and restated license agreement and commercial manufacturing supply agreement with Acorda. Under the terms of this agreement, we granted Acorda the right, either with us or with a third party, in each case in accordance with certain terms and conditions, to develop new formulations of dalfampridine or other aminopyridines. Under the terms of the agreement, Acorda has the right to select either a formulation developed by us or by a third party for commercialization. We are entitled to development fees we incur in developing formulations under the development and supplemental agreement and, if Acorda selects and commercializes any such formulation, to milestone payments (for new indications if not previously paid), license revenues and royalties in accordance with our amended and restated license agreement for the product, and either manufacturing fees as a percentage of net selling price for product manufactured by us or compensating fees for product manufactured by third parties. If, under the development and supplemental agreement, Acorda selects a formulation not developed by us, then we will be entitled to various compensation payments and have the first option to manufacture such third &#8209;party formulation. The development and supplemental agreement expires upon the expiry or termination of the amended and restated license agreement and may be earlier terminated by either party following an uncured breach of the agreement by the other party. 

&#160; 

Acorda&#8217;s financial obligations under this development and supplemental agreement continue for a minimum of ten years from the first commercial sale of such new formulation, and may extend for a longer period of time, depending on the intellectual property rights protecting the formulation, regulatory exclusivity and/or the absence of significant market competition. These financial obligations survive termination of the agreement. 

&#160; 

AstraZeneca 

&#160; 

In May 2000, we entered into a development and license agreement with Amylin Pharmaceuticals, LLC (&#8220;Amylin&#8221;) for the development of exendin products falling within the scope of our patents, including the once &#8209;weekly formulation of exenatide marketed as BYDUREON. In August 2012, Bristol &#8209;Myers acquired Amylin. From August 2012 through January 2014, Bristol &#8209;Myers and AstraZeneca jointly developed and commercialized Amylin&#8217;s exendin products, including BYDUREON, through their diabetes collaboration. In April 2013, Bristol &#8209;Myers completed its assumption of all global commercialization responsibility related to the marketing of BYDUREON from Amylin&#8217;s former collaborative partner, Eli Lilly &#38; Company (&#8220;Lilly&#8221;). In February 2014, AstraZeneca acquired sole ownership of the intellectual property and global rights related to BYDUREON and Amylin&#8217;s other exendin products, including Amylin&#8217;s rights and obligations under our development and license agreement. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the development and license agreement, AstraZeneca has an exclusive, worldwide license to our polymer &#8209;based microsphere technology for the development and commercialization of injectable extended &#8209;release formulations of exendins and other related compounds. We receive funding for research and development and will also receive royalty payments based on future product sales. Upon the achievement of certain development and commercialization goals, we received milestone payments consisting of cash and warrants for Amylin common stock; there are no further milestones to be earned under the agreement. In October 2005 and in July 2006, we amended the development and license agreement. Under the amended development and license agreement (i) we are responsible for formulation and are principally responsible for non &#8209;clinical development of any products that may be developed pursuant to the agreement and for manufacturing these products for use in early &#8209;phase clinical trials, and (ii) we transferred certain of our technology related to the manufacture of BYDUREON to Amylin and agreed to the manufacture of BYDUREON by Amylin. Under our amended development and license agreement, AstraZeneca is responsible for conducting clinical trials, securing regulatory approvals and commercializing exenatide products, including BYDUREON, on a worldwide basis. 

&#160; 

Until December 31, 2021, we will receive royalties equal to 8% of net sales from the first 40 million units of BYDUREON sold in any particular calendar year and 5.5% of net sales from units sold beyond the first 40 million units for that calendar year. Thereafter, during the term of the development and license agreement, we will receive royalties equal to 5.5% of net sales of products sold. We were entitled to, and received, milestone payments related to the first commercial sale of BYDUREON in the EU and the first commercial sale of BYDUREON in the U.S. 

&#160; 

The development and license agreement expires on the later of (i) ten years from the first commercial sale of the last of the products covered by the development and license agreement, or (ii) the expiration or invalidation of all of our patents covering such product. Upon expiration, all licenses become non &#8209;exclusive and royalty &#8209;free. AstraZeneca may 

&#160;

terminate the development and license agreement for any reason upon 180 days&#8217; written notice to us. In addition, either party may terminate the development and license agreement upon a material default or breach by the other party that is not cured within 60 days after receipt of written notice specifying the default or breach. Alkermes may terminate the development and license agreement upon AstraZeneca&#8217;s insolvency or bankruptcy. 

&#160; 

Other Arrangements 

&#160; 

Civitas Therapeutics, Inc. 

&#160; 

In December 2010, we entered into an asset purchase and license agreement and equity investment agreement with Civitas Therapeutics, Inc. (&#8220;Civitas&#8221;). Under the terms of these agreements, we sold, assigned and transferred to Civitas our right, title and interest in our pulmonary patent portfolio and certain of our pulmonary drug delivery equipment, instruments, contracts and technical and regulatory documentation and licensed certain related know &#8209;how in exchange for 15% of the issued shares of the Series A Preferred Stock of Civitas and a royalty on future sales of any products developed using this pulmonary drug delivery technology. We also participated in certain subsequent rounds of financing. In connection with this transaction, Civitas also entered into an agreement to sublease our pulmonary manufacturing facility located in Chelsea, Massachusetts. 

&#160; 

We may terminate the asset purchase and license agreement for default in the event Civitas does not meet certain minimum development performance obligations. Either party may terminate the asset purchase and license agreement upon a material default or breach by the other party that is not cured within 45 days after receipt of written notice specifying the default or breach. Either party may also terminate the asset purchase and license agreement upon written notice in the event of the other party&#8217;s insolvency or bankruptcy. 

&#160; 

In October 2014, Civitas was acquired by Acorda for approximately $525.0 mi llion, of which we received $29.6 million in exchange for our approxi mate 6% interest in Civitas. Also, in connection with Acorda&#8217;s purchase of Civitas, we sold certain of our pulmonary manufacturing equipment to Acorda in exchange for $30.0 million. In November 2015, we assigned the lease to our pulmonary manufacturing facility located in Chelsea, Massachusetts to Civitas and terminated the sublease with Civitas related to this facility. 

&#160; 

Recro Pharma, Inc. 

&#160; 

On April 10, 2015, we completed the sale of our manufacturing facility in Gainesville, GA, the manufacturing and royalty revenue associated with products manufactured at that facility, and global rights to IV/IM and parenteral forms of Meloxicam (the &#8220;Disposition&#8221; or &#8220;Gainesville Transaction&#8221;) to Recro Pharma, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation listed on Nasdaq (&#8220;Recro&#8221;) and Recro Pharma LLC (the &#8220;Acquisition Sub&#8221; and together with Recro, the &#8220;Purchasers&#8221;) pursuant to a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the &#8220;Purchase Agreement&#8221;) entered into on March 7, 2015 among us, Daravita Limited (an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company), and the Purchasers. 

&#160; 

In accordance with the terms of the Purchase Agreement, at the closing of the Disposition, the Purchasers made an initial cash payment to us of $50 million, a $4 million payment relating to the net working capital, and issued us a seven-year warrant to purchase an aggregate of 350,000 shares of Recro common stock at a per share exercise price equal to $19.46, two times the closing price of Recro&#8217;s common stock on the day prior to closing. We are also eligible to receive low double digit royalties on net sales of IV/IM and parenteral forms of Meloxicam and up to $120 million in milestone payments upon the achievement of certain regulatory and sales milestones related to IV/IM and parenteral forms of Meloxicam. 

&#160; 

Proprietary Product Platforms 

&#160; 

Our proprietary product platforms, which include technologies owned and exclusively licensed to us, address several important development opportunities. We have used these technologies as platforms to establish drug development, clinical development and regulatory expertise. 

&#160; 

Injectable Extended &#8209;Release Microsphere Technology 

&#160; 

Our injectable extended &#8209;release microsphere technology allows us to encapsulate small &#8209;molecule pharmaceuticals, peptides and proteins, in microspheres made of common medical polymers. The technology is 

&#160;

designed to enable novel formulations of pharmaceuticals by providing controlled, extended release of drugs over time. Drug release from the microsphere is controlled by diffusion of the drug through the microsphere and by biodegradation of the polymer. These processes can be modulated through a number of formulation and fabrication variables, including drug substance and microsphere particle sizing and choice of polymers and excipients. 

&#160; 

LinkeRx Technology 

&#160; 

The long &#8209;acting LinkeRx technology platform is designed to enable the creation of extended &#8209;release injectable versions of antipsychotic therapies and may also be useful in other disease areas in which long action may provide therapeutic benefits. The technology uses proprietary linker &#8209;tail chemistry to create new molecular entities derived from known agents. 

&#160; 

NanoCrystal Technology 

&#160; 

Our NanoCrystal technology is applicable to poorly water &#8209;soluble compounds and involves formulating and stabilizing drugs into particles that are nanometers in size. A drug in NanoCrystal form can be incorporated into a range of common dosage forms and administration routes, including tablets, capsules, inhalation devices and sterile forms for injection, with the potential for enhanced oral bioavailability, increased therapeutic effectiveness, reduced/eliminated fed/fasted variability and sustained duration of intravenous/intramuscular release. 

&#160; 

Oral Controlled Release Technology 

&#160; 

Our oral controlled release (&#8220;OCR&#8221;) technologies are used to formulate, develop and manufacture oral dosage forms of pharmaceutical products that control the release characteristics of standard dosage forms. Our OCR platform includes technologies for tailored pharmacokinetic profiles including SODAS technology, CODAS technology, IPDAS technology and the MXDAS drug absorption system, each as described below: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

SODAS Technology: SODAS (Spheroidal Oral Drug Absorption System) technology involves producing uniform spherical beads of 1 mm to 2 mm in diameter containing drug plus excipients and coated with product &#8209;specific modified &#8209;release polymers. Varying the nature and combination of polymers within a selectively permeable membrane enables varying degrees of modified release depending upon the required product profile. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

CODAS Technology: CODAS (Chronotherapeutic Oral Drug Absorption System) technology enables the delayed onset of drug release incorporating the use of specific polymers, resulting in a drug release profile that more accurately complements circadian patterns. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

IPDAS Technology: IPDAS (Intestinal Protective Drug Absorption System) technology conveys gastrointestinal protection by a wide dispersion of drug candidates in a controlled and gradual manner, through the use of numerous high &#8209;density controlled &#8209;release beads compressed into a tablet form. Release characteristics are modified by the application of polymers to the micro matrix and subsequent coatings, which form a rate &#8209;limiting semi &#8209;permeable membrane. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

MXDAS Technology: MXDAS (Matrix Drug Absorption System) technology formulates the drug candidate in a hydrophilic matrix and incorporates one or more hydrophilic matrix &#8209;forming polymers into a solid oral dosage form, which controls the release of drug through a process of diffusion and erosion in the gastrointestinal tract. 

&#160; 

Manufacturing and Product Supply 

&#160; 

We own and occupy a &#160; R&#38;D and manufacturing facility in Athlone, Ireland and a manufacturing facility in Wilmington, Ohio. We either purchase active drug product from third parties or receive it from our third &#8209;party licensees to formulate product using our technologies. The manufacture of our products for clinical trials and commercial use is subject to Current Good Manufacturing Practice (&#8220;cGMP&#8221;) regulations and other regulatory agency regulations. Our manufacturing and development capabilities include formulation through process development, scale &#8209;up and full &#8209;scale commercial manufacturing and specialized capabilities for the development and manufacturing of controlled substances. 

&#160; 

Although some materials for our products are currently available from a single source or a limited number of 

&#160;

qualified sources, we attempt to acquire an adequate inventory of such materials, establish alternative sources and/or negotiate long &#8209;term supply arrangements. We believe we do not have any significant issues in finding suppliers. However, we cannot be certain that we will continue to be able to obtain long &#8209;term supplies of our manufacturing materials. 

&#160; 

Our third &#8209;party service providers involved in the manufacture of our products are subject to inspection by the FDA or comparable agencies in other jurisdictions. Any delay, interruption or other issues that arise in the acquisition of active pharmaceutical ingredients (&#8220;API&#8221;), manufacture, fill &#8209;finish, packaging, or storage of our marketed products or product candidates , including as a result of a failure of our facilities or the facilities or operations of third parties to pass any regulatory agency inspection, could significantly impair our ability to sell our products or advance our development efforts, as the case may be. For information about risks relating to the manufacture of our marketed products and product candidates , see &#8220;Item 1A&#8212;Risk Factors&#8221; and specifically those sections entitled &#8220;&#8212; We rely on third parties to provide services in connection with the manufacture and distribution of our products&#8221; and &#8220;&#8212;We are subject to risks related to the manufacture of our products. &#8221; 

&#160; 

Proprietary Products and Products using our Proprietary Technologies 

&#160; 

We manufacture microspheres for RISPERDAL CONSTA and VIVITROL, polymer for BYDUREON , &#160; and ARISTADA in our Wilmington, Ohio facility. We are currently operating two RISPERDAL CONSTA line s, one VIVITROL line and one ARISTADA line at commercial scale. Janssen has granted us an option, exercisable upon 30 days&#8217; advance written notice, to purchase the most recently constructed and validated RISPERDAL CONSTA manufacturing line at its then &#8209;current net book value. We source our packaging operations for VIVITROL and ARISTADA to a third &#8209;party contractor. Janssen is responsible for packaging operations for RISPERDAL CONSTA. Our Wilmington, Ohio facility has been inspected by U.S., European including the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, Chinese, Japanese, Brazilian and Saudi Arabian regulatory authorities for compliance with required cGMP standards for continued commercial manufacturing. 

&#160; 

We manufacture AMPYRA/ FAMPYRA and other products in our Athlone, Ireland facility. This facility has been inspected by U.S., Irish, Brazilian, Turkish, Saudi Arabian, Korean and Belarusian regulatory authorities for compliance with required cGMP standards for continued commercial manufacturing. 

&#160; 

For more information about our manufacturing facilities, see &#8220;Item 2&#8212;Properties.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Clinical Product s &#160; 

&#160; 

We have established, and are operating, facilities with the capability to produce clinical supplies of injectable extended &#8209;release products at our Wilmington, Ohio facility and NanoCrystal and OCR technology products at our Athlone, Ireland facility. We have also contracted with third &#8209;party manufacturers to formulate certain products for clinical use. We require that our contract manufacturers adhere to cGMP in the manufacture of products for clinical use. 

&#160; 

Research &#38; Development 

&#160; 

We devote significant resources to R&#38;D programs. We focus our R&#38;D efforts on finding novel therapeutics in areas of high unmet medical need. Our R&#38;D efforts include, but are not limited to, areas such as pharmaceutical formulation, analytical chemistry, process development, engineering, scale &#8209;up and drug optimization/delivery. Please see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; for our R&#38;D expenditures for our years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and the nine months ended December 31, 2013. 

&#160; 

Permits and Regulatory Approvals 

&#160; 

We hold various licenses in respect of our manufacturing activities conducted in Wilmington, Ohio and Athlone, Ireland. The primary licenses held in this regard are FDA Registrations of Drug Establishment; and Drug Enforcement Administration of the U.S. Department of Justice (&#8220;DEA&#8221;). We also hold a Manufacturers Authorization (No. M1067), an Investigational Medicinal Products Manufacturers Authorization (No. IMP074) and Certificates of Good Manufacturing Practice Compliance of a Manufacturer (Ref. 2014/7828/IMP074 and 2014/7828/M1067) from the Health Products Regulatory Authority (&#8220;HPRA&#8221;) in respect of our Athlone, Ireland facility, and a number of Controlled 

&#160;

Substance Licenses granted by the HPRA. Due to certain U.S. state law requirements, we also hold certain state licenses to cover distribution activities through certain states and not in respect of any manufacturing activities conducted in those states. 

&#160; 

We do not generally act as the product authorization holder for products incorporating our drug delivery technologies that have been developed on behalf of a licensee. In such cases, our licensee usually holds the relevant authorization from the FDA or other national regulator, and we would support this authorization by furnishing a copy of the Drug Master File, or the chemistry, manufacturing and controls data to the relevant regulator to prove adequate manufacturing data in respect of the product. We would generally update this information annually with the relevant regulator. In other cases where we are developing proprietary products, such as VIVITROL and ARISTADA, we hold the appropriate regulatory documentation ourselves. 

&#160; 

Marketing, Sales and Distribution 

&#160; 

We are responsible for the marketing of VIVITROL and ARISTADA in the U.S. We focus our sales and marketing efforts on specialist physicians in private practice and in public treatment systems. We use customary pharmaceutical company practices to market our product and to educate physicians, such as sales representatives calling on individual physicians, advertisements, professional symposia, selling initiatives, public relations and other methods. We provide, or contract with third &#8209;party vendors to provide, customer service and other related programs for our product s , such as product &#8209;specific websites, insurance research services and order, delivery and fulfillment services. 

&#160; 

Our sales force for VIVITROL in the U.S. consists of approximately 70 individuals. VIVITROL is sold directly to pharmaceutical wholesalers, specialty pharmacies and a specialty distributor. Product sales of VIVITROL during the year ended December 31, 2015 to McKesson Corporat ion, CVS Caremark Corporation and Cardinal Health represented approximately 17 % , 15% &#160; and 10 %, respectively , of total VIVITROL sales. 

&#160; 

Our sales force for ARISTADA in the U.S. consists of approximately 200 individuals. ARISTADA is primarily sold to pharmaceutical wholesalers. 

&#160; 

ICS AmerisourceBergen, a division of AmerisourceBergen Corporation, provides warehousing, shipping and administrative services for VIVITROL and ARISTADA . 

&#160; 

Under our license agreements with Janssen, AstraZeneca, Acorda and other licensees and sublicensees , these companies are responsible for the commercialization of any products developed thereunder if and when regulatory approval is obtained. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

We face intense competition in the development, manufacture, marketing and comme rcialization of our products from many and varied sources, such as academic institutions, government agencies, research institutions and biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, including other companies with similar technologies. Some of these competitors are also our licensees , who control the commercialization of products f r om which we receive manufacturing and royalty revenues. These competitors are working to develop and market other systems, products and other methods of preventing or reducing disease, and new small &#8209;molecule and other classes of drugs that can be used with or without a drug delivery system. 

&#160; 

The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries &#160; are characterized by intensive research, development and commercialization efforts and rapid and significant technological change. Many of our competitors are larger and have significantly greater financial and other resources than we do. We expect our competitors to develop new technologies, products and processes that may be more effective than those we develop. The development of technologically improved or different products or technologies may make our product s or product platforms obsolete or noncompetitive before we recover expenses incurred in connection with their development or realize any revenues from any marketed product. 

&#160; 

There are other companies developing extended &#8209;release product platforms. In many cases, there are products on the market or in development that may be in direct competition with our products. In addition, we know of new chemical entities that are being developed that, if successful, could compete against our product s . These chemical entities are being designed to work differently than our product s and may turn out to be safer or to be more effective than our 

&#160;

product s . Among the many experimental therapies being tested around the world, there may be some that we do not now know of that may compete with our proprietary product platforms or product s . Our licensees could choose a competing technology to use with their drugs instead of one of our product platforms and could develop products that compete with our products. 

&#160; 

With respect to our proprietary injectable product platform, we are aware that there are other companies developing extended &#8209;release delivery systems for pharmaceutical products. In the treatment of schizophrenia, ARISTADA, INVEGA SUSTENNA /XEPLION and INVEGA TRINZA and RISPERDAL CONSTA compete with each other and a number of other injectable products including ZYPREXA RELPREVV ((olanzapine) For Extended Release Injectable Suspension), which is marketed and sold by Lilly; ABILIFY MAINTENA, (aripiprazole for extended release injectable suspension), a once &#8209;monthly injectable formulation of ABILIFY (aripiprazole) developed by Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (&#8220;Otsuka Pharm. Co. &#8221;); oral compounds currently on the market; and generic versions of branded oral and injectable products. In the treatment of bipolar disorder, RISPERDAL CONSTA competes with antipsychotics such as ABILIFY, LATUDA, risperidone, olanzapine, ziprasidone and clozapine. 

&#160; 

In the treatment of alcohol dependence, VIVITROL competes with CAMPRAL (acamprosate calcium) sold by Forest Laboratories and ANTABUSE sold by Odyssey Pharmaceuticals (&#8220;Odyssey&#8221;) as well as currently marketed drugs, including generic drugs, also formulated from naltrexone. Other pharmaceutical companies are developing product s that have shown some promise in treating alcohol dependence that, if approved by the FDA, would compete with VIVITROL. 

&#160; 

In the treatment of opioid dependence, VIVITROL competes with methadone, oral naltrexone, SUBOXONE (buprenorphine HCl/naloxone HCl dehydrate sublingual tablets), SUBOXONE (buprenorphine/naloxone) Sublingual Film, and SUBUTEX (buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets), each of which is marketed and sold by Indivior plc, and BUNAVAIL buccal film (buprenorphine and naloxone) marketed b y BioDelivery Sciences, and ZUBS OLV (buprenorphine and naloxone) marketed by Orexo US, Inc. It also competes with generic versions of SUBUTEX and SUBOXONE sublingual tablets. Other pharmaceutical companies are developing product s that have shown promise in treating opioid dependence that, if approved by the FDA, would compete with VIVITROL. 

&#160; 

BYDUREON competes with established diabetes therapies for market share. Such competitive products include sulfonylureas, metformin, insulins, thiazolidinediones, glinides, dipeptidyl peptidase type IV inhibitors, insulin sensitizers, alpha &#8209;glucosidase inhibitors and sodium &#8209;glucose transporter &#8209;2 inhibitors. BYDUREON also competes with other glucagon &#8209;like peptide &#8209;1 (&#8220;GLP &#8209;1&#8221;) agonists, including VICTOZA (liraglutide (rDNA origin) injection), which is marketed and sold by Novo Nordisk A/S and TRULICITY ((dulaglutide) injection), which is marketed and sold by Lilly . Other pharmaceutical companies are developing product candidates for the treatment of type 2 diabetes that, if approved by the FDA, would compete with BYDUREON. 

&#160; 

While AMPYRA/FAMPYRA is the first product approved as a treatment to improve walking in patients with MS, there are a number of FDA &#8209;approved therapies for MS disease management that seek to reduce the frequency and severity of exacerbations or slow the accumulation of physical disability for people with certain types of MS. These products include AVONEX, TYSABRI, TECFIDER A, and PLEGRIDY from Biogen ; BETASERON from Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals; COPAXONE from Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.; REBIF and NOVANTRONE from EMD Serono, Inc.; GILENYA and EXTAVIA from Novartis AG; AUBAGIO and LEMTRADA from Sanofi &#8209;Aventis and generic products. 

&#160; 

With respect to our NanoCrystal technology, we are aware that other technology approaches similarly address poorly water &#8209;soluble drugs. These approaches include nanoparticles, cyclodextrins, lipid &#8209;based self &#8209;emulsifying drug delivery systems, dendrimers and micelles, among others, any of which could limit the potential success and growth prospects of products incorporating our NanoCrystal technology. In addition, there are many competing technologies to our OCR technology, some of which are owned by large pharmaceutical companies with drug delivery divisions and other, smaller drug &#8209;delivery &#8209;specific companies. 

&#160; 

Patents and Proprietary Rights 

&#160; 

Our success will be dependent, in part, on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products, including those marketed and sold by our licensees , to maintain trade secret protection and to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others. We have a proprietary portfolio of patent rights and exclusive licenses to patents 

&#160;

and patent applications. In addition, our licensees may own issued patents that cover certain of our products. We have filed numerous patent applications in the U.S. and in other countries directed to compositions of matter as well as processes of preparation and methods of use, including patent applications relating to each of our delivery technologies. As of December 31, 2015, w e own ed more than 200 issued U.S. patents. In the future, we plan to file additional patent applications in the U.S. and in other countries directed to new or improved products and processes, and we intend to vigorously defend our patent positions. 

&#160;

ALKS 8700 

&#160; 

We have U.S. patents and patent applications, and a number of corresponding foreign counterparts, related to ALKS 8700. Our U.S. patents and expiration dates for ALKS 8700 are: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

U.S. Patent No. 8,669,281, having claims to a composition of matter that covers ALKS 8700, expiring in 2033; and 

&#183; 

U.S. Patent No. 9,090,558, having claims to methods of treating MS, expiring in 2033. 

&#160; 

We have exclusive rights through licensing agreements with third parties to issued U.S. patents, pending patent applications and corresponding patents or patent applications in countries outside the U.S, subject in certain instances to the rights of the U.S. government to use the technology covered by such patents and patent applications. Under certain licensing agreements, we are responsible for patent expenses, and we pay annual license fees and/or minimum annual royalties. In addition, under these licensing agreements, we are obligated to pay royalties on future sales of products, if any, covered by the licensed patents. 

&#160; 

We know of several U.S. patents issued to other parties that may relate to our product s . The manufacture, use, offer for sale, sale or import of some of our product s might be found to infringe on the claims of these patents. A party might file an infringement action against us. The cost of defending such an action is likely to be high, and we might not receive a favorable ruling. 

&#160; 

We also know of patent applications filed by other parties in the U.S. and various other countries that may relate to some of our product s if issued in their present form. The patent laws of the U.S. and other countries are distinct, and decisions as to patenting, validity of patents and infringement of patents may be resolved differently in different countries. If patents are issued to any of these applicants, we or our licensee s may not be able to manufacture, use, offer for sale, sell or import some of our product s without first getting a license from the patent holder. The patent holder may not grant us a license on reasonable terms, or it may refuse to grant us a license at all. This could delay or prevent us from developing, manufacturing, selling or importing those of our product s that would require the license. 

&#160; 

We try to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the U.S. and in other countries related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business. Because the patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies involves complex legal and factual questions, enforceability of patents cannot be predicted with certainty. The ultimate degree of patent protection that will be afforded to products and processes, including ours, in the U.S. and in other important markets, remains uncertain and is dependent upon the scope of protection decided upon by the patent offices, courts and lawmakers in these countries. Patents, if issued, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. Thus, any patents that we own or license from others may not provide any protection against competitors. Our pending patent applications, those we may file in the future, or those we may license from third parties, may not result in patents being issued. If issued, they may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, others may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology that we have developed outside the scope of our patents. The laws of certain countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S. 

&#160;

&#160; 

We also rely on trade secrets, know &#8209;how and technology, which are not protected by patents, to maintain our competitive position. We try to protect this information by entering into confidentiality agreements with parties that have access to it, such as our corporate partners, collaborators, licensees, employees and consultants. Any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our confidential information or our competitors might learn of the information in some other way. If any trade secret, know &#8209;how or other technology not protected by a patent were to be disclosed to, or independently developed by, a competitor, such event could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. For more information, see &#8220;Item 1A&#8212;Risk Factors.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Our trademarks, including VIVITROL and ARISTADA , are important to us and are generally covered by trademark applications or registrations in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and the patent or trademark offices of other countries. P roducts using our proprietary technologies also use trademarks that are owned by our licensees , su ch as the marks INVEGA SUSTENNA, INVEGA TRINZA and RISPERDAL CONSTA, which are registered trade marks of Johnson &#38; Johnson , BYDUREON, which is a registered trademark of Amylin, and AMPYRA and FAMPYRA, which are registered trademarks of Acorda. Trademark protection varies in accordance with local law, and continues in some countries as long as the mark is used and in other countries as long as the mark is registered. Trademark registrations generally are for fixed but renewable terms.

Regulatory 

&#160; 

Regulation of Pharmaceutical Products 

&#160; 

United States 

&#160; 

Our current and contemplated activities, and the products and processes that result from such activities, are subject to substantial government regulation. Before new pharmaceutical products may be sold in the U.S., pre &#8209;clinical studies and clinical trials of the products must be conducted and the results submitted to the FDA for approval. Clinical trial programs must determine an appropriate dose and regimen, establish substantial evidence of effectiveness and define the conditions for safe use. This is a high &#8209;risk process that requires stepwise clinical studies in which the product candidate must successfully meet pre &#8209;specified endpoints. 

&#160; 

Pre &#8209;Clinical Testing : Before beginning testing of any compounds with potential therapeutic value in human subjects in the U.S., stringent government requirements for pre &#8209;clinical data must be satisfied. Pre &#8209;clinical testing includes both in vitro, or in an artificial environment outside of a living organism, and in vivo, or within a living 

&#160;

organism, laboratory evaluation and characterization of the safety and efficacy of a drug and its formulation. 

&#160; 

Investigational New Drug (&#8220;IND&#8221;) Exemption : Pre &#8209;clinical testing results obtained from in vivo studies in several animal species, as well as from in vitro studies, are submitted to the FDA, as part of an IND, and are reviewed by the FDA prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. The pre &#8209;clinical data must provide an adequate basis for evaluating both the safety and the scientific rationale for the initial clinical studies in human volunteers. 

&#160; 

Clinical Trials : Clinical trials involve the administration of the drug to healthy human volunteers or to patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator pursuant to an FDA &#8209;reviewed protocol. Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, although the phases may overlap with one another and, depending upon the nature of the clinical program, a specific phase or phases may be skipped altogether. Clinical trials must be conducted under protocols that detail the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used to monitor safety, and the efficacy criteria, if any, to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Phase 1 clinical trials&#8212;test for safety, dose tolerability, absorption, bio &#8209;distribution, metabolism, excretion and clinical pharmacology and, if possible, to gain early evidence regarding efficacy. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Phase 2 clinical trials&#8212;involve a relatively small sample of the actual intended patient population and seek to assess the efficacy of the drug for specific targeted indications, to determine dose &#8209;response and the optimal dose range and to gather additional information relating to safety and potential adverse effects. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Phase 3 clinical trials&#8212;consist of expanded, large &#8209;scale studies of patients with the target disease or disorder to obtain definitive statistical evidence of the efficacy and safety of the proposed product and dosing regimen. 

&#160; 

In the U.S., the results of the pre &#8209;clinical and clinical testing of a product candidate are then submitted to the FDA in the form of a Biologics License Application (&#8220;BLA&#8221;), or an NDA. The NDA or BLA also includes information pertaining to the preparation of the new drug, analytical methods, details of the manufacture of finished products and proposed product packaging and labeling. The submission of an application is not a guarantee that the FDA will find the application complete and accept it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file the application if it is not considered sufficiently complete to permit a review and will inform the applicant of the reason for the refusal. The applicant may then resubmit the application and include the supplemental information. 

&#160; 

Once an NDA or BLA is accepted for filing, the FDA has 10 months, under its standard review process, within which to review the application (for some applications, the review process is longer than 10 months). For drugs that, if approved, would represent a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of serious conditions when compared to standard applications, the FDA may assign &#8220;priority review&#8221; designation and review the application within 6 months. The FDA has additional review pathways to expedite development and review of new drugs that are intended to treat serious or life &#8209;threatening conditions and demonstrate the potential to address un met medical needs, including: &#8220;Fast Track,&#8221; &#8220;B reakthrough T herapy,&#8221; and &#8220; A ccelerated A pproval.&#8221; 

&#160; 

For example, i n October 2013, the FDA granted F ast T rack status for ALKS 5461 for the adjunctive treatment of MDD in patients with inadequate response to standard antidepressant therapies. Fast T rack is a process designed to expedite the review of such products by providing, among other things, more frequent meetings with the FDA to discuss the product&#8217;s development plan, more frequent written correspondence from the FDA about trial design, eligibility for accelerated approval, and rolling review, which allows submission of individually completed sections of a NDA or BLA for FDA review before the entire filing is completed. Fast T rack status does not ensure that a product will be developed more quickly or receive FDA approval. 

&#160; 

As part of its review, the FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for independent advice on questions related to the development of the drug and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee; however, historically, it has typically followed such recommendations. The FDA may determine that a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (&#8220;REMS&#8221;) is necessary to ensure that the benefits of a new product outweigh its risks. If required, a REMS may include various elements, such as publication of a medication guide, patient package insert, a communication plan to 

&#160;

educate health care providers of the drug&#8217;s risks, limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, or other measures that the FDA deems necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. 

&#160; 

In reviewing a BLA or NDA, the FDA may grant marketing approval , or issue a complete response letter to communicate to the applicant the reasons the application cannot be approved in the current form and provide input on the changes that must be made before an application can be approved. Even if such additional information and data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA or NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The receipt of regulatory approval often takes a number of years, involves the expenditure of substantial resources and depends on a number of factors, including the severity of the disease in question, the availability of alternative treatments, potential safety signals observed in pre &#8209;clinical or clinical tests, and the risks and benefits demonstrated in clinical trials. It is impossible to predict with any certainty whether and when the FDA will grant marketing approval. Even if a product is approved, the approval may be subject to limitations based on the FDA&#8217;s interpretation of the data. For example, the FDA may require, as a condition of approval, restricted distribution and use, enhanced labeling, special packaging or labeling, expedited reporting of certain adverse events, pre &#8209;approval of promotional material s or restrictions on direct &#8209;to &#8209;c onsumer advertising, any of which could negatively impact the commercial success of a drug. The FDA may require a sponsor to conduct additional post &#8209;marketing studies as a condition of approval to provide data on safety and effectiveness. In addition, prior to commercialization, controlled substances are subject to review and potential scheduling by the DEA. 

&#160; 

The FDA tracks information on side effects and adverse events reported during clinical studies and after marketing approval. Non &#8209;compliance with safety reporting requirements may result in civil or criminal penalties. Side effects or adverse events that are identified during clinical trials can delay, impede or prevent marketing approval. Based on new safety information that emerges after approval, the FDA can mandate product labeling changes, impose a new REMS or the addition of elements to an existing REMS, require new post &#8209;marketing studies (including additional clinical trials), or suspend or withdraw approval of the product. 

&#160; 

If we seek to make certain types of changes to an approved product, such as adding a new indication, making certain manufacturing changes, or changing manufacturers or suppliers of certain ingredients or components, the FDA will need to review and approve such changes in advance. In the case of a new indication, we are required to demonstrate with additional clinical data that the product is safe and effective for the new intended use. Such regulatory reviews can result in denial or modification of the planned changes, or requirements to conduct additional tests or evaluations that can substantially delay or increase the cost of the planned changes. 

&#160; 

In addition, the FDA regulates all advertising and promotional activities for products under its jurisdiction. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by the FDA. However, physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for uses that are not described in the drug&#8217;s labeling. Such off &#8209;label uses are common across certain medical specialties and often reflect a physician&#8217;s belief that the off &#8209;label use is the best treatment for a particular patient. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments, but the FDA regulations do impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers&#8217; communications regarding off &#8209;label uses. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements may subject a company to adverse publicity, enforcement action by the FDA and the U.S. Department of Justice, corrective advertising and the full range of civil and criminal penalties available to the FDA and the U.S. Department of Justice. 

&#160; 

Controlled Substances Act : The DEA regulates pharmaceutical products that are controlled substances. Controlled substances are those drugs that appear on one of the five schedules promulgated and administered by the DEA under the Controlled Substances Act (the &#8220;CSA&#8221;). The CSA governs, among other things, the inventory, distribution, recordkeeping, handling, security and disposal of controlled substances. Pharmaceutical products that act on the CNS are often evaluated for abuse potential; a product that is then classified as controlled substance must undergo scheduling by the DEA, which is a separate process that may delay the commercial launch of a pharmaceutical product even after FDA approval of the NDA. Companies with a scheduled pharmaceutical product are subject to periodic and ongoing inspections by the DEA and similar state drug enforcement authorities to assess ongoing compliance with the DEA&#8217;s regulations. Any failure to comply with these regulations could lead to a variety of sanctions, including the revocation , or a denial of renewal , of any DEA registration and injunctions, or civil or criminal penalties. 

&#160; 

Outside the United States 

&#160; 

&#160;

Our products are commercialized by our licensees in numerous jurisdictions outside the U.S. Most of these jurisdictions have product approval and post &#8209;approval regulatory processes that are similar in principle to those in the U.S. In Europe, there are several tracks for marketing approval, depending on the type of product for which approval is sought. Under the centralized procedure, a company submits a single application to the EMA. The marketing application is similar to the NDA in the U.S. and is evaluated by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (&#8220; CHMP &#8221;) , the expert scientific committee of the EMA. If the CHMP determines that the marketing application fulfills the requirements for quality, safety, and efficacy, it will submit a favorable opinion to the European Commission (&#8220;EC&#8221;). The CHMP opinion is not binding, but is typically adopted by the EC. A marketing application approved by the EC is valid in all member states. 

&#160; 

In addition to the centralized procedure, Europe also has: (i) a nationalized procedure, which requires a separate application to, and approval determination by, each country; (ii) a decentralized procedure, whereby applicants submit identical applications to several countries and receive simultaneous approval; and (iii) a mutual recognition procedure, where applicants submit an application to one country for review and other countries may accept or reject the initial decision. Regardless of the approval process employed, various parties share responsibilities for the monitoring, detection and evaluation of adverse events post &#8209;approval, including national authorities, the EMA, the EC and the marketing authorization holder. 

&#160; 

Good Manufacturing Processes 

&#160; 

The FDA, the EMA, the competent authorities of the EU Member States and other regulatory agencies regulate and inspect equipment, facilities and processes used in the manufacturing of pharmaceutical and biologic products prior to approving a product. If, after receiving clearance from regulatory agencies, a company makes a material change in manufacturing equipment, location or process, additional regulatory review and approval may be required. Companies also must adhere to cGMP and product &#8209;specific regulations enforced by the FDA following product approval. The FDA, the EMA and other regulatory agencies also conduct regular, periodic visits to re &#8209;inspect equipment, facilities and processes following the initial approval of a product. If, as a result of these inspections, it is determined that our equipment, facilities or processes do not comply with applicable regulations and conditions of product approval, regulatory agencies may seek civil, criminal or administrative sanctions and/or remedies against us, including the suspension of our manufacturing operations. 

&#160; 

Good Clinical Practices 

&#160; 

The FDA, the EMA and other regulatory agencies promulgate regulations and standards, commonly referred to as Good Clinical Practices (&#8220;GCP&#8221;), for designing, conducting, monitoring, auditing and reporting the results of clinical trials to ensure that the data and results are accurate and that the trial participants are adequately protected. The FDA, the EMA and other regulatory agencies enforce GCP through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators, trial sites, contract research organizations (&#8220;CROs&#8221;) and institutional review boards. If our studies fail to comply with applicable GCP, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable, and relevant regulatory agencies may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. Noncompliance can also result in civil or criminal sanctions. We rely on third parties, including CROs, to carry out many of our clinical trial &#8209;related activities. Failure of such third parties to comply with GCP can likewise result in rejection of our clinical trial data or other sanctions.

Under the U.S. Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (the &#8220;Hatch &#8209;Waxman Act&#8221;), Congress created an abbreviated FDA review process for generic versions of pioneer, or brand &#8209;name, drug products. The law also provides incentives by awarding, in ce rtain circumstances, non &#8209;patent related marketing exclusivities to pioneer drug manufacturers. Newly approved drug products and changes to the conditions of use of approved products may benefit from periods of non &#8209;patent &#8209;related marketing exclusivity in addition to any patent protection the drug product may have. The Hatch &#8209;Waxman Act provides five years of new chemical entity (&#8220;NCE&#8221;) marketing exclusivity to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a product that contains an active ingredient, known as the active drug moiety, not found in any other approved product. The FDA is prohibited from accepting any abbreviated NDA (&#8220;ANDA&#8221;) for a generic drug or 505(b)(2) application for five years from the date of approval of the NCE, or four years in the case of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application containing a patent challenge. A 505(b)(2) application is an NDA wherein the applicant relies , in part , on data and the FDA&#8217;s findings of safety and efficacy 

&#160;

f rom studies not conducted by or for it and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of referen ce. This exclusivity will not prevent the submission or approval of a full NDA (e.g., under 505(b)(1)), as opposed to an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application, for any drug, including, for example, a drug with the same active ingredient, dosage form, route of administration, strength and conditions of use. 

&#160; 

The Hatch &#8209;Waxman Act also provides three years of exclusivity for applications containing the results of new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, essential to the FDA&#8217;s approval of new uses of approved products, such as new indications, dosage forms, strengths, or conditions of use. However, this exclusivity only protects against the approval of ANDAs and 505(b)(2) applications for the protected use and will not prohibit the FDA from accepting or approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) applications for other products containing the same active ingredient. 

&#160; 

The Hatch &#8209;Waxman Act requires NDA applicants and NDA holders to provide certain information about patents related to the drug for listing in the FDA&#8217;s Approved Drugs Product List, commonly referred to as the Orange Book. ANDA and 505(b)(2) applicants must then certify regarding each of the patents listed with the FDA for the reference product. A certification that a listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the marketing of the applicant&#8217;s product is called a &#8220;Paragraph IV certification.&#8221; If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant provides such a notification of patent invalidity or noninfringement, then the FDA may accept the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application four years after approval of the NDA for an NCE . If a Paragraph IV certification is filed and the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application has been accepted as a reviewable filing by the FDA, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant must then, within 20 days, provide notice to the NDA holder and patent owner stating that the application has been submitted and providing the factual and legal basis for the applicant&#8217;s opinion that the patent is invalid or not infringed. The NDA holder or patent owner may file suit against the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant for patent infringement. If this is done within 45 days of receiving notice of the Paragraph IV certification, a one &#8209;time, 30 &#8209;month stay of the FDA&#8217;s ability to approve the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application is triggered. The 30 &#8209;month stay begins at the end of the NDA holder&#8217;s data exclusivity period, or, if data exclusivity has expired, on the date that the patent holder is notified. The FDA may approve the proposed product before the expiration of the 30 &#8209;month stay if a court finds the patent invalid or not infringed, or if the court shortens the period because the parties have failed to cooperate in expediting the litigation. 

&#160; 

Sales and Marketing 

&#160; 

We are subject to various U.S. federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti &#8209;kickback laws and false claims laws. Anti &#8209;kickback laws make it illegal for a prescription drug manufacturer to solicit, offer, receive, or pay any remuneration in exchange for, or to induce, the referral of business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug. Due to the broad scope of the U.S. statutory provisions, the general absence of guidance in the form of regulations, and few court decisions addressing industry practices, it is possible that our practices might be challenged under anti &#8209;kickback or similar laws. False claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to third &#8209;party payers (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Activities relating to the sale and marketing of our products may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, as well as the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). In addition, federal and state authorities are paying increased attention to enforcement of these laws within the pharmaceutical industry and private individuals have been active in alleging violations of the laws and bringing suits on behalf of the government under the federal civil False Claims Act. If we were subject to allegations concerning, or were convicted of violating, these laws, our business could be harmed. See &#8220;Item 1A&#8212;Risk Factors&#8221; and specifically those sections entitled &#8220;&#8212;If we fail to comply with the extensive legal and regulatory requirements affecting the healthcare industry, we could face increased costs, penalties and a loss of business,&#8221; &#8220;&#8212;Revenues generated by sales of our products depend on the availability of reimbursement from third &#8209;party payers, and a reduction in payment rate or reimbursement or an increase in our financial obligation to governmental payers could result in decreased sales of our products and decreased revenues&#8221; and &#8220;&#8212; The commercial use of our products may cause unintended side effects or adverse reactions, or incidents of misuse may occur, which could adversely affect our business and share price.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Laws and regulations have been enacted by the federal government and various states to regulate the sales and 

&#160;

marketing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers. The laws and regulations generally limit financial interactions between manufacturers and healthcare providers or require disclosure to the government and public of such interactions. The laws include federal &#8220;sunshine&#8221; provisions enacted in 2010 as part of the comprehensive federal healthcare reform legislation; Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (&#8220;CMS&#8221;) issued a final rule with respect to such provisions in February 2013 and manufacturer reporting commenced in March 2014. The sunshine provisions apply to pharmaceutical manufacturers with products reimbursed under certain government programs and require those manufacturers to disclose annually to the federal government (for re &#8209;disclosure to the public) certain payments made to, or at the request of , or on behalf of, physicians or to teaching hospitals. Certain state laws also require disclosure of pharmaceutical pricing information and marketing expenditures. Given the ambiguity found in many of these laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent federal and state laws and regulations. 

&#160; 

Pricing and Reimbursement 

&#160; 

United States 

&#160; 

In the U.S., sales of our products, including those sold by our licensees , and our ability to generate revenues on such sales are dependent, in significant part, on the availability and level of reimbursement from third &#8209;party payers such as state and federal governments, including Medicare and Medicaid, managed care providers and private insurance plans. Third &#8209;party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and examining the medical necessity and cost &#8209; effectiveness of medical products, in addition to their safety and efficacy. 

&#160; 

Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that is administered by the states for low &#8209;income and disabled beneficiaries. Under the Medicaid rebate program, we are required to pay a rebate for each unit of product reimbursed by the state Medicaid programs. The amount of the rebate for each product is set by law as the greater of 23.1% of average manufacturer price (&#8220;AMP&#8221;) or the difference between AMP and the best price available from us to any commercial or non &#8209;federal governmental customer. The rebate amount must be adjusted upward where the AMP for a product&#8217;s first full quarter of sales, when adjusted for increases in the Consumer Price Index&#8212;Urban, is less than the AMP for the current quarter, with this difference being the amount by which the rebate is adjusted upwards. The rebate amount is required to be recomputed each quarter based on our report of current AMP and best price for each of our products to the CMS. The terms of our participation in the rebate program imposes a requirement for us to report revisions to AMP or best price within a period not to exceed 12 quarters from the quarter in which the data was originally due. Any such revisions could have the impact of increasing or decreasing our rebate liability for prior quarters, depending on the direction of the revision. In addition, if we were found to have knowingly submitted false information to the government, the statute provides for civil monetary penalties per item of false information in addition to other penalties available to the government. 

&#160; 

Medicare is a federal program that is administered by the federal government that covers individuals age 65 and over as well as those with certain disabilities. Medicare Part B pays physicians who administer our products under a payment methodology using average sales price (&#8220;ASP&#8221;) information. Manufacturers, including us, are required to provide ASP information to the CMS on a quarterly basis. This information is used to compute Medicare payment rates, with rates for Medicare Part B drugs outside the hospital outpatient setting and in the hospital outpatient setting consisting of ASP plus a specified percentage. These rates are adjusted periodically. If a manufacturer is found to have made a misrepresentation in the reporting of ASP, the statute provides for civil monetary penalties for each misrepresentation for each day in which the misrepresentation was applied. 

&#160; 

Medicare Part D provides coverage to enrolled Medicare patients for self &#8209;administered drugs (i.e. drugs that do not need to be injected or otherwise administered by a physician). Medicare Part D also covers the prescription drug benefit for dual eligible beneficiaries. Medicare Part D is administered by private prescription drug plans approved by the U.S. government and each drug plan establishes its own Medicare Part D formulary for prescription drug coverage and pricing, which the drug plan may modify from time &#8209;to &#8209;time. The prescription drug plans negotiate pricing with manufacturers and may condition formulary placement on the availability of manufacturer discounts. Except for dual eligible Medicare Part D beneficiaries who qualify for low income subsidies, manufacturers, including us, are required to provide a 50% discount on brand name prescription drugs utilized by Medicare Part D beneficiaries when those beneficiaries reach the coverage gap in their drug benefits. 

&#160; 

The availability of federal funds to pay for our products under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and 

&#160;

Medicare Part B requires that we extend discounts to certain purchasers under the Public Health Services (&#8220;PHS&#8221;) pharmaceutical pricing program. Purchasers eligible for discounts include a variety of community health clinics, other entities that receive health services grants from PHS, and hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of financially needy patients. 

&#160; 

We also make our products available for purchase by authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule (&#8220;FSS&#8221;) of the General Services Administration pursuant to our FSS contract with the Department of Veterans Affairs. Under the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 (the &#8220;VHC Act&#8221;), we are required to offer deeply discounted FSS contract pricing to four federal agencies: the Department of Veterans Affairs; the Department of Defense; the Coast Guard; and the PHS (including the Indian Health Service), in order for federal funding to be made available for reimbursement of any of our products by such federal agencies and certain federal grantees. Coverage under Medicaid, the Medicare Part B program and the PHS pharmaceutical pricing program is also conditioned upon FSS participation. FSS pricing is negotiated periodically with the Department of Veterans Affairs. FSS pricing is intended not to exceed the price that we charge our most &#8209;favored non &#8209;federal customer for a product. In addition, prices for drugs purchased by the Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Defense (including drugs purchased by military personnel and dependents through the TriCare retail pharmacy program), Coast Guard and PHS are subject to a cap on pricing equal to 76% of the non &#8209;federal average manufacturer price (&#8220;non &#8209;FAMP&#8221;). An additional discount applies if non &#8209;FAMP increases more than inflation (measured by the Consumer Price Index&#8212;Urban). In addition, if we are found to have knowingly submitted false information to the government, the VHC Act provides for civil monetary penalties per false item of information in addition to other penalties available to the government. 

&#160; 

In addition, on January 21, 2016, CMS released the final Medicaid covered outpatient drug regulation, which will be effective April 1, 2016. This regulation implements those changes made by the Affordable Care Act to the Medicaid drug rebate statute in 2010 and addresses a number of other issues with respect to the Medicaid program, including, but not limited to, the eligibility and calculation methodologies for AMP and best price, and the expansion of Medicaid rebate liability to include Medicaid managed care organizations. 

&#160; 

The U.S. government regularly consider s reforming healthcare coverage and lessening healthcare costs. Such reforms may include changes to the coverage and reimbursement of our products, which may have a significant impact on our business. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the U.S. has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on drug pricing. Private insurers regularly seek to manage drug cost and utilization by implementing coverage and reimbursement limitations through means including, but not limited to, formularies, increased out &#8209;of &#8209;pocket obligations and various prior authorization requirements. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we have received regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 

&#160; 

Outside the United States 

&#160; 

Within the EU, products are paid for by a variety of payers, with governments being the primary source of payment. Governments may determine or influence reimbursement of products. Governments may also set prices or otherwise regulate pricing. Negotiating prices with governmental authorities can delay commercialization of products. Governments may use a variety of cost &#8209; containment measures to control the cost of products, including price cuts, mandatory rebates, value &#8209;based pricing and reference pricing (i.e. referencing prices in other countries and using those reference prices to set a price). Recent budgetary pressures in many EU countries are causing governments to consider or implement various cost &#8209;containment measures, such as price freezes, increased price cuts and rebates, and expanded generic substitution and patient cost &#8209;sharing. If budget pressures continue, governments may implement additional cost &#8209;containment measures. 

&#160; 

Other Regulations 

&#160; 

Foreign Corrupt Practices Act : We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (&#8220;FCPA&#8221;), which prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from paying, offering to pay, promising, authorizing, or making payments of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party, or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. In many countries, the healthcare professionals with whom we regularly interact may meet the FCPA&#8217;s definition of a foreign government official. The FCPA also requires public companies to make and keep books and 

&#160;

records that accurately and fairly reflect their transactions and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. 

&#160; 

UK Bribery Act : We are also subject to the UK Bribery Act, which proscribes giving and receiving bribes in the public and private sectors, bribing a foreign public official and failing to have adequate procedures to prevent employees and other agents from giving bribes. Foreign corporations that conduct business in the UK generally will be subject to the UK Bribery Act. Penalties under the UK Bribery Act include potentially unlimited fines for corporations and criminal sanctions for corporate officers under certain circumstances. 

&#160; 

Environmental, Health and Safety Laws : Our operations are subject to complex and increasingly stringent environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in the countries where we operate and, in particular, where we have manufacturing facilities, namely the U.S. and Ireland. Environmental and health and safety authorities in the relevant jurisdictions, including the Environmental Protection Agency and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration in the U.S. and the Environmental Protection Agency and the Health and Safety Authority in Ireland, administer laws which regulate, among other matters, the emission of pollutants into the air (including the workplace), the discharge of pollutants into bodies of water, the storage, use, handling and disposal of hazardous substances, the exposure of persons to hazardous substances, and the general health, safety and welfare of employees and members of the public. In certain cases, these laws and regulations may impose strict liability for pollution of the environment and contamination resulting from spills, disposals or other releases of hazardous substances or waste and/or any migration of such hazardous substances or waste. Costs, damages and/or fines may result from the presence, investigation and remediation of contamination at properties currently or formerly owned, leased or operated by us and/or off &#8209;site locations, including where we have arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances or waste. In addition, we may be subject to third &#8209;party claims, including for natural resource damages, personal injury and property damage, in connection with such contamination. 

&#160; 

Other Laws : We are subject to a variety of financial disclosure, securities trading regulations and governmental regulations as a n Irish-incorporated public company in the U.S., including laws relating to the oversight activities of the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) , the Irish Companies Act 2014, and the regulations of the NASDAQ, on which our shares are traded. We are also subject to various laws, regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and the purchase, storage, movement, import and export and use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances used in connection with our research work. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of F ebruary 12, 2016 , we had approximately 1, 5 00 full &#8209;time employees. A significant number of our management and professional employees have prior experience with pharmaceutical, biotechnology or medical product companies. We believe that we have been successful in attracting skilled and experienced scientific and senior management personnel; however, competition for such personnel is intense. None of our employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
