 Item 1. BUSINESS 

General 

Hyster-Yale Materials Handling, Inc. ("Hyster-Yale" or the "Company") and its subsidiaries, including its operating company Hyster-Yale Group, Inc. ("HYG") formerly known as NACCO Materials Handling Group, Inc., is a leading global integrated designer, engineer, manufacturer, seller and servicer of a comprehensive line of lift trucks and aftermarket parts marketed globally primarily under the Hyster &#174; and Yale &#174; &#32;brand names, mainly to independent Hyster &#174; &#32;and Yale &#174; &#32;retail dealerships. Lift trucks and component parts are manufactured in the United States, Northern Ireland, Mexico, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Italy, Japan, Vietnam, Brazil and China. Hyster-Yale was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in 1999. 

On December 18, 2014, the Company acquired Nuvera Fuel Cells, Inc. ("Nuvera"). Nuvera, located in Billerica, Massachusetts, is an alternative-power technology company focused on fuel-cell stacks and related systems. Nuvera is also focused on supporting on-site hydrogen production and dispensing systems that are designed to deliver clean energy solutions to customers. 

As a result of the acquisition of Nuvera, the Company intends to commercialize Nuvera's research and technology to provide for the integration of this fuel-cell technology across large parts of the Company's lift truck product range. The Company expects to be able to offer its Hyster &#174; &#32;and Yale &#174; &#32;customers an integrated, factory-fitted fuel-cell solution, as well as associated hydrogen generation and delivery capability. In addition, the Company expects to offer aftermarket solutions designed to be used in electric powered lift truck brands in the market today. 

The Company makes its annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports available, free of charge, through its website, www.hyster-yale.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;). 

Business Segments 

The Company operates four reportable segments: the Americas, EMEA, JAPIC and Nuvera. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. 

Manufacturing and Assembly 

The Company manufactures components, such as frames, masts and transmissions, and assembles lift trucks in the market of sale whenever practical to minimize freight cost and balance currency mix. In some instances, however, it utilizes one worldwide location to manufacture specific components or assemble specific lift trucks. Additionally, components and assembled lift trucks are exported to locations when it is advantageous to meet demand in certain markets. The Company operates twelve lift truck manufacturing and assembly facilities worldwide with five plants in the Americas, three in EMEA and four in JAPIC, including joint venture operations. 

Sales of lift trucks represented approximately 82% of the Company&#8217;s annual revenues in 2015 &#32;(approximately 52% internal combustion engine units and approximately 30% electric units), and 83% and 82% in 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. Service, rental and other revenues were approximately 5% in 2015 , 4% in 2014 &#32;and 5% in 2013 . 

During 2015 , the Company&#8217;s retail shipments in North America by end market were approximately 23% to the manufacturing market, approximately 18% to the home centers and retail market, approximately 13% to the wholesale distribution market, approximately 12% to the food and beverage market, approximately 11% to the freight and logistics market, approximately 9% to the rental market and approximately 5% to the paper market. 

Aftermarket Parts 

The Company offers a line of aftermarket parts to service its large installed base of lift trucks currently in use in the industry. The Company offers online technical reference databases specifying the required aftermarket parts to service lift trucks and an aftermarket parts ordering system. Aftermarket parts sales represented approximately 13% of the Company&#8217;s annual revenues in each of 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 . 

The Company sells Hyster &#174; - and Yale &#174; -branded aftermarket parts to dealers for Hyster &#174; &#32;and Yale &#174; &#32;lift trucks. The Company also sells aftermarket parts under the UNISOURCE&#8482; and PREMIER&#8482; brands to Hyster &#174; &#32;and Yale &#174; &#32;dealers for the service of competitor lift trucks. The Company has a contractual relationship with a third-party, multi-brand, aftermarket parts wholesaler 

&#32;1 

in the Americas and EMEA whereby orders from the Company's dealers for parts for lift trucks are fulfilled by the third party who then pays the Company a commission. 

Marketing 

The Company&#8217;s marketing organization is structured in three regional divisions: the Americas; EMEA, which includes Europe, the Middle East and Africa; and JAPIC, which includes Japan, Asia, Pacific, India and China. In each region, certain marketing support functions for the Hyster &#174; &#32;and Yale &#174; &#32;brands are carried out by shared services teams. These activities include sales and service training, information systems support, product launch coordination, specialized sales material development, help desks, order entry, marketing strategy and field service support. 

Patents, Trademarks and Licenses 

The Company relies on a combination of trade secret protection, trademarks, copyrights, and patents to establish and protect the Company's proprietary rights. These intellectual property rights may not have commercial value or may not be sufficiently broad to protect the aspect of the Company's technology to which they relate or competitors may design around the patents. The Company is not materially dependent upon patents or patent protection; however, as materials handling equipment has become more technologically advanced, the Company and its competitors have increasingly sought patent protection for inventions incorporated into their respective products. The Company owns the Hyster &#174; &#32;and Yale &#174; &#32;trademarks and believes these trademarks are material to its business. 

Nuvera relies on a combination of trade secret protection, trademarks, copyrights, and patents to establish and protect its proprietary rights. The Company believes these intellectual property rights are well suited for industrial mobility markets such as lift trucks. The integration of these technologies into commercial solutions will require significant cooperation between HYG and Nuvera product engineering and is a key to developing commercial value from this technology. 

Distribution Network 

The Company distributes lift trucks primarily through two channels: independent dealers and a National Accounts program. In addition, the Company distributes aftermarket parts and service for its lift trucks through its independent dealers. The Company&#8217;s end-user base is diverse and fragmented, including, among others, light and heavy manufacturers, trucking and automotive companies, rental companies, building materials and paper suppliers, lumber, metal products, warehouses, retailers, food distributors, container handling companies and U.S. and non-U.S. governmental agencies. 

Independent Dealers 

The Company&#8217;s dealers, located in 129 countries, are generally independently owned and operated. In the Americas, Hyster &#174; &#32;had 21 independent dealers and Yale &#174; &#32;had 14 independent dealers as of December 31, 2015 . In EMEA, Hyster &#174; &#32;had 66 independent dealers and Yale &#174; &#32;had 101 independent dealers as of December 31, 2015 . In JAPIC, Hyster &#174; &#32;had 48 independent dealers and Yale &#174; &#32;had 14 independent dealers as of December 31, 2015 . As of December 31, 2015 , the Company had 26 dual-branded dealers in the Americas, three in EMEA and four in JAPIC. 

National Accounts 

The Company operates a National Accounts program for both Hyster &#174; &#32;and Yale &#174; . The National Accounts program focuses on large customers with centralized purchasing and geographically dispersed operations in multiple dealer territories. The National Accounts program accounted for 16%, 15% and 15% of new lift truck unit volume in 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. The independent dealers support the National Accounts program by providing aftermarket parts and service on a local basis. Dealers receive a commission for the support they provide in connection with National Accounts sales and for the preparation and delivery of lift trucks to customer locations. In addition to selling new lift trucks, the National Accounts program markets services, including full maintenance leases and fleet management. 

Financing of Sales 

The Company is engaged in a joint venture with General Electric Capital Corporation (&#8220;GECC&#8221;) to provide dealer and customer financing of new lift trucks in the United States. The Company owns 20% of the joint venture entity, NMHG Financial Services, Inc. (&#8220;NFS&#8221;), and receives fees and remarketing profits under a joint venture agreement. This agreement has a base term of five years and automatically renews for additional one-year terms unless written notice is given by either party at least 180 days prior to termination. The expiration of the base term is December 2018. The Company accounts for its ownership of NFS using the equity method of accounting. 

&#32;2 

Under the joint venture agreement with NFS, the Company&#8217;s dealers and certain customers are extended credit for the purchase of lift trucks to be placed in the dealer&#8217;s floor plan inventory or the financing of lift trucks that are sold or leased to customers. For some of these arrangements, the Company provides recourse or repurchase obligations to NFS or to others. In substantially all of these transactions, a perfected security interest is maintained in the lift trucks financed, so that in the event of a default, the Company has the ability to foreclose on the leased property and sell it through the Hyster &#174; &#32;or Yale &#174; &#32;dealer network. Furthermore, the Company has established reserves for exposures under these agreements when required. In addition, the Company has an agreement with GECC to limit its exposure to losses at certain eligible dealers. Under this agreement, losses related to guarantees for these certain eligible dealers are limited to 7.5% of their original loan balance. See Notes 16 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.

As of December 31, 2015 , the Company expects substantially all of its backlog of unfilled orders placed with its manufacturing and assembly operations for new lift trucks to be sold during fiscal 2016 . Backlog represents unfilled lift truck orders placed with the Company&#8217;s manufacturing and assembly facilities from dealers and National Accounts customers. In general, unfilled orders may be canceled at any time prior to the time of sale; however, the Company can assess cancellation penalties on dealer orders within a certain period prior to initiating production. The dollar value of backlog is calculated using the current unit backlog and the forecasted average sales price per unit. 

Key Suppliers and Raw Materials 

At times, the Company has experienced significant increases in its material costs, primarily as a result of global increases in industrial metals including steel, lead and copper and other commodity products, such as rubber, due to increased demand and limited supply. While the Company attempts to pass these increased costs along to its customers in the form of higher prices for its products, it may not be able to fully offset the increased costs of industrial metals and other commodities, due to overall market conditions and the lag time involved in implementing price increases for its products. 

A significant raw material required by the Company's manufacturing operations is steel, which is generally purchased from steel producing companies in the geographic area near each of the Company's manufacturing facilities. The other significant components for the Company's lift trucks are axles, brakes, transmissions, batteries and chargers. These components are available from numerous sources in quantities sufficient to meet the Company's requirements. The Company depends on a limited number of suppliers for some of the Company's crucial components, including diesel and gasoline engines, which are supplied by, among others, Power Solutions International, Inc., Kubota Corp., and Cummins Inc., and cast-iron counterweights used to counter balance some lift trucks, which are obtained from, among others, North Vernon Industry Corp. and Eagle Quest International Ltd. Some of these critical components are imported and subject to regulations, such as customary inspection by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, as well as the Company's own internal controls and security procedures. The Company believes comparable alternatives are available for all suppliers. 

Competition 

The Company is one of the leaders in the lift truck industry with respect to market share in the Americas and worldwide. Competition in the materials handling industry is intense and based primarily on strength and quality of distribution, brand loyalty, customer service, new lift truck sales prices, availability of products and aftermarket parts, comprehensive product line offerings, product performance, product quality and features and the cost of ownership over the life of the lift truck. The Company competes with several global lift truck manufacturers that operate in all major markets, as well as other niche companies. 

The lift truck industry also competes with alternative methods of materials handling, including conveyor systems and automated guided vehicle systems. 

The Company's aftermarket parts offerings compete with parts manufactured by other lift truck manufacturers as well as companies that focus solely on the sale of generic parts. 

&#32;3 

The use of fuel-cell technology in industrial and commercial applications is a relatively new development. Companies implementing such technology face competitors that integrate more traditional energy technologies into their product lines, as well as competitors that have implemented or are implementing alternatives to traditional energy technologies, such as lithium batteries, fuel additives and other high efficiency or &#8220;renewable&#8221; technologies. 

Cyclical Nature of Lift Truck Business 

The Company&#8217;s lift truck business historically has been cyclical. Fluctuations in the rate of orders for lift trucks and fuel-cell technology reflect the capital investment decisions of the Company&#8217;s customers, which depend to a certain extent on the general level of economic activity in the various industries the lift truck customers serve. During economic downturns, customers tend to delay new lift truck and parts purchases. Consequently, the Company has experienced, and in the future may continue to experience, significant fluctuations in its revenues and net income. 

Research and Development 

The Company&#8217;s lift truck research and development capability is organized around four major engineering centers, all coordinated on a global basis by the Company&#8217;s global executive administrative center. Products are designed for each brand concurrently and generally each center is focused on the global requirements for a single product line. The Company&#8217;s counterbalanced development center, which has global design responsibility for several classes of lift trucks for a highly diverse customer base, is located in Fairview, Oregon. The Company&#8217;s big truck development center is located in Nijmegen, the Netherlands, adjacent to a dedicated global big truck assembly facility. Big trucks are primarily used in handling shipping containers and other specialized heavy lifting applications, including steel, concrete and energy-related industries. Warehouse trucks, which are primarily used in distribution applications, are designed based on regional differences in stacking and storage practices. The Company designs warehouse equipment for sale in the Americas market in Greenville, North Carolina, adjacent to the Americas manufacturing and assembly facility. The Company designs warehouse equipment for the European market in Masate, Italy adjacent to its manufacturing and assembly facility for warehouse equipment. The Company also has an engineering Concept Center in the United Kingdom to support advanced design activities and an engineering office in India to support its global design activities for its four major engineering centers. 

The Company&#8217;s lift truck engineering centers utilize a three-dimensional CAD/CAM system and are interconnected, with all of the Company&#8217;s manufacturing and assembly facilities and certain suppliers. This allows for collaboration in technical engineering designs and collaboration with these suppliers. Additionally, the Company solicits customer feedback throughout the design phase to improve product development efforts. The Company invested $69.1 million, $71.4 million &#32;and $69.2 million &#32;on lift truck product design and development activities in 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. 

Nuvera has two research and development locations. In the U.S., Billerica, Massachusetts is the primary location for design, development and testing of all of Nuvera&#8217;s technologies, including the generation, compression, storage and dispensing of hydrogen, in addition to fuel cells. In Europe, the operations at San Donato, Italy are primarily focused on fuel-cell systems integration and testing. The Company invested $19.2 million on product design and development activities at Nuvera in 2015. 

Sumitomo-NACCO Joint Venture 

The Company has a 50% ownership interest in Sumitomo-NACCO Materials Handling Group, Ltd. (&#8220;SN&#8221;), a limited liability company that was formed in 1970 primarily to manufacture and distribute Sumitomo-branded lift trucks in Japan and export Hyster &#174; - and Yale &#174; -branded lift trucks and related components and service parts outside of Japan. Sumitomo Heavy Industries, Ltd. owns the remaining 50% interest in SN. Each stockholder of SN is entitled to appoint directors representing 50% of the vote of SN&#8217;s board of directors. All matters related to policies and programs of operation, manufacturing and sales activities require mutual agreement between the Company and Sumitomo Heavy Industries, Ltd. prior to a vote of SN&#8217;s board of directors. As a result, the Company accounts for its ownership in SN using the equity method of accounting. The Company purchases Hyster &#174; - and Yale &#174; -branded lift trucks and related component and aftermarket parts from SN for sale outside of Japan under agreed-upon terms. The Company also contracts with SN for engineering design services on a cost plus basis and charges SN for technology used by SN but developed by the Company. During 2015 , SN sold more than 4,700 lift trucks. 

Employees 

As of January 31, 2016 , the Company had approximately 5,500 employees. Certain employees in the Danville, Illinois parts depot operations are unionized. The Company&#8217;s contract with the Danville union expires in June 2018. Employees at the facilities in Berea, Kentucky; Sulligent, Alabama; and Greenville, North Carolina are not represented by unions. In Brazil, all employees are represented by a union. The Company&#8217;s contracts with the Brazilian unions expire annually at which time salaries and certain benefits are negotiated for the following year. In Mexico, certain employees are unionized. The Company&#8217;s 

&#32;4 

contract with the Mexico union expires annually in March, at which time salaries are negotiated for the following year. Benefits in Mexico are negotiated every other year. 

In Europe, certain employees in the Craigavon, Northern Ireland; Masate, Italy; San Donato, Italy; and Nijmegen, the Netherlands facilities are unionized. All of the European employees are part of works councils that perform a consultative role on business and employment matters. 

The Company believes its current labor relations with both union and non-union employees are generally satisfactory. However, there can be no assurances that the Company will be able to successfully renegotiate its union contracts without work stoppages or on acceptable terms. A prolonged work stoppage at a unionized facility could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business and results of operations. 

Environmental Matters 

The Company&#8217;s manufacturing operations are subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing the management and disposal of hazardous substances. The Company&#8217;s policies stress compliance, and the Company believes it is currently in substantial compliance with existing environmental laws. If the Company fails to comply with these laws or its environmental permits, it could incur significant costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil and criminal sanctions. In addition, future changes to environmental laws could require the Company to incur significant additional expense or restrict operations. Based on current information, the Company does not expect compliance with environmental requirements to have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s financial condition or results of operations. 

The Company&#8217;s products may also be subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing vehicle exhaust. Regulatory agencies in the United States and Europe have issued or proposed various regulations and directives designed to reduce emissions from spark-ignited engines and diesel engines used in off-road vehicles, such as industrial lift trucks. These regulations require the Company and other lift truck manufacturers to incur costs to modify designs and manufacturing processes and to perform additional testing and reporting. While there can be no assurance, the Company believes the impact of the additional expenditures to comply with these requirements will not have a material adverse effect on its business. 

The Company is investigating or remediating historical contamination at some current and former sites caused by its operations or those of businesses it acquired. While the Company is not currently aware that any material outstanding claims or obligations exist with regard to these sites, the discovery of additional contamination at these or other sites could result in significant cleanup costs that could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s financial conditions and results of operations. 

In connection with any acquisition made by the Company, the Company could, under some circumstances, be held financially liable for or suffer other adverse effects due to environmental violations or contamination caused by prior owners of businesses the Company has acquired. In addition, under some of the agreements through which the Company has sold businesses or assets, the Company has retained responsibility for certain contingent environmental liabilities arising from pre-closing operations. These liabilities may not arise, if at all, until years later and could require the Company to incur significant additional expenses. 

Government and Trade Regulations 

In the past, the Company&#8217;s business has been affected by trade disputes between the United States and Europe. In the future, to the extent the Company is affected by trade disputes and increased tariffs are levied on its goods, its results of operations may be materially adversely affected.
