 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Overview 

Founded in 1975 with a single truck, Casella Waste Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and certain partially owned entities over which it has a controlling financial interest (collectively, &#147;we&#148;, &#147;us&#148; or &#147;our&#148;), is a regional, vertically-integrated solid waste services company. We provide resource management expertise and services to residential, commercial, 

&#160;

municipal and industrial customers, primarily in the areas of solid waste collection and disposal, transfer, recycling and organics services. We provide integrated solid waste services in six states: Vermont, New Hampshire, New York, Massachusetts, Maine and Pennsylvania, with our headquarters located in Rutland, Vermont. We manage our solid waste operations on a geographic basis through two regional operating segments, the Eastern and Western regions, each of which provides a full range of solid waste services, and our larger-scale recycling and commodity brokerage operations through our Recycling segment. Organics services, ancillary operations, industrial services, discontinued operations, and earnings from equity method investees, as applicable, are included in our Other segment. 

As of January 29, 2016, we owned and/or operated 34 solid waste collection operations, 44 transfer stations, 18 recycling facilities, nine Subtitle D landfills, four landfill gas-to-energy facilities and one landfill permitted to accept construction and demolition (&#147;C&#38;D&#148;) materials. 

Change in Fiscal Year 

In June 2014, we elected to change our fiscal year-end from April 30 th to December 31 st . This change in fiscal year became effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2015 and ended December 31, 2015. As a result of this change, we filed a Transition Report on Form 10-KT for the eight-month transition period ended December 31, 2014. The references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to the terms listed below reflect the respective period noted (all other reporting periods defined separately): 

&#160;

Our goal is to build a sustainable and profitable company by providing exemplary service to our customers, while operating safe and environmentally sound facilities. Over the last several years, many of our customers have been seeking to reduce their environmental footprint by increasing their recycling rates, diverting organics materials out of the waste stream into beneficial use processes and exploring emerging methods to transform traditional waste streams into renewable resources. Since we first began operating in Vermont in 1975, our business strategy has been firmly tied to creating a sustainable resource management model and we continue to be rooted in these same tenets today. We strive to create long-term value for all of our stakeholders, including customers, employees, communities and shareholders. 

Our primary objective is to maximize long-term shareholder value through a combination of financial performance and strategic asset positioning. Annually, we complete a comprehensive strategic planning process to assess and refine our strategic objectives in the context of our asset mix and the current market environment. This process helps the management team allocate resources to a range of business opportunities in order to strive to maximize long-term financial returns and competitive positioning. 

Over the last three years we have made significant progress in simplifying our business structure, improving cash flows and reducing risk exposure by divesting and closing underperforming operations that did not enhance or complement our core operations. Specifically, we have had success over the last three years improving our financial performance and driving positive cash flows by advancing efforts in four key areas: (1) increasing landfill returns; (2) driving additional profitability at collection operations; (3) creating incremental value through resource solutions; and (4) improving our balance sheet and reducing business risk. We plan to continue to focus our efforts in these areas in the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016. To support our efforts, we continue to invest in our employees through leadership development, technical training, and incentive compensation structures that seek to align our employees&#146; incentives with our long-term goal to improve returns on invested capital. 

Increasing landfill returns 

We launched a strategic initiative in fiscal year 2014 to source incremental waste volumes to our landfills to maximize annual capacity utilization and increase cash flows. Our goal was to increase waste volumes by 0.5 million tons annually to our landfills by the end of fiscal year 2015. As of December 31, 2015, we had exceeded this goal, with overall landfill volumes for fiscal year 2015 up by approximately 0.8 million tons per year compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2012, excluding volumes from the Worcester landfill closure project in Massachusetts. 

&#160;

Landfill waste volume increases have been primarily driven by: (1) our success in acquiring new transfer station and hauling customers; (2) increasing waste volumes at our Southbridge landfill (&#147;Southbridge&#148;) in Southbridge, Massachusetts and our Waste USA landfill (&#147;Waste USA&#148;) in Coventry, Vermont, in accordance with increased annual permit limits; (3) increasing C&#38;D volumes as the construction market began to slowly rebound across several of our market areas; (4) our focused landfill sales strategy, which included the revamping of our special waste team to focus on sourcing additional industrial and remediation waste volumes; and (5) our asset positioning in several key markets that have contracting permitted capacity. 

Disposal market dynamics have quickly shifted across our footprint due to improving macroeconomic conditions and a challenging regulatory environment for new disposal capacity. In total, facilities that we estimate had approximately 1.7 million tons of annual disposal capacity have permanently closed in Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont over the last two years, and we expect that facilities with another 1.2 million tons of additional annual capacity will permanently close over the next several years. These closures and expected closures represent a reduction of over 20% of total market capacity across these states. Furthermore, we expect that waste flow shifts in New York State and additional facility closures in contiguous markets will keep more waste volumes in the market for ultimate disposal over the next 20 years, further tightening available market capacity. 

Given this backdrop, we shifted our landfill strategy in transition period 2014 to balance sourcing additional volumes against improving pricing and returns at our landfills. While we believe it will take several years for the capacity constraints in our markets to become acute, we experienced tightening pricing elasticity in our markets over the last year, which has enabled us to begin increasing disposal prices in excess of the Consumer Price Index in several of our markets. In fiscal year 2015, our average price per ton at our landfills was up 3.7% over the prior period as we increased tipping fees and improved the mix of materials. 

We continue to work on strategies to source additional waste volumes to our landfills by increasing our geographic reach through the use of rail transportation and accessing new end-markets. 

Driving additional profitability at collection operations 

Over the last three years we have developed and implemented a number of programs designed to improve profitability and returns in the collection line-of-business, including: pricing yield analytics; new sales force incentives; route profitability analytics; on-route sales and marketing initiatives; a comprehensive fleet strategy; and selling or swapping underperforming routes or operations. 

Our local collection teams have moved pricing from an annual process to a core process that is continually reviewed and adjusted throughout the year. Our division management and sales teams use our customer profitability analytics tool to calculate customer level profitability and increase pricing, where appropriate, to offset cost increases. We continue to yield success from our collection pricing programs, with commercial and residential collection price growth of 4.5% in fiscal year 2015. 

We attempt to offset core inflationary pressures on an ongoing basis. In fiscal year 2015, we implemented the Sustainability Recycling Adjustment fee (&#147;SRA fee&#148;) to dynamically adjust residential and commercial collection pricing for monthly changes in recycling commodity prices. The SRA fee has been well received by our customers and is helping to offset significant commodity price headwinds. 

During fiscal year 2014, we adjusted our sales force incentive compensation program to better support our efforts to drive responsibility to the local operating level. We introduced a uniform commission structure tracking and payment system to help our local teams administer customized commission structures for each sales representative, while maintaining a consistent system to track performance. 

Collection routes are the basic building blocks of our solid waste business and we believe that it is imperative that we seek to ensure that each route is profitable and covers the cost of truck and container capital. In order to achieve this goal we developed and implemented a route profitability tool to help our operating teams analyze and improve their routing productivity and profitability. With the help of this tool, we increased the frequency of re-routing existing customers to improve efficiencies and take trucks off the road. In addition, we routinely evaluate on an account-by-account basis existing customer service levels, service types, equipment selection and truck type selection to seek to ensure that we are maximizing profitability and asset utilization. To further improve route density, we focus our marketing and sales efforts on existing routes. 

&#160;

To augment our operating efforts, we implemented a comprehensive fleet plan during transition period 2014 to define our fleet standards and specifically target truck replacements to maximize returns. We believe that this plan will help us to reduce our operating costs and improve our capital efficiency by reducing downtime and maintenance costs and improving service levels. 

Differentiating business with resource solutions 

To complement our traditional solid waste offerings, we have developed a set of resource solutions and invested in select assets that are intended to enhance our ability to support emerging customer and market needs. Our resource solutions strategy seeks to leverage our core competencies across our operating segments in materials processing, industrial recycling, clean energy, and organics service offerings in order to generate additional value from the waste stream for our customers. In fiscal year 2015, 25.4% of our revenues were generated by our Recycling, Customer Solutions and Organics businesses in the aggregate. 

For nearly 40 years, we have been a leader in providing recycling services to our customers. We currently own or operate six material recovery facilities (&#147;MRFs&#148;) that use our Zero-Sort Recycling process, which we own or operate under long-term operating agreements. With Zero-Sort Recycling, customers can commingle all of their recyclables (paper, cardboard, plastics, metals, and glass) into a single, right-sized residential or commercial container. By making it easier for a customer to recycle, we have increased recycling participation and yields, thereby increasing volumes through our MRFs and enhancing asset utilization. 

The average mix of recycling commodities generated by residential and commercial customers has historically sold at an average price that covered the cost of processing the materials, including an adequate return on the processing equipment, facilities, and rolling stock necessary to process the recyclables. Since 2011, recycling commodity prices have declined by approximately 60% to historically low levels as global demand for fiber and metal materials has significantly dropped and plastics pricing has declined with lower crude oil pricing. Roughly half of this decline in recycling commodity pricing has occurred since the beginning of fiscal year 2015. 

At current recycling commodity pricing levels, we are not generating adequate revenue from the sale of these commodities to cover the cost of processing the materials or generating a positive return on our investment in recycling infrastructure. In order to continue to provide these necessary services to our residential, commercial, municipal, and industrial customers, we have readdressed our pricing model for these services by introducing the SRA fee in fiscal year 2015. 

Our Customer Solutions business works with our industrial services, including multi-location customers, colleges and universities, municipalities, and industrial customers to develop customized comprehensive solid waste solutions. The focus of this group is to help these large scale organizations achieve waste reduction and diversion goals to meet their economic and environmental objectives. We believe that we differentiate our services from our competitors by providing a personalized set of resource solutions, which enables us to win new business, including traditional solid waste collection and disposal customers. 

Our Organics business provides transportation, disposal and resource solutions to waste water treatment facilities across the northeast. In fiscal year 2015, our operations managed approximately 0.7 million tons of biosolids, with 0.2 million tons of this material internalized to our landfills and 0.4 million tons transformed into renewable products for fertilization and landscaping. In addition, our Organics group has been working to develop and/or partner with firms that have developed innovative approaches to deriving incremental value from source separated organics to comply with emerging waste regulations. 

Improving our balance sheet and reducing business risk 

We believe we are making excellent progress improving our balance sheet and reducing operational and financial risk. One of the key pillars of this initiative is our Enterprise Risk Management (&#147;ERM&#148;) program that helps us to more effectively identify and mitigate risk throughout all aspects of our business. This program has helped us to prioritize and focus resources on mitigating key risk areas. 

During fiscal year 2015, our financial strategy was focused on maximizing cash flows to permanently retire indebtedness and refinancing near term debt maturities to reduce financing risks. We made significant progress in each area during fiscal year 2015 as we completed the refinancing of our senior revolving credit and letter of credit facility that was due March 2016 (&#147;Senior Credit Facility&#148;) with our new senior secured asset-based revolving credit and letter of credit facility due February 2020 (&#147;ABL Facility&#148;) in February 2015 and paid down our long-term debt by $15.8 million, decreasing our consolidated leverage ratio under our ABL Facility to 4.75 as of December 31, 2015 from 5.43 as of March 31, 2015. The ABL Facility allowed us to move out a key maturity date, while increasing our financial flexibility. We were able to take advantage of this additional flexibility during fiscal year 2015 by using excess cash flows to buy-back on the open market and permanently retire $14.7 million of our 7.75% senior subordinated notes due February 2019 (&#147;2019 Notes&#148;). The retirement of this portion of the 2019 Notes is expected to save us $1.1 million of annual cash interest expense. 

&#160;

Over the last three years we have made significant progress in simplifying our business structure, improving cash flows and reducing risk exposure by divesting and closing underperforming operations that did not enhance or complement our core operations. These actions included: (1) the divestiture of Maine Energy Recovery Company, LP (&#147;Maine Energy&#148;), a low margin, negative cash flow waste-to-energy operation, in fiscal year 2013; (2) the divestiture of KTI BioFuels, Inc. (&#147;BioFuels&#148;), a low margin, negative cash flow C&#38;D processing facility, in fiscal year 2014; (3) the sale of our 50% equity interest in US GreenFiber LLC (&#147;GreenFiber&#148;), a negative cash flow cellulose insulation joint-venture, in fiscal year 2014; (4) the wind down of Casella-Altela Regional Environmental Services, LLC (&#147;CARES&#148;) through the disposal of the remaining assets of CARES in fiscal year 2015, in which we held a 51% membership interest; and (5) the sale of select low-margin collection routes in fiscal year 2015. 

We believe that we are well-positioned for the future and remain strongly committed to a disciplined capital investment strategy, with excess cash flow expected to be primarily used to repay indebtedness. Further, we plan to continue our efforts to actively review our business portfolio for opportunities to improve financial performance by swapping or selling under-performing operations or making selective tuck-in acquisitions to improve route density or internalization. 

Operational Overview 

Our solid waste and recycling operations comprise a full range of non-hazardous solid waste, services, including collections, transfer stations, MRFs and disposal facilities. 

Collections. A majority of our commercial and industrial collection services are performed under one-to-five year service agreements, with prices and fees determined by such factors as: collection frequency; type of equipment and containers furnished; type, volume and weight of solid waste collected; distance to the disposal or processing facility; and cost of disposal or processing. Our residential collection and disposal services are performed either on a subscription basis (with no underlying contract) with individuals, or through contracts with municipalities, homeowner associations, apartment building owners or mobile home park operators. 

Transfer Stations. Our transfer stations receive, compact and transfer solid waste, collected primarily by our various residential and commercial collection operations, for transport to disposal facilities by larger vehicles. We believe that transfer stations benefit us by: (1) increasing the size of the wastesheds which have access to our landfills; (2) reducing costs by improving utilization of collection personnel and equipment; and (3) helping us build relationships with municipalities and other customers by providing a local physical presence and enhanced local service capabilities. 

Material Recovery Facilities. Our MRFs receive, sort, bale and sell recyclable materials originating from the municipal solid waste stream, including newsprint, cardboard, office paper, glass, plastic, steel or aluminum containers and bottles. We operate eight MRFs within our Recycling region in geographic areas served by our collection divisions. Revenues are received from municipalities and customers in the form of processing fees, tipping fees and commodity sales. These MRFs, three of which are located in New York, two of which are located in Vermont, two of which are located in Massachusetts, and one of which is located in Maine, are large-scale, high-volume facilities that process over 0.5 million tons per year of recycled materials delivered to them by municipalities and commercial customers under long-term contracts. We also operate smaller MRFs, which generally process recyclables collected from our various residential collection operations. 

Landfills. We operate nine solid waste Subtitle D landfills and one landfill permitted to accept C&#38;D materials. Revenues are received from municipalities and customers in the form of tipping fees. The estimated capacity at our landfills is subject to change based on engineering factors, requirements of regulatory authorities, our ability to continue to operate our landfills in compliance with applicable regulations and our ability to successfully renew operating permits and obtain expansion permits at our sites. The following table (in thousands) reflects the aggregate landfill capacity and airspace changes, in tons, for landfills we operated during fiscal year 2015, transition period 2014 and fiscal year 2014:

(1) We convert estimated remaining permitted capacity and estimated additional permittable capacity from cubic yards to tons generally by assuming a compaction factor equal to the historic average compaction factor applicable to the respective landfill over the last three fiscal years. In addition to a total capacity limit, certain permits place a daily and/or annual limit on capacity. (2) Represents capacity which we have determined to be &#147;permittable&#148; in accordance with the following criteria: (i) we control the land on which the expansion is sought; (ii) all technical siting criteria have been met or a variance has been obtained or is reasonably expected to be obtained; (iii) we have not identified any legal or political impediments which we believe will not be resolved in our favor; (iv) we are actively working on obtaining any necessary permits and we expect that all required permits will be received; and (v) senior management has approved the project. (3) The change in new expansions pursued airspace capacity in fiscal year 2015 and fiscal year 2014 relates to the determination of additional permittable airspace at our Southbridge and NCES landfills in the Eastern region and our Chemung landfill in the Western region. (4) The increase in remaining permitted airspace capacity in transition period 2014 was the result of a permit received at our NCES landfill. (5) The variation in changes in airspace capacity associated with engineering estimates in fiscal year 2015, transition period 2014 and fiscal year 2014 is primarily the result of changes in compaction at our landfills and estimated airspace changes associated with design changes at certain of our landfills. Eastern Region 

NCES. The North Country Environmental Services landfill (&#147;NCES&#148;) is a Subtitle D landfill located in Bethlehem, New Hampshire that we purchased in 1994. NCES currently consists of approximately 54 acres of landfill area, is permitted to accept municipal solid waste, C&#38;D material and certain pre-approved special waste and has no annual tonnage limitations. 

Juniper Ridge. The Juniper Ridge landfill (&#147;Juniper Ridge&#148;) is a Subtitle D landfill located in West Old Town, Maine. In 2004, we completed transactions with the State of Maine and Georgia-Pacific Corporation (&#147;Georgia Pacific&#148;), pursuant to which the State of Maine took ownership of Juniper Ridge, formerly owned by Georgia Pacific, and we became the operator under a 30-year operating and services agreement between us and the State of Maine. Juniper Ridge currently consists of approximately 179 acres of landfill area, which is sufficient to permit the additional airspace required for the term of the 30-year operating and services agreement, and is permitted to accept the following waste originating from the State of Maine: 0.1 million tons of municipal solid waste per year through March 2018, C&#38;D material, ash from municipal solid waste incinerators and fossil fuel boilers, front end processed residuals and bypass municipal solid waste from waste-to-energy facilities and certain pre-approved special waste. Outside of the limitations on municipal solid waste, there are no annual tonnage limitations at Juniper Ridge. In January 2015, we entered into an agreement with a third-party to develop and construct a 4.8 mW/hr landfill gas-to-energy plant that is expected to be completed during the fiscal year ending December 31, 2017, which will be owned and operated by this third-party. 

Southbridge. Southbridge is a Subtitle D landfill located in Southbridge, Massachusetts. In 2003, we acquired Southbridge Recycling and Disposal Park, Inc., which owns a recycling facility and has a contract with the Town of Southbridge, Massachusetts to operate Southbridge. Southbridge currently consists of approximately 95 acres of landfill area, and is permitted to accept 0.4 million tons of municipal solid waste, processed C&#38;D residual material and certain pre-approved special waste annually. The Southbridge site houses a landfill gas-to-energy plant, which is owned and operated by us, that has the capacity to generate 1.6 mW/hr of energy. 

Closure Projects. In 2005, we started closure operations at the Worcester, Massachusetts landfill (&#147;Worcester&#148;). These closure operations were completed in April 2014 when Worcester accepted its final tons of waste. We began final capping and closing Worcester in May 2014 and expect to be completed final capping and closing in the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016. Worcester is not included in the preceding table of landfill capacity. 

&#160;

In 2005, we entered into a 25-year operation, management and lease agreement for Chemung and certain other facilities with Chemung County. Chemung is strategically situated to accept long haul volume from both eastern and downstate New York markets. Chemung currently consists of approximately 126 acres of landfill area, which is sufficient to permit the additional airspace required for the term of the 25-year operation, management and lease agreement, and is permitted to accept 0.4 million tons of municipal solid waste and certain pre-approved special waste annually and eighty thousand tons of C&#38;D material annually. 

McKean. The McKean landfill (&#147;McKean&#148;) is a Subtitle D landfill located in Mount Jewett, Pennsylvania that we purchased in 2011 as part of a bankruptcy reorganization. McKean currently consists of approximately 256 acres of landfill area, and is permitted to accept one thousand tons of municipal solid waste, C&#38;D material and certain pre-approved special waste daily. In March, 2014, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania awarded a grant in the amount of $7.0 million to fund the construction of the rail siding at the landfill which if completed, would expand the market reach for the landfill to other rail capable transfer facilities. We have not yet committed to the construction of the rail siding pending a determination of the economic viability. We believe that the landfill is well situated to provide services to the oil and gas industry that explores natural gas in the Marcellus Shale of Pennsylvania in the form of disposal capacity for residual materials. 

Closed Landfills 

We also own and/or manage five unlined landfills and three lined landfills that are not currently in operation. We have closed and capped all of these landfills according to applicable environmental regulatory standards. 

Operating Segments 

We manage our solid waste operations, which include a full range of solid waste services, on a geographic basis through two regional operating segments, which we designate as the Eastern and Western regions. Our third operating segment is Recycling, which comprises our larger-scale recycling operations and our commodity brokerage operations. Organic services, ancillary operations, industrial services, discontinued operations and earnings from equity method investees, as applicable, are included in our &#147;Other&#148; segment. See Note 19, Segment Reporting to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary of revenues, certain expenses, profitability, capital expenditures, goodwill, and total assets of our operating segments. 

&#160;

Within each geographic region, we organize our solid waste services around smaller areas that we refer to as &#147;wastesheds.&#148; A wasteshed is an area that comprises the complete cycle of activities in the solid waste services process, from collection to transfer operations and recycling to disposal in landfills, some of which may be owned and or operated by third parties. We typically operate several divisions within each wasteshed, each of which provides a particular service, such as collection, recycling, disposal or transfer. Each division operates interdependently with the other divisions within the wasteshed. Each wasteshed generally operates autonomously from adjoining wastesheds. 

Through the eight MRFs and one commodity brokerage operation comprising the Recycling segment, Recycling provides services to our six anchor contracts, which have original terms ranging from five to twenty years and expire at various times through calendar year end 2028. The terms of each contract vary, but all of the contracts provide that the municipality or a third-party delivers materials to our facility. These contracts may include a minimum volume guarantee by the municipality. We also have service agreements with individual towns and cities and commercial customers, including small solid waste companies and major competitors that do not have processing capacity within a specific geographic region. 

The following table provides information about each operating segment (as of January 29, 2016 except revenue information, which is for fiscal year 2015):

Eastern region 

The Eastern region consists of wastesheds located in Maine, northern, central and southeastern New Hampshire and central and eastern Massachusetts. The Eastern region is vertically integrated, with transfer, landfill, processing and recycling assets serviced by our collection operations. In February 2013, we aligned management of NCES with the Eastern region. NCES had been historically aligned with the Western region. This move, combined with the permitting approvals at Southbridge, the opening of our transfer station in Westbrook, Maine, and the divestiture of Maine Energy, has helped reduce our overall reliance on waste-to-energy disposal capacity. Our December 2012 acquisition of Bestway Disposal Services and BBI Waste Services (&#147;BBI&#148;) strengthened both our collection and transfer network in New Hampshire and Maine by adding three collection operations and four, either owned or operated, transfer stations, and contributing additional internalized solid waste and recycling volumes to our disposal facilities. In August 2013, we divested of our BioFuels C&#38;D processing facility in Lewiston, Maine, allowing us to focus on our higher margin core businesses. 

We entered the Maine market in 1996 and have grown organically and through small acquisitions transacted in the late 1990&#146;s and early 2000&#146;s. In 2004, we obtained the right to operate Juniper Ridge under a 30-year agreement with the State of Maine. In December 2012, we acquired BBI, which gave us additional hauling and transfer capacity in southern Maine. 

We entered the southern New Hampshire market in 1999 and the eastern Massachusetts market in 2000 and since have grown organically and through small acquisitions. In this market, we rely to a large extent on third-party disposal capacity, but NCES and other assets have provided additional opportunities to internalize volumes. We believe that we can continue to increase internalization rates in eastern Massachusetts as well with the increased capacity at Southbridge. In December 2013, we acquired a transfer station in Oxford, Massachusetts, allowing greater operational flexibility for our solid waste and recycling collection operations. The facility is permitted to accept 650 tons per day and provides a source of volume for Southbridge. 

&#160;

Western region 

The Western region includes wastesheds located in Vermont, southwestern New Hampshire and eastern and upstate New York. The portion of eastern New York served by the Western region includes Clinton (operation of Clinton County), Franklin, Essex, Warren, Washington, Saratoga, Rennselaer and Albany counties. 

The Western region also consists of wastesheds in upstate New York, which includes Ithaca, Elmira, Oneonta, Lowville, Potsdam, Geneva, Auburn, Dunkirk, Jamestown and Olean counties. We entered these wastesheds in 1997 and have expanded primarily through tuck-in acquisitions and organic growth. Our Western region collection operations include leadership positions in nearly every rural market outside of the larger metropolitan markets such as Syracuse, Rochester, Buffalo and Albany. 

We remain focused on increasing our vertical integration in the Western region through extension of our reach into new markets and managing new materials. We believe that maximizing these logistics through the use of rail, if implemented, long haul trucks and trailer tippers at our facilities will increase our reach. 

Recycling 

Our Recycling segment is one of the largest processors and marketers of recycled materials in the northeastern United States, comprised of eight MRFs that process and market recyclable materials that municipalities and commercial customers deliver under long-term contracts. Two of the eight MRFs are leased, three are owned, and three are operated by us under contracts with third-parties. In fiscal year 2015, the Recycling segment processed and/or marketed over 0.5 million tons of recyclable materials including tons marketed through our commodity brokerage division and our baling facilities located throughout our footprint. Recycling&#146;s facilities are located in Vermont, New York, Maine, and Massachusetts. 

A significant portion of the material provided to Recycling is delivered pursuant to six anchor contracts. The anchor contracts have an original term of five to twenty years and expire at various times through 2028. The terms of the recycling contracts vary, but all of the contracts provide that the municipality or a third-party delivers the recycled materials to our facility. Under the recycling contracts, we charge the municipality a fee for each ton of material delivered to us. Some contracts contain revenue sharing arrangements under which the municipality receives a specified percentage of our revenues from the sale of the recovered materials. 

Our Recycling segment derives a significant portion of its revenues from the sale of recyclable materials. Since purchase and sale prices of recyclable materials, particularly newspaper, corrugated containers, plastics, ferrous and aluminum, can fluctuate based upon market conditions, we use long-term supply contracts with customers to reduce commodity risk. Under such contracts, we obtain a guaranteed minimum price for the recyclable materials along with a commitment to receive higher prices if the current market price rises. The contracts are generally with large domestic companies that use the recyclable materials in their manufacturing process, such as paper, packaging and consumer goods companies. In fiscal year 2015, 31.4% of the revenues from the sale of residential recyclable materials were derived from sales under long-term contracts which may include floor prices. At times, we also hedge against fluctuations in the commodity prices of recycled paper and corrugated containers in order to mitigate the variability in cash flows and earnings generated from the sales of recycled materials at floating prices. As of December 31, 2015, no such commodity hedges were in place. 

Other 

Our Other segment derives a significant portion of its revenues from our Customer Solutions and Organics businesses. Our resource solutions strategy seeks to leverage our core competencies in materials processing, industrial recycling, clean energy, and organics service offerings in order to generate additional value from the waste stream for our customers. Our Customer Solutions business works with industrial services (including multi-location customers, colleges and universities, municipalities, and industrial customers) to develop customized solid waste solutions. The focus of this business is to help these large scale organizations achieve waste reduction and diversion goals to meet their economic and environmental objectives. We differentiate our services from our competitors by providing a customized set of comprehensive resource solutions, which enables us to win new business, including traditional solid waste collection and disposal customers. 

Our Organics business has been working to develop and/or partner with firms that have developed innovative approaches to deriving incremental value from the organic portion of the waste stream. Through our Earthlife &#174; soils products, we offer a wide array of organic fertilizers, composts, and mulches that help our customers recycle organic waste streams. We also have an ownership interest 

&#160;

in AGreen Energy, LLC (&#147;AGreen&#148;) and BGreen Energy, LLC (&#147;BGreen&#148;), which we account for as cost method investments, that partners with other capital investors to build farm-based anaerobic digesters in the Northeast to generate electricity from farm and food waste streams. 

Casella-Altela Regional Environmental Services, LLC 

CARES is a joint venture that owned and operated a water and leachate treatment facility for the natural gas drilling industry in Pennsylvania. Our joint venture partner in CARES is Altela, Inc. (&#147;Altela&#148;). In fiscal year 2014, we determined that assets of the CARES water treatment facility were no longer operational or were not operating within product performance parameters. As a result, we initiated a plan to abandon and shut down the operations of CARES. It was determined that the carrying value of the assets of CARES was no longer recoverable and, as a result, the carrying value of the asset group was assessed for impairment and impaired. As a result, we recorded an impairment charge of $7.5 million in fiscal year 2014 to the asset group of CARES in the Western region. 

We executed a purchase and sale agreement in fiscal year 2015 pursuant to which we and Altela agreed to sell certain assets of the CARES water treatment facility to a third-party. We sold these assets of CARES for purchase consideration of $3.5 million, resulting in a gain of $2.9 million in fiscal year 2015, 49% of which was attributable to Altela, the noncontrolling interest holder. As of December 31, 2015, we continued to pursue the dissolution of CARES in accordance with the CARES agreement. 

In connection with this transaction, we also sold certain of our equipment and real estate to the same third-party for total consideration of $1.1 million, resulting in a gain of $0.9 million in fiscal year 2015. As of December 31, 2015, our ownership interest in CARES is 51%. In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) Accounting Standards Codification (&#147;ASC&#148;) 810-10-15, we consolidate the assets, liabilities, noncontrolling interest and results of operations of CARES into our consolidated financial statements due to our controlling financial interest in the joint venture. 

Equity Method Investments 

In the fiscal year 2014, we sold our 50% membership interest in GreenFiber and purchased the remaining 50% membership of Tompkins County Recycling LLC (&#147;Tompkins&#148;), both of which were previously accounted for using the equity method of accounting. 

GreenFiber. In fiscal year 2014, we and Louisiana Pacific Corporation (&#147;LP&#148;) executed a purchase and sale agreement with a limited liability company formed by Tenex Capital Partners, L.P., pursuant to which we and LP agreed to sell our membership interests in GreenFiber for total cash consideration of $18.0 million plus an expected working capital true-up less any indebtedness and other unpaid transaction costs of GreenFiber as of the closing date. The transaction was completed for $19.2 million in gross cash proceeds, including a $1.2 million working capital adjustment. After netting indebtedness of GreenFiber and transaction costs, our 50% of the net cash proceeds amounted to $3.4 million. After considering the $0.6 million impact of our unrealized losses relating to derivative instruments in accumulated other comprehensive income on our investment in GreenFiber, we recorded a gain on sale of equity method investment of $0.6 million in fiscal year 2014. 

Tompkins. Also in fiscal year 2014, we purchased the remaining 50% membership interest of Tompkins for total cash consideration of $0.4 million. The acquisition-date fair value of our investment in Tompkins, which was determined using the cost approach based on an assessment of the price to purchase the acquired assets of Tompkins prior to the acquisition date, was $0.3 million. We recognized a gain of $0.1 million in fiscal year 2014 through loss from equity method investments due to the remeasurement. As a result of the purchase, we began including the accounts of Tompkins in our consolidated financial statements. 

Competition 

The solid waste services industry is highly competitive. We compete for collection and disposal volume primarily on the basis of the quality, breadth and price of our services. From time to time, competitors may reduce the price of their services in an effort to expand market share or to win a competitively bid municipal contract. These practices may also lead to reduced pricing for our services or the loss of business. In addition, competition exists within the industry for potential acquisition candidates. 

The larger urban markets in which we compete are served by one or more of the large national solid waste companies, including Waste Management, Inc., Republic Services, Inc. and Waste Connections, Inc., that may be able to achieve greater economies of scale than we can. We also compete with a number of regional and local companies that offer competitive prices and quality service. In addition, we compete with operators of alternative disposal facilities, including incinerators, and with certain municipalities, counties and districts that operate their own solid waste collection and disposal facilities. Public sector facilities may have certain advantages over us due to the availability of user fees, charges or tax revenues and tax-exempt financing. 

&#160;

Marketing and Sales 

We have fully integrated sales and marketing strategies with a primary focus on acquiring and retaining commercial, industrial, municipal and residential customers. Our business strategy focuses on creating a highly differentiated sustainable resource management model that meets customers&#146; unique needs and provides value &#147;beyond the curb&#148;. 

Maintenance of a local presence and identity is an important aspect of our sales and marketing strategy, and many of our divisional managers are involved in local governmental, civic and business organizations. Our name and logo, or, where appropriate, that of our divisional operations, are displayed on all of our containers and trucks. We attend and make presentations at municipal and state meetings, and we advertise in a variety of media throughout our service footprint. 

The Customer Solutions business serves customers with multiple locations and is also focused on growing our share of business with municipal, institutional and industrial customers. This group provides customers with a broader set of solutions to augment our regional and divisional service capabilities. 

Marketing activities are focused on attracting new commercial and residential customers directly on-route in order to enhance profitability. Marketing campaigns are integrated with divisional management, sales personnel and the centralized customer care center. 

Employees 

As of January 29, 2016, we employed approximately 1,900 people, including approximately 400 professionals or managers, sales, clerical, information systems or other administrative employees and approximately 1,500 employees involved in collection, transfer, disposal, recycling or other operations. Approximately 80 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe relations with our employees are good. 

Risk Management, Insurance and Performance or Surety Bonds 

We actively maintain environmental and other risk management programs that we believe are appropriate for our business. Our environmental risk management program includes evaluating existing facilities, as well as potential acquisitions, for compliance with environmental law requirements. We also maintain a worker safety program, which focuses on safe practices in the workplace. Operating practices at all of our operations are intended to reduce the possibility of environmental contamination, enforcement actions and litigation. 

We carry a range of insurance intended to protect our assets and operations, including a commercial general liability policy and a property damage policy. A partially or completely uninsured claim against us (including liabilities associated with cleanup or remediation at our facilities), if successful and of sufficient magnitude, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any future difficulty in obtaining insurance could also impair our ability to secure future contracts, which may be conditioned upon the availability of adequate insurance coverage. 

We self-insure for automobile and workers&#146; compensation coverage with reinsurance coverage limiting our maximum exposure. Our maximum exposure in fiscal year 2015 under the workers&#146; compensation plan was $1.0 million per individual event. Our maximum exposure in fiscal year 2015 under the automobile plan was $1.2 million per individual event. 

Municipal solid waste collection contracts and landfill closure and post-closure obligations may require performance or surety bonds, letters of credit or other means of financial assurance to secure contractual performance. While we have not experienced difficulty in obtaining these financial instruments, if we are unable to obtain these financial instruments in sufficient amounts or at acceptable rates we could be precluded from entering into additional municipal contracts or obtaining or retaining landfill operating permits. 

We hold a 19.9% ownership interest in Evergreen National Indemnity Company (&#147;Evergreen&#148;), a surety company which provides surety bonds to secure our contractual obligations for certain municipal solid waste collection contracts and landfill closure and post-closure obligations. Our ownership interest in Evergreen is pledged to Evergreen as security for our obligations under the bonds they provide on our behalf. 

&#160;

Customers 

We provide our collection services to commercial, institutional, industrial and residential customers. A majority of our commercial and industrial collection services are performed under one-to-five year service agreements, and fees are determined by such factors as: professional or management services required; collection frequency; type of equipment and containers furnished; the type, volume and weight of the solid waste collected; the distance to the disposal or processing facility; and the cost of disposal or processing. Our residential collection and disposal services are performed either on a subscription basis (with no underlying contract) with individuals, or through contracts with municipalities, homeowners associations, apartment owners or mobile home park operators. 

Our Recycling segment provides recycling services to municipalities, commercial haulers and commercial waste generators within the geographic proximity of the processing facilities. 

Seasonality and Severe Weather 

Our transfer and disposal revenues historically have been higher in the late spring, summer and early fall months. This seasonality reflects lower volumes of waste in the late fall, winter and early spring months because: 

&#160;

&#149; &#160; the volume of waste relating to C&#38;D activities decreases substantially during the winter months in the northeastern United States; and &#160;

&#149; &#160; decreased tourism in Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine and eastern New York during the winter months tends to lower the volume of waste generated by commercial and restaurant customers, which is partially offset by increased volume from the ski industry. Because certain of our operating and fixed costs remain constant throughout the fiscal year, operating income is therefore impacted by a similar seasonality. Our operations can also be adversely affected by periods of inclement or severe weather, which could increase our operating costs associated with the collection and disposal of waste, delay the collection and disposal of waste, reduce the volume of waste delivered to our disposal sites, increase the volume of waste collected under our existing contracts (without corresponding compensation), decrease the throughput and operating efficiency of our materials recycling facilities, or delay construction or expansion of our landfill sites and other facilities. Our operations can also be favorably affected by severe weather, which could increase the volume of waste in situations where we are able to charge for our additional services provided. 

Our Recycling segment experiences increased volumes of fiber in November and December due to increased newspaper advertising and retail activity during the holiday season. 

Regulation 

Introduction 

We are subject to extensive and evolving federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations which have become increasingly stringent in recent years. The environmental regulations affecting us are administered by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (&#147;EPA&#148;) and other federal, state and local environmental, zoning, health and safety agencies. Failure to comply with such requirements could result in substantial costs, including civil and criminal fines and penalties. Except as described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that we are currently in substantial compliance with applicable federal, state and local environmental laws, permits, orders and regulations. Other than as disclosed herein, we do not currently anticipate any material costs to bring our operations into environmental compliance, although there can be no assurance in this regard for the future. We expect that our operations in the solid waste services industry will be subject to continued and increased regulation, legislation and enforcement actions. We attempt to anticipate future legal and regulatory requirements and to keep our operations in compliance with those requirements. 

In order to transport, process, or dispose of solid waste, it is necessary for us to possess and comply with one or more permits from federal, state and/or local agencies. We must renew these permits periodically, and the permits may be modified or revoked by the issuing agency. 

&#160;

The principal federal statutes and regulations applicable to our operations are as follows: 

The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended (&#147;RCRA&#148;) 

The RCRA regulates the generation, treatment, storage, handling, transportation and disposal of solid waste and requires states to develop programs to ensure the safe disposal of solid waste. The RCRA divides waste into two categories, hazardous and non-hazardous. Wastes are generally classified as hazardous if they either (a) are specifically included on a list of hazardous wastes, or (b) exhibit certain characteristics defined as hazardous and are not specifically designated as non-hazardous. Wastes classified as hazardous waste are subject to more extensive regulation than wastes classified as non-hazardous, and businesses that deal with hazardous waste are subject to regulatory obligations in addition to those imposed on businesses that deal with non-hazardous waste. 

Among the wastes that are specifically designated as non-hazardous are household waste and &#147;special&#148; waste, including items such as petroleum contaminated soils, asbestos, foundry sand, shredder fluff and most non-hazardous industrial waste products. 

The EPA regulations issued under Subtitle C of the RCRA impose a comprehensive &#147;cradle to grave&#148; system for tracking the generation, transportation, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous wastes. Subtitle C regulations impose obligations on generators, transporters and disposers of hazardous wastes, and require permits that are costly to obtain and maintain for sites where those businesses treat, store or dispose of such material. Subtitle C requirements include detailed operating, inspection, training and emergency preparedness and response standards, as well as requirements for manifesting, record keeping and reporting, corrective action, facility closure, post-closure and financial responsibility. Most states have promulgated regulations modeled on some or all of the Subtitle C provisions issued by the EPA, and in many instances the EPA has delegated to those states the principal role in regulating businesses which are subject to those requirements. Some state regulations impose obligations different from and in addition to those the EPA imposes under Subtitle C. 

Leachate generated at our landfills and transfer stations is tested on a regular basis, and generally is not regulated as a hazardous waste under federal law. However, there is no guarantee that leachate generated from our facilities in the future will not be classified as hazardous waste. 

In October 1991, the EPA adopted the Subtitle D regulations under RCRA governing solid waste landfills. The Subtitle D regulations, which generally became effective in October 1993, include siting restrictions, facility design standards, operating criteria, closure and post-closure requirements, financial assurance requirements, groundwater monitoring requirements, groundwater remediation standards and corrective action requirements. In addition, the Subtitle D regulations require that new landfill sites meet more stringent liner design criteria (typically, composite soil and synthetic liners or two or more synthetic liners) intended to keep leachate out of groundwater and have extensive collection systems to carry away leachate for treatment prior to disposal. Regulations generally require us to install groundwater monitoring wells at virtually all landfills we operate, to monitor groundwater quality and, indirectly, the effectiveness of the leachate collection systems. The Subtitle D regulations also require facility owners or operators to control emissions of landfill gas (including methane) generated at landfills exceeding certain regulatory thresholds. State landfill regulations must meet those requirements or the EPA will impose such requirements upon landfill owners and operators in that state. 

The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, as amended (&#147;Clean Water Act&#148;) 

The Clean Water Act regulates the discharge of pollutants into the &#147;waters of the United States&#148; from a variety of sources, including solid waste disposal sites and transfer stations, processing facilities and waste-to-energy facilities (collectively, &#147;solid waste management facilities&#148;). If run-off, treated leachate from our solid waste management facilities is discharged into streams, rivers or other surface waters, the Clean Water Act would require us to apply for and obtain a discharge permit, conduct sampling and monitoring and, under certain circumstances, reduce the quantity of pollutants in such discharge. A permit also may be required if that run-off or leachate is discharged to a treatment facility that is owned by a local municipality. Almost all solid waste management facilities must comply with the EPA&#146;s storm water regulations, which govern the discharge of regulated storm water to surface waters. 

Under federal regulation, facilities that have above ground and/or below ground petroleum storage capacities over certain thresholds may be subject to regulations and/or permitting under the Clean Water Act. Many of our facilities have petroleum storage and are required to have a spill, prevention, control and countermeasures (&#147;SPCC&#148;) plan to prevent petroleum release to waters of the U.S. due to a spill rupture or leak. 

Several states in which we operate have been delegated the authority to implement the Clean Water Act requirements and in some cases the regulations are more stringent than the federal regulations. We believe we are in compliance with the Clean Water Act regulations, however future changes to the law or regulations could have a material impact on our business. 

&#160;

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (&#147;CERCLA&#148;) 

CERCLA established a regulatory and remedial program intended to provide for the investigation and remediation of facilities where, or from which, a release of any hazardous substance into the environment has occurred or is threatened. CERCLA has been interpreted to impose retroactive strict, and under certain circumstances, joint and severable, liability for the costs to investigate and clean up facilities on current owners and operators of the site, former owners and operators of the site at the time of the disposal of the hazardous substances, as well as the generators and certain transporters of the hazardous substances. In addition, CERCLA imposes liability for the costs of evaluating and addressing damage to natural resources. The costs of CERCLA investigation and cleanup can be substantial. Liability under CERCLA does not depend upon the existence or disposal of &#147;hazardous waste&#148; as defined by RCRA, but can be based on the presence of any of more than 700 &#147;hazardous substances&#148; listed by the EPA, many of which can be found in household waste. In addition, the definition of &#147;hazardous substances&#148; in CERCLA incorporates substances designated as hazardous or toxic under the Federal Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act and Toxic Substances Control Act. If we were found to be a responsible party for a CERCLA cleanup, under certain circumstances, the enforcing agency could pursue us or any other responsible party, for all investigative and remedial costs, even if others also were liable. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA to impose a lien in favor of the United States upon all real property subject to, or affected by, a remedial action for all costs for which the property owner is liable. CERCLA provides a responsible party with the right to bring a contribution action against other responsible parties for their allocable share of investigative and remedial costs. Our ability to obtain reimbursement for amounts we pay in excess of our allocable share of such costs would be limited by our ability to identify and locate other responsible parties and to prove the extent of their responsibility and by the financial resources of such other parties. 

The Clean Air Act of 1970, as amended (&#147;Clean Air Act&#148;) 

The Clean Air Act, generally through state implementation of federal requirements, regulates emissions of air pollutants from certain landfills based upon the date the landfill was constructed and the annual volume of emissions. The EPA has promulgated new source performance standards regulating air emissions of certain regulated pollutants (non-methane organic compounds) from municipal solid waste landfills. Landfills located in areas where ambient levels of regulated pollutants exceed certain thresholds may be subject to more extensive air pollution controls and emission limitations. In addition, the EPA has issued standards regulating the disposal of asbestos-containing materials under the Clean Air Act. 

The EPA is also focusing on the emissions of greenhouse gases, or GHG, including carbon dioxide and methane. In December, 2009, the EPA issued its &#147;endangerment finding&#148; that carbon dioxide poses a threat to human health and welfare, providing the basis for the EPA to regulate GHG emissions. In December 2009 the EPA&#146;s &#147;Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases&#148; rule went into effect, requiring facilities that emit twenty-five thousand metric tons or more per year of GHG emissions to submit annual reports to the EPA. 

In June 2010, the EPA issued the so-called &#147;GHG Tailoring Rule&#148;, which described how certain sources that emit GHG would be subject to heightened Clean Air Act PSD / Title V regulation. In July 2011, however, the EPA promulgated a rule that, broadly, deferred for three years the applicability of those regulations with regard to sources emitting carbon dioxide from biomass-fired and other &#147;biogenic&#148; sources. In June 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision partially invalidating EPA&#146;s Tailoring Rule. We do not know whether or when the EPA will put those regulations in place following the Supreme Court decision, or what obligations such regulations will impose on our operations. 

The adoption of other laws and regulations, which may include the imposition of fees or taxes, could adversely affect our collection and disposal operations. Additionally, certain of the states in which we operate are contemplating air pollution control regulations relating to GHG that may be more stringent than regulations the EPA may promulgate. Changing environmental regulations could require us to take any number of actions, including purchasing emission allowances or installing additional pollution control technology, and could make some operations less profitable, which could adversely affect our results of operations. 

Congress also is considering various options, including a cap and trade system, which could impose a limit on and establish a pricing mechanism for GHG emissions and emission allowances. There also is increasing pressure for the United States to join international efforts to control GHG emissions. 

The Clean Air Act regulates emissions of air pollutants from our processing facilities. The EPA has enacted standards that apply to those emissions. It is possible that the EPA, or a state where we operate, will enact additional or different emission standards in the future. 

All of the federal statutes described above authorize lawsuits by private citizens to enforce certain provisions of the statutes. In addition to a penalty award to the United States, some of those statutes authorize an award of attorney&#146;s fees to private parties successfully advancing such an action. 

&#160;

The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, as amended (&#147;OSHA&#148;) 

OSHA establishes employer responsibilities and authorizes the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to promulgate and enforce occupational health and safety standards, including the obligation to maintain a workplace free of recognized hazards likely to cause death or serious injury, to comply with adopted worker protection standards, to maintain certain records, to provide workers with required disclosures and to implement certain health and safety training programs. A variety of those promulgated standards may apply to our operations, including those standards concerning notices of hazards, safety in excavation and demolition work, the handling of asbestos and asbestos-containing materials, and worker training and emergency response programs. 

The Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, As Amended (&#147;PURPA&#148;) 

PURPA exempts qualifying facilities from most federal and state laws governing the financial organization and rate regulation of electric utilities, and generally requires electric utilities to purchase electricity generated by qualifying facilities at a price equal to the utility&#146;s full &#147;avoided cost&#148;. Our four landfill gas-to-energy facilities are self- certified as &#147;qualifying facilities&#148;. 

State and Local Regulations 

Each state in which we now operate or may operate in the future has laws and regulations governing (1) water and air pollution, and the generation, storage, treatment, handling, processing, transportation, incineration and disposal of solid waste and hazardous waste; (2) in most cases, the siting, design, operation, maintenance, closure and post-closure maintenance of solid waste management facilities; and (3) in some cases, vehicle emissions limits or fuel types, which impact our collection operations. Such standards typically are as stringent as, and may be more stringent and broader in scope than, federal regulations. Most of the federal statutes noted above authorize states to enact and enforce laws with standards that are more protective of the environment than the federal analog. In addition, many states have adopted statutes comparable to, and in some cases more stringent than, CERCLA. These statutes impose requirements for investigation and remediation of contaminated sites and liability for costs and damages associated with such sites, and some authorize the state to impose liens to secure costs expended addressing contamination on property owned by responsible parties. Some of those liens may take priority over previously filed instruments. Some states have enacted statutes that impose liability for substances in addition to the &#147;hazardous substances&#148; listed by EPA under CERCLA. 

Many municipalities in which we currently operate or may operate in the future also have ordinances, laws and regulations affecting our operations. These include zoning and health measures that limit solid waste management activities to specified sites or conduct, flow control provisions that direct the delivery of solid wastes to specific facilities or to facilities in specific areas, laws that grant the right to establish franchises for collection services and then put out for bid the right to provide collection services, and bans or other restrictions on the movement of solid wastes into a municipality. 

Some states have enacted laws that allow agencies with jurisdiction over waste management facilities to deny or revoke permits based on the applicant&#146;s or permit holder&#146;s compliance status. Some states also consider the compliance history of the corporate parent, subsidiaries and affiliates of the applicant or permit holder. 

Certain permits and approvals issued under state or local law may limit the types of waste that may be accepted at a solid waste management facility or the quantity of waste that may be accepted at a solid waste management facility during a specific time period. In addition, certain permits and approvals, as well as certain state and local regulations, may limit a solid waste management facility to accepting waste that originates from specified geographic areas or seek to restrict the importation of out-of-state waste or otherwise discriminate against out-of-state waste. Generally, restrictions on importing out-of-state waste have not withstood judicial challenge. However, from time to time federal legislation is proposed which would allow individual states to prohibit the disposal of out-of-state waste or to limit the amount of out-of-state waste that could be imported for disposal and would require states, under certain circumstances, to reduce the amounts of waste exported to other states. Although such legislation has not been passed by Congress, if similar legislation is enacted, states in which we operate solid waste management facilities could limit or prohibit the importation of out-of-state waste. Such actions could materially and adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of any of our landfills within those states that receive a significant portion of waste originating from out-of-state. 

Certain states and localities may restrict the export of waste from their jurisdiction, or require that a specified amount of waste be disposed of at facilities within their jurisdiction. In 1994, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected as unconstitutional and therefore invalid, a local ordinance that sought to limit waste going out of the locality by imposing a requirement that the waste be delivered to a particular privately-owned facility. However, in 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a U.S. District Court ruling that the flow control regulations in Oneida and Herkimer counties in New York requiring trash haulers to use publicly-owned transfer stations are constitutional, and therefore valid. Additionally, certain state and local jurisdictions continue to seek to enforce such restrictions. Further, some proposed federal legislation would allow states and localities to impose flow restrictions. Those restrictions could reduce the volume of waste going to solid waste management facilities in certain areas, which may materially adversely affect our ability to operate our facilities and/or affect the prices we can charge for certain services. Those restrictions also may result in higher disposal costs for our collection operations. In sum, flow control restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

&#160;

There has been an increasing trend at the state and local levels to mandate or encourage both waste reduction at the source and waste recycling, and to prohibit or restrict the disposal in landfills of certain types of solid wastes, including yard wastes and leaves, food wastes, beverage containers, newspapers, household appliances and electronics such as computers, and batteries. Regulations reducing the volume and types of wastes available for transport to and disposal in landfills could affect our ability to operate our landfill facilities. Vermont, for example, enacted Act 148, containing among other things, a phased waste ban for recyclables, organics and leaf/yard waste. The bill became effective July 1, 2012, with phased deadlines for compliance beginning 2014 through 2020. Vermont also passed a bill requiring recycling of architectural waste from construction or demolition of a commercial project. The law became effective in January 2015. 

Massachusetts revised its regulations governing solid waste management with a framework to encourage the re-use of organic waste material and prohibiting such material from disposal for large-scale commercial generators by October 2014. 

New York State is considering revisions to its regulations governing solid waste management, 6 NYCRR Part 360. 

Although there is no federal law governing extended producer responsibility (&#147;EPR&#148;) regulations; many states have implemented EPR regulations for certain products. EPR regulations are intended to place responsibility for ultimate management or end-of-useful-life handling of the products they create. In addition to financial responsibility, an EPR program may include responsibility for local take-back or recycling programs. For example, several states in which we operate have EPR regulations for electronic waste. If broad EPR laws or regulations were adopted and managed under a manufacturer implemented program, it could have an impact on our business.
