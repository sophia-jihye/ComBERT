 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

General 

PacWest Bancorp, a Delaware corporation, is a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, or "BHCA", with our corporate headquarters located in Los Angeles, California. Our principal business is to serve as the holding company for our wholly-owned subsidiary, Pacific Western Bank. References to "Pacific Western" or the "Bank" refer to Pacific Western Bank together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries. References to "we," "us," or the "Company" refer to PacWest Bancorp together with its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. When we refer to "PacWest" or to the "holding company," we are referring to PacWest Bancorp, the parent company, on a stand-alone basis. We are focused on relationship-based business banking to small, middle-market and venture-backed businesses nationwide. The Bank offers a broad range of loan and deposit products and services through 80 &#32;full-service branches located throughout the state of California, one &#32;branch located in Durham, North Carolina, and several loan production offices located in cities across the country. We provide commercial banking services, including real estate, construction, and commercial loans, and comprehensive deposit and treasury management services to small and middle-market businesses. We offer products and services under the brand names of Pacific Western as well as its business groups, CapitalSource and Square 1 Bank. CapitalSource focuses on providing cash flow, asset-based, equipment and real estate loans and treasury management services to established middle market businesses on a national basis. Square 1 Bank focuses on providing a comprehensive suite of financial products tailored to service entrepreneurial businesses and their venture capital and private equity investors, with offices located in key innovation hubs across the United States. Square 1 Asset Management, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bank and a SEC-registered investment adviser, provides investment advisory and asset management services to select clients. 

We were established in October 1999 and have achieved strong market positions by developing and maintaining extensive local relationships in the communities we serve. By leveraging our business model, service-driven focus, and presence in attractive markets, as well as maintaining a highly efficient operating model and robust approach to risk management, we have achieved significant and profitable growth, both organically and through disciplined acquisitions. We have successfully completed 28 acquisitions since 2000 which have contributed to our growth and expanded our market presence throughout the United States. 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had total assets of $21.3 billion , gross loans and leases of $14.5 billion , total deposits of $15.7 billion &#32;and stockholders&#8217; equity of $4.4 billion . 

From the second quarter of 2012 to the third quarter of 2015, we operated as three reportable segments: Community Banking, National Lending (formerly Asset Financing) and Other. As a result of the Square 1 Financial, Inc., or "Square 1" acquisition, along with changes in personnel, reporting structure, and operations, we re-evaluated our segment reporting for year-end 2015. 

At December 31, 2015 , we operated as one reportable segment. The factors considered in making this determination include the nature of products and offered services, the geographic regions in which we operate, the applicable regulatory environment, and the discrete financial information reviewed by our key decision makers. 

Our Business Strategy 

General Overview 

We believe that stable, long-term growth and profitability are the result of building strong customer relationships while maintaining disciplined credit underwriting standards. We continue to focus on originating high-quality loans and leases and growing our low-cost deposit base through our relationship-based business lending. These core strengths enable us to maintain our operational efficiency and increase profitability, increase our core deposits and grow loans and leases in a sound manner. 

Our loan and lease portfolio consists primarily of real estate mortgage loans, real estate construction and land loans, and commercial and industrial, or "C&#38;I", loans and leases. We pursue attractive growth opportunities to expand and enter new markets aligned with our business model and strategic plans. Additionally, we focus on cultivating strong relationships with firms within the private equity and venture capital community nationwide, many of which are also our clients and/or may invest in our clients. 

Our reputation, expertise and relationship-based business banking model enable us to deepen our relationships with our customers. We leverage our relationships with existing customers by cross-selling our products and services, including attracting deposits from and offering cash management solutions to our loan and lease customers. We price our deposit products with a view to maximizing our share of each customer's financial services business and prudently managing our cost of funds. 

Focusing on operational efficiency is critical to our profitability and future growth. We intend to carefully manage our cost structure and continuously refine and implement internal processes and systems to create further efficiencies and enhance our earnings. We are also continuing our efforts to shift our deposit base from certificates of deposit to lower-cost core deposits, a strategic initiative that was undertaken following the CapitalSource Inc. merger. The acquisition of Square 1 accelerated this process as nearly all of the $3.8 billion of acquired deposits were core deposits. 

Our management team has extensive expertise and a successful track record in evaluating, executing and integrating attractive, franchise-enhancing acquisitions. We have successfully completed 28 acquisitions since 2000, including the Square 1 acquisition in 2015 and the CapitalSource Inc. acquisition in 2014. We will continue to consider acquisitions that are consistent with our business strategy and financial model as opportunities arise.

Depository Products and Services 

Deposits are our primary source of funds to support our revenue-generating assets and provide a source of low-cost funds and deposit-related fee income. We offer traditional deposit products to businesses and other customers with a variety of rates and terms, including demand, money market, and time deposits. We also provide international banking services, multi-state deposit services, asset management services, as well as product offerings through other correspondent banks. The Bank&#8217;s deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or "FDIC," up to statutory limits. 

Our branch network allows us to gather deposits, expand our brand presence and service our customers&#8217; banking and cash management needs. In addition, as the banking industry continues to experience broader customer acceptance of on-line and mobile banking tools for conducting basic banking functions we are able to serve our customers through a wide range of non-branch channels, including on-line and telephone banking platforms, which allows us to attract new depositors without a commensurate increase in branch traffic. 

&#32;At December 31, 2015 , we had ATMs at 63 of our branches and had another two at off-site locations located in California. We are part of the MoneyPass network that enables our customers to withdraw cash surcharge-free and service charge-free at over 25,000 ATM locations across the country. &#32; We provide access to customer accounts via a 24 hour seven-day-a-week, toll-free, automated telephone customer service and secure on-line banking services. 

At December 31, 2015 , our total deposits consisted of $10.6 billion in core deposits, $4.2 billion in time deposits and $0.9 billion in brokered non-maturity deposits. Core deposits represented 67% of total deposits at December 31, 2015 , and were comprised of $6.2 billion in noninterest-bearing deposits, $0.9 billion in interest-bearing checking accounts, $2.8 billion in money market accounts and $0.7 billion in savings accounts. Our deposit base is also diversified by client type. As of December 31, 2015 , no individual depositor represented more than 1.2% &#32;of our total deposits, and our top ten depositors represented 8.6% of our total deposits. 

The composition of our deposit mix changed as a result of the CapitalSource Inc. merger, which lowered the proportion of core deposits and increased the proportion of more expensive time deposits. Since the CapitalSource Inc. merger, we have focused on shifting the mix of our deposits to include a higher proportion of core deposits. Our dedicated team of professionals has been successful in growing our low-cost, core deposit base by attracting deposits from our business customers and offering alternative cash management solutions intended to help retain business customers. The Square 1 acquisition completed in October 2015 accelerated this shift in deposit mix. 

We face strong competition in gathering deposits. Our most direct competition for deposits comes from nationwide, regional, and community banks, savings banks and associations, credit unions, insurance companies, money market funds, brokerage firms and other non-bank financial services companies that target the same customers we do. We compete actively for deposits and emphasize solicitation of noninterest-bearing deposits. We seek to provide a higher level of personal service than our larger competitors, many of whom have more assets, capital and resources than we do and may be able to conduct more intensive and broader based promotional efforts to reach both commercial and retail customers. We also compete based on interest rates. Our cost of funds fluctuates with market interest rates and may be affected by higher rates being offered by other financial institutions. In certain interest rate environments, additional significant competition for deposits may be expected to arise from corporate and government debt securities and money market mutual funds. Competition for deposits is also affected by the ease with which customers can transfer deposits from one institution to another. 

Client Investment Funds 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32; In addition to deposit products, we also offer select clients non-depository cash investment options through Square 1 Asset Management, Inc. ("S1AM"), our registered investment adviser subsidiary, and third-party money market sweep products. S1AM provides customized investment advisory and asset management solutions. At December 31, 2015, total off-balance sheet client investment funds were $2.0 billion, of which $1.6 billion was managed by S1AM. Subsequent to the completion of the Square 1 acquisition, we launched an initiative to migrate client investment funds into on-balance sheet deposit products, and approximately $300 million were transferred as of December 31, 2015. 

&#160; 

Lending Activities 

We conduct a range of commercial lending activities that includes real estate mortgage, real estate construction and land loans and C&#38;I loans and leases. Our commercial real estate loans are secured by a range of property types. Our C&#38;I loan offerings are diverse and generally include various asset-secured loans, equipment-secured loans and leases, cash flow loans (leveraged loans) to finance business acquisitions and recapitalizations, and venture loans to support the operations of entrepreneurial companies during the various phases of their start-up operations. We price loans to preserve our interest spread and maintain our net interest margin. Loan interest rates may be floating throughout the loan term or fixed. The rates on hybrid loans typically are fixed for a set period and then become floating later in the loan term. While we do not actively solicit consumer loans, we hold consumer loans, which are primarily purchased participation interests in student loans originated and serviced by a third-party lender. 

&#32; Real Estate Loans &#32; 

Our real estate lending activities focus primarily on loans to professional developers and real estate investors for the acquisition, refinancing and construction of commercial real estate. Our real estate loans generally are collateralized by first deeds of trust on specific commercial properties. The most prevalent types of properties securing our real estate loans are various healthcare properties such as skilled nursing facilities and assisted living facilities, multi-family properties, office properties, hotels, industrial properties, and retail properties. This includes loans provided to owners of commercial real estate properties that use such premises to conduct their operations. The properties are located across the United States, primarily in central business districts, but a substantial percentage of our real estate collateral is in California. Our real estate loans generally have an initial interest-only period followed by an amortization schedule with a lump sum balloon payment due in one to ten years or may, more immediately, have interest and principal payments due on an amortization schedule ranging from 15 to 30 years with a lump sum balloon payment due in one to ten years. Construction loans typically finance from 50% to 70% of the costs to construct commercial or multi-family residential properties. The terms are generally two to four years. 

We also provide real estate secured loans under the Small Business Administration&#8217;s (or "SBA") 7(a) Program and 504 Program. Compliant Small Business Administration 7(a) loans have an SBA guaranty for 75% of the loan. SBA 504 loans are 50% loan-to-value first deed of trust mortgage loans on owner-occupied commercial real estate where a second deed of trust is also provided by a nonprofit certified development company. The SBA 7(a) and SBA 504 mortgage loans repay on a twenty-five year amortization schedule. 

&#32;Our real estate portfolio is subject to certain risks including, but not limited to, the following: 

&#8226; 

increased competition in pricing and loan structure; 

&#8226; 

the economic conditions of the United States, particularly Southern California; 

&#8226; 

interest rate increases; 

&#8226; 

decreased real estate values in the markets where we lend; 

&#8226; 

the borrower's inability to repay our loan due to decreased cash flow or operating losses; 

&#8226; 

the borrower&#8217;s inability to refinance or payoff our loan upon maturity; 

&#8226; 

loss of our loan principal stemming from a collateral foreclosure; and 

&#8226; 

various environmental risks, including natural disasters. 

In addition to the foregoing, construction loans are also subject to project-specific risks including, but not limited to, the following: 

&#8226; 

construction costs being more than anticipated; 

&#8226; 

construction taking longer than anticipated; 

&#8226; 

failure by developers and contractors to meet project specifications; 

&#8226; 

disagreement between contractors, subcontractors and developers; 

&#8226; 

demand for completed projects being less than anticipated; and 

&#8226; 

buyers of the completed projects not being able to secure financing. 

The risks related to buyer inability to secure permanent financing and loss through foreclosure are affected by market conditions and are not entirely controllable by us. When considering the markets in which to pursue real estate loans, we consider the market conditions, our current loan portfolio concentrations by property type and by market, and our past experience with the borrower, the specific market, and the property type. 

When underwriting real estate loans, we seek to mitigate risk by using the following framework: 

&#8226; 

reviewing each loan request and renewal individually; 

&#8226; 

using a credit committee approval process for the approval of each loan request over a certain dollar amount; 

&#8226; 

adhering to written loan policies including, among other factors, minimum collateral requirements, maximum loan&#8209;to&#8209;value ratio requirements, cash flow requirements and full or partial guaranty requirements; 

&#8226; 

obtaining independent third-party appraisals that are reviewed by our appraisal department; 

&#8226; 

obtaining environmental risk assessments; and 

&#8226; 

obtaining seismic studies where appropriate. 

With respect to construction loans, in addition to the foregoing, we attempt to mitigate project-specific risks by: 

&#8226; 

implementing a controlled disbursement process for loan proceeds in accordance with an agreed upon schedule; 

&#8226; 

conducting project site visits; and 

&#8226; 

monitoring the construction costs compared to the budgeted costs and the remaining costs to complete. 

SBA 7(a) and 504 program loans are subject to the risks outlined above and the risk that an SBA 7(a) guaranty may be invalid if SBA specific procedures are not followed. We seek to mitigate this risk by maintaining and following additional policies specific to SBA loans which align with SBA requirements. 

C&#38;I Loans and Leases 

Our C&#38;I loan and lease offerings are diverse and generally include various cash flow loans (leveraged loans) to finance business acquisitions and recapitalizations, asset-based loans, equipment-secured loans and leases, and venture-backed loans to support the operations of entrepreneurial companies during the various phases of their start-up operations. 

Our C&#38;I loans include the following specific lending products: 

&#8226; 

Cash flow loans. These loans include senior secured loans provided to entities in conjunction with equity contributions from private equity groups to finance the acquisition or recapitalization of a business, SBA 7(a) loans, loans to professionals and other specialty finance products, and leveraged loans (defined below). Our cash flow lending focuses on borrowers with a high degree of contractual recurring revenues operating primarily in the technology, healthcare and security monitoring sectors. The primary source of repayment is cash flow from operations, the refinancing of the loan, and/or the proceeds from the sale of the company. The loan terms are three to six years with some amortization during the term. According to regulatory guidance, the majority of cash flow loans are considered leveraged loans. Leveraged loans are typically loans where the proceeds are used for buyouts or acquisitions and where the resulting total debt levels are four or more times the in-place historical adjusted earnings of the borrower. Leveraged loans are supported by underwriting that indicates the debt levels relative to earnings will decline meaningfully over the terms of the loans and for which the enterprise value provides sufficient coverage for our debt. The SBA 7(a) loans are secured by the value of a business and its equipment and are fully-amortizing term loans generally over a 10-year period. 

&#8226; 

Asset-based loans. These loans are used for working capital and are secured by trade accounts receivable and/or inventory. In conjunction with our healthcare real estate loans, we may provide healthcare operators with asset-based loans secured by healthcare accounts receivable to support working capital needs. This loan segment also includes lender finance loans or loans to finance companies and timeshare operators. These loans are used to purchase finance receivables or extend finance receivables to the underlying obligors and are secured primarily by the finance receivables owed to our borrowers. The primary sources of repayment are the operating income of the borrower, the collection of the receivables securing the loan, and/or the sale of the inventory securing the loan. The loans are typically revolving lines of credit with terms of one to three years. Also included in this segment are loans used to finance annual life insurance premiums and are fully secured by the corresponding cash surrender value of life insurance contracts and other liquid collateral with one-year terms that generally renew annually. 

&#8226; 

Equipment-secured loans and leases. These loans and leases are used to purchase equipment essential to the operations of our borrower or lessee and are secured by the specific equipment financed. The primary source of repayment is the operating income of the borrower or lessee. The loan and lease terms are two to ten years and generally amortize to either a full repayment or residual balance or investment that is expected to be collected through a sale of the equipment to the lessee or a third party. 

&#8226; 

Venture capital loans. These loans are to venture-backed companies to support their operations, including operating losses, working capital requirements and fixed asset acquisitions. Our borrowers are at various stages in their development and are generally reporting operating losses. The primary sources of repayment are future additional venture capital equity investments, or the sale of the company or its assets. This loan segment also includes loans directly to venture capital firms, venture capital funds, and venture capital management companies to provide a bridge to the receipt of capital calls and to support the borrowers' working capital needs, such as the cost of raising a new venture fund or leasehold improvements for new office space. The primary sources of repayment are receipt of capital calls, exits from portfolio company investments, or management fees. The loan terms for venture loans are generally one to four years. 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;Our portfolio of C&#38;I loans and leases is subject to certain risks including, but not limited to, the following: 

&#8226; 

the economic conditions of the United States; 

&#8226; 

interest rate increases; 

&#8226; 

deterioration of the value of the underlying collateral; 

&#8226; 

increased competition in pricing and loan structure; 

&#8226; 

the deterioration of a borrower&#8217;s or guarantor&#8217;s financial capabilities; and 

&#8226; 

various environmental risks, including natural disasters, which can negatively affect a borrower&#8217;s business. 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;When underwriting C&#38;I loans and leases, we seek to mitigate risk by using the following framework: 

&#8226; 

consider the prospects for the borrower's industry; 

&#8226; 

consider our past experience with the borrower, the borrower's industry, and the collateral type; 

&#8226; 

consider our current loan and lease portfolio concentration by loan type and collateral type; 

&#8226; 

reviewing each loan request and renewal individually; 

&#8226; 

using our credit committee approval process for the approval of each loan request over a certain dollar amount; and 

&#8226; 

adhering to written loan underwriting policies and procedures. 

Consumer Loans &#32;&#32; 

Consumer loans include personal loans, auto loans, home equity lines of credit, revolving lines of credit, other loans typically made by banks to individual borrowers, and purchased participation interests in student loans originated and serviced by a third-party lender. We do not currently originate first trust deed home mortgage loans. Home equity lines of credit are revolving lines of credit collateralized by junior deeds of trust on residential real estate properties. During 2013, 2014 and 2015 we purchased participation interests in student loans that are not guaranteed by any program of the U.S. Government. These loans refinanced the outstanding student loan debt of borrowers who met certain underwriting criteria, with terms that fully amortize the debt over terms ranging from five to twenty years. 

&#32;Our consumer loan portfolio is subject to certain risks, including, but not limited to, the following: 

&#8226; 

the economic conditions of the United States and the levels of unemployment; 

&#8226; 

the amount of credit offered to consumers in the market; 

&#8226; 

interest rate increases; 

&#8226; 

consumer bankruptcy laws which allow consumers to discharge certain debts (excluding student loans); 

&#8226; 

compliance with consumer lending regulations; 

&#8226; 

additional regulations and oversight by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("CFPB"); and 

&#8226; 

the ability of the sub-servicer of the Bank&#8217;s student loan participation interests to service the loans in accordance with the terms of the loan purchase agreement. 

We seek to mitigate the exposure to such risks through the direct approval of all internally originated consumer loans by reviewing each loan request and renewal individually and adhering to written credit policies. For all purchased student loan participation interests, we monitor the performance of the originator and the enforcement of our rights under the loan purchase agreement.

(1) 

Includes leveraged loans of $2.2 billion and $1.7 billion at December 31, 2015 and 2014. 

(2) 

Includes purchased credit impaired ("PCI") loans of $189.0 million &#32;and $290.9 million &#32;at December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , of which the majority are included in the Real Estate Mortgage category in this table. 

Real estate mortgage loans and real estate construction and land loans together comprised 44% &#32;and 50% &#32;of our total portfolio at December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 . The decline in real estate loans as a percentage of total loans was attributable to commercial loans acquired in connection with the Square 1 acquisition and net loan originations and repayment activity during 2015. 

&#32;&#32;Commercial real estate mortgage loans are diversified among various property types. At December 31, 2015 , our largest property type concentration was healthcare property, totaling $1.2 billion or 21% of real estate mortgage loans. Healthcare property types include skilled nursing facilities, hospitals, assisted living facilities, independent living facilities, and owner-occupied medical office facilities. At December 31, 2014 , healthcare property totaled $1.0 billion and comprised 19% of real estate mortgage loans. 

Other significant real estate concentrations were office properties &#32; at 12% and 14% of real estate mortgage loans at December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , and multi-family properties at 14% of real estate mortgage loans at December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 . 

Commercial loans and leases comprised 55% and 49% of our total portfolio at December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 . The increase in the commercial loan and lease portfolio composition in 2015 is attributable to commercial loans acquired in connection with the Square 1 acquisition and net loan originations and repayment activity. 

Commercial loans and leases are diversified among various loan types and industries. At December 31, 2015, our largest commercial loan type concentration was cash flow loans, totaling $3.1 billion or 21% of our total portfolio compared to 22% at December 31, 2014. Other significant commercial concentrations were asset-based loans at 18% and 19% of the total portfolio at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, and equipment finance at 6% and 8% of the total portfolio at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. Venture capital loans were 10% of the total portfolio at December 31, 2015, and represent venture capital loans acquired in the Square 1 acquisition. 

Current Developments 

Square 1 Financial, Inc. Acquisition 

PacWest acquired Square 1 Financial, Inc. (&#8220;Square 1&#8221;) on October 6, 2015 . As part of the acquisition, Square 1 Bank, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Square 1, merged with and into Pacific Western and we formed the Square 1 Bank Division of the Bank. We provide a comprehensive suite of financial services focused on entrepreneurial businesses and their venture capital and private equity investors nationwide marketed under the Square 1 Bank Division brand. We completed this acquisition to increase our core deposits, expand our nationwide lending platform, and increase our presence in the technology and life-sciences credit markets. We recorded the acquired assets and liabilities, both tangible and intangible, at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date and increased total assets by approximately $4.6 billion . The application of the acquisition method of accounting resulted in goodwill of $448 million . 

CapitalSource Inc. Merger 

PacWest acquired CapitalSource Inc. on April 7, 2014. As part of the merger, CapitalSource Bank (&#8220;CSB&#8221;), a wholly-owned subsidiary of CapitalSource Inc., merged with and into Pacific Western. At closing, we formed the CapitalSource Division of the Bank. We provide a full spectrum of financing solutions across numerous industries and property types to middle market businesses nationwide marketed under the CapitalSource Division brand. We completed this acquisition in order to increase our loan and lease generation capabilities and to diversify our loan portfolio. We recorded the acquired assets and liabilities, both tangible and intangible, at their estimated fair values as of the merger date and increased total assets by approximately $10.7 billion . The application of the acquisition method of accounting resulted in goodwill of $1.5 billion . 

Financing 

We depend on deposits and external financing sources to fund our operations. We employ a variety of financing arrangements, including term debt, subordinated debt and equity. As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (&#8220;FHLB&#8221;), the Bank had financing capacity with the FHLB as of December 31, 2015 &#32;of $2.5 billion , collateralized by a blanket lien on certain qualifying loans. 

Information Technology Systems &#32; 

We devote significant resources to maintain stable, reliable, efficient and scalable information technology systems. Where possible, we utilize third-party software systems that are hosted and supported by nationally recognized vendors. We selectively employ proprietary software systems to support our specialty lending products. We work with our third-party vendors to monitor and maximize the efficiency of our use of their applications. We use integrated systems to originate and process loans and deposit accounts, which reduces processing time, automates numerous internal controls, improves customer experiences and reduces costs. Most customer records are maintained digitally. We also provide on-line and telephone banking services to further improve the overall client experience. We expect to convert from the core processing system that is used to manage customer accounts to a processing system offered by another software vendor with the initial phase occurring during the second quarter of 2016. 

We maintain a strategic plan with respect to information technology. The information technology strategic plan outlines how specific solutions will support our overall goals, analyzes infrastructure for capacity planning, details migration plans to replace aging hardware and software, provides baseline projections for allocating information technology staff, discusses information security trends and measures, considers future technologies, and provides details on information technology initiatives over the next several years. 

Protecting our systems to ensure the safety of our customers&#8217; information is critical to our business. We use multiple layers of protection to control access and reduce risk, including conducting a variety of audits and vulnerability and penetration tests on our platforms, systems and applications, and maintain comprehensive incident response plans to reduce the risk that any cyber attacks are successful. To protect against disasters, we have a backup offsite core processing system and recovery plans. 

We invested in an enterprise data warehouse system in order to capture, analyze and report key metrics associated with our customers and products. Data that previously was arduous to collect across multiple systems is now available daily through standard and ad hoc reports to assist with managing our business and competing effectively in the marketplace. 

Risk Oversight and Management 

We believe risk management is another core competency of our business. We have a comprehensive risk management process that monitors, evaluates and manages the risks we assume in conducting our activities. Our oversight of this risk management process is conducted by the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors (the &#8220;Board&#8221;) and its standing committees. The committees each report to the Board and the Board has overall oversight responsibility for risk management. 

Our risk framework is structured to guide decisions regarding the appropriate balance between risk and return considerations in our business. Our risk framework is based upon our business strategy, risk appetite and financial plans approved by our Board. Our risk framework is supported by an enterprise risk management program. Our enterprise risk management program integrates all risk efforts under one common framework. This framework includes risk policies, procedures, measured and reported limits and targets, and reporting. Our Board approves our risk appetite statement, which sets forth the amount and type of risks we are willing to accept in pursuit of achieving our strategic, business and financial objectives. Our risk appetite statement provides the context for our risk management tools, including, among others, risk policies, delegated authorities, limits, portfolio composition, underwriting standards and operational processes. 

Competition 

The banking business is highly competitive. We compete for loans and leases, deposits, employees and customers nationwide with other commercial banks and financial services institutions. Some of these competitors are larger in total assets and capitalization, with more offices over a wider geographic area and offer a broader range of financial services than our operations. Our most direct competition for loans comes from larger regional and national banks, diversified finance companies, venture debt funds and service-focused community banks that target the same customers we do. In recent years, competition has increased from institutions not subject to the same regulatory restrictions as domestic banks and bank holding companies. Those competitors include non-bank specialty lenders, insurance companies, private investment funds, investment banks, and other financial and non-financial institutions. 

Competition is based on a number of factors, including interest rates charged on loans and leases and paid on deposits, the scope and type of banking and financial services offered, convenience of our branch locations, customer service, technological changes and regulatory constraints. Many of our competitors are large companies that have substantial capital, technological and marketing resources. Some of our competitors have substantial market positions and have access to a lower cost of capital or a less expensive source of funds. Because of economies of scale, our larger, nationwide competitors may offer loan pricing that is more attractive that what we can offer. 

Economic factors, along with legislative and technological changes, will have an ongoing impact on the competitive environment within the financial services industry. We work to anticipate and adapt to dynamic competitive conditions whether it is by developing and marketing innovative products and services, adopting or developing new technologies that differentiate our products and services, cross marketing, or providing highly personalized banking services. We strive to distinguish ourselves from other banks and financial services providers in our marketplace by providing an extremely high level of service to enhance customer loyalty and to attract and retain business. 

We differentiate ourselves in the marketplace through the quality of service we provide to borrowers while maintaining competitive interest rates, loan fees and other loan terms. We emphasize personalized relationship banking services and the efficient decision-making of our lending business units. We compete effectively based on our in-depth knowledge of our borrowers' industries and their business needs based upon information received from our borrowers' key decision-makers, analysis by our experienced professionals and interaction between these two groups; our breadth of loan product offerings and flexible and creative approach to structuring products that meet our borrowers' business and timing needs; and our dedication to superior client service. However, we can provide no assurance as to the effectiveness of these efforts on our future business or results of operations, as to our continued ability to anticipate and adapt to changing conditions, and as to sufficiently improving our services and/or banking products in order to successfully compete in the marketplace. 

Employees 

As of January 31, 2016, we had 1,670 full time equivalent employees. 

Financial and Statistical Disclosure 

Certain of our statistical information is presented within &#8220;Item 6. Selected Financial Data,&#8221; &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,&#8221; and &#8220;Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk.&#8221; This information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements contained in &#8220;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.&#8221; 

Supervision and Regulation 

General 

The Company and Bank are subject to extensive regulation under federal and state banking laws that establish a comprehensive framework for our operations. Such regulation is intended to, among other things, protect the interests of customers, including depositors, and the federal deposit insurance fund, as well as to minimize risk to the banking system as a whole. These regulations are not, however, generally charged with protecting the interests of our stockholders or creditors. Described below are the material elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to our Company or the Bank. The descriptions are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and regulations described. Changes in applicable law or regulations, and in their application by regulatory agencies, cannot be predicted, but they may have a material effect on the business, operations, and results of our Company or the Bank. 

Bank Holding Company Regulation 

As a bank holding company, PacWest is registered with and subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ("FRB") under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, or &#8220;BHCA&#8221;, and we are required to file with the FRB periodic reports of our operations and such additional information regarding the Company and its subsidiaries as the FRB may require. 

The Dodd&#8209;Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221; or &#8220;Dodd Frank&#8221;, requires the Company to act as a source of financial strength to the Bank including committing resources to support the Bank even at times when the Company may not be in a financial position to do so. Similarly, under the cross&#8209;guarantee provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, or "FDIA," the FDIC can hold any FDIC&#8209;insured depository institution liable for any loss suffered or anticipated by the FDIC in connection with (i) the default of a commonly controlled FDIC&#8209;insured depository institution or (ii) any assistance provided by the FDIC to such a commonly controlled institution. 

Pursuant to the BHCA, we are required to obtain the prior approval of the FRB before we acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank or the ownership or control of voting shares of any bank if, after giving effect to such acquisition, we would own or control, directly or indirectly, more than 5 percent of such bank. Pursuant to the Bank Merger Act, the prior approval of the FDIC is required for our bank to merge with another bank or purchase all or substantially all of the assets or assume any of the deposits of another FDIC-insured depository institution. In reviewing certain merger or acquisition transactions, the federal regulators will consider the assessment of the competitive effect and public benefits of the transactions, the capital position and managerial resources of the combined organization, the risks to the stability of the U.S. banking or financial system, our performance record under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, or "CRA," our compliance with fair housing and other consumer protection laws, and the effectiveness of all organizations involved in combating money laundering activities. 

Under the BHCA, we may not engage in any business other than managing or controlling banks or furnishing services to our subsidiaries and such other activities that the FRB deems to be so closely related to banking as &#8220;to be a proper incident thereto.&#8221; We are also prohibited, with certain exceptions, from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5 percent of the voting shares of any company unless the company is engaged in banking activities or the FRB determines that the activity is so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to banking. The FRB&#8217;s approval must be obtained before the shares of any such company can be acquired and, in certain cases, before any approved company can open new offices. Additionally, bank holding companies that meet certain eligibility requirements may elect to operate as financial holding companies permitting them to engage in, or own shares in companies engaged in, a wider range of nonbanking activities. We have not elected to be treated as a financial holding company. 

The federal regulatory agencies also have general authority to prohibit a banking subsidiary or bank holding company from engaging in an unsafe or unsound banking practice. Depending upon the circumstances, the agencies could take the position that paying a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice. Further, as discussed below under &#8220;- Capital Requirements, &#8221; we are required to maintain minimum ratios of Common Equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital, and total capital to total risk&#8209;weighted assets, and a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to total adjusted quarterly average assets as defined in such regulations. The level of our capital ratios may affect our ability to pay dividends or repurchase our shares. See &#8220;Item 5. Market for Registrant&#8217;s Common Equity and Related Shareholder Matters-Dividends&#8221; and Note 19. Dividend Availability and Regulatory Matters , of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in &#8220;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.&#8221; 

The Dodd-Frank Act 

The Dodd&#8209;Frank Act, which was enacted in July 2010, significantly restructured the financial regulatory landscape in the United States, including the creation of a new systemic risk oversight body, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (the &#8220;FSOC&#8221;). The FSOC oversees and coordinates the efforts of the primary U.S. financial regulatory agencies (including the FRB, the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the FDIC) in establishing regulations to address financial stability concerns. The Dodd-Frank Act and the FRB&#8217;s implementing regulations impose increasingly stringent regulatory requirements on financial institutions as their size and scope of activities increases. With the April 7, 2014 CapitalSource Inc. merger, our total consolidated assets exceeded $15 billion, which subjects us to additional regulatory requirements for financial institutions with over $10 billion in total consolidated assets. This substantially increased the regulations we are required to meet, particularly with respect to risk management, capital planning, and stress testing in various parts of the Company and the Bank. In addition, the Company and the Bank are now subject to the examination and supervision of the CFPB. 

Transactions with Affiliates 

Transactions between the Bank and its affiliates are regulated under federal banking law. Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Federal Reserve Act, a bank may enter into &#8220;covered transactions&#8221; with its affiliates if the aggregate amount of the covered transactions to any single affiliate does not exceed 10 percent of the Bank&#8217;s capital stock and surplus or 20 percent of the Bank&#8217;s capital stock and surplus for covered transaction with all affiliates. Covered transactions include, among other things, extension of credit, the investment in securities, the purchase of assets, the acceptance of collateral or the issuance of a guaranty. The Dodd-Frank Act significantly expanded the coverage and scope of the limitations on affiliate transactions within a banking organization. 

Volcker Rule 

The Volcker Rule adopted pursuant to the Dodd&#8209;Frank Act prohibits banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in and sponsoring certain unregistered investment companies (hedge funds and private equity funds, defined as &#8220;covered funds&#8221;). Since the implementation of the Volcker Rule, the FRB has granted an extension of the Volcker Rule conformance period to July 21, 2016 for existing investments in and relationships with covered funds (relationships existing as of December 31, 2013). A similar one-year extension by the FRB is expected to further extend the Volcker Rule conformance period for existing investments in and relationships with such covered funds to July 21, 2017. We do not currently anticipate that the Volcker Rule will have a material effect on our operations, however, because many of the effects of the Volcker Rule may become apparent only over several years as the federal financial regulatory agencies apply the rule in practice, the precise financial impact of the rule on the Company, its customers or the financial industry more generally cannot currently be determined. 

Dividends 

The ability of the Company to pay dividends on its common stock, and the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Company, may be restricted due to several factors including: (a) the Delaware General Corporation Law, or &#8220;DGCL&#8221; (b) covenants contained in our subordinated debentures and borrowing agreements, and (c) the regulatory authority of the FRB and the California Department of Business Oversight, or &#8220;DBO&#8221;. Our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders is subject to the restrictions set forth in the DGCL. The DGCL provides that a corporation, unless otherwise restricted by its certificate of incorporation, may declare and pay dividends out of its surplus or, if there is no surplus, out of net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or for the preceding fiscal year, as long as the amount of capital of the corporation is not less than the aggregate amount of the capital represented by the issued and outstanding stock of all classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets. Surplus is defined as the excess of a corporation&#8217;s net assets (i.e., its total assets minus its total liabilities) over the capital associated with issuances of its common stock. Moreover, DGCL permits a board of directors to reduce its capital and transfer such amount to its surplus. In determining the amount of surplus of a Delaware corporation, the assets of the corporation, including stock of subsidiaries owned by the corporation, must be valued at their fair market value as determined by the board of directors, regardless of their historical book value. 

Our ability to pay cash dividends to our stockholders may be limited by certain covenants contained in the indentures governing trust preferred securities issued by us or entities that we have acquired, and the debentures underlying the trust preferred securities. Generally the indentures provide that if an Event of Default (as defined in the indentures) has occurred and is continuing, or if we are in default with respect to any obligations under our guarantee agreement which covers payments of the obligations on the trust preferred securities, or if we give notice of any intention to defer payments of interest on the debentures underlying the trust preferred securities, then we may not, among other restrictions, declare or pay any dividends with respect to our common stock. 

In addition, notification to the FRB is required prior to our declaring and paying a cash dividend to our stockholders during any period in which our quarterly and/or cumulative twelve&#8209;month net earnings are insufficient to fund the dividend amount, among other requirements. Under such circumstances, we may not pay a dividend should the FRB object until such time as we receive approval from the FRB or no longer need to provide notice under applicable regulations. 

In connection with the decision regarding dividends, we expect that our Board of Directors will take into account such matters as general business conditions, our financial results, projected cash flows, capital requirements, contractual, legal and regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by us to our stockholders or by our subsidiary to the holding company and such other factors as our Board of Directors may deem relevant. We can provide no assurance that we will continue to declare dividends on a quarterly basis or otherwise. The declaration of dividends by the Company is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors. 

PacWest&#8217;s primary source of liquidity is the receipt of cash dividends from Pacific Western. Various statutes and regulations limit the availability of cash dividends from Pacific Western. Dividends paid by Pacific Western are regulated by the DBO and FDIC under their general supervisory authority as it relates to a bank&#8217;s capital requirements. Pacific Western may declare a dividend without the approval of the DBO and FDIC as long as the total dividends declared in a calendar year do not exceed either the retained earnings or the total of net earnings for three previous fiscal years less any dividend paid during such period. Since the Bank had a retained deficit of $609 million at December 31, 2015, for the foreseeable future, any further cash dividends from the Bank to the Company will continue to require DBO and FDIC approval. It is possible, depending upon the financial condition of the bank in question, and other factors, that the FRB, the FDIC or the DBO could assert that payment of dividends or other payments is an unsafe or unsound practice. Pacific Western is subject to restrictions under certain federal and state laws and regulations governing banks which limit its ability to transfer funds to the holding company through intercompany loans, advances or cash dividends. 

See &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity&#8221; and Note 19. Dividend Availability and Regulatory Matters , of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in &#8220;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; for a discussion of other factors affecting the availability of dividends and limitations on the ability to declare dividends. 

Capital Requirements 

Prior to January 1, 2015, the risk-based capital standards applicable to the Company and the Bank (the &#8220;general risk-based capital rules&#8221;) were based on the 1988 Capital Accord, known as Basel I, of the Basel Committee. In 2013, the FRB and the FDIC approved final rules, or "Basel III", establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations. Basel III generally implemented the Basel Committee&#8217;s December 2010 final capital framework for strengthening international capital standards. Basel III substantially revised the risk&#8209;based capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and their depository institution subsidiaries, including the Company and the Bank, as compared to the general risk&#8209;based capital rules. Basel III became effective for the Company and the Bank as of January 1, 2015, subject to phase&#8209;in periods for certain of its components and other provisions. 

Basel III, among other things, (i) required increased capital levels for the Company and the Bank, (ii) introduced a new capital measure called Common Equity Tier 1 (&#8220;CET1&#8221;) and related regulatory capital ratio of CET1 to risk&#8209;weighted assets, (iii) specified that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and &#8220;Additional Tier 1 capital&#8221; instruments meeting certain revised requirements, (iv) mandated that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital, and (v) expanded the scope of the deductions from and adjustments to capital as compared to existing regulations. Under Basel III, for most banking organizations the most common form of Additional Tier 1 capital is non&#8209;cumulative perpetual preferred stock and the most common form of Tier 2 capital is subordinated notes and a portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses, in each case, subject to Basel III specific requirements. 

Pursuant to Basel III, the minimum capital ratios as of January 1, 2015 are as follows: 

&#8226; 

4.5% CET1 to risk&#8209;weighted assets; 

&#8226; 

6.0% Tier 1 capital (that is, CET1 plus &#32;Additional Tier 1 capital) to risk&#8209;weighted assets; 

&#8226; 

8.0% Total capital (that is, Tier 1 capital plus &#32;Tier 2 capital) to risk&#8209;weighted assets; and 

&#8226; 

4% Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets as reported on regulatory financial statements (known as the &#8220;leverage ratio&#8221;). 

Basel III also introduced a new &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221;, composed entirely of CET1, on top of the minimum risk&#8209;weighted asset ratios. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk&#8209;weighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 at a 0.625% level and will increase by 0.625% on each subsequent January 1 until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019. When fully phased&#8209;in, the Company and the Bank will be required to maintain such additional capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of CET1, effectively resulting in minimum ratios of (i) CET1 to risk&#8209;weighted assets of at least 7%, (ii) Tier 1 capital to risk&#8209;weighted assets of at least 8.5%, and (iii) total capital to risk&#8209;weighted assets of at least 10.5%. 

Basel III provided for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks and significant investments in non&#8209;consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such items, in the aggregate, exceed 15% of CET1. 

In addition, under the current general risk&#8209;based capital rules, the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss (&#8220;AOCI&#8221;) items included in stockholders&#8217; equity (for example, unrealized gains and losses of securities held in the available-for-sale portfolio) under U.S. GAAP are reversed for the purposes of determining regulatory capital ratios. Pursuant to Basel III, the effects of certain AOCI items are not excluded; however, non&#8209;advanced approaches banking organizations, including the Company and the Bank, are permitted to make a one&#8209;time permanent election to continue to exclude these items. The Company and the Bank made this election in order to avoid significant variations in the level of capital depending upon the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the fair value of our securities portfolio. 

Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 commenced on January 1, 2015 and will be phased&#8209;in over a 4&#8209;year period (beginning at 40% on January 1, 2015 and an additional 20% increase per year thereafter until reaching 100%). 

With respect to the Bank, Basel III revised the prompt corrective action regulations as described below under &#8220;- Prompt Corrective Action &#8221;. 

Basel III prescribed a new standardized approach for risk weightings that expand the risk&#8209;weighting categories from the current four Basel I&#8209;derived categories (0%, 20%, 50% and 100%) to a larger and more risk&#8209;sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the assets, generally ranging from 0% for U.S. government and agency securities, to 600% for certain equity exposures, resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset classes. 

The Company has outstanding subordinated debentures issued to trusts, which, in turn, issued trust preferred securities. The amount of subordinated debentures totaled $436.0 million at December 31, 2015 and includes $297.2 million of debentures assumed in connection with the CapitalSource Inc. merger. Under Basel III, as a result of the Company having exceeded $15 billion in consolidated total assets, beginning in 2015 only 25% of the $131.0 million of trust preferred securities issued prior to the CapitalSource Inc. merger (and none of the trust preferred securities acquired in the CapitalSource Inc. merger) is included in Tier 1 capital, and in 2016, none of the Company&#8217;s trust preferred securities will be included in Tier 1 capital. Under Basel III, trust preferred securities no longer included in the Company&#8217;s Tier 1 capital may be included as a component of Tier 2 capital on a permanent basis without phase-out. We believe that, as of December 31, 2015, the Company and the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements under Basel III. See &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Capital Resources-Capital&#8221; for further information on regulatory capital requirements, capital ratios, and deferred tax asset limits as of December 31, 2015 for the Company and the Bank. 

Stress Testing 

As an institution with total assets in excess of $10 billion, the stress testing rules of the FRB and the FDIC require the Company and the Bank to conduct an annual company-run stress test of capital, consolidated earnings and losses under one base scenario and at least two stress scenarios provided by the federal bank regulators. Stress test results must be reported to the regulatory agencies, and the stress testing rules require the public disclosure of a summary of the stress test results. The Company&#8217;s and Bank&#8217;s capital ratios reflected in the stress test calculations will be an important factor considered by the FRB and FDIC in evaluating the capital adequacy of the Company and the Bank, respectively, and whether any proposed payments of dividends or stock repurchases may be deemed an unsafe or unsound practice. The Company will be required to publicly disclose its first stress test results in October 2016. 

Prompt Corrective Action 

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act, or FDICIA, requires each federal banking agency to take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of insured depository institutions, including but not limited to those that fall below one or more prescribed minimum capital ratios. Pursuant to FDICIA, the FDIC promulgated regulations defining the following five categories in which an insured depository institution will be placed, based on the level of its capital ratios: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. A bank&#8217;s category is determined solely for the purpose of applying prompt corrective action regulations, and the capital category may not constitute an accurate representation of the bank&#8217;s overall financial condition or prospects for other purposes. 

Under the prompt corrective action, or &#8220;PCA&#8221;, provisions of the FDICIA, an insured depository institution generally will be classified as undercapitalized if its total risk&#8209;based capital is less than 8% or its Tier 1 risk&#8209;based capital or leverage ratio is less than 4%. Basel III revised the PCA regulations by: (i) introducing a CET1 ratio requirement at each PCA category (other than critically undercapitalized), with the required CET1 ratio being 6.5% for well capitalized status; (ii) increasing the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirement for each category, with the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio for well capitalized status being 8% (as compared to the prior 6%); and (iii) eliminating the provision that provides that a bank with a composite supervisory rating of 1 may have a 3% leverage ratio and still be adequately capitalized (under Basel III a 5% leverage ratio is required for an institution to be well capitalized and a 4% leverage ratio is required to be adequately capitalized). Basel III does not change the total risk&#8209;based capital requirement for any PCA category. An institution that, based upon its capital levels, is classified as &#8220;well capitalized&#8221;, &#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221; or &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221; may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or an unsafe or unsound practice warrants such treatment. At each successive lower capital category, an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions and prohibitions, including restrictions on growth, restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, prohibitions on payment of dividends and restrictions on the acceptance of brokered deposits. Furthermore, if a bank is classified in one of the undercapitalized categories, it is required to submit a capital restoration plan to its federal bank regulator, and the holding company must guarantee the performance of that plan. The obligation of a controlling bank holding company to fund a capital restoration plan is limited to the lesser of 5% of an undercapitalized subsidiary&#8217;s assets or the amount required to meet regulatory capital requirements. 

In addition to measures taken under the prompt corrective action provisions, commercial banking organizations, such as the Bank, may be subject to potential enforcement actions by the federal or state banking agencies for unsafe or unsound 

practices in conducting their businesses or for violations of any law, rule, regulation or any condition imposed in writing by the agency or any written agreement with the agency. Enforcement actions may include the imposition of a conservator or receiver, the issuance of a cease&#8209;and&#8209;desist order that can be judicially enforced, the termination of insurance for deposits (in the case of a depository institution), the imposition of civil money penalties, the issuance of directives to increase capital, the issuance of formal and informal agreements, the issuance of removal and prohibition orders against institution&#8209;affiliated parties. The enforcement of such actions through injunctions or restraining orders may be based upon a judicial determination that the agency would be harmed if such equitable relief was not granted. 

Safety and Soundness Standards 

As required by the FDIA, guidelines adopted by the federal bank regulatory agencies establish general standards relating to internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth and quality, and compensation, fees and benefits. Bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more are required to establish and maintain risk management committees for their boards of directors to oversee the bank holding companies&#8217; risk management framework. In April 2014, our Board of Directors formed the Risk Committee to oversee our risk management framework. 

Deposit Insurance 

The Bank is a state&#8209;chartered, &#8220;non&#8209;member&#8221; bank and therefore is regulated by the DBO and the FDIC. Pacific Western accepts deposits, and those deposits have the benefit of FDIC insurance up to the applicable limits. The applicable limit for FDIC insurance for most types of accounts is $250,000. 

Pursuant to the Dodd&#8209;Frank Act, the FDIC amended its regulations to determine insurance assessments based on the average consolidated assets less the average tangible equity of the insured depository institution during the assessment period. In 2010, the FDIC adopted its Deposit Insurance Fund restoration plan to ensure that the fund reserve ratio reaches 1.35% of total deposits by September 30, 2020. Insured institutions with assets over $10 billion, such as the Bank, are responsible for funding the increase. The FDIC has established a long-term target for the fund reserve ratio of 2.0%. At least semi&#8209;annually, the FDIC will update its loss and income projections for the fund and, if needed, will increase or decrease assessment rates. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded $12.7 million of FDIC assessment expense. 

Under the FDIA, the FDIC may terminate deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. 

Incentive Compensation 

In 2010, federal banking regulators issued final joint agency guidance on Sound Incentive Compensation Policies. This guidance applies to executive and non-executive incentive plans administered by the Bank. The guidance notes that incentive compensation programs must (i) provide employees incentives that appropriately balance risk and reward, (ii) be compatible with effective controls and risk management and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including oversight by the board. The FRB reviews, as part of its regular examination process, the Company&#8217;s incentive compensation programs. 

In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act required the federal bank regulatory agencies and the SEC to establish joint regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentive based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities having at least $1 billion in total assets, such as the Company and the Bank, that encourage inappropriate risks by providing an executive officer, employee, director or principal stockholder with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits that could lead to material financial loss to the entity. In addition, these regulators must establish regulations or guidelines requiring enhanced disclosure of incentive based compensation arrangements to regulators. The agencies proposed such regulations in April 2011, but these regulations have not yet been finalized. If the regulations are adopted in the form initially proposed, they will impose limitations on the manner in which we may structure compensation for our executives. 

Consumer Regulation 

We are subject to a number of federal and state consumer protection laws that extensively govern our relationship with our customers. These laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure 

Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Service Members Civil Relief Act and these laws&#8217; respective state-law counterparts, as well as state usury laws and laws regarding unfair and deceptive acts and practices. Violations of applicable consumer protection laws can result in significant potential liability from litigation brought by customers, including actual damages, restitution and attorneys&#8217; fees. Federal bank regulators, state attorneys general and state and local consumer protection agencies may also seek to enforce consumer protection requirements and obtain these and other remedies, including regulatory sanctions, customer rescission rights, action by the state and local attorneys general in each jurisdiction in which we operate and civil money penalties. Failure to comply with consumer protection requirements may also result in our failure to obtain any required bank regulatory approval for merger or acquisition transactions we may wish to pursue or our prohibition from engaging in such transactions even if approval is not required. 

The Dodd&#8209;Frank Act established the CFPB with broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws. The CFPB is also authorized to engage in consumer financial education, track consumer complaints, request data and promote the availability of financial services to underserved consumers and communities. Banking organizations with more than $10 billion in assets, such as the Bank, are subject to direct oversight and examination by the CFPB. The consumer protection provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and the examination, supervision and enforcement of those laws and implementing regulations by the CFPB have created a more intense and complex environment for consumer finance regulation. The ultimate impact of this heightened scrutiny is uncertain but could result in changes to pricing, practices, products and procedures. It could also result in increased costs related to regulatory oversight, supervision and examination, additional remediation efforts and possible penalties. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act provides the CFPB with broad supervisory, examination and enforcement authority over various consumer financial products and services, including the ability to require reimbursements and other payments to customers for alleged legal violations and to impose significant penalties, as well as injunctive relief that prohibits lenders from engaging in allegedly unlawful practices. The CFPB also has the authority to obtain cease and desist orders providing for affirmative relief or monetary penalties. The Dodd-Frank Act does not prevent states from adopting stricter consumer protection standards. State regulation of financial products and potential enforcement actions could also adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

Depositor Preference 

The FDIA provides that, in the event of the &#8220;liquidation or other resolution&#8221; of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors of the institution, including the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors, and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver, will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution. If an insured depository institution fails, insured and uninsured depositors, along with the FDIC, will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured, non&#8209;deposit creditors, including the parent bank holding company, with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution. 

USA PATRIOT Act and Anti-Money Laundering 

The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001, or "PATRIOT Act," designed to deny terrorists and others the ability to obtain access to the United States financial system, has significant implications for depository institutions, brokers, dealers and other businesses involved in the transfer of money. The PATRIOT Act, as implemented by various federal regulatory agencies, requires the Company and the Bank to establish and implement policies and procedures with respect to, among other matters, anti&#8209;money laundering, compliance, suspicious activity and currency transaction reporting and due diligence on customers and prospective customers. The PATRIOT Act and its underlying regulations permit information sharing for counter&#8209;terrorist purposes between federal law enforcement agencies and financial institutions, as well as among financial institutions, subject to certain conditions, and require the FRB, the FDIC and other federal banking agencies to evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in combating money laundering activities when considering a bank holding company acquisition and/or a bank merger act application. 

We regularly evaluate and continue to enhance our systems and procedures to continue to comply with the PATRIOT Act and other anti&#8209;money laundering initiatives. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal, strategic, and reputational consequences for the institution and result in material fines and sanctions. 

Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation 

The United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, designated nationals and others. These rules are based on their administration by the U.S. Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control, or &#8220;OFAC&#8221;. The OFAC&#8209;administered sanctions targeting designated countries take many different forms. Generally, however, they contain one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned 

country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on &#8220;U.S. persons&#8221; engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in, or providing investment&#8209;related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country; and (ii) a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons). Blocked assets (e.g., property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal, strategic, and reputational consequences, and result in civil money penalties on the Company and the Bank. 

Community Reinvestment Act 

The CRA generally requires the Bank to identify the communities we serve and to make loans and investments, offer products, make donations in, and provide services designed to meet the credit needs of these communities. The CRA also requires the Bank to maintain comprehensive records of its CRA activities to demonstrate how we are meeting the credit needs of our communities. These documents are subject to periodic examination by the FDIC. During these examinations, the FDIC rates such institutions&#8217; compliance with CRA as &#8220;Outstanding,&#8221; &#8220;Satisfactory,&#8221; &#8220;Needs to Improve&#8221; or &#8220;Substantial Noncompliance.&#8221; The CRA requires the FDIC to take into account the record of a bank in meeting the credit needs of all of the communities served, including low&#8209;and moderate&#8209;income neighborhoods, in determining such rating. Failure of an institution to receive at least a &#8220;Satisfactory&#8221; rating could inhibit such institution or its holding company from undertaking certain activities, including acquisitions. The Bank received a CRA rating of &#8220;Satisfactory&#8221; as of its most recent examination. In the case of a bank holding company, such as the Company, when applying to acquire a bank, savings association, or a bank holding company, the FRB will assess the CRA record of each depository institution of the applicant bank holding company in considering the application. 

Customer Information Security 

The FRB and other bank regulatory agencies have adopted guidelines for safeguarding confidential, personal, non&#8209;public customer information. These guidelines require each financial institution, under the supervision and ongoing oversight of its board of directors or an appropriate committee thereof, to create, implement and maintain a comprehensive written information security program designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information, protect against any anticipated threats or hazard to the security or integrity of such information and protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. We have adopted a customer information security program to comply with these requirements. 

Privacy 

The Gramm&#8209;Leach&#8209;Bliley Act of 1999 and the California Financial Information Privacy Act require financial institutions to implement policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of non-public personal information about consumers to non&#8209;affiliated third parties. In general, the statutes require explanations to consumers on policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of such non-public personal information and, except as otherwise required by law, prohibit disclosing such information except as provided in the Bank&#8217;s policies and procedures. We have implemented privacy policies addressing these restrictions, which are distributed regularly to all existing and new customers of the Bank. 

Hazardous Waste Clean &#8209; Up and Climate &#8209; Related Risk 

Our primary exposure to environmental laws is through our lending activities and through properties or businesses we may own, lease or acquire, or which are collateral for our loans, since we are not involved in any business that manufactures, uses or transports chemicals, waste, pollutants or toxins that might have a material adverse effect on the environment. Based on a general survey of the Bank&#8217;s loan portfolio, conversations with local appraisers and the type of lending currently and historically done by the Bank, we are not presently aware of any actual liability for hazardous waste contamination that would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company as of February 20, 2016. In addition, we are not aware of any physical or regulatory consequence resulting from climate change that would have a material adverse effect upon the Company. 

Regulation of Certain Subsidiaries 

Our subsidiary, Square One Asset Management, Inc. is registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, and is subject to its rules and regulations. Following the completion of various studies on investment advisers and broker-dealers required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC has, among other things, recommended to Congress that it consider 

various means to enhance the SEC&#8217;s examination authority over investment advisers, which may have an impact on Square One Asset Management that we cannot currently assess.
