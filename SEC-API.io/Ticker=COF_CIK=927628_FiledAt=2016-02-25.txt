 Item 1. Business 

OVERVIEW 

General 

Capital One Financial Corporation, a Delaware Corporation established in 1994 and headquartered in McLean, Virginia, is a diversified financial services holding company with banking and non-banking subsidiaries. Capital One Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) offer a broad array of financial products and services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients through branches, the internet and other distribution channels. 

As of December 31, 2015 , our principal subsidiaries included: 

&#8226; 

Capital One Bank (USA), National Association (&#8220;COBNA&#8221;), which offers credit and debit card products, other lending products and deposit products; and 

&#8226; 

Capital One, National Association (&#8220;CONA&#8221;), which offers a broad spectrum of banking products and financial services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients. 

The Company is hereafter collectively referred to as &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; or &#8220;our.&#8221; COBNA and CONA are collectively referred to as the &#8220;Banks.&#8221; References to &#8220;this Report&#8221; or our &#8220; 2015 &#32;Form 10-K&#8221; or &#8220; 2015 &#32;Annual Report&#8221; are to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 . All references to 2015 , 2014 , 2013 , 2012 &#32;and 2011 , refer to our fiscal years ended, or the dates, as the context requires, December 31, 2015 , December 31, 2014 , December 31, 2013 , December 31, 2012 &#32;and December 31, 2011 , respectively. Certain business terms used in this document are defined in the &#8220;MD&#38;A&#8212;Glossary and Acronyms&#8221; and should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report. 

As one of the nation&#8217;s ten largest banks based on deposits as of December 31, 2015 , we service banking customer accounts through the internet and mobile banking, as well as through ATMs and branch locations primarily across New York, Louisiana, Texas, Maryland, Virginia, New Jersey and the District of Columbia . We also operate the largest online direct banking institution in the United States (&#8220;U.S.&#8221;) by deposits. In addition to bank lending, treasury management and depository services, we offer credit and debit card products, auto loans and mortgage banking in markets across the United States. We were the fourth largest issuer of Visa &#174; &#32;(&#8220;Visa&#8221;) and MasterCard &#174; &#32;(&#8220;MasterCard&#8221;) credit cards in the United States based on the outstanding balance of credit card loans as of December 31, 2015 . 

We also offer products outside of the United States principally through Capital One (Europe) plc (&#8220;COEP&#8221;), an indirect subsidiary of COBNA organized and located in the United Kingdom (&#8220;U.K.&#8221;), and through a branch of COBNA in Canada. COEP has authority, among other things, to provide credit card and installment loans. Our branch of COBNA in Canada has the authority to provide credit card loans. 

Recent Acquisitions and Dispositions 

We regularly explore and evaluate opportunities to acquire financial services and financial assets, including credit card and other loan portfolios, and enter into strategic partnerships as part of our growth strategy. We also explore opportunities to acquire digital companies and related assets to improve our information technology infrastructure and to deliver on our digital strategy. We also regularly consider the potential disposition of certain of our assets, branches, partnership agreements or lines of businesses. We may issue equity or debt in connection with acquisitions, including public offerings, to fund such acquisitions. Below we provide information on acquisitions and dispositions completed in 2015, 2014 and 2013: 

&#8226; 

On December 1, 2015, we completed the acquisition of the Healthcare Financial Services business of General Electric Capital Corporation (&#8220;GE Healthcare acquisition&#8221;). As part of this acquisition, we recorded approximately $9.2 billion &#32;in assets, including $8.3 billion &#32;of loans. 

&#8226; 

On November 1, 2013, we completed the acquisition of Beech Street Capital, a privately-held, national originator and servicer of the Federal National Mortgage Association (&#8220;Fannie Mae&#8221;), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (&#8220;Freddie Mac&#8221;) and the Federal Housing Administration (&#8220;FHA&#8221;) multifamily commercial real estate loans. At closing, 

&#160; 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) 

we acquired a mortgage servicing portfolio on approximately $10 billion of loans. Beech Street Capital was renamed Capital One Multifamily Finance in 2014. 

&#8226; 

On September 6, 2013, we completed the sale of the Best Buy private label and co-branded credit card portfolio to Citibank, N.A. (&#8220;Portfolio Sale&#8221;). Pursuant to the agreement with Citibank, N.A., we received $6.4 billion for the net portfolio assets. 

See &#8220; Note 2&#8212;Business Developments &#8221; for additional information on our business acquisitions and dispositions. 

Additional Information 

Our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange (&#8220;NYSE&#8221;) under the symbol &#8220;COF&#8221; and is included in the Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s (&#8220;S&#38;P&#8221;) 100 Index. Our principal executive office is located at 1680 Capital One Drive, McLean, Virginia 22102, telephone number (703) 720-1000. We maintain a website at www.capitalone.com. Documents available on our website include: (i) our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for the Corporation; (ii) our Corporate Governance Guidelines; and (iii) charters for the Audit, Compensation, Governance and Nominating, and Risk Committees of the Board of Directors. These documents also are available in print to any stockholder who requests a copy. 

In addition, we make available free of charge through our website our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after electronically filing or furnishing such material to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;). 

OPERATIONS AND BUSINESS SEGMENTS 

Our consolidated total net revenues are derived primarily from lending to consumer and commercial customers net of funding costs associated with deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt. We also earn non-interest income which primarily consists of interchange income net of reward expenses, and service charges and other customer-related fees. Our expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses, operating expenses (including salaries and associate benefits, occupancy and equipment costs, professional services, communication and data processing expenses and other miscellaneous expenses), marketing expenses and income taxes. 

Our principal operations are currently organized for management reporting purposes into three primary business segments, which are defined primarily based on the products and services provided or the type of customer served: Credit Card, Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. The operations of acquired businesses have been integrated into our existing business segments. Certain activities that are not part of a segment, such as management of our corporate investment portfolio and asset/liability management by our centralized Corporate Treasury group, are included in the Other category. 

&#8226; 

Credit Card: &#32;Consists of our domestic consumer and small business card lending, and the international card lending businesses in Canada and the United Kingdom. 

&#8226; 

Consumer Banking: &#32;Consists of our branch-based lending and deposit gathering activities for consumers and small businesses, national deposit gathering, national auto lending and consumer home loan lending and servicing activities. 

&#8226; 

Commercial Banking: &#32;Consists of our lending, deposit gathering and treasury management services to commercial real estate and commercial and industrial customers. Our commercial and industrial customers typically include companies with annual revenues between $10 million and $1 billion. 

Customer usage and payment patterns, credit quality, levels of marketing expense and operating efficiency all affect our profitability. In our Credit Card business, we experience fluctuations in purchase volume and the level of outstanding loan receivables due to higher seasonal consumer spending and payment patterns around the winter holiday season, summer vacations and back-to-school periods. No individual quarter in 2015, 2014 or 2013 accounted for more than 30% of our total revenues in any of these fiscal years. Net charge-off rates in our Credit Card and Consumer Banking businesses also have historically exhibited seasonal patterns and generally tend to be the highest in the first and fourth quarters of the year.

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) 

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION 

General 

Capital One Financial Corporation is a bank holding company (&#8220;BHC&#8221;) under Section 3 of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (12 U.S.C. &#167; 1842) (&#8220;BHC Act&#8221;) and is subject to the requirements of the BHC Act, including its required approvals for investments in or acquisitions of banking organizations, capital adequacy standards and limitations on our nonbanking activities. We are also subject to supervision, examination and regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (&#8220;Federal Reserve&#8221;). Permissible activities for a BHC include those activities that are so closely related to banking as to be proper incidents thereto, such as consumer lending and other activities that have been approved by the Federal Reserve by regulation or order. Certain servicing activities are also permissible for a BHC if conducted for or on behalf of the BHC or any of its affiliates. Impermissible activities for BHCs generally include nonfinancial activities such as sales of commercial products. 

On May 27, 2005, we became a &#8220;financial holding company&#8221; under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act amendments to the BHC Act (&#8220;GLBA&#8221;). The GLBA removed many of the restrictions on the activities of BHCs that become financial holding companies. A financial holding company, and the nonbank companies under its control, are permitted to engage in activities considered financial in nature (including, for example, insurance underwriting, agency sales and brokerage, securities underwriting and dealing and merchant banking activities), incidental to financial activities and, if the Federal Reserve determines that they pose no risk to the safety or soundness of depository institutions or the financial system in general, activities complementary to financial activities. 

For a BHC to become and remain eligible for financial holding company status, the BHC and its subsidiary depository institutions must meet certain criteria, including capital, management and Community Reinvestment Act (&#8220;CRA&#8221;) requirements. The failure to meet such criteria could, depending on which requirements were not met, result in the Company facing restrictions on new financial activities or acquisitions or being required to discontinue existing activities that are not generally permissible for BHCs. 

The Banks are national associations chartered under the laws of the United States, the deposits of which are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund (&#8220;DIF&#8221;) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;) up to applicable limits. In addition to regulatory requirements imposed as a result of COBNA&#8217;s international operations (discussed below), the Banks are subject to comprehensive regulation and periodic examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (&#8220;OCC&#8221;), the FDIC and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (&#8220;CFPB&#8221;). 

We also are registered as a financial institution holding company under Virginia law and, as such, we are subject to periodic examination by Virginia&#8217;s Bureau of Financial Institutions. We also face regulation in the international jurisdictions in which we conduct business (see below under &#8220;Regulation of International Business by Non-U.S. Authorities&#8221;). 

Regulation of Business Activities 

The business activities of the Company and Banks also are subject to regulation and supervision under various laws and regulations. 

Regulations of Consumer Lending Activities 

The activities of the Banks as consumer lenders are subject to regulation under various federal laws, including the Truth in Lending Act (&#8220;TILA&#8221;), the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the CRA, the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (&#8220;SCRA&#8221;) and the Military Lending Act, as well as under various state laws. Depending on the underlying issue and applicable law, regulators are often authorized to impose penalties for violations of these statutes and, in certain cases, to order banks to compensate injured borrowers. Borrowers may also have a private right of action for certain violations. Federal bankruptcy and state debtor relief and collection laws also affect the ability of a bank to collect outstanding balances owed by borrowers. These laws may affect the ability of banks to collect outstanding balances. 

The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act (amending the TILA) enacted in May 2009, and related changes to Regulation Z, impose a number of restrictions on credit card practices impacting rates and fees, require that a consumer&#8217;s ability to pay be taken into account before issuing credit or increasing credit limits, and update the disclosures required for open-end credit. 

&#160; 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) 

Mortgage Lending 

The CFPB has issued several final rules pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (&#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;) that provide additional disclosure requirements and substantive limitations on our mortgage lending activities. These rules, which include the Ability-to-Repay and Qualified Mortgage Standards under the TILA (Regulation Z) and Integrated Mortgage Disclosures under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (Regulation X) and the TILA (Regulation Z), could impact the type and amount of mortgage loans we offer. 

Under the Dodd-Frank Act credit risk retention rules, securitizers also are generally required to retain a 5% economic interest in the credit risk of assets sold through the issuance of asset-backed securitizations, with an exemption for traditionally underwritten residential mortgage loans that meet the definition of a qualified residential mortgage loan. The final implementing rules on risk retention define a qualified residential mortgage loan to be identical to the CFPB&#8217;s definition of a qualified mortgage loan. Therefore, we may securitize such loans without being required to retain credit risk under these rules. 

Debit Interchange Fees 

The Dodd-Frank Act requires that the amount of any interchange fee received by a debit card issuer with respect to debit card transactions be reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer with respect to the transaction. In 2011 and 2012, the Federal Reserve adopted final rules that implement the portion of the Dodd-Frank Act that limits interchange fees received by a debit card issuer. The final rules limited interchange fees per debit card transaction to $0.21 plus five basis points of the transaction amount and provided for an additional $0.01 fraud prevention adjustment to the interchange fee for issuers that meet certain fraud prevention requirements. In August 2015, the Federal Reserve issued a clarification regarding the inclusion of transaction-monitoring costs in its interchange fee rules, which clarification did not have any impact on the rules or our debit card business. The clarification followed a series of decisions in the federal courts that upheld the interchange rules. 

Bank Secrecy Act and USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 

The Bank Secrecy Act and the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (&#8220;Patriot Act&#8221;) require financial institutions, among other things, to implement a risk-based program reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and to combat the financing of terrorism, including through suspicious activity and currency transaction reporting, compliance, record-keeping and due diligence on customers. 

The Patriot Act also contains financial transparency laws and enhanced information collection tools and enforcement mechanisms for the U.S. government, including: due diligence and record-keeping requirements for private banking and correspondent accounts; standards for verifying customer identification at account opening; and rules to produce certain records upon request of a regulator or law enforcement and to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators, and law enforcement in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism, money laundering and other crimes. 

Funding 

Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (&#8220;FDICIA&#8221;), as discussed in &#8220;MD&#38;A&#8212; Liquidity Risk Profile ,&#8221; only well-capitalized and adequately-capitalized institutions may accept brokered deposits. Adequately-capitalized institutions, however, must first obtain a waiver from the FDIC before accepting brokered deposits, and such deposits may not pay rates that significantly exceed the rates paid on deposits of similar maturity from the institution&#8217;s normal market area or, for deposits from outside the institution&#8217;s normal market area, the national rate on deposits of comparable maturity. The FDIC is authorized to terminate a bank&#8217;s deposit insurance upon a finding by the FDIC that the bank&#8217;s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule, regulation, order or condition enacted or imposed by the bank&#8217;s regulatory agency. The termination of deposit insurance for a bank could have a material adverse effect on its liquidity and its earnings. 

For any of our funding conducted through securitization, in addition to the credit risk retention provision requiring a securitizer to retain a portion of the credit risk of an asset-backed securitization, the Dodd-Frank Act also prohibits conflicts of interest relating to securitizations. 

Nonbank Activities 

Certain of our nonbank subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by various other federal and state authorities. Capital One Securities, Inc. and Capital One Investing, LLC (formerly known as Capital One Sharebuilder, Inc.) are registered broker- 

&#160; 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) 

dealers regulated by the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. Our broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to, among other things, net capital rules designed to measure the general financial condition and liquidity of a broker-dealer. Under these rules, broker-dealers are required to maintain the minimum net capital deemed necessary to meet their continuing commitments to customers and others, and are required to keep a substantial portion of their assets in relatively liquid form. These rules also limit the ability of broker-dealers to transfer capital to parent companies and other affiliates. Broker-dealers are also subject to other regulations covering their business operations, including sales and trading practices, public offerings, publication of research reports, use and safekeeping of client funds and securities, capital structure, record-keeping and the conduct of directors, officers and employees. 

Capital One Asset Management LLC and Capital One Advisors, LLC (formerly known as ShareBuilder Advisors, LLC) are SEC-registered investment advisers regulated under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Capital One Asset Management LLC, whose sole client is CONA, provides investment advice to CONA&#8217;s private banking customers, including trusts, high net worth individuals, institutions, foundations, endowments and other organizations, 

Finally, Capital One Agency LLC is a licensed insurance agency that provides both personal and business insurance services to retail and commercial clients and is regulated by the New York State Department of Financial Services in its home state and by the state insurance regulatory agencies in the states in which it operates. 

Derivative Activities 

In 2012, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (&#8220;CFTC&#8221;) and the SEC jointly issued final rules further defining the Dodd-Frank Act&#8217;s &#8220;swap dealer&#8221; definitions. Based on the final rules, no Capital One entity will be required to register with the CFTC or SEC as a swap dealer; however, this may change in the future. If such registration occurs, the registered entity is required to comply with additional regulatory requirements relating to its derivatives activities. The Dodd-Frank Act also requires all swap market participants to keep swap transaction data records and report certain information to swap data repositories on a real-time and on-going basis. Further, each swap, group, category, type or class of swap that the CFTC or SEC determines must be cleared will need to be cleared through a derivatives clearinghouse unless the swap is eligible for a clearing exemption and executed on a designated contract market (&#8220;DCM&#8221;), exchange or swap execution facility (&#8220;SEF&#8221;), unless no DCM, exchange or SEF has made the swap available for trading. 

Volcker Rule 

We and each of our subsidiaries, including the Banks, are subject to the &#8220;Volcker Rule,&#8221; a provision of the Dodd-Frank Act that contains prohibitions on proprietary trading and certain investments in, and relationships with, covered funds (hedge funds, private equity funds, and similar funds), subject to certain exemptions and in each case as those terms are defined in the rule. The implementing regulations require that we maintain a robust compliance program in accordance with the requirements of the rule. 

Capital Adequacy 

The Company and the Banks are subject to capital adequacy guidelines adopted by the Federal Reserve and OCC. For a further discussion of the capital adequacy guidelines, see &#8220;MD&#38;A&#8212;Capital Management&#8221; and &#8220;Note 13&#8212;Regulatory and Capital Adequacy.&#8221; The Company and the Banks exceeded minimum regulatory requirements under these guidelines as of December 31, 2015. 

Basel III and U.S. Capital and Liquidity Rules 

In December 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (&#8220;Basel Committee&#8221;) published a final framework on additional capital and liquidity requirements (&#8220;Basel III&#8221;), which included detailed capital ratios and buffers, subject to transition periods through 2018. In November 2011, the Basel Committee adopted a framework that would impose an additional common equity Tier 1 capital buffer on globally systemically important banking organizations (&#8220;G-SIBs&#8221;), which surcharge would vary based on the company&#8217;s systemic importance as determined using five criteria: size, interconnectedness, cross-jurisdictional activity, substitutability and complexity (&#8220;G-SIB Surcharge&#8221;). As discussed further below, Capital One is currently not identified as a G-SIB. In January 2014, the Basel Committee made changes to the leverage ratio rules to account for differences in national accounting frameworks. The Basel Committee continues to evaluate further modifications to these and other capital standards, which, if finalized, would require rulemaking in the United States prior to their effectiveness for U.S. banking organizations. 

The Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC (collectively, the &#8220;Federal Banking Agencies&#8221;) issued a rule in July 2013 that implemented the Basel III capital framework developed by the Basel Committee and certain Dodd-Frank Act and other capital provisions, and 

&#160; 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) 

that updated the prompt corrective action (&#8220;PCA&#8221;) framework to reflect the new regulatory capital minimums (&#8220;Final Basel III Capital Rule&#8221;). The Final Basel III Capital Rule increases the minimum capital that we and other institutions are required to hold. 

Prior to being revised in the Final Basel III Capital Rule in 2013, the minimum risk-based capital requirements adopted by the Federal Banking Agencies followed Basel I. In December 2007 the &#8220;Advanced Approaches&#8221; version of Basel II was adopted. The Final Basel III Capital Rule modified both Basel I and the Basel II Advanced Approaches (as modified, referred to respectively as the &#8220;Basel III Standardized Approach&#8221; and the &#8220;Basel III Advanced Approaches&#8221;). 

The Basel III Advanced Approaches is mandatory for those institutions with total consolidated assets of $250 billion or more or total consolidated on-balance-sheet foreign exposure of $10 billion or more. We became subject to these rules at the end of 2012. Prior to full implementation of the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework, organizations must complete a qualification period, known as the parallel run, during which they must meet the requirements of the rule to the satisfaction of their primary U.S. banking regulator. According to the rule, parallel run must last at least four quarters, though in practice it has taken U.S. banks considerably longer to complete parallel run. We entered parallel run on January 1, 2015. Compliance with the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework requires a material investment of resources in building processes and systems. 

The so-called Collins Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act, as implemented in the Final Basel III Capital Rule, establishes a capital floor so that organizations subject to the Basel III Advanced Approaches may not hold less capital than would be required using the Basel III Standardized Approach capital calculations. Based on current rules and our business mix, we estimate that our Basel III Advanced Approaches ratios will be lower than our Standardized Approach ratios. 

The Final Basel III Capital Rule revised the definition of regulatory capital, established a new common equity Tier 1 capital requirement, set higher minimum capital ratio requirements, introduced a new capital conservation buffer of 2.5%, introduced a new countercyclical capital buffer (currently set at 0.0%) and updated the PCA framework. Compliance with certain aspects of the Final Basel III Capital Rule went into effect for Capital One as of January 1, 2014 and other provisions go into effect according to different start dates and phase-in periods. As of January 1, 2014, the minimum risk-based and leverage capital requirements for Advanced Approaches banking organizations included a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 4.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 5.5%, a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.0% and a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of at least 4.0%. On January 1, 2015, the minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements increased to 4.5% for the common equity Tier 1 capital ratio and to 6.0% for the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, and the minimum requirements for the total risk-based capital ratio and Tier 1 leverage capital ratio remained the same. Both the capital conservation buffer and the countercyclical capital buffer will be phased-in over a transition period of four years commencing on January 1, 2016. On January 1, 2014, we started to use the Basel III Standardized Approach, including transition provisions, for calculating our capital ratios. On January 1, 2015, we began to use the Basel III Standardized Approach for calculating our risk-weighted assets in our regulatory capital ratios, which were previously calculated under Basel I. 

The Final Basel III Capital Rules also introduced a new supplementary leverage ratio (&#8220;SLR&#8221;) for all Advanced Approaches banking organizations with a minimum requirement of 3.0%. In September 2014, the Federal Banking Agencies issued a final rule that revised the calculation of total leverage exposures. The SLR compares Tier 1 capital to total leverage exposures and includes all on-balance sheet assets and many off-balance sheet assets, including derivatives and unused commitments. The new SLR becomes effective on January 1, 2018. However, as an Advanced Approaches banking organization, we were required to calculate and publicly disclose our SLR beginning in the first quarter of 2015. 

For further information see &#8220;Part II&#8212;Item 7. MD&#38;A&#8212;Capital Management.&#8221; 

On July 20, 2015, the Federal Reserve approved a final rule establishing a G-SIB Surcharge for U.S.-based G-SIBs. The final rule establishes a methodology for determining which U.S. BHCs are considered G-SIBs and thus subject to a G-SIB Surcharge. A U.S. BHC whose score using the prescribed methodology equals or exceeds 130 is considered a G-SIB under the final rule. U.S. BHCs with total consolidated assets of $250 billion or more or total consolidated on-balance-sheet foreign exposure of $10 billion or more are required to determine annually, before December 31, beginning in 2015, whether or not they are considered G-SIBs for purposes of the G-SIB Surcharge. In connection with approving the final rule, the Federal Reserve identified eight U.S. BHCs that would be identified as G-SIBs based on the most recent available data. Capital One was not identified as a G-SIB based on the most recent available data. 

The Basel Committee also published a liquidity framework in December 2010, which was subsequently amended. The liquidity framework includes two standards for liquidity risk supervision, each subject to observation periods and transitional arrangements. One standard, the liquidity coverage ratio (&#8220;LCR&#8221;), seeks to promote short-term resilience by requiring sufficient high-quality 

&#160; 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) 

liquid assets to survive a stress scenario lasting for 30 days. The other standard, the net stable funding ratio (&#8220;NSFR&#8221;), seeks to promote longer-term resilience by requiring sufficient stable funding over a one-year period, based on the liquidity characteristics of assets and activities. We expect that minimum liquidity requirements for us and other institutions will increase as a result of the Basel III liquidity framework, though rules implementing the Basel III NSFR have not yet been proposed by the Federal Banking Agencies. 

In September 2014, the Federal Banking Agencies issued final rules implementing the LCR in the United States. The rule (&#8220;Final LCR Rule&#8221;) applies to institutions with total consolidated assets of $250 billion or more or total consolidated on-balance sheet foreign exposure of $10 billion or more, and their respective consolidated subsidiary depository institutions with $10 billion or more in total consolidated assets. As a result, the Company and the Banks are subject to the Final LCR Rule. The Final LCR Rule requires the Company and each of the Banks to hold an amount of eligible high-quality, liquid assets that equals or exceeds 100% of their respective projected net cash outflows over a 30-day period, each as calculated in accordance with the Final LCR Rule. The Final LCR Rule phases in the minimum LCR standard as follows: 80% by January 1, 2015; 90% by January 1, 2016; and 100% by January 1, 2017 and thereafter. The Final LCR Rule came into effect in January 2015 and requires us to calculate the LCR as of the last business day of each month from January 2015 until July 2016. As of July 1, 2016, the Final LCR Rule requires us to calculate the LCR on a daily basis. In preparation for the Final LCR Rule, we modified the composition of our investment portfolio, with some of those actions resulting in us purchasing types of securities that are lower yielding than securities we otherwise would have purchased if not for the Final LCR Rule. 

We will continue to monitor regulators&#8217; implementation of the new capital and liquidity rules and assess the potential impact to us. 

Market Risk Capital Rule 

A market risk capital rule, which the Federal Banking Agencies amended in August 2012, supplements both the general risk-based capital rules and the Basel III Advanced Approaches rules by requiring institutions subject to the rule to adjust their risk-based capital ratios to reflect the market risk in their trading activities. The rule applies to institutions with aggregate trading assets and liabilities equal to the lesser of (i) 10% or more of total assets or (ii) $1 billion or more. Currently, we are not subject to this rule but may become subject to it in the future. In January 2016, the Basel Committee issued a revised framework for minimum capital requirements for market risk, which would require rulemaking by the Federal Banking Agencies prior to it impacting capital requirements for market risk for U.S. banking institutions. 

FDICIA and Prompt Corrective Action 

In general, the FDICIA subjects banks to significantly increased regulation and supervision. Among other things, the FDICIA requires Federal Banking Agencies to take &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; for banks that do not meet minimum capital requirements. The FDICIA establishes five capital ratio levels: well capitalized; adequately capitalized; undercapitalized; significantly undercapitalized; and critically undercapitalized. The three undercapitalized categories are based upon the amount by which a bank falls below the ratios applicable to an adequately-capitalized institution. The capital categories are determined solely for purposes of applying the FDICIA&#8217;s PCA provisions, and such capital categories may not constitute an accurate representation of the Banks&#8217; overall financial condition or prospects. 

Under applicable regulations for 2014, an insured depository institution was considered to be well capitalized if it maintained a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6%, a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of at least 5% and was not subject to any supervisory agreement, order or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. An insured depository institution was considered to be adequately capitalized if it maintained a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 4% and a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of at least 4% (3% for certain highly rated institutions), and did not otherwise meet the definition of well capitalized. 

As noted above, the Final Basel III Capital Rule updated the PCA framework to reflect new, higher regulatory capital minimums. This rule adjusts the definitions of well capitalized and adequately capitalized. For an insured depository institution to be well capitalized, it must maintain a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or more; a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8% or more; a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5% or more; and a leverage ratio of 5% or more. An adequately-capitalized depository institution must maintain a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% or more; a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6% or more; a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5% or more; a leverage ratio of 4% or more; and, for Basel III Advanced Approaches institutions, a supplementary leverage ratio, which incorporates a broader set of exposures as noted above, of 3% or more. The revised PCA requirements became effective 

&#160; 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) 

on January 1, 2015, other than the supplementary leverage ratio, which becomes effective on January 1, 2018. As of December 31, 2015, each of the Banks met the requirements for a well-capitalized institution. 

As an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions, the FDICIA requires regulators to establish certain non-capital safety and soundness standards. The standards relate generally to operations and management, asset quality, interest rate exposure and executive compensation. The agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards. 

Enhanced Prudential Standards and Other Requirements Under the Dodd-Frank Act 

With the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, because we are a BHC with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more (a &#8220;covered company&#8221;), we are subject to certain enhanced prudential standards, including requirements that may be recommended by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (&#8220;Council&#8221;) and implemented by the Federal Reserve and other regulators. As a result, we are becoming subject to more stringent standards and requirements than those applicable for smaller institutions. The Council also may issue recommendations to the Federal Reserve or other primary financial regulatory agencies to apply new or heightened standards to risky financial activities or practices. 

In 2011, the Federal Reserve and FDIC finalized rules requiring us to implement resolution planning for orderly resolution in the event the Company faces material financial distress or failure. The FDIC issued similar rules regarding resolution planning applicable to the Banks. Additionally, although not a direct requirement under the Dodd-Frank Act, the OCC proposed guidelines in December 2015 that would require the Banks to develop recovery plans detailing the actions necessary to remain a going concern when the Banks are experiencing considerable financial or operational stress, but have not deteriorated to the extent resolution is imminent. 

In October 2012, the Federal Reserve issued a rule that implements the requirement in the Dodd-Frank Act that the Federal Reserve conducts annual stress tests on the capacity of our capital to absorb losses as a result of adverse economic conditions. The stress test rule also implements the requirement that we conduct our own semiannual stress tests and requires us to publish the results of the stress tests on our website or other public forum. The OCC finalized a similar stress test rule in October 2012, to implement the requirement that each of the Banks conduct annual stress tests. 

In December 2011, the Federal Reserve released proposed rules implementing certain other aspects of the enhanced prudential standards under the Dodd-Frank Act. The Federal Reserve finalized certain of the proposed rules on February 18, 2014, and we were required to comply with these requirements beginning on January 1, 2015 (&#8220;Enhanced Standards Rule&#8221;). The Enhanced Standards Rule, however, did not finalize the proposed single-counterparty credit limits or early remediation framework. Under the Enhanced Standards Rule, we must meet liquidity risk management standards, conduct internal liquidity stress tests, and maintain a 30-day buffer of highly liquid assets, in each case, consistent with the requirements of the rule. These requirements are in addition to the Final LCR, discussed above in &#8220;Basel III and U.S. Capital and Liquidity Rules.&#8221; In addition, the Enhanced Standards Rule requires that we comply with, and hold capital commensurate with the requirements of, any regulations adopted by the Federal Reserve relating to capital planning and stress tests. Stress testing and capital planning regulations are discussed further below under &#8220;Dividends, Stock Repurchases and Transfers of Funds.&#8221; 

The Enhanced Standards Rule also requires that we establish and maintain an enterprise-wide risk management framework that includes a risk committee and a chief risk officer. 

While not a requirement of the Dodd-Frank Act, in 2014 the OCC issued regulatory guidelines (&#8220;Heightened Standards Guidelines&#8221;) that apply heightened standards for risk management to large institutions subject to its supervision, including the Banks. The Heightened Standards Guidelines establish standards for the development and implementation by the Banks of a risk governance framework. 

The Dodd-Frank Act also imposes new, more stringent standards and requirements with respect to bank and nonbank acquisitions and mergers and affiliate transactions. The Dodd-Frank Act also includes provisions related to corporate governance and executive compensation and new fees and assessments, among others. 

The federal agencies have significant discretion in drafting the implementing regulations of the Dodd-Frank Act. Implementing regulations may result in modifications to our business models and organizational structure, and may subject us to escalating costs associated with any such changes. The full impact of the regulatory reform, including the Dodd-Frank Act, will not be known for some time. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act and subsequent legislation require various studies and reports to be delivered to Congress, which could result in additional legislative or regulatory action. 

&#160; 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) 

Investment in the Company and the Banks 

Certain acquisitions of our capital stock may be subject to regulatory approval or notice under federal or state law. Investors are responsible for ensuring that they do not, directly or indirectly, acquire shares of our capital stock in excess of the amount that can be acquired without regulatory approval, including under the BHC Act and the Change in Bank Control Act. 

Federal law and regulations prohibit any person or company from acquiring control of the Company or the Banks without, in most cases, prior written approval of the Federal Reserve or the OCC, as applicable. Control exists if, among other things, a person or company acquires more than 25% of any class of our voting stock or otherwise has a controlling influence over us. For a publicly traded BHC like us, a rebuttable presumption of control arises if a person or company acquires more than 10% of any class of our voting stock. 

Additionally, COBNA and CONA are &#8220;banks&#8221; within the meaning of Chapter 13 of Title 6.1 of the Code of Virginia governing the acquisition of interests in Virginia financial institutions (&#8220;Financial Institution Holding Company Act&#8221;). The Financial Institution Holding Company Act prohibits any person or entity from acquiring, or making any public offer to acquire, control of a Virginia financial institution or its holding company without making application to, and receiving prior approval from, the Virginia Bureau of Financial Institutions. 

Dividends, Stock Repurchases and Transfers of Funds 

In November 2011, the Federal Reserve finalized capital planning rules applicable to large BHCs including us (commonly referred to as Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review or &#8220;CCAR&#8221;). Under the rules, a BHC with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more must submit a capital plan to the Federal Reserve on an annual basis that contains a description of all planned capital actions, including dividends or stock repurchases, over a nine-quarter planning horizon beginning with the fourth quarter of the calendar year prior to the submission of the capital plan (&#8220;CCAR cycle&#8221;). The BHC may take the capital actions in its capital plan if the Federal Reserve provides a non-objection to the plan. The Federal Reserve&#8217;s objection or non-objection generally applies to capital actions during the four quarters beginning with the second quarter of the second calendar year in the planning horizon. 

On September 24, 2013, the Federal Reserve released an interim final rule that incorporated the Final Basel III Capital Rule into CCAR. On October 17, 2014, the Federal Reserve issued a final rule to modify the regulations for capital planning and stress testing (&#8220;2014 Final Capital Plan and Stress Test Rule&#8221;). In addition, the OCC issued a final rule in December 2014 modifying its Dodd-Frank Act stress testing regulation, to be consistent with the 2014 Final Capital Plan and Stress Test Rule changes to the Federal Reserve&#8217;s Dodd-Frank Act stress testing regulation. The Dodd-Frank Act stress testing regulations are described above in &#8220;Enhanced Prudential Standards and Other Requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act.&#8221; 

The 2014 Final Capital Plan and Stress Test Rule changes the annual capital plan and stress test cycle start date from October 1 to January 1, effective for the cycle beginning January 1, 2016. Under the 2014 Final Capital Plan and Stress Test Rule, for the CCAR cycle under which capital plan submissions were due by January 5, 2015 (&#8220;2015 CCAR cycle&#8221;), the Federal Reserve&#8217;s objection or non-objection applies to planned capital actions from the second quarter of 2015 through the second quarter of 2016. Subsequent submissions each would cover a four-quarter period. The change in the start date of the annual cycle impacts the as-of dates for data used to project results as well as the dates that stress test results must be submitted to the regulators and disclosed to the public. For the annual company-run stress test, a BHC is required to disclose the results within 15 calendar days after the Federal Reserve discloses the results of that BHC&#8217;s supervisory stress test, unless that time period is extended by the Federal Reserve. The 2014 Final Capital Plan and Stress Test Rule requires a BHC to disclose results of its mid-cycle stress test within 30 calendar days after the BHC submits the results of its mid-cycle stress test to the Federal Reserve, unless that time period is extended by the Federal Reserve. 

The 2014 Final Capital Plan and Stress Test Rule also provides a one-year deferral on the use of Basel III Advanced Approaches for banking institutions to estimate their capital ratios for the 2015 capital plan and stress test cycles. In addition, it shifts the focus of the Federal Reserve from annual capital issuances and distributions to quarterly capital issuances and distributions by establishing a new cumulative net distribution requirement. With certain limited exceptions, this requirement provides that--as measured on an aggregate basis beginning in the third quarter of the planning horizon--to the extent a BHC does not issue the amount of a given class of regulatory capital instrument that it projected in its capital plan, the BHC must reduce its capital distributions such that the cumulative net amounts of a BHC&#8217;s actual capital issuances and capital distributions for each category of regulatory capital instrument cannot be less than the cumulative net amounts of capital issuances and capital distributions for that category of regulatory capital instrument projected in the BHC&#8217;s capital plan. 

&#160; 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) 

The Federal Reserve issued a final rule on November 25, 2015 to further modify its capital planning and stress testing regulations (&#8220;2015 Final Capital Plan and Stress Test Rule&#8221;). Among other changes, the 2015 Final Capital Plan and Stress Test Rule would indefinitely delay incorporation of the Basel III Advanced Approaches; remove the tier 1 common ratio from the capital plan and stress testing regulations, given the full phase-in of the common equity tier 1 capital requirement in the nine-quarter planning horizon of the 2016 capital plan and stress testing cycles; and delay the incorporation of the supplementary leverage ratio until the 2017 capital plan and stress testing cycles. In addition, on December 18, 2015, the Federal Reserve also issued guidance that summarizes and further details its supervisory expectations for the capital planning process, capital positions and modeling of large and complex firms such as the Company in connection with their capital planning and stress testing activities. 

The purpose of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s capital plan and stress test rules is to ensure that large BHCs have robust, forward-looking capital planning processes that account for their unique risks and capital needs to continue operations through times of economic and financial stress. As part of its evaluation of a capital plan, the Federal Reserve will consider the comprehensiveness of the plan, the reasonableness of assumptions and analysis and methodologies used to assess capital adequacy and the ability of the BHC to maintain capital above each minimum regulatory capital ratio on a pro forma basis under expected and stressful conditions throughout a planning horizon of at least nine quarters. The 2016 CCAR cycle will measure our capital levels under the Basel III Standardized Approach, with appropriate phase-in provisions applicable to Capital One. 

Traditionally, dividends to us from our direct and indirect subsidiaries have represented a major source of funds for us to pay dividends on our stock, make payments on corporate debt securities and meet our other obligations. There are various federal law limitations on the extent to which the Banks can finance or otherwise supply funds to us through dividends and loans. These limitations include minimum regulatory capital requirements, federal banking law requirements concerning the payment of dividends out of net profits or surplus, Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W governing transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates, as well as general federal regulatory oversight to prevent unsafe or unsound practices. In general, federal and applicable state banking laws prohibit, without first obtaining regulatory approval, insured depository institutions, such as the Banks, from making dividend distributions if such distributions are not paid out of available earnings or would cause the institution to fail to meet applicable capital adequacy standards. 

Deposit Insurance Assessments 

Each of CONA and COBNA, as an insured depository institution, is a member of the DIF maintained by the FDIC. Through the DIF, the FDIC insures the deposits of insured depository institutions up to prescribed limits for each depositor. The DIF was formed on March 31, 2006, upon the merger of the Bank Insurance Fund and the Savings Association Insurance Fund in accordance with the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 (&#8220;Reform Act&#8221;). The Reform Act permits the FDIC to set a Designated Reserve Ratio (&#8220;DRR&#8221;) for the DIF. To maintain the DIF, member institutions may be assessed an insurance premium, and the FDIC may take action to increase insurance premiums if the DRR falls below its required level. 

Prior to passage of the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC had established a plan to restore the DIF in the face of recent insurance losses and future loss projections, which resulted in several rules that generally increased deposit insurance rates and purported to improve risk differentiation so that riskier institutions bear a greater share of insurance premiums. The Dodd-Frank Act reformed the management of the DIF in several ways: raised the minimum DRR to 1.35% (from the former minimum of 1.15%); removed the upper limit on the DRR; required that the reserve ratio reach 1.35% by September 30, 2020 (rather than 1.15% by the end of 2016); required that in setting assessments, the FDIC must offset the effect of meeting the increased reserve ratio on small insured depository institutions; and eliminated the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends from the DIF when the reserve ratio reaches certain levels. The FDIC has set the DRR at 2% and, in lieu of dividends, has established progressively lower assessment rate schedules as the reserve ratio meets certain trigger levels. The Dodd-Frank Act also required the FDIC to change the deposit insurance assessment base from deposits to average total consolidated assets minus average tangible equity. In February 2011, the FDIC finalized rules to implement this change that significantly modified how deposit insurance assessment rates are calculated for those banks with assets of $10 billion or greater. On November 18, 2014, the FDIC issued final rules to amend its deposit insurance assessment regulation to conform to the Final Basel III Capital Rule and to the final rule revising the supplementary leverage ratio. 

On October 22, 2015, the FDIC proposed rules to implement the requirement that the FDIC offset the effect of meeting the increased reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35% on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion. The FDIC&#8217;s proposed rulemaking would impose a new quarterly deposit insurance surcharge assessment, with a quarterly rate of 1.125 basis points, on all insured depository institutions with assets of $10 billion or more (including COBNA and CONA), in addition to regular quarterly deposit insurance assessments applicable to each insured depository institution. The surcharge would begin the quarter after the DIF reserve ratio first reaches or exceeds 1.15% (projected by the FDIC as likely to occur during the first 

&#160; 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) 

quarter of 2016) and would continue until the reserve ratio first reaches or exceeds 1.35%, but no later than the fourth quarter of 2018. As proposed, the surcharge is expected to be partially offset by lower FDIC assessment rates, which will be in effect once the DIF reserve ratio reaches 1.15%. The potential impact on COBNA and CONA is dependent upon the duration, rate and structure of the FDIC surcharge in the final rule, which has not yet been issued. 

Source of Strength and Liability for Commonly-Controlled Institutions 

Under the regulations issued by the Federal Reserve, a BHC must serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks (the so-called &#8220;source of strength doctrine&#8221;). The Dodd-Frank Act codified the source of strength doctrine, directing the Federal Reserve to require BHCs to serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks. 

Under the &#8220;cross-guarantee&#8221; provision of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (&#8220;FIRREA&#8221;), insured depository institutions such as the Banks may be liable to the FDIC with respect to any loss incurred, or reasonably anticipated to be incurred, by the FDIC in connection with the default of, or FDIC assistance to, any commonly controlled insured depository institution. The Banks are commonly controlled within the meaning of the FIRREA cross-guarantee provision. 

FDIC Orderly Liquidation Authority 

The Dodd-Frank Act provides the FDIC with liquidation authority that may be used to liquidate nonbank financial companies and BHCs if the Treasury Secretary, in consultation with the President and based on the recommendation of the Federal Reserve and another federal agency, determines that doing so is necessary, among other criteria, to mitigate serious adverse effects on U.S. financial stability. Upon such a determination, the FDIC would be appointed receiver and must liquidate the company in a way that mitigates significant risks to financial stability and minimizes moral hazard. The costs of a liquidation of a financial company would be borne by shareholders and unsecured creditors and then, if necessary, by risk-based assessments on large financial companies. The FDIC has issued rules implementing certain provisions of its liquidation authority and may issue additional rules in the future. In November 2015, the Federal Reserve proposed rules designed to promote U.S. financial stability and orderly liquidity authority by requiring U.S. BHCs identified as G-SIBs to maintain outstanding a minimum amount of loss absorbing instruments, including a minimum amount of unsecured long-term debt, and related buffer. Capital One would not be subject to this requirement as proposed. 

Regulation of International Business by Non-U.S. Authorities 

COBNA is subject to regulation in foreign jurisdictions where it operates, currently in the United Kingdom and Canada. 

United Kingdom 

In the United Kingdom, COBNA operates through COEP, which was established in 2000 and is an authorized payment institution regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (&#8220;FCA&#8221;) under the Payment Services Regulations 2009 and the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. COEP&#8217;s indirect parent, Capital One Global Corporation, is wholly-owned by COBNA and is subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve as an &#8220;agreement corporation&#8221; under the Federal Reserve&#8217;s Regulation K. 

Over the past few years the U.K. government has enacted significant changes to the framework of financial services regulation. As part of these changes, in April 2013, the Financial Services Authority (&#8220;FSA&#8221;) was split into a new Prudential Regulatory Authority (&#8220;PRA&#8221;) and the FCA, with the FCA, rather than the PRA, regulating COEP. In April 2014, the FCA took over regulation of the U.K. consumer credit regime previously regulated by the Office of Fair Trading. The FCA&#8217;s new regulatory purview includes credit card lending activities. The FCA established a new Consumer Credit Sourcebook based on the existing regulatory regime which came into full effect on September 30, 2014. COEP, in common with other market participants, currently operates under certain &#8220;interim&#8221; permissions of FCA and COEP applied for related &#8220;full&#8221; permissions in October 2015 (with such full permissions anticipated to be granted during 2016). 

Regulatory focus on Payment Protection Insurance (&#8220;PPI&#8221;) complaint handling has continued as PPI continues to be a key driver of consumer complaints to the Financial Ombudsman Service (&#8220;FOS&#8221;). In January 2015, FCA announced it would gather evidence on current trends in PPI complaints to assess whether further interventions were required. In May 2015, the FCA also announced that it was considering whether further rules and/or guidance were required to deal with the impact of the decision in the case of &#32;Plevin v. Paragon Personal Finance &#32;to the effect that failure to disclose the amount of commission included in the price of the single premium PPI sold to the plaintiff created an unfair relationship between the lender and the borrower under section 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. On November 26, 2015, the FCA launched a consultation on proposed new rules relating to PPI 

&#160; 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) 

complaint handling, including the introduction of a 2-year deadline by which consumers would need to make their PPI complaints or else lose their right to have them assessed by firms or by the FOS. 

COEP is a party to the Sentinel Card Protection (&#8220;SCP&#8221;) redress scheme which enables customers who bought SCP provided by Affinion International Limited to seek compensation. In August 2015 the redress scheme became effective with a general claims bar date of March 18, 2016, other than for exceptional circumstances. The claims bar date for exceptional circumstances is September 18, 2016. The redress scheme relating to Card Protection Plan (&#8220;CPP&#8221;) insurance, which enabled customers who bought card protection insurance with CPP to seek compensation, has now come to an end. 

Canada 

In Canada, COBNA operates as an authorized foreign bank pursuant to the Bank Act (Canada) (&#8220;Bank Act&#8221;) and is permitted to conduct its credit card business in Canada through its Canadian branch, Capital One Bank (Canada Branch) (&#8220;Capital One Canada&#8221;). The primary regulator of Capital One Canada is the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Canada (&#8220;OSFI&#8221;). Other regulators include the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada (&#8220;FCAC&#8221;), the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, and the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada. Capital One Canada is subject to regulation under various Canadian federal laws, including the Bank Act and its regulations, the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act and the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act. 

There were two new significant developments described below that affect credit cards issued by federally regulated financial institutions in Canada, such as Capital One Canada. These changes could increase our operational and compliance costs and affect the types and terms of products that we offer in Canada. 

In April 2015, the voluntary agreement to reduce interchange fees among the Canadian federal government, MasterCard Canada and Visa Canada came into effect. The agreement contains a commitment to reduce interchange fees for consumer credit cards to an average of 1.5% and will remain in effect for 5 years. 

On September 19, 2014, the Supreme Court of Canada (&#8220;Court&#8221;) released its decision in Bank of Montreal v. Marcotte . The Court found that certain provisions of Quebec provincial consumer protection legislation apply to credit cards issued by federally chartered banks. The broader implications of the applicability of provincial law to banks in Canada remain unclear. 

COMPETITION 

Each of our business segments operates in a highly competitive environment, and we face competition in all aspects of our business from numerous bank and non-bank providers of financial services. 

Our Credit Card business competes with international, national, regional and local issuers of Visa and MasterCard credit cards, as well as with American Express &#174; , Discover Card &#174; , private-label card brands, and, to a certain extent, issuers of debit cards. In general, customers are attracted to credit card issuers largely on the basis of price, credit limit, reward programs and other product features. 

Our Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking businesses compete with national, state and direct banks for deposits, commercial and auto loans, mortgages and trust accounts, as well as with savings and loan associations and credit unions for loans and deposits. Our competitors also include automotive finance companies, mortgage banking companies and other financial services providers that provide loans, deposits, and other similar services and products. In addition, we compete against non-depository institutions that are able to offer these products and services. Securities firms and insurance companies that elect to become financial holding companies may acquire banks and other financial institutions. Combinations of this type could significantly change the competitive environment in which we conduct business. The financial services industry is also likely to become more competitive as further technological advances enable more companies to provide financial services. These technological advances may diminish the importance of depository institutions and other financial intermediaries in the transfer of funds between parties. In addition, competition among direct banks is intense because online banking provides customers the ability to rapidly deposit and withdraw funds and open and close accounts in favor of products and services offered by competitors. 

Our businesses generally compete on the basis of the quality and range of their products and services, transaction execution, innovation and price. Competition varies based on the types of clients, customers, industries and geographies served. Our ability to compete depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain our associates and on our reputation. In the current environment, customers are generally attracted to depository institutions that are perceived as stable, with solid liquidity and funding. We believe 

&#160; 

Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) 

that we are able to compete effectively in our current markets. There can be no assurance, however, that our ability to market products and services successfully or to obtain adequate returns on our products and services will not be impacted by the nature of the competition that now exists or may later develop, or by the broader economic environment. For a discussion of the risks related to our competitive environment, please refer to &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1A. Risk Factors .&#8221; 

EMPLOYEES 

A central part of our philosophy is to attract and retain highly capable staff. We had approximately 45,400 employees, whom we refer to as &#8220;associates,&#8221; as of December 31, 2015 . None of our associates are covered under a collective bargaining agreement, and management considers our associate relations to be satisfactory. 

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 

Technology/Systems 

We leverage information technology to achieve our business objectives and to develop and deliver products and services that satisfy our customers&#8217; needs. A key part of our strategic focus is the development and use of efficient, flexible computer and operational systems, such as cloud technology, to support complex marketing and account management strategies, the servicing of our customers, and the development of new and diversified products. We believe that the continued development and integration of these systems is an important part of our efforts to reduce costs, improve quality and provide faster, more flexible technology services. Consequently, we continuously review capabilities and develop or acquire systems, processes and competencies to meet our unique business requirements. 

As part of our continuous efforts to review and improve our technologies, we may either develop such capabilities internally or rely on third-party outsourcers who have the ability to deliver technology that is of higher quality, lower cost, or both. We continue to rely on third-party outsourcers to help us deliver systems and operational infrastructure. These relationships include (but are not limited to): Total System Services Inc. (&#8220;TSYS&#8221;) for processing services for our North American and U.K. portfolios of consumer and small business credit card accounts, and Fidelity Information Services (&#8220;FIS&#8221;) for certain of our banking systems. 

To protect our systems and technologies, we employ security, backup and recovery systems and generally require the same of our third-party service providers. In addition, we perform, or cause to be performed, a variety of vulnerability and penetration testing on the platforms, systems and applications used to provide our products and services in an effort to ensure that any attacks on these platforms, systems and applications are unlikely to succeed. 

Intellectual Property 

As part of our overall and ongoing strategy to protect and enhance our intellectual property, we rely on a variety of protections, including copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents and certain restrictions on disclosure, solicitation and competition. We also undertake other measures to control access to and distribution of our other proprietary information. Despite these precautions, it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use certain intellectual property or proprietary information without authorization. Our precautions may not prevent misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property or proprietary information. In addition, our competitors and other third parties also file patent applications for innovations that are used in our industry. The ability of our competitors and other third parties to obtain such patents may adversely affect our ability to compete. Conversely, our ability to obtain such patents may increase our competitive advantage. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in such efforts, or that the ability of our competitors to obtain such patents may not adversely impact our financial results. 

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

From time to time, we have made and will make forward-looking statements, including those that discuss, among other things, strategies, goals, outlook or other non-historical matters; projections, revenues, income, returns, expenses, capital measures, accruals for claims in litigation and for other claims against us; earnings per share or other financial measures for us; future financial and operating results; our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions; and the assumptions that underlie these matters. 

To the extent that any such information is forward-looking, it is intended to fit within the safe harbor for forward-looking information provided by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. 

Numerous factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those described in such forward-looking statements, including, among other things: 

&#8226; 

general economic and business conditions in the U.S., the U.K., Canada or our local markets, including conditions affecting employment levels, interest rates, collateral values, consumer income, credit worthiness and confidence, spending and savings that may affect consumer bankruptcies, defaults, charge-offs and deposit activity;
