Brink&#8217;s was founded in 1859 and The Brink&#8217;s Company was first incorporated in 1930 under the laws of the State of Delaware (at that time, the Company was named The Pittston Company). It succeeded to the business of a Virginia corporation in 1986 and was renamed The Brink&#8217;s Company in 2003. Our headquarters are located in Richmond, Virginia. The Brink&#8217;s Company, along with its subsidiaries, is referred to as &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221;, &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;Brink&#8217;s,&#8221; or &#8220;the Company&#8221; throughout this Form 10-K. 

Brink&#8217;s operations are located throughout the world with 76% of our revenues earned outside the U.S. during 2015. Brink&#8217;s Largest 5 Markets (U.S., France, Mexico, Brazil and Canada) represent 63% of consolidated revenues.

Mission and Strategy 

Our Mission and Goal 

Our mission is to be the world&#8217;s most respected provider of secure logistics solutions. Our goal is to increase shareholder value by achieving consistent growth in revenues, profits and cash flows. 

Our Strategy 

Our strategy has three pillars: 

&#8226; 

Expand offerings 

&#8226; 

Drive efficiency 

&#8226; 

Transform our culture 

Expand our offerings - Transform from a transactional business model to a value-based secure supply chain management company. 

We are working to expand our services across our customers&#8217; entire cash and valuable supply chains and business processes. Improving our customers&#8217; supply-chain efficiency reduces total cost, improves our value-added pricing and generates opportunities for customers to outsource more services to Brink&#8217;s. 

These opportunities include: 

&#8226; 

integrated armored transportation and money processing services 

&#8226; 

full-service management of entire ATM networks 

&#8226; 

CompuSafe &#174; &#32;service (&#8220;intelligent safes&#8221;) 

&#8226; 

new market opportunities for Global Services 

Drive efficiency - Implement "Lean" processes, right-size cost structure, and centralize support to deliver the most customer value while consuming fewer resources. 

Improving operational efficiency is critical to enhancing our competitive position and pursuing future growth. Our efforts include: 

&#8226; 

flattening organizational structures to enhance decision-making and reduce administrative expenses 

&#8226; 

centralizing support functions to reduce costs and enable country-level operating management to focus on customers and operations 

&#8226; 

improving route logistics with IT-based productivity tools 

&#8226; 

introducing new and retrofitted vehicles to accommodate one-person crews 

&#8226; 

leveraging global purchasing power to reduce costs for vehicles, equipment, maintenance, travel and other services. 

Transform our culture - Demonstrate behaviors that reflect our values of Accountability, Customer Focus and Trust (&#8220;ACT&#8221;). Transform culture to drive strategy. 

As part of our ongoing cultural transformation, we continue to promote ACT and endeavor to ensure that our employees demonstrate these values and related behaviors. We are working to place leaders who consistently demonstrate ACT behaviors in our most critical roles. 

Services 

We design customized services to meet the cash and valuables supply chain needs of our customers. We enter into contracts with our customers to establish pricing and other terms. Cash-in-Transit and ATM contracts usually cover an initial term of at least one year and in many cases one to three years, and generally remain in effect thereafter until canceled by either party. Contracts for Cash Management Services are typically longer. Following are descriptions of our service offerings: 

Core Services &#32;(53% of total revenues in 2015 ) 

Cash-in-transit and ATM Services are core services we provide to customers throughout the world. We charge customers per service performed or based on the value of goods transported. Revenues are affected by the level of economic activity in various markets as well as the volume of business for specific customers. Core services generated approximately $1.6 billion of revenues in 2015 . 

Cash-in-Transit Services &#32;&#8211; Serving customers since 1859, our success in Cash-in-Transit is driven by a combination of rigorous security practices, high-quality customer service, risk management and logistics expertise. Cash-in-Transit Services generally include the secure transportation of: 

&#8226; 

cash between businesses and financial institutions, such as banks and credit unions 

&#8226; 

cash, securities and other valuables between commercial banks, central banks and investment banking and brokerage firms 

&#8226; 

new currency, coins, bullion and precious metals for central banks and other customers 

ATM Services &#160; &#8211; We manage 93,000 &#32;ATMs worldwide. We provide customers who own and operate ATMs a variety of service options. Basic ATM management services include cash replenishment and first and second line maintenance. We also provide comprehensive services for ATM management through our Brink's Integrated Managed Services (&#8220;Brink&#8217;s IMS&#8221;) offering, which includes cash replenishment, replenishment forecasting, cash optimization, ATM remote monitoring, service call dispatching, transaction processing, installation services, and first and second line maintenance. 

High-Value Services &#32;(39% of total revenues in 2015 ) 

Our Core Services, combined with our brand and global infrastructure, provide a broad platform from which we offer additional High-Value Services, which generated approximately $1.2 billion of revenues in 2015 . 

Global Services &#32;- Brink&#8217;s Global Services ("BGS") is the leading global provider of secure transport of highly-valued commodities including diamonds, jewelry, precious metals, securities, currency, high-tech devices, electronics and pharmaceuticals. Our specialized diamond and jewelry operations have offices in the world&#8217;s major diamond and jewelry centers. Serving customers in more than 100 countries, BGS provides secure transportation services including pick-up, packaging, customs clearance, secure vault storage and inventory management. BGS uses a combination of armored vehicles and secure air and sea transportation. 

Cash Management Services &#32;- We offer a variety of Cash Management Services, depending on customers&#8217; unique needs. These include: 

&#8226; 

money processing (e.g., counting, sorting, wrapping, checking condition of bills, etc.) and other cash management services 

&#8226; 

deploying and servicing &#8220;intelligent&#8221; safes and safe control devices, including our patented CompuSafe &#174; &#32; &#160; service 

&#8226; 

integrated check and cash processing services (&#8220;Virtual Vault&#8221;) 

&#8226; 

check imaging services 

Other cash management services include cashier balancing, counterfeit detection, account consolidation and electronic reporting. Retail and bank customers use Brink&#8217;s to count and reconcile coins and currency, prepare bank deposit information and replenish coins and currency in specific denominations. 

Customers may have relatively simple requirements or they may need a more fully integrated approach to managing their supply chain of cash. Brink&#8217;s offers logistical support from point-of-sale through transport, vaulting, bank deposit and related credit reporting. We also offer a variety of advanced technology applications including online cash tracking, cash inventory management, check imaging for real-time deposit processing, and a variety of other web-based tools that enable banks and other customers to reduce costs while improving service to their customers. We believe the quality and scope of our money processing and information systems differentiate our Cash Management Services from competitive offerings. 

Brink&#8217;s CompuSafe &#174; &#32; Service . Brink&#8217;s CompuSafe &#174; &#32;service provides an integrated, closed-loop system for preventing theft and managing cash. We market CompuSafe &#174; &#32;services to a variety of cash-intensive customers including convenience stores, gas stations, restaurants, retail chains and entertainment venues. Once the specialized safe is installed, the customer&#8217;s employees deposit currency into the safe&#8217;s cassettes, which can only be removed by Brink&#8217;s personnel. Upon removal, the cassettes are securely transported to a vault for processing where contents are verified and transferred for deposit. Our CompuSafe &#174; &#32;service features currency-recognition and counterfeit-detection technology, multi-language touch screens and an electronic interface between the point-of-sale, back-office systems and external banks. Our electronic reporting interface with external banks enables customers to receive same-day credit on their cash balances, even if the cash remains on the customer&#8217;s premises. 

Virtual Vault . Virtual Vault services combine Cash-in-Transit Services, Cash Management Services, vaulting and electronic reporting technologies to help banks expand into new markets while minimizing investment in vaults and branch facilities. In addition to providing secure storage, we process deposits, provide check imaging and reconciliation services, 

perform currency inventory management, process ATM replenishment orders and electronically transmit banking transactions. 

Payment Services &#160; &#8211; We provide convenient payment services, including bill payment processing, mobile phone top-up, and Brink&#8217;s Money&#8482; prepaid cards. 

Latin America . Bill payment processing services include bill payment acceptance and processing services on behalf of utility companies and other billers. Consumers can pay bills, top-up prepaid mobile phones and manage accounts at retail agent locations that we operate on behalf of utility companies, banks and a small number of leased payment locations. This service is offered at over 33,000 locations in Brazil, Mexico, Colombia and Panama. 

United States . We offer Brink&#8217;s Money&#8482; general purpose reloadable prepaid cards and payroll cards to consumers and employers. Our general purpose reloadable cards are sold to consumers through our direct-to-consumer marketing efforts while our payroll cards are sold to employers who use them to pay employees electronically. Brink&#8217;s Money&#8482; cards can be used at stores, restaurants, online retailers, and at ATMs worldwide. This product is targeted to the millions of unbanked and under-banked Americans looking for alternative financial products. 

Commercial Security Systems &#32; &#8211; We provide commercial security system services in designated markets in Europe. Our security system design and installation services include alarms, motion detectors, closed-circuit televisions, digital video recorders, and access control systems, including card and biometric readers, electronic locks, and turnstiles. Monitoring services may also be provided after systems have been installed. 

Other Security Services &#32;(8% of total revenues in 2015 ) 

Guarding &#32;&#8211; We protect airports, offices, warehouses, stores, and public venues with or without electronic surveillance, access control, fire prevention and highly trained patrolling personnel. Other security services generated approximately $0.2 billion of revenues in 2015 . 

We offer security and guarding services in France, Luxembourg, Greece, Germany and Brazil. A portion of this business involves long-term contracts related primarily to security services at airports and embassies. Generally, guarding contracts are for a one-year period, and the majority of contracts are extended. 

Industry and Competition 

Brink&#8217;s competes with large multinational, regional and smaller companies throughout the world. Our largest multinational competitors are G4S plc (U.K.); Loomis AB (Sweden); Prosegur, Compania de Seguridad, S.A. (Spain); and Garda World Security Corporation (Canada). 

We believe the primary factors in attracting and retaining customers are security expertise, service quality, and price. Our competitive advantages include: 

&#8226; 

brand name recognition 

&#8226; 

reputation for a high level of service and security 

&#8226; 

risk management and logistics expertise 

&#8226; 

global infrastructure and customer base 

&#8226; 

proven operational excellence, and 

&#8226; 

high-quality insurance coverage and financial strength 

Although we face competitive pricing pressure in many markets, we resist competing on price alone. We believe our high levels of service, security expertise and value-added solutions differentiate us from competitors. 

Insurance Coverage 

The availability of high-quality and reliable insurance coverage is an important factor in our ability to attract and retain customers and manage the risks inherent in our business. We purchase insurance coverage for losses in excess of what we consider to be prudent levels of self-insurance. Our insurance policies cover losses from most causes, with the exception of war, nuclear risk and certain other exclusions typical in such policies. 

Insurance for security is provided by different groups of underwriters at negotiated rates and terms. Premiums fluctuate depending on market conditions. The security loss experience of Brink&#8217;s and, to a limited extent, other armored carriers affects our premium rates. 

Service Mark and Patents 

BRINKS is a registered service mark in the U.S. and certain foreign countries. The BRINKS mark, name and related marks are of material significance to our business. We own patents for safes and related services, including our integrated CompuSafe &#174; &#32;service, which expire between 2016 &#32;and 2032 . These patents provide us with important advantages; however, we are not dependent on the existence of these patents. 

We have licensed the Brink&#8217;s name to a limited number of companies, including a distributor of security products (padlocks, door hardware, etc.) offered for sale to consumers through major retail chains. 

Government Regulation 

Our U.S. operations are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation with respect to safety of operations, equipment and financial responsibility. Intrastate operations in the U.S. are subject to state regulation. Operations outside of the United States are regulated to varying degrees by the countries in which we operate. 

Employee Relations 

At December 31, 2015 , our company had approximately 59,900 &#32;full-time and contract employees, including approximately 7,100 &#32;employees in the United States (of whom approximately 480 &#32;were classified as part-time employees) and approximately 52,800 &#32;employees outside the United States. At December 31, 2015 , Brink&#8217;s was a party to eleven collective bargaining agreements in North America with various local unions covering approximately 1,700 &#32;employees. The agreements have various expiration dates from 2016 &#32;to 2019 . Outside of North America, approximately 62% &#32;of employees are represented by trade union organizations. We believe our employee relations are satisfactory. 

Business Divestitures 

Below is a summary of the significant businesses we disposed in the last three years. See note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on these dispositions. The results of the operations below, which met the criteria for classification as discontinued operations as of or prior to December 31, 2014, have been excluded from continuing operations and are reported as discontinued operations for the current and prior periods. The sales of the Russian cash management business and the Irish guarding operations in 2015 did not meet the criteria for classification as discontinued operations. Operating results for these two businesses are included in continuing operations for the current and prior periods. We continue to operate our Global Services business in most of these countries.

Other operations sold: &#32; 

&#8226; 

We sold Threshold Financial Technologies, Inc. in Canada in November 2013. Threshold operated private-label ATM network and payment processing businesses. Brink&#8217;s continues to own and operate Brink&#8217;s Integrated Managed Services for ATM customers. &#32; 

&#8226; 

We sold ICD Limited and other affiliated subsidiaries in November 2013. ICD had operations in China and other locations in Asia. ICD designed and installed security systems for commercial customers. &#32; 

&#8226; 

In February 2015, we sold a small Mexican parcel delivery business which met the criteria for classification as a discontinued operation as of December 31, 2014. &#32; 

Other divestitures not classified as discontinued operations: 

&#8226; 

We sold an Irish guarding operation in November 2015. 

&#8226; 

We sold our 70% ownership interest in a Russian cash management business in November 2015 and recognized a $5.9 million &#32;loss on the disposition. A significant part of the loss ( $5.0 million ) represented the reclassification of foreign currency translation adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings. 

&#8226; 

We sold a noncontrolling interest in a CIT business based in Peru in 2014 for $60 million. 

In February 2016, we decided to wind down the majority of our operations in the Republic of Ireland, which had revenues of approximately $15 million &#32;in 2015. We expect to recognize losses from operations and the disposition in the range of $20 million &#32;to $25 million &#32;in 2016 . During 2016, as these expenses are incurred, we intend to exclude them from the non-GAAP results consistent with other dispositions. We will continue to provide international shipments to and from the Republic of Ireland through our Global Services business. 

Reorganization and Restructuring 

In the fourth quarter of 2014, we announced a reorganization and restructuring of Brink&#8217;s global organization (&#8220;2014 Reorganization and Restructuring&#8221;) to accelerate the execution of our strategy by reducing costs and providing for a more streamlined and centralized organization. As part of this program, we reduced our total workforce by approximately 1,700 &#32;positions. Severance costs of $21.8 million &#32;associated with these actions were recognized in 2014, with an additional $1.9 million &#32;in restructuring charges recognized in 2015. The restructuring saved annual direct costs of approximately $50 million in 2015 compared to 2014, excluding severance, lease termination and accelerated depreciation. 

As part of the 2014 reorganization and restructuring we: 

&#8226; 

reorganized the majority of Brink&#8217;s country operations under two business units: Largest 5 Markets (including U.S., France, Mexico, Brazil and Canada), and Global Markets (country operations outside the Largest 5 Markets). Country operations typically provide Cash-in-Transit (&#8220;CIT&#8221;) Services, ATM Services, Cash Management Services and Global Services. These services are described on pages 3&#8211;4. Reporting lines within these two business units are supplemented by a matrixed centralized management of the Global Services operations. 

&#8226; 

decided to maintain our centralized organization structure for the Payment Services business. 

&#8226; 

centralized the reporting structure of our support functions, including IT, HR, finance, legal, procurement, security and project management. Under the new structure, these functional field employees now report to the global functional leaders instead of the country or regional leaders. 

&#8226; 

eliminated regional roles and structures in Europe, Middle East and Africa (&#8220;EMEA&#8221;) and Latin America. 

As a result of the restructuring, we began to report financial results in the following nine operating segments: 

&#8226; 

Each of the five countries within Largest 5 Markets (U.S., France, Mexico, Brazil and Canada) 

&#8226; 

Each of the three regions within Global Markets (Latin America, EMEA and Asia) 

&#8226; 

Payment Services 

Previously, our reportable segments were: Latin America, EMEA, North America and Asia Pacific. 

Financial information related to our segments and amounts not allocated to segments is included in the consolidated financial statements on pages 75&#8211;79. 

We initiated another global restructuring of our business in the third quarter of 2015 (&#8220;2015 Reorganization and Restructuring&#8221;), which included the recognition in 2015 of $11.6 million &#32;in costs related to employee severance, contract terminations and property impairment. The 2015 Reorganization and Restructuring is expected to reduce the global workforce by approximately 1,000 &#32;to 1,200 &#32;positions and is projected to result in $25 &#32;to $35 million &#32;in 2016 cost savings. 

Executive Leadership and Board of Directors Restructuring &#32; 

In January 2016, Brink&#8217;s entered into an agreement (the "Starboard Agreement") with Starboard Value LP and its affiliates ("Starboard") and announced that the Chief Executive Officer, Thomas C. Schievelbein, would step down no later than the 2016 annual meeting of shareholders and that two of the Company&#8217;s directors (including the Company&#8217;s independent lead director) had retired from the Board. Pursuant to the Starboard Agreement, among other things, the Board appointed three new independent directors and delegated the responsibility to oversee the search for a new Chief Executive Officer to the Board&#8217;s Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee. 

In the fourth quarter of 2015, we recognized $1.8 million &#32;in costs related to the Executive Leadership and Board of Directors restructuring. The majority of these charges will be paid in cash in 2016. 

We expect to recognize an additional $5 &#32;to $10 million &#32;in costs in 2016 related to the 2015 Reorganization and Restructuring and the Executive Leadership and Board of Directors Restructuring. 

Other Important Events and Transactions in 2015 &#32; 

In addition to the reorganization and restructuring, the following key events and transactions occurred in 2015 . 

Impairment of Long-lived Assets in Venezuela 

During the second quarter, Brink's elected to evaluate and pursue strategic options for the Venezuelan business. Our consideration of these options, which is ongoing, required us to perform an impairment review of the carrying values of our Venezuelan long-lived assets. As a result, we recognized a $35.3 million &#32;impairment charge in 2015. The carrying value of the long-lived assets of our Venezuelan operations was $6.4 million &#32;at December 31, 2015 . We have not reclassified any of the approximately $113 million &#32;of accumulated other comprehensive losses attributable to Brink&#8217;s shareholders related to our operations in Venezuela into earnings. 

Argentina 

We use the official exchange rate to translate the Brink's Argentina balance sheet and income statement. During 2015 , the official exchange rate ranged from 8.5 &#32;to 9.8 &#32;local pesos to the U.S. dollar until December 17, 2015 when the currency was devalued. At December 31, 2015, the official exchange rate was 12.9 &#32;local pesos to the U.S. dollar. 

The government in Argentina had periodically imposed limits on the exchange of local pesos into U.S. dollars. As a result, we elected to repatriate cash from Argentina using different means to convert Argentine pesos into U.S. dollars. Conversions prior to the December 17, &#32; 2015 devaluation had settled at rates approximately 30% &#32;to 40% &#32;less favorable than the rates at which we translated the financial statements of our subsidiary in Argentina. After the currency was devalued, we completed a conversion transaction at a rate approximately 10% less favorable than the newly devalued rate.
