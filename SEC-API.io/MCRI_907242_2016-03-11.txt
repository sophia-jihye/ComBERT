 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Monarch Casino &#38; Resort, Inc., was incorporated in 1993 and through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Golden Road Motor Inn, Inc. (&#147;Golden Road&#148;), owns and operates the Atlantis Casino Resort Spa, a hotel/casino facility in Reno, Nevada (the &#147;Atlantis&#148;). Monarch&#146;s wholly owned subsidiaries, High Desert Sunshine, Inc. (&#147;High Desert&#148;), Golden East, Inc. (&#147;Golden East&#148;) and Golden North, Inc. (&#147;Golden North&#148;), each own separate parcels of land located proximate to the Atlantis. 

&#160; 

Monarch&#146;s wholly owned subsidiary Monarch Growth Inc. (&#147;Monarch Growth&#148;), formed in 2011, acquired Riviera Black Hawk, Inc., owner of the Riviera Black Hawk Casino on April 26, 2012. Riviera Black Hawk, Inc. was renamed Monarch Black Hawk, Inc. and Riviera Black Hawk Casino was renamed Monarch Casino Black Hawk in October 2013. Monarch Growth also owns a parcel of land in Black Hawk, Colorado contiguous to the Monarch Casino Black Hawk. In addition to owning the Monarch Casino Black Hawk, Monarch Black Hawk, Inc. also wholly owns Chicago Dogs Eatery, Inc. and Monarch Promotional Association, both of which were formed in relation to extended licensure for extended hours of liquor operation in Black Hawk. The Company has included the results of Monarch Black Hawk, Inc. in its consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition. 

&#160; 

Monarch&#146;s wholly owned subsidiary Monarch Interactive, Inc. (&#147;Monarch Interactive&#148;) received approval from the Nevada Gaming Commission on August 23, 2012, which approval was extended three times, each for an additional six-month period, for a license as an operator of interactive gaming. The Company has decided to allow the current approval to lapse pending a change in market conditions that would support the Company&#146;s investment in this line of business. Monarch Interactive is not currently engaged in any operating activities. In Nevada, legal interactive gaming is currently limited to intrastate poker. 

&#160; 

Our operating assets are the Atlantis and the Monarch Casino Black Hawk. Our business strategy is to maximize revenues, operating income and cash flow primarily through our casino, food and beverage operations and at the Atlantis, our hotel operations. Monarch Casino Black Hawk does not yet have a hotel. We focus on delivering exceptional service and value to our guests. Our hands-on management style focuses on customer service and cost efficiencies.

&#160; 

The Atlantis Casino Resort Spa 

&#160; 

The Atlantis is located approximately three miles south of downtown in the generally more affluent area of Reno, Nevada. The Atlantis features approximately 61,000 square feet of casino space; 824 guest rooms and suites; eight food outlets; two espresso and pastry bars; a 30,000 square foot health spa and salon with an enclosed year-round pool; two retail outlets offering clothing and traditional gift shop merchandise; an 8,000 square-foot family entertainment center; and approximately 52,000 square feet of banquet, convention and meeting room space. The casino features approximately 1,450 slot and video poker machines; approximately 38 table games, including blackjack, craps, roulette, and others; a race and sports book; a 24-hour live keno lounge and a poker room. 

&#160; 

Through an enclosed skywalk, Atlantis is the only hotel facility to be physically connected to the Reno-Sparks Convention Center. The Reno-Sparks Convention Center offers approximately 500,000 square feet of leasable exhibition, meeting room, ballroom and lobby space. 

&#160; 

Operations at the Atlantis are conducted 24 hours a day, every day of the year. Business is seasonal in nature, with higher revenues during the summer months and lower revenues during the winter months. 

&#160; 

Atlantis Casino. &#160; The Atlantis offers what we believe to be higher than average payout rates on slot machines relative to other northern Nevada casinos. We seek to attract high-end players through high quality amenities and services and by extension of gaming credit after a careful credit history evaluation.

&#160; 

Hotel and Spa. &#160; The Atlantis includes three contiguous, high-rise hotel towers with a total of 824 rooms and suites. The rooms on the top seven floors in the third tower are nearly 20% larger than the standard guest rooms and offer restricted elevator access, upscale accommodations and a private concierge service.

&#160; 

The Atlantis hotel rooms feature design and furnishings consistent with the highest quality in the Northern Nevada market as well as nine-foot ceilings, which create an open and spacious feel. The third hotel tower features a four-story waterfall with an adjacent year-round swimming pool in a climate controlled, five-story glass enclosure, which shares an outdoor pool deck with a seasonal outdoor swimming pool and year round whirlpool. The Salon at Atlantis is a full service salon overlooking the third floor sundeck and outdoor seasonal swimming pool and offers salon-grade products and treatments for hair, nails, skincare and body services for both men and women. Our Spa Atlantis is a high-end health spa located adjacent to the swimming area that offers treatments and amenities unique to our market. The hotel rooms on the spa floor feature d&#233;cor that is themed consistent with the spa. Certain spa treatments are also available in spa floor hotel rooms. The hotel features glass elevators that rise the full 19 and 28 stories of the respective towers providing panoramic views of the Reno area and the Sierra Nevada mountain range. In 2012, our hotel was awarded with the prestigious AAA Four Diamond rating from the American Automobile Association, a rating we currently maintain.

&#160; 

Restaurants and Dining. &#160; The Atlantis has eight restaurants, two gourmet coffee bars and one snack bar as described below:

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; The 550-seat Toucan Charlie&#146;s Buffet &#38; Grill, which offers a wide variety of food selections from around the globe including a carving station, live action Asian and Salad stations for made-to-order items, and an extensive selection of desserts from our in-house bakery;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; The 160-seat Atlantis Steakhouse, a fine dining destination featuring Allen Brothers Prime steaks from Chicago, fresh seafood, and numerous tableside presentations of classic Steakhouse dishes;

&#183; &#160; The Bistro Napa, featuring creative wine country cuisine served in a 140-seat main dining room with a central wine cellar and an adjacent upscale 60-seat lounge;

&#183; &#160; The Oyster Bar on the Sky Terrace offering pan roasts made-to-order, fresh seafood, cioppino, house made chowder and bisques.

&#183; &#160; Sushi Bar serving creative, made-to-order sushi rolls with a wide variety of raw and cooked options, all offered in all-you-care-to-eat lunch and dinner settings. Combined, the Oyster Bar and Sushi Bar can accommodate up to 137 guests;

&#183; &#160; The newly remodeled, 178-seat Purple Parrot coffee shop, which serves breakfast and American comfort food 24 hours a day;

&#183; &#160; The 110-seat Caf&#233; Alfresco featuring an Italian-inspired menu featuring pastas, wood-fired pizza and a variety of gelato desserts;

&#183; &#160; The 170-seat Manhattan Deli featuring authentic New York Deli favorites like Matzo Ball Soup, piled high sandwiches, salads, house made soups, bagels and lox, and famous New York Cheesecake.

&#183; &#160; Two gourmet coffee bars offering specialty coffee drinks, &#147;grab and go&#148; sandwiches, house made gelato and freshly baked pastries; and

&#183; &#160; The Chicago Dogs Eatery, a snack bar, serving Chicago-style hot dogs, pizza, ice cream and arcade-style refreshments.

&#160; 

The Sky Terrace. &#160; The Sky Terrace is a unique structure with a diamond-shaped, blue glass body suspended approximately 55 feet, and spanning 160 feet across South Virginia Street, Reno&#146;s main thoroughfare. The Sky Terrace connects the Atlantis with parking on our 16-acre site across South Virginia Street. The structure rests at each end on two 100-foot tall Grecian columns with no intermediate support pillars. The interior of the Sky Terrace houses the Oyster Bar, the Sushi Bar, a video poker bar, banks of slot machines and a lounge area.

&#160; 

The Monarch Casino Black Hawk 

&#160; 

The Monarch Casino Black Hawk is located approximately 40 miles west of Denver, Colorado and is the first casino encountered by visitors arriving from Denver, Colorado on Highway 119. The Monarch Casino Black Hawk features approximately 30,000 square feet of casino space, 700 slot machines, 14 table games, a 250 seat buffet-style restaurant, a snack bar and a parking structure with approximately 500 spaces. Monarch owns a 1.5 acre land parcel contiguous to the Monarch Casino Black Hawk which is zoned for gaming that we plan to utilize for future expansion. 

&#160; 

Since the acquisition of Monarch Casino Black Hawk in April 2012, our focus has been to maximize casino and food and beverage revenues while upgrading the existing facility and laying the groundwork for the major expansion that we plan. There is currently no hotel on the property. In December 2013, we began a project to redesign and upgrade the existing Monarch Casino Black Hawk facility. To minimize disruption, we staged the work in three equal phases. The first phase was completed and opened in August 2014. The second phase was completed and opened in March 2015 and the final phase was completed and opened in August 2015. In the fourth quarter of 2013, we began work on a multi-phased expansion of the Monarch Casino Black Hawk which involves construction of a new parking structure, demolition of the existing parking structure followed by construction of a new hotel tower and casino expansion on the site where the existing parking structure currently sits. We expect to complete construction of the new parking structure in the second quarter of 2016. The planned nine-story parking structure will increase total parking on site from approximately 500 spaces to approximately 1,500 spaces. Monarch expects to begin construction of the new hotel tower and casino expansion in the fourth quarter of 2016. Upon completion of the new parking structure, the existing parking structure will be demolished to make space for the hotel tower and casino expansion. Once completed, the Monarch Casino Black Hawk expansion will nearly double the casino space and will add a 23-story hotel tower with approximately 500 guest rooms and suites, an upscale spa and pool facility, three additional restaurants (increasing the total to four), additional bars, a new parking structure and associated support facilities. We currently expect completion of the entire expansion in the third quarter of 2018. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The Company&#146;s Master Planned Expansion of Monarch Casino Black Hawk is more fully discussed in the CAPITAL SPENDING AND DEVELOPMENT section. 

&#160; 

Acquisition, Improvements and Additional Expansion Potential 

&#160; 

We identify and evaluate strategic expansion and acquisition opportunities through market and detailed financial analyses. We develop overall master plans and then execute each phase of the master plan after re-evaluation of the current market conditions and comparison against other capital investment opportunities. 

&#160; 

We have continuously invested in upgrading our facilities. Capital expenditures were $38.1 million in 2015, $19.9 million in 2014 and $12.4 million in 2013. During 2015, 2014 and 2013, capital expenditures related primarily to the upgrade and master expansion plan of the Monarch Casino Black Hawk facility as well as acquisition of gaming equipment to upgrade and replace existing equipment at both of our properties. 

&#160; 

Expansion potential at the Atlantis is twofold. First, we could further expand our existing hotel and casino, thereby providing more hotel rooms. Second, we could develop the 16-acre parcel we own across Virginia Street from the Atlantis. This site is connected to the Atlantis by the Sky Terrace and is currently used for surface parking and special events related to the Atlantis. Our 16-acre parcel meets all current Reno zoning requirements in the event we decide to build another resort casino or entertainment facility. We also own additional land adjacent to our two large sites that would facilitate expansion opportunities by allowing us to relocate certain of our administrative and other non-operational personnel and offices. 

&#160; 

On August 28, 2015, the Company entered into a 20-year lease (the &#147;Parking Lot Lease) with Biggest Little Investments, L.P. with respect to a portion of the Shopping Center, adjacent to the Atlantis property. This lease gives the Atlantis the right to use a parcel, approximately 4.2 acres, comprised of commercial building and surrounding land. The primary purpose of the Parking Lot Lease is to provide additional, convenient, Atlantis surface parking. We have demolished the building and are in the process of converting the now vacant land into approximately 300 additional surface parking spaces for the Atlantis. We expect this work to be completed in the second quarter of 2016. 

&#160; 

As discussed in the &#147;Monarch Casino Black Hawk&#148; section above, we own a 1.5 acre land parcel contiguous to the Monarch Casino Black Hawk which is zoned for gaming that we plan to utilize for expansion of that facility. 

&#160; 

Marketing Strategy 

&#160; 

Reno/Sparks . &#160; Our marketing efforts are directed toward three broad consumer groups: leisure travelers, conventioneers and northern Nevada local residents.

&#160; 

The Reno/Sparks region is a major gaming and leisure destination with aggregate gaming revenues of approximately $690 million (as reported by the Nevada State Gaming Control Board for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015). 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Our Atlantis revenues and operating income are principally dependent on the level of gaming activity at the Atlantis casino. Our predominant marketing goal is to utilize all of the Atlantis amenities to generate additional casino play. Our secondary goal is to maximize revenues from our hotel, food and beverage, spa, convention and meeting rooms, retail and other amenities. 

&#160; 

We believe the Atlantis&#146; location south of downtown Reno (near the airport, near major freeway arteries and physically connected to the Reno-Sparks Convention Center) makes the facility appealing to all three groups. 

&#160; 

Leisure Travelers : The Reno/Tahoe region is a popular gaming and vacation destination. The principal segments of Reno&#146;s leisure traveler market are independent travelers, package tour and travel guests, guests we reach through the internet and high-end players. We attempt to maximize our gaming revenues and hotel occupancy through a balanced marketing approach that addresses each market segment.

&#160; 

Independent travelers make reservations directly with hotels of their choice, through independent travel agents or through the internet. We strive to attract the middle to upper-middle income strata of this consumer segment through advertising and direct marketing. This segment represents a large portion of the Atlantis&#146; guests. 

&#160; 

The package tour and travel segment consists of visitors who utilize travel packages offered by wholesale operators. We market to this segment through relationships with select wholesalers, primarily to generate guest visits and supplement mid-week occupancy. 

&#160; 

We welcome domestic and international reservations on the Atlantis&#146; website www.atlantiscasino.com and we are featured on major package tour and travel websites. 

&#160; 

We market to high-end players selectively through direct sales and hosts. We utilize complimentary rooms, food and beverage, special events and the extension of gaming credit to attract, and maintain patronage from, high-end players. 

&#160; 

Conventioneers : Convention business, like package tour and travel business, supplements occupancy during lower-demand periods. Conventioneers also typically pay higher average room rates than non-conventioneers. We selectively seek convention and meeting groups that we believe will materially enhance the Atlantis&#146; occupancy and daily room rates, as well as those we believe will be more likely to utilize our gaming products. As the only hotel-casino physically connected to the Reno-Sparks Convention Center, the Atlantis is, in our view, uniquely positioned to capitalize on this segment. We believe the Reno-Sparks Convention Center has created, and we expect will continue to create, additional guest traffic for the Atlantis within this market segment that is presently underserved in the Reno area.

&#160; 

We market to all guest segments, including conventioneers, on the basis of the location, quality and ambiance of the Atlantis facility, gaming values, friendly, efficient service, and the quality and relative value of Atlantis rooms, food and beverage offerings, entertainment and promotions. 

&#160; 

Our players&#146; club, &#147;Club Paradise,&#148; allows our guests to be eligible to receive rewards and privileges based on the amount of their play, while allowing us to track play patterns through a computerized system. We use this information to determine appropriate levels of complimentary awards and to guide our direct marketing efforts. We believe that Club Paradise significantly enhances our ability to build guest loyalty and generate repeat guest visits. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Northern Nevada Residents : We market to northern Nevada residents (referred to as &#147;Locals&#148;) on the basis of the Atlantis&#146; location and accessibility; convenient surface parking; gaming values; ambiance; friendly efficient service; quality and relative value of food and beverage offerings.

&#160; 

Black Hawk . Our marketing efforts are directed toward patrons from the Denver metropolitan area and to Colorado mountain areas. Black Hawk is approximately 40 miles west of Denver.

&#160; 

Our Monarch Casino Black Hawk revenues and operating income are principally dependent on the level of gaming activity in the Black Hawk market. Our predominant marketing goal is to provide a desired mix of high quality gaming products in an attractive setting while providing superior food and beverage offerings. In August 2015 we completed the redesign and upgrade of the existing Monarch Casino Black Hawk, bringing to the facility&#146;s interior the same quality, ambiance and finishes of the ongoing master planned expansion that will transform Monarch Casino Black Hawk into a full-scale casino resort and satisfy all of our guests&#146; requirements during their visit. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Reno/Sparks. &#160; Gaming competition in the Reno area is intense. Based on information obtained from the December 31, 2015 Gaming Revenue Report published by the Nevada State Gaming Control Board, there are approximately 14 casinos in the Reno-Sparks area which each generated more than $12.0 million in annual gaming revenues.

&#160; 

We believe that the Atlantis&#146; primary competition for leisure travelers comes from other large-scale casinos that offer amenities that appeal to middle to upper-middle income guests. We compete for leisure travelers on the basis of the desirability of our location, the quality and ambiance of the Atlantis facility, friendly, efficient service, the quality and relative value of our rooms and food and beverage offerings, entertainment offerings, promotions and gaming values. We believe that our location away from downtown Reno is appealing to first-time and more affluent guests. 

&#160; 

We believe that the Atlantis&#146; primary competition for conventioneers comes from other large-scale hotel casinos in the Reno area that actively target the convention market segment, and from other cities in the western United States with large convention facilities and substantial hotel capacity, including Las Vegas. We compete for conventioneers based on the desirability of our location, the quality and ambiance of the Atlantis facility, meeting and banquet rooms designed to appeal to conventions and groups, friendly, efficient service, and the quality and relative value of our rooms and food and beverage offerings. We believe that the Atlantis&#146; proximity to the Reno-Sparks Convention Center, and the enclosed pedestrian sky bridge that connects the Atlantis directly with the Reno-Sparks Convention Center facilities, affords us a distinct competitive advantage in attracting conventioneers. 

&#160; 

We believe that the Atlantis&#146; competition for northern Nevada residents comes primarily from other large-scale casinos located outside of downtown Reno that offer amenities that appeal to middle to upper-middle income guests, and secondarily with those casinos located in downtown Reno that offer similar amenities. We compete for northern Nevada residents primarily on the basis of the desirability of our location, the quality and ambiance of the Atlantis facility, friendly, efficient service, the quality and relative value of our food and beverage offerings, entertainment offerings, promotions and gaming values. We believe the Atlantis&#146; proximity to residential areas in south Reno and its abundant surface parking provide us an advantage over the casinos located in downtown Reno in attracting Locals. 

&#160; 

The Atlantis also competes for gaming guests with hotel casino operations located in other parts of Nevada, especially Las Vegas and Lake Tahoe, and with hotel casinos, located elsewhere throughout the United States and the world. Major Native American owned facilities in central and northern California have been very successful, adversely impacting many hotel casinos in Reno. We believe that the Atlantis also competes to a lesser extent with state-sponsored lotteries, off-track wagering, card parlors and other forms of legalized gaming, particularly in northern California and the Pacific Northwest. We believe our numerous amenities, such as a wide array of restaurants, banquet facilities, spa and surface parking are key advantages in our ability to attract Locals that competitor facilities cannot easily match without significant capital expenditures. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

We also believe that the legalization of additional land-based casino gaming in or near any major metropolitan area in the Atlantis&#146; feeder markets, such as San Francisco or Sacramento, could have a material adverse impact on our business. 

&#160; 

The legalization of internet poker and other forms of internet gaming in additional jurisdictions throughout the United States could create further competition for the Atlantis. 

&#160; 

Black Hawk . There is strong competition in the concentrated Black Hawk/Central City area gaming market including approximately 24 casinos, which generated approximately $620 million in annual gaming revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 according to the Colorado Division of Gaming.

&#160; 

The Black Hawk and Central City gaming market is geographically isolated. The only other non-tribal gaming market is Cripple Creek, seventy-five miles away. There are two federally recognized tribes in southwest Colorado, both with gaming facilities, more than 350 miles from Denver. There have been proposals for the development of Native American, racetrack and video lottery terminal casinos throughout the state over the years. None of the proposals has been adopted by the state&#146;s electorate or by the legislature. Should any form of additional gaming be authorized in the Denver metropolitan area, the Black Hawk and Central City market would be adversely affected. 

&#160; 

We believe that the Monarch Casino Black Hawk&#146;s primary competition for visitors comes from larger-scale casinos in the market which offer amenities that appeal to the guest&#146;s entire vacation experience including hotel, broader dining choices as well as other amenities. We compete for patrons on the basis of the desirability of our location, which is the first casino encountered when entering the area on the main thoroughfare, as well as the attractive setting, friendly, efficient service, quality and relative value of our food and beverage offerings, promotions and gaming values.

Financial Information about Segments and Geographic Areas

For additional information regarding revenues, operating profit or loss and total assets, see Item 8, &#147;FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMNATARY DATA.&#148; 

&#160; 

Regulation and Licensing 

&#160; 

Nevada. The ownership and operation of casino gaming facilities in Nevada are subject to the &#147;Nevada Gaming Control Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder, referred to as the &#147;Nevada Act&#148;, and various local regulations. Our gaming operations are subject to the licensing and regulatory control of the Nevada Gaming Commission, the Nevada State Gaming Control Board, and the Reno City Council, referred to collectively as the Nevada Gaming Authorities.

&#160; 

&#160; 

The laws, regulations and supervisory procedures of the Nevada Gaming Authorities are based upon declarations of public policy that are concerned with, among other things: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; the prevention of unsavory or unsuitable persons from having a direct or indirect involvement with gaming at any time or in any capacity;

&#183; &#160; the establishment and maintenance of responsible accounting practices and procedures;

&#183; &#160; the maintenance of effective controls over the financial practices of licensees, including the establishment of minimum procedures for internal fiscal affairs and the safeguarding of assets and revenues, providing reliable record keeping and requiring the filing of periodic reports with the Nevada Gaming Authorities;

&#183; &#160; the prevention of cheating and fraudulent practices; and

&#183; &#160; providing a source of state and local revenues through taxation and licensing fees.

&#160; 

Changes in such laws, regulations and procedures could have an adverse effect on our gaming operations. 

&#160; 

Golden Road, our subsidiary which operates the Atlantis, is required to be licensed by the Nevada Gaming Authorities. This gaming license requires the periodic payment of fees and taxes and is not transferable. We are registered by the Nevada Gaming Commission as a publicly traded corporation, or Registered Corporation. As such, we are required periodically to submit detailed financial and operating reports to the Nevada Gaming Commission and to furnish any other information that the Nevada Gaming Commission may require. No person may become a stockholder of, or receive any percentage of profits from Golden Road without first obtaining licenses and approvals from the Nevada Gaming Authorities. Golden Road and Monarch have obtained from the Nevada Gaming Authorities the various registrations, approvals, permits and licenses required in order to engage in gaming activities in Nevada. 

&#160; 

The Nevada Gaming Authorities may investigate any individual who has a material relationship to, or material involvement with Golden Road or Monarch in order to determine whether that individual is suitable or should be licensed as a business associate of a gaming licensee. Officers, directors and key employees of Golden Road must file applications with the Nevada Gaming Authorities and may be required to be licensed or found suitable by the Nevada Gaming Authorities. Our officers, directors and key employees who are actively and directly involved in gaming activities of Golden Road may be required to be licensed or found suitable by the Nevada Gaming Authorities. The Nevada Gaming Authorities may deny an application for licensure on suitability for any cause that they deem reasonable. A finding of suitability is comparable to licensing, and both require submission of detailed personal and financial information followed by a thorough investigation. Applicants for licensing or a finding of suitability must pay all costs of the investigation. Changes in licensed positions must be reported to the Nevada Gaming Authorities. In addition to their authority to deny an application for a finding of unsuitability or licensure requirements, the Nevada Gaming Authorities also have jurisdiction to disapprove a change in a corporate position. 

&#160; 

If the Nevada Gaming Authorities were to find an officer, director or key employee unsuitable for licensing or unsuitable to continue having a relationship with Golden Road or us, the companies involved would have to sever all relationships with that person. In addition, the Nevada Gaming Commission may require that we terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications. Determinations of suitability and questions pertaining to licensing are not subject to judicial review in Nevada. 

&#160; 

We are required to submit detailed financial and operating reports to the Nevada Gaming Authorities. Substantially all material loans, leases, sales of securities and similar financing transactions by us must be reported to, or approved by, the Nevada Gaming Authorities. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

If it were determined that we violated the Nevada Act, our gaming licenses and registrations with the Nevada Gaming Commission could be limited, conditioned, suspended or revoked, subject to compliance with certain statutory and regulatory procedures. In addition, we and the persons involved could be subject to substantial fines for each separate violation of the Nevada Act at the discretion of the Nevada Gaming Commission. Further, the Nevada Gaming Commission could appoint a supervisor to operate our gaming properties and, under certain circumstances, earnings generated during the supervisor&#146;s appointment (except for the reasonable rental value of our gaming properties) could be forfeited to the State of Nevada. The limitation, conditioning or suspension of any gaming license or the appointment of a supervisor could (and revocation of any gaming license would) materially adversely affect our gaming operations. 

&#160; 

Any beneficial holder of our voting securities, regardless of the number of shares owned, may be required to file an application, be investigated, and have his or her suitability as a beneficial holder of our voting securities determined if the Nevada Gaming Commission has reason to believe that such ownership would otherwise be inconsistent with the declared policies of the State of Nevada. The applicant must pay all costs of investigation incurred by the Nevada Gaming Authorities in conducting any such investigation. 

&#160; 

The Nevada Act requires any person who acquires more than 5% of Monarch&#146;s voting securities to report the acquisition to the Nevada Gaming Commission. The Nevada Act requires that beneficial owners of more than 10% of our voting securities apply to the Nevada Gaming Commission for a finding of suitability within 30 days after the Chairman of the Nevada Gaming Control Board mails the written notice requiring such filing. Under certain circumstances, an &#147;institutional investor,&#148; as defined in the Nevada Act, which acquires more than 10%, but not more than 25%, of our voting securities may apply to the Nevada Gaming Commission for a waiver of such finding of suitability if the institutional investor holds the voting securities for investment purposes only. If the acquisition is above 20% of the voting securities, the institutional investor may also apply for a waiver of the requirement for an approval of a change of control. An institutional investor is not deemed to hold voting securities for investment purposes unless the securities were acquired and are held in the ordinary course of business as an institutional investor and not for the purpose of causing, directly or indirectly, the election of a majority of the members of the board of directors, any change in our corporate charter, bylaws, management, policies or operations, or any of our gaming affiliates, or any other action that the Nevada Gaming Commission finds to be inconsistent with holding our voting securities for investment purposes only. Activities that are not deemed to be inconsistent with holding voting securities for investment purposes only include: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; voting on all matters voted on by stockholders;

&#183; &#160; making financial and other inquiries of management of the type normally made by securities analysts for informational purposes and not to cause a change in its management, policies or operations; and

&#183; &#160; such other activities as the Nevada Gaming Commission may determine to be consistent with such investment intent.

&#160; 

If the beneficial holder of voting securities who must be found suitable is a corporation, partnership or trust, it must submit detailed business and financial information including a list of beneficial owners. The applicant is required to pay all costs of investigation. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Any person who fails or refuses to apply for a finding of suitability or a license within 30 days after being ordered to do so by the Nevada Gaming Commission or the Chairman of the Nevada State Gaming Control Board may be found unsuitable. The same restrictions apply to a record owner if the record owner, after request, fails to identify the beneficial owner. Any stockholder found unsuitable and who holds, directly or indirectly, any beneficial ownership of the common stock of a Registered Corporation beyond such period of time as may be prescribed by the Nevada Gaming Commission may be guilty of a criminal offense. We are subject to disciplinary action if, after we receive notice that a person is unsuitable to be a stockholder or to have any other relationship with us, we: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; pay that person any dividend or interest upon voting securities;

&#183; &#160; allow that person to exercise, directly or indirectly, any voting right conferred through securities held by that person;

&#183; &#160; pay remuneration in any form to that person for services rendered or otherwise; or

&#183; &#160; fail to pursue all lawful efforts to require such unsuitable person to relinquish his voting securities for cash at fair market value.

&#160; 

The Nevada Gaming Commission may, in its discretion, require the holder of any debt security of a Registered Corporation to file applications, be investigated and be found suitable to own the debt security of a Registered Corporation. If the Nevada Gaming Commission determines that a person is unsuitable to own such security, then pursuant to the Nevada Act, the Registered Corporation can be sanctioned, including the loss of its approvals if, without the prior approval of the Nevada Gaming Commission, it: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; pays to the unsuitable person any dividend, interest, or any distribution;

&#183; &#160; recognizes any voting right by such unsuitable person in connection with such securities;

&#183; &#160; pays the unsuitable person remuneration in any form; or

&#183; &#160; makes any payment to the unsuitable person by way of principal, redemption, conversion, exchange, liquidation or similar transaction.

&#160; 

We are required to maintain a current stock ledger in Nevada, and the Nevada Gaming Authorities may examine the ledger at any time. If any securities are held in trust by an agent or a nominee, the record holder may be required to disclose the identity of the beneficial owner to the Nevada Gaming Authorities. A failure to make such disclosure may be grounds for finding the record holder unsuitable. We are also required to render maximum assistance in determining the identity of the beneficial owner. The Nevada Gaming Commission may require our stock certificates to bear a legend indicating that the securities are subject to the Nevada Act. 

&#160; 

We may not make a public offering of our securities without the prior approval of the Nevada Gaming Commission if the securities or proceeds therefrom are intended to be used to construct, acquire or finance gaming facilities in Nevada, or to retire or extend obligations incurred for purposes of constructing, acquiring or financing gaming facilities. Any approval, if granted, does not constitute a finding, recommendation or approval by the Nevada Gaming Authorities as to the accuracy or adequacy of the prospectus or the investment merits of the securities offered. Any representation to the contrary is unlawful. 

&#160; 

Changes in our control through merger, consolidation, stock or asset acquisitions, management or consulting agreements, or any act or conduct by a person whereby that person obtains control (including foreclosure on the pledged shares), may not occur without the prior approval of the Nevada Gaming Commission. Entities seeking to acquire control of a Registered Corporation must satisfy the Nevada Gaming Authorities in a variety of stringent standards prior to assuming control of such Registered Corporation. The Nevada Gaming Commission may also require controlling stockholders, officers, directors and other persons having a material relationship or involvement with the entity proposing to acquire control, to be investigated and licensed or found suitable as part of the approval process relating to the transaction. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The Nevada Legislature has declared that some corporate acquisitions opposed by management, repurchases of voting securities and corporate defense tactics affecting Nevada gaming licensees, and Registered Corporations that are affiliated with those operations, may be injurious to stable and productive corporate gaming. The Nevada Gaming Commission has established a regulatory scheme to ameliorate the potentially adverse effects of these business practices upon Nevada&#146;s gaming industry and to further Nevada&#146;s policy to: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; assure the financial stability of corporate gaming operators and their affiliates;

&#183; &#160; preserve the beneficial aspects of conducting business in the corporate form; and

&#183; &#160; promote a neutral environment for the orderly governance of corporate affairs.

&#160; 

We are, in certain circumstances, required to receive approval from the Nevada Gaming Commission before we can make exceptional repurchases of voting securities above their current market price and before we can consummate a corporate acquisition opposed by management. The Nevada Act also requires prior approval of a plan of recapitalization proposed by the board of directors in response to a tender offer made directly to a Registered Corporation&#146;s stockholders for the purposes of acquiring control of the Registered Corporation. 

&#160; 

Licensee fees and taxes, computed in various ways depending on the type of gaming or activity involved, are payable to the State of Nevada and to the counties and cities in which the Nevada licensee&#146;s respective operations are conducted. Depending upon the particular fee or tax involved, these fees and taxes are payable monthly, quarterly or annually and are based upon either: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; a percentage of the gross revenues received;

&#183; &#160; the number of gaming devices operated; or

&#183; &#160; the number of table games operated.

&#160; 

A live entertainment tax is also paid where entertainment is furnished in connection with the selling of food or refreshments. Nevada licensees that hold a license as an operator of a slot route, a manufacturer or a distributor also pay certain fees and taxes to the State of Nevada. 

&#160; 

Any person who is licensed, required to be licensed, registered, required to be registered, or is under common control with such persons, referred to as &#147;Licensees&#148;, and who is or proposes to become involved in a gaming venture outside of Nevada is required to deposit with the Nevada State Gaming Control Board, and thereafter maintain, a revolving fund in the amount of $10,000 to pay the expenses of investigation by the Nevada State Gaming Control Board of their participation in foreign gaming. The revolving fund is subject to increase or decrease in the discretion of the Nevada Gaming Commission. Thereafter, Licensees are required to comply with certain reporting requirements imposed by the Nevada Act. Licensees are also subject to disciplinary action by the Nevada Gaming Commission if they knowingly violate any laws of the foreign jurisdiction pertaining to the foreign gaming operation, fail to conduct the foreign gaming operation in accordance with the standards of honesty and integrity required of Nevada gaming operations, engage in activities that are harmful to the State of Nevada or its ability to collect gaming taxes and fees, or employ a person in the foreign operation who has been denied a license or finding of suitability in Nevada on the ground of personal unsuitability. 

&#160; 

Colorado. As prescribed by the Colorado Limited Gaming Act of 1991 (the &#147;Colorado Act&#148;), the ownership and operation of limited stakes gaming facilities in Colorado are subject to the Colorado Gaming Regulations (the &#147;Colorado Regulations&#148;) and final authority of the Colorado Limited Gaming Control Commission (the &#147;Colorado Commission&#148;). The Colorado Act also created the Colorado Division of Gaming within the Colorado Department of Revenue to license, supervise and enforce the conduct of limited stakes gaming in Colorado.

&#160; 

&#160; 

The Colorado Act declares public policy on limited stakes gaming to be that: (1) the success of limited stakes gaming is dependent upon public confidence and trust that licensed limited stakes gaming is conducted honestly and competitively, the rights of the creditors of licensees are protected and gaming is free from criminal and corruptive elements; (2) public confidence and trust can be maintained only by strict regulation of all persons, locations, practices, associations and activities related to the operation of licensed gaming establishments and the manufacture or distribution of gaming devices and equipment; (3) all establishments where limited gaming is conducted and where gambling devices are operated, and all manufacturers, sellers and distributors of certain gambling devices and equipment, must therefore be licensed, controlled and assisted to protect the public health, safety, good order and the general welfare of the inhabitants of the state to foster the stability and success of limited stakes gaming and to preserve the economy, policies and free competition in Colorado; and (4) no applicant for a license or other affirmative Colorado Commission approval has any right to a license or to the granting of the approval sought. Having the authority to impose fines, the Colorado Commission has broad discretion to issue, condition, suspend for up to six months, revoke, limit or restrict at any time the following licenses: slot machine manufacturer or distributor, operator, retail gaming, support and key employee gaming licenses. With limited exceptions applicable to licensees that are publicly traded entities, no person may sell, lease, purchase, convey or acquire any interest in a retail gaming or operator license or business without the prior approval of the Colorado Commission. Any license issued or other Colorado Commission approval granted pursuant to the Colorado Act is a revocable privilege, and no holder acquires any vested rights therein. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to an amendment to the Colorado Constitution (the &#147;Colorado Amendment&#148;), limited stakes gaming became lawful in the cities of Central City, Black Hawk and Cripple Creek on October 1, 1991. Currently, limited stakes gaming means a maximum single bet of $100 on slot machines and in the games of blackjack, poker, craps and roulette. Gaming is permitted to be conducted 24 hours each day. 

&#160; 

Limited stakes gaming is confined to the commercial districts of these cities as defined by Central City on October 7, 1981, by Black Hawk on May 4, 1978, and by Cripple Creek on December 3, 1973. In addition, the Colorado Amendment restricts limited stakes gaming to structures that conform to the architectural styles and designs that were common to the areas prior to World War I and that conform to the requirements of applicable city ordinances regardless of the age of the structures. Under the Colorado Amendment, no more than 35% of the square footage of any building and no more than 50% of any one floor of any building may be used for limited stakes gaming. Persons under the age of 21 cannot participate in limited stakes gaming. The Colorado Constitution provides for a tax on the total amount wagered less all payouts to players at graduated annual rates. The gaming tax rates in effect as of July 1, 2008 can only be increased by amendment to the Colorado Constitution by voters in a statewide election. With respect to games of poker, the tax is calculated based on the sums wagered that are retained by the licensee as compensation, which must be consistent with the minimum and maximum amounts established by the Colorado Commission. The graduated rates effective as of July 1, 2012 are: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; 0.25% up to and including $2 million of the subject amounts;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; 2.0% on amounts from $2 million to $5 million;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; 9.0% on amounts from $5 million to $8 million;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; 11.0% on amounts from $8 million to $10 million;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; 16.0% on amounts from $10 million to $13 million; and

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; 20.0% on amounts over $13 million.

&#160; 

&#160; 

The City of Black Hawk also assesses two monthly device fees that are based on the number of gaming devices operated. Those consist of a $78.75 fee per device and a transportation device fee of $6.42 per device. 

&#160; 

The Colorado Commission has enacted Rule 4.5, which imposes requirements on publicly traded corporations holding gaming licenses in Colorado and on gaming licenses owned directly or indirectly by a publicly traded corporation, whether through a subsidiary or intermediary company. The term &#147;publicly traded corporation&#148; includes corporations, firms, limited liability companies, trusts, partnerships and other forms of business organizations. Such requirements automatically apply to any ownership interest held by a publicly traded corporation, holding company or intermediary company thereof, where the ownership interest directly or indirectly is, or will be upon approval of the Colorado Commission, 5% or more of the entire licensee. In any event, if the Colorado Commission determines that a publicly traded corporation or a subsidiary, intermediary company or holding company has the actual ability to exercise influence over a licensee, regardless of the percentage of ownership possessed by such entity, the Colorado Commission may require the entity to comply with the disclosure regulations contained in Rule 4.5. 

&#160; 

Under Rule 4.5, gaming licensees, affiliated companies and controlling persons commencing a public offering of voting securities must notify the Colorado Commission no later than 10 business days after the initial filing of a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Licensed publicly traded corporations are also required to send proxy statements to the Division of Gaming within five days after their distribution. Licensees to whom Rule 4.5 applies must include in their charter documents provisions that restrict the rights of the licensees to issue voting interests or securities except in accordance with the Colorado Act and the Colorado Regulations; limit the rights of persons to transfer voting interests or securities of licensees except in accordance with the Colorado Act and the Colorado Regulations; and provide that holders of voting interests or securities of licensees found unsuitable by the Colorado Commission may, within 60 days of such finding of unsuitability, be required to sell their interests or securities back to the issuer at the lesser of the cash equivalent of the holders&#146; investment or the market price as of the date of the finding of unsuitability. Alternatively, the holders may, within 60 days after the finding of unsuitability, transfer the voting interests or securities to a suitable person, as determined by the Colorado Commission. Until the voting interests or securities are held by suitable persons, the issuer may not pay dividends or interest, the securities may not be voted and may not be included in the voting or securities of the issuer, and the issuer may not pay any remuneration in any form to the holders of the securities. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to Rule 4.5, persons who acquire direct or indirect beneficial ownership of (a) 5% or more of any class of voting securities of a publicly traded corporation that is required to include in its articles of incorporation the Rule 4.5 charter language provisions; or (b) 5% or more of the beneficial interest in a gaming licensee directly or indirectly through any class of voting securities of any holding company or intermediary company of a licensee, referred to as &#147;qualifying persons,&#148; shall notify the Division of Gaming within 10 days of such acquisition and submit all requested information. Such persons are subject to a finding of suitability as required by the Division of Gaming or the Colorado Commission. Licensees also must notify any qualifying persons of these requirements. A qualifying person other than an institutional investor whose interest equals 10% or more must apply to the Colorado Commission for a finding of suitability within 45 days after acquiring such securities. Licensees must also notify any qualifying persons of these requirements. Whether or not notified, qualifying persons are responsible for complying with these requirements. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

A qualifying person who is an institutional investor under Rule 4.5 and who, individually or in association with others, acquires, directly or indirectly, the beneficial ownership of 15% or more of any class of voting securities must apply to the Colorado Commission for a finding of suitability within 45 days after acquiring such interests. 

&#160; 

The Colorado Regulations provide for exemption from the requirements for a finding of suitability when the Colorado Commission finds such action to be consistent with the purposes of the Colorado Act. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to Rule 4.5, persons found unsuitable by the Colorado Commission must be removed from any position as an officer, director or employee of a licensee, or from a holding or intermediary company. Such unsuitable persons also are prohibited from any beneficial ownership of the voting securities of any such entities. Licensees, or affiliated entities of licensees, are subject to sanctions for paying dividends or distributions to persons found unsuitable by the Colorado Commission, or for recognizing voting rights of, or paying a salary or any remuneration for services to, unsuitable persons. Licensees or their affiliated entities also may be sanctioned for failing to pursue efforts to require unsuitable persons to relinquish their interest. The Colorado Commission may determine that anyone with a material relationship to, or material involvement with, a licensee or an affiliated company must apply for a finding of suitability or must apply for a key employee license. 

&#160; 

The Colorado Regulations require that every officer, director and stockholder of private corporations or equivalent office or ownership holders for non-corporate applicants, and every officer, director or stockholder holding either a 5% or greater interest or controlling interest of a publicly traded corporation or owners of an applicant or licensee, shall be a person of good moral character and submit to a full background investigation conducted by the Division of Gaming and the Colorado Commission. The Colorado Commission may require any person having an interest in a license to undergo a full background investigation and pay the cost of investigation in the same manner as an applicant. 

&#160; 

The sale of alcoholic beverages in gaming establishments is subject to strict licensing, control and regulation by State and local authorities. Alcoholic beverage licenses are revocable and nontransferable. State and local licensing authorities have full power to limit, condition, suspend for as long as six months or revoke any such licenses. 

&#160; 

There are various classes of retail liquor licenses which may be issued under the Colorado Liquor Code. A gaming licensee may sell malt, vinous or spirituous liquors only by the individual drink for consumption on the premises. An application for an alcoholic beverage license in Colorado requires notice, posting and a public hearing before the local liquor licensing authority prior to approval. The Colorado Department of Revenue&#146;s Liquor Enforcement Division must also approve the application. Monarch Casino Black Hawk has been approved for a restaurant liquor license by both the local Black Hawk licensing authority and the State Division of Liquor Enforcement.
