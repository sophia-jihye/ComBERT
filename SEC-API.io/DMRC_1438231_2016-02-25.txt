The following discussion of our business should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Overview 

Digimarc Corporation enables governments and enterprises around the world to give digital identities to media and objects that computers can sense and recognize and to which they can react. We have developed the Digimarc Discover &#174; and Digimarc Barcode Intuitive Computing Platform that are designed to optimize the identification of all consumer brand impressions, wherever and whenever they may appear, facilitating modern mobile-centric shopping. The platform includes means to embed &#147;Digimarc Barcodes,&#148; invisible and inaudible barcode-like information that is recognizable by smartphones, industrial scanners, and other computer interfaces into virtually all forms of media content, including consumer product packaging. Digimarc Barcodes have many applications, including facilitating remarkably faster scanning of products at retail checkout as well as improved engagement with smartphone-equipped consumers. The Digimarc Barcode is robust yet imperceptible by people in ordinary use, allowing for reliable, efficient, economical, globally scalable automatic identification of media without visible computer codes like traditional barcodes. 

Our media identification and discovery innovations enable our business partners to create numerous applications across a wide range of media content, including solutions that: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Improve the speed of retail checkout; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Provide simple and intuitive mobile customer engagement experiences in stores; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Quickly and reliably identify and effectively manage music, movies, television programming, digital images, e-books, documents and other printed materials, especially in light of non-linear distribution over the Internet; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Deter counterfeiting of money, media and goods, and piracy of e-books, movies and music; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Support new digital media distribution models and methods to monetize media content; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Leverage the power of ubiquitous computing to instantly link consumers to a wealth of information and/or interactive experiences related to the media and objects they encounter each day; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Provide consumers with more choice and access to media content when, where and how they want it; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Enhance imagery and video by associating metadata or authenticating media content for government and commercial uses; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Better secure identity documents to enhance national security and combat identity theft and fraud. The Intuitive Computing Platform has a proprietary foundation in a signal processing innovation known as &#147;digital watermarking,&#148; which allows imperceptible digital information to be embedded in all forms of digitally designed, produced or distributed media content and many physical objects, including photographs, movies, music, television, personal identification documents, financial instruments, industrial parts and product packages. We refer to the embedded information as the Digimarc Barcode. This digital information can be detected and read by a wide range of computers, smartphones and other digital devices. 

Our inventions allow our business partners and customers to provide persistent digital identities for any media content that is digitally processed at some point during its lifecycle. The technology can be applied to printed materials, video, audio, and images. The inclusion of these digital signals enables a wide range of improvements in security and media management, and new business models for distribution and consumption of media content. Over the years our enabling software and business processes, and associated intellectual property portfolio have grown to encompass many related technologies. 

We provide solutions directly and through our business partners. Our inventions provide a powerful element of document security, giving rise to a long-term relationship with a consortium of central banks (&#147;Central Banks&#148;), and many leading companies in the information technology industry. We and our business partners have successfully propagated the use of our technology in music, movies, television broadcasts, digital images, e-books and printed materials. Digimarc Barcodes have been used in these applications to improve media rights and asset management, reduce piracy and counterfeiting losses, improve marketing programs, permit more efficient and effective distribution of valuable media content and enhance consumer entertainment and commercial experiences. 

In October 2010, we entered into a patent licensing arrangement with IV Digital Multimedia Inventions, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company affiliated with Intellectual Ventures (&#147;IV&#148;), pursuant to which we granted an exclusive license to sublicense, subject to pre-existing encumbrances and a grant-back license, an aggregate of approximately 900 of the 1,200 patents and applications held by us at the time the agreement was entered into, as noted below in the section titled &#147;Technology and Intellectual Property.&#148; Many of the patents licensed to IV have expired, and there are only a few pending applications on file, resulting in a decline in the number of licensed patents to approximately 600. This trend will continue. 

Digimarc Barcodes are easily embedded into all forms of media and are imperceptible to human senses, but quickly detected by computers, networks or other digital devices like smartphones. Unlike traditional barcodes and tags, our solution does not require publishers to give up valuable visual space in magazines and newspapers; nor does it impact the overall layout or aesthetics of the publication. Our Digimarc Discover platform delivers a range of rich media experiences to its readers on their smartphones across multiple media including print, audio, video and packaging. Unique to the Digimarc Discover platform is its seamless multi-model use of various content identification technologies as needed, including Digimarc Barcode when present. 

Banknote counterfeit deterrence was the first commercially successful large scale use of our technologies. Innovations based on our existing digital watermarking technology and experience have been leveraged to create new products to deter counterfeiting and tampering of driver licenses and other government-issued secure credentials. In parallel, our business partners, under patent or technology licenses from us, are delivering digital watermarking solutions to track and monitor the distribution of music, images, television and movies to consumers. In November of 2007, we announced a relationship with The Nielsen Company (US) LLC (&#147;Nielsen&#148;) to license our patents in support of Nielsen&#146;s industry leading television audience measurement solutions. In December 2012, we entered into a renewal and extension through 2024 of the Counterfeit Deterrence System Development and License Agreement with the Central Banks, with a 5-year extension option. 

&#160;

We introduced Digimarc Barcodes for use in consumer product packaging in 2014. These Digimarc Barcodes can contain the same information found in traditional universal product codes (&#147;UPC&#148;). The UPC information is invisibly repeated multiple times over the entire package surface. We partnered with Datalogic, a global leader in Automatic Data Capture and Industrial Automation markets and producer of barcode readers, in introducing the Digimarc Barcode to the consumer product packaging market. The first retail scanner enabled was Datalogic&#146;s Magellan TM 9800i multi-plane imaging scanner. Since then additional scanner vendors and other channel partners have announced support for the platform. Digimarc Barcodes can also connect mobile-enabled consumers directly from packaging to engaging mobile experiences such as additional product information, special offers, recommendations, reviews, social networks and more. 

Financial Information About Geographic Areas 

Financial information about geographic areas is included in Note 4 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Customers and Business Partners 

Our revenue is generated through commercial and government applications of our technology. We derive our revenue primarily from development services, subscriptions for products and services, and licensing of our technology and patents. During 2015, we generated the majority of our revenue from development services under a long-term contract with the Central Banks, subscriptions to our anti-piracy and copyright protection services, and royalties from Civolution. 

In 2015, revenue from government contracts accounted for 59% of our total revenue. Central Banks accounted for substantially all revenue generated under our government contracts. Our government contracts typically span one or more base years and multiple option years. Government customers generally have the right to not exercise option periods. As part of our work with government customers, we must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of government contracts. Government contract laws and regulations affect how we do business with our government customers and, in some instances, impose added costs on our business. 

Information about customers that accounted for 10% or more of revenue in the last three years is included in Note 4 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Products and Services 

We provide media identification and management solutions to commercial entities and government customers and license our technology and patent inventions to other solution providers. Our largest government customer is the Central Banks, with whom we have for the last 17 years been developing, deploying, supporting and continuing to enhance a system to deter digital counterfeiting of currency using personal computers and digital reprographics. We license primarily to commercial entities who use our technology and patented inventions in the media and entertainment industry. Commercial customers use a range of solutions from our business partners and us to identify, track, manage and protect content as it is distributed and consumed&#151;either digitally or physically&#151;and to enable new consumer applications to access networks and information from personal computers and mobile devices. Many movie studios, record labels, broadcasters, creative professionals and other customers rely on digital watermarking as a cost-effective means to: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; deter piracy and illegal use of movies, music and images; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; protect entertainment content from copyright infringement; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; track and monitor entertainment content for rights usage and licensing compliance; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; monitor advertisements to verify ad placement and measure return on investment; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; enhance information access, search and marketing capabilities related to media content; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; enable fair and legitimate use of content by consumers. Digimarc Barcodes are easily embedded into all forms of media and are imperceptible to human senses, but quickly detected by computers, networks or other digital devices like smartphones. Unlike traditional barcodes and tags, our solution does not require publishers to give up valuable space in magazines and newspapers; nor does it impact the overall layout or aesthetics of the publication. Our Digimarc Discover platform delivers a range of rich media experiences to its readers on their smartphones across multiple media including print, audio, video and packaging. Unique to the Digimarc Discover platform is its ability to use various content identification technologies as needed, including our patented technology. 

We introduced Digimarc Barcodes to the retail industry in 2014. Digimarc Barcodes contain the same information found in traditional universal product codes (&#147;UPC&#148;). The UPC information is invisibly repeated multiple times over the entire package surface. We partnered with Datalogic, a global leader in Automatic Data Capture and Industrial Automation markets and producer of barcode readers, in bringing the Digimarc Barcode to the market. The first retail scanner enabled was Datalogic&#146;s Magellan TM 9800i multi-plane imaging scanner. Since then additional scanner vendors and other channel partners have announced support for the platform. Digimarc Barcodes can also connect mobile-enabled consumers directly from packaging to engaging mobile experiences such as additional product information, special offers, recommendations, reviews, social networks and more. 

The market for patent licensing has become more challenging in recent years. As a result, we have shifted our focus from direct monetization via enforcement and licensing to: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; facilitating progress toward the realization of our vision to enrich everyday living via pervasive, intuitive computing; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; effectively monetize our patent assets; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; encouraging large scale adoption of our technologies by industry leaders; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; improving our financial performance by enhancing our competitive differentiation; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; increasing the scale and rate of growth of our products and services business; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; laying a foundation for continuing innovation. Current patent licensees include, among others, IV, Nielsen, Verance, Civolution, Overdrive, AlpVision SA, Monic, Signum Technologies and Verimatrix. 

Technology and Intellectual Property 

We seek patent protection for our inventions to differentiate our products and technologies, mitigate infringement risks, and develop opportunities for licensing. Our broad patent portfolio covers a wide range of methods, applications, system architectures and business processes. 

Most of our patents relate to various methods for embedding and decoding digital information in video, audio and images, whether the content is rendered in analog or digital formats. The digital information is generally embedded by making subtle modifications to the fundamental elements of the content itself, generally at a signal processing level. The changes necessary to embed this information are so subtle that they are generally not noticeable by people during normal use. Because the message is carried by the content itself, it is file-format independent. The embedded digital information generally survives most normal content transformations, including compression, edits, rotation, scaling, re-sampling, file-format transformations, copying, scanning and printing. 

&#160;

Our patent portfolio contains many innovations in digital watermarking, pattern recognition (sometimes referred to as &#147;fingerprinting&#148;), digital rights management and related fields. To protect our inventions, we have implemented an extensive intellectual property protection program that relies on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, and nondisclosure agreements and other contracts. As a result, we believe we have one of the world&#146;s most extensive patent portfolios in digital watermarking and related fields, with approximately 1,150 U.S. and foreign patents and pending patent applications as of December 31, 2015. We continue to develop and broaden our portfolio in the fields of media identification and management technology and related applications and systems. We devote significant resources to developing and protecting our inventions and continuously seek to identify and evaluate potential licensees for our patents. The patents in our portfolio have a life of approximately 20 years from the effective filing date, and up to 17 years after the patent has been granted.

Markets 

Our patented inventions are used in various media identification and management products and solutions supporting a variety of media objects, from movies and music to banknotes, secure credentials and consumer packaged goods. Each media object enabled by our inventions creates the potential for several applications, such as: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; counterfeiting and piracy deterrence; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; online e-book piracy protection; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; content identification and media management; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; authentication and monitoring; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; retail point of sale transaction processing; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; linking to networks and providing access to information; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; enhanced services in support of mobile commerce. We believe the market for most of these applications is in the early stages of development and that existing solutions represent only a small portion of the potential market for our products, services and technology. 

Competition 

No single competitor or small number of competitors dominate our market. Our competitors vary depending on the application of our products and services. Our business partners and we generally compete with non-digital watermarking technologies for the security or marketing budgets of the producers and distributors of media objects, documents, products and advertising. These alternatives include, among other things, encryption-based security systems and technologies and solutions based on fingerprinting, pattern recognition, and traditional barcodes. Our competitive position in digital watermarking applications is strong because of our large, high quality, sophisticated patent portfolio and our substantial and growing amount of intellectual property in related media security and management innovations that span basic technologies, applications, system designs and business processes. Our intellectual property portfolio allows us to use proprietary technologies that are well regarded by our customers and partners and not available to our competitors. We compete based on the variety of features we offer and a traditional cost/benefit analysis against alternative technologies and solutions. We anticipate that our competitive position within some markets may be affected by factors such as reluctance to adopt new technologies and by changes in government regulations. 

&#160;

Backlog 

Based on projected commitments we have for the periods under contract with our respective customers, we anticipate our current contracts as of December 31, 2015 will generate a minimum of $28 million in revenue. We expect approximately $15 million of this amount to be recognized as revenue during 2016. 

Some factors that lead to increased backlog include: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; contracts with new customers; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; renewals with current customers; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; add-on orders with customers; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; contracts with longer contractual periods replacing contracts with shorter contractual periods. Some factors that lead to decreased backlog include: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; recognition of revenue associated with backlog currently in place; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; contracts with shorter contractual periods replacing contracts with longer contractual periods; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; modifications to existing contracts; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; contract minimum payments ending; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; expiration of contracts with existing customers. The mix of these factors, among others, dictates whether our backlog increases or decreases for any given period. Our backlog may not result in actual revenue in any particular period, because the orders, awards and contracts included in our backlog may be subject to modification, cancellation or suspension. We may not realize revenue on certain contracts, orders or awards included in our backlog or the timing of any realization may change. 

Employees 

At December 31, 2015, we had 166 full-time employees, including 53 in sales, marketing, technical support and customer support; 83 in research, development and engineering, including intellectual property; and 30 in finance, administration, information technology and legal. 

Our employees are not covered by any collective bargaining agreement, and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We believe that our relations with our employees are good. 

Available Information 

We make available free of charge through our website at www.digimarc.com our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to these and other reports filed or furnished by us pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as soon as reasonably practicable after we file these materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
