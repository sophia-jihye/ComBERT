 ITEM 1. BUSINESS. &#160;

United Community Banks, Inc. (&#8220;United&#8221;), a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the &#8220;BHC Act&#8221;), was incorporated under the laws of Georgia in 1987 and commenced operations in 1988 by acquiring 100% of the outstanding shares of Union County Bank, Blairsville, Georgia, now known as United Community Bank, Blairsville, Georgia (the &#8220;Bank&#8221;).

&#160;

Since the early 1990&#8217;s, United has actively expanded its market coverage through organic growth complemented by selective acquisitions, primarily of banks whose managements share United&#8217;s community banking and customer service philosophies. Although those acquisitions have directly contributed to United&#8217;s growth, their contribution has primarily been to provide United access to new markets with attractive organic growth potential. Organic growth in assets includes growth through existing offices as well as growth at de novo locations and post-acquisition growth at acquired banking offices.

&#160;

To emphasize its commitment to community banking, United conducts substantially all of its operations through a community-focused operating model of separate &#8220;community banks&#8221;, which as of December 31, 2015, operated at 134 locations throughout the Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Roswell, Georgia, and Gainesville, Georgia metropolitan statistical areas, upstate South Carolina, north and coastal Georgia, western North Carolina, and east Tennessee. Also, United has commercial loan offices in Charlotte, North Carolina and Charleston, South Carolina. The community banks offer a full range of retail and corporate banking services, including checking, savings and time deposit accounts, secured and unsecured loans, wire transfers, brokerage services and other financial services, and are led by local bank presidents (referred to herein as the &#8220;Community Bank Presidents&#8221;) and management with significant experience in, and ties to, their communities. Each of the Community Bank Presidents has authority, alone or with other local officers, to make most credit decisions. In recent years, United has developed a number of specialized lending areas focusing on asset-based lending, commercial real estate, middle market businesses, United States Small Business Administration (&#8220;SBA&#8221;) and United States Department of Agriculture (&#8220;USDA&#8221;) guaranteed loans and builder finance. Although the specialized lending areas have their own customers, they also work with the community banks to provide their specialized lending expertise to help the community banks better serve their customers. This partnership helps United to position itself as a community bank with large bank resources. Management believes that this operating model provides a competitive advantage. 

&#160;

The Bank, through its full-service retail mortgage lending division, United Community Mortgage Services (&#8220;UCMS&#8221;), is approved as a seller/servicer for the Federal National Mortgage Association (&#8220;Fannie Mae&#8221;) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (&#8220;Freddie Mac&#8221;) and provides fixed and adjustable-rate home mortgages. During 2015, the Bank originated $494 million of residential mortgage loans throughout its footprint in Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee and South Carolina for the purchase of homes and to refinance existing mortgage debt. Substantially all of these mortgages were sold into the secondary market without recourse to the Bank, other than for breaches of warranties. With the acquisition of The Palmetto Bank in late 2015, United began retaining the servicing on some of its mortgage production. United&#8217;s residential mortgage servicing portfolio included $377 million in loans at December 31, 2015.

&#160;

The Bank owns an insurance agency, United Community Insurance Services, Inc. (&#8220;UCIS&#8221;), known as United Community Advisory Services, which is a subsidiary of the Bank. United also owns a captive insurance subsidiary, United Community Risk Management Services, Inc. (&#8220;UCRMSI&#8221;) that provides risk management services for United&#8217;s subsidiaries. Another Bank subsidiary, United Community Payment Systems, LLC (&#8220;UCPS&#8221;), provides payment processing services for the Bank&#8217;s commercial and small business customers. UCPS is a joint venture with Security Card Services, LLC, a merchant services provider headquartered in Oxford, Mississippi.

&#160;

United produces fee revenue through its sale of non-deposit investment products. Those products are sold by employees of United that are licensed financial advisors doing business as United Community Advisory Services. United has an affiliation with a third party broker/dealer, Invest Financial, to facilitate this line of business. &#160;

Monetary Policy and Economic Conditions 

&#160;

United&#8217;s profitability depends to a substantial extent on the difference between interest revenue received from loans, investments, and other earning assets, and the interest paid on deposits and other liabilities. These rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the control of United, including national and international economic conditions and the monetary policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities, particularly the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &#8220;Federal Reserve&#8221;). The instruments of monetary policy employed by the Federal Reserve include open market operations in U.S. government securities, changes in the discount rate on bank borrowings and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits.

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160;

The market for banking and bank-related services is highly competitive. United actively competes in its market areas, which include north Georgia, the Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Roswell, Georgia metropolitan statistical area, the Gainesville, Georgia metropolitan statistical area, coastal Georgia, western North Carolina, east Tennessee and upstate South Carolina, with other providers of deposit and credit services. These competitors include other commercial banks, savings banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, mortgage companies, and brokerage firms.

Lending Policy 

&#160;

The Bank makes loans primarily to persons or businesses that reside, work, own property, or operate in its primary market areas, except for specific specialized lending strategies such as SBA and franchise lending. Unsecured loans are generally made only to persons who qualify for such credit based on their credit history, net worth, income and liquidity. Secured loans are made to persons who are well established and have the credit history, net worth, collateral, and cash flow to support the loan. Exceptions to the Bank&#8217;s policies are permitted on a case-by-case basis. Major policy exceptions require an approving officer to document the reason for the exception. Loans exceeding a lending officer&#8217;s credit limit must be approved through a credit approval process involving Regional Credit Managers. Consumer loans are approved through centralized consumer credit centers.

&#160;

United&#8217;s Credit Administration department provides each lending officer with written guidelines for lending activities as approved by the Bank&#8217;s Board of Directors. Limited lending authority is delegated to lending officers by Credit Administration as authorized by the Bank&#8217;s Board of Directors. Loans in excess of individual officer credit authority must be approved by a senior officer with sufficient approval authority delegated by Credit Administration as authorized by the Bank&#8217;s Board of Directors. The Senior Credit Committee approves loans where the total relationship exposure exceeds $8.5 million. At December 31, 2015, the Bank&#8217;s secured legal lending limit was $242 million; however, the Board of Directors has established an internal lending limit of $28 million and an individual real estate project limit of $17 million.

&#160; 

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Commercial Lending 

&#160; 

United utilizes its Regional Credit Managers to provide credit administration support for commercial loans to the Bank as needed. The Regional Credit Managers have lending authority set by Credit Administration based on characteristics of the markets they serve. The Regional Credit Managers also provide credit underwriting support as needed by the community banks they serve.

&#160; 

Consumer Credit Center 

United has implemented a centralized consumer credit center that provides underwriting, regulatory disclosure and document preparation for all consumer loan requests originated by the bank&#8217;s market lenders. Applications are processed through an automated loan origination software platform and decisioned by the credit center underwriters.

&#160; 

Loan Review and Nonperforming Assets 

&#160;

United&#8217;s Loan Review Department reviews, or engages an independent third party to review, the Bank&#8217;s loan portfolio on an ongoing basis to identify any weaknesses in the portfolio and to assess the general quality of credit underwriting. The results of such reviews are presented to Executive Management, the Community Bank Presidents, Credit Administration Management and the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. If an individual loan or credit relationship has a material weakness identified during the review process, the risk rating of the loan, or generally all loans comprising that credit relationship, will be downgraded to the classification that most closely matches the current risk level. The review process also provides for the upgrade of loans that show improvement since the last review. Since each loan in a credit relationship may have a different credit structure, source of repayment and guarantors, different loans in a relationship can be assigned different risk ratings. United adopted a dual risk rating system for commercial loans whereby risk is defined at the obligor level and the facility level. The obligor risk rating assigns a rating based on qualitative and quantitative metrics that measure the financial viability of the borrower which is an estimate of the probability that the borrower will default. The facility risk rating considers the loss protection provided by assigned collateral factoring in control and the loan-to-value ratio. This rating estimates the probability of loss once the borrower has defaulted.

&#160;

Under United&#8217;s 10-tier loan grading system for commercial loans, grades 1 through 6 are considered &#8220;pass&#8221; (acceptable) credit risk, grade 7 is a &#8220;watch&#8221; rating, and grades 8 through 10 are &#8220;adversely classified&#8221; credits that require management&#8217;s attention. The entire 10-grade rating scale provides for a higher numeric rating for increased risk. For example, a risk rating of 1 is the least risky of all credits and would be typical of a loan that is 100% secured by a deposit at the Bank. Risk ratings of 2 through 6 in the pass category each have incrementally more risk. The four watch list credit ratings and rating definitions are:

&#160;

7 (Watch) Loans in this category are presently protected from apparent loss; however weaknesses exist that could cause future impairment, including the deterioration of financial ratios, past due status and questionable management capabilities. These loans require more than the ordinary amount of supervision. Collateral values generally afford adequate coverage, but may not be immediately marketable. &#160; &#160; 8 (Substandard) These loans are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or by the collateral pledged. Specific and well-defined weaknesses exist that may include poor liquidity and deterioration of financial ratios. The loan may be past due and related deposit accounts experiencing overdrafts. There is the distinct possibility that United will sustain some loss if deficiencies are not corrected. If possible, immediate corrective action is taken. &#160; &#160; 9 (Doubtful) Specific weaknesses characterized as Substandard that are severe enough to make collection in full highly questionable and improbable. There is no reliable secondary source of full repayment. &#160; &#160; 10 (Loss) Loans categorized as Loss have the same characteristics as Doubtful, however, loss is certain. Loans classified as Loss are charged-off. &#160;

Loans not meeting the criteria above that are analyzed individually as part of the above described process are considered to be pass rated loans. Consumer loans are part of a pass / fail grading system designed to segment loans based upon the risk of default resulting in a loss to the Bank. Specifically, a failed credit will be a loan that has a high probability of default within the next twelve months with the default expected to result in a loss to the Bank.

&#160;

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

In addition, Credit Administration, with supervision and input from the Accounting Department, prepares a quarterly analysis to determine the adequacy of the Allowance for Credit Losses (&#8220;ACL&#8221;). The ACL is comprised of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for unfunded commitments. The allowance for loan losses analysis starts with total loans and subtracts loans fully secured by deposit accounts at the Bank and the portion of loans guaranteed by the SBA or USDA, which effectively have no risk of loss. Next, all loans that are considered individually impaired are reviewed and assigned a specific reserve if one is warranted. Most collateral dependent impaired loans with specific reserves are charged down to net realizable value of the underlying collateral. The remaining loan balance for each major loan category is then multiplied by its respective estimated loss factor that is derived from the weighted average historical loss rate for the preceding two year period, weighted toward the most recent quarters, and adjusted to reflect current economic conditions. Loss factors for these loans are estimated and determined based on historical loss experience by type of loan. United multiplies the annualized loss factor by the calculated loss emergence period in order to quantify the amount of incurred losses in the loan portfolio. The loss emergence period is determined for each category of loans based on the average length of time between when a loan first becomes more than 30 days past due and when that loan is ultimately charged off. Management&#8217;s use of the loss emergence period is an estimate of the period of time from the first evidence of loss incurrence through the period of time until such losses are confirmed (or charged-off). Previously, United reported an unallocated portion of the allowance which was maintained due to imprecision in estimating loss factors and loss emergence periods, and economic and other conditions that cannot be entirely quantified in the analysis. With the incorporation of the loss emergence period into United&#8217;s allowance methodology in the first quarter of 2014, the previously unallocated balance has been allocated to other components of the allowance for loan losses.

&#160; 

Asset/Liability Committee 

&#160;

United&#8217;s Asset Liability Management Committee (&#8220;ALCO&#8221;) is composed of executive and other officers and the Treasurer of United. ALCO is charged with managing the assets and liabilities of United and the Bank. ALCO&#8217;s primary role is to balance asset growth and income generation with the prudent management of interest rate risk, market risk and liquidity risk and with the need to maintain appropriate levels of capital. ALCO directs the Bank&#8217;s overall balance sheet strategy, including the acquisition and investment of funds. At regular meetings, the committee reviews the interest rate sensitivity and liquidity positions, including stress scenarios, the net interest margin, the investment portfolio, the funding mix and other variables, such as regulatory changes, monetary policy adjustments and the overall state of the economy. A more comprehensive discussion of United&#8217;s asset/liability management and interest rate risk is contained in the Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis (Part II, Item 7) and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Part II, Item 7A) sections of this report.

&#160; 

Investment Policy 

&#160;

United&#8217;s investment portfolio policy is to balance income generation with liquidity, interest rate sensitivity, pledging and regulatory needs. The Chief Financial Officer and the Treasurer of United administer the policy, and it is reviewed from time to time by United&#8217;s ALCO and the Board of Directors. Portfolio activity, composition, and performance are reviewed and approved periodically by United&#8217;s Board of Directors and Risk Committee thereof.

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, United and its subsidiaries had 1,883 full-time equivalent employees. Neither United nor any of its subsidiaries are a party to any collective bargaining agreement and management believes that employee relations are good.

&#160; 

Available Information 

&#160; 

United&#8217;s Internet website address is www.ucbi.com. United makes available free of charge through its website Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.

&#160; 

Supervision and Regulation 

&#160;

The following is an explanation of the supervision and regulation of United and the Bank as financial institutions. This explanation does not purport to describe state, federal or Nasdaq Stock Market supervision and regulation of general business corporations or Nasdaq listed companies.

&#160;

General. United is a registered bank holding company subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve under the BHC Act. United is required to file annual and quarterly financial information with the Federal Reserve and is subject to periodic examination by the Federal Reserve.

&#160;

The BHC Act requires every bank holding company to obtain the Federal Reserve&#8217;s prior approval before (1) it may acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any bank that it does not already control; (2) it or any of its non-bank subsidiaries may acquire all or substantially all of the assets of a bank; and (3) it may merge or consolidate with any other bank holding company. In addition, a bank holding company is generally prohibited from engaging in, or acquiring, direct or indirect control of the voting shares of any company engaged in non-banking activities. This prohibition does not apply to activities listed in the BHC Act or found by the Federal Reserve, by order or regulation, to be closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. Some of the activities that the Federal Reserve has determined by regulation or order to be closely related to banking are:

&#160;

&#160; 9 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; making or servicing loans and certain types of leases; &#183; performing certain data processing services; &#183; acting as fiduciary or investment or financial advisor; &#183; providing brokerage services; &#183; underwriting bank eligible securities; &#183; underwriting debt and equity securities on a limited basis through separately capitalized subsidiaries; and &#183; making investments in corporations or projects designed primarily to promote community welfare. &#160;

Although the activities of bank holding companies have traditionally been limited to the business of banking and activities closely related or incidental to banking (as discussed above), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the &#8220;GLB Act&#8221;) relaxed the previous limitations and permitted bank holding companies to engage in a broader range of financial activities. Specifically, bank holding companies may elect to become financial holding companies which may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature. Among the activities that are deemed &#8220;financial in nature&#8221; include:

&#160;

&#183; lending, exchanging, transferring, investing for others or safeguarding money or securities; &#183; insuring, guaranteeing, or indemnifying against loss, harm, damage, illness, disability, or death, or providing and issuing annuities, and acting as principal, agent, or broker with respect thereto; &#183; providing financial, investment, or economic advisory services, including advising an investment company; &#183; issuing or selling instruments representing interests in pools of assets permissible for a bank to hold directly; and &#183; underwriting, dealing in or making a market in securities. &#160;

Under this legislation, the Federal Reserve serves as the primary &#8220;umbrella&#8221; regulator of financial holding companies with supervisory authority over each parent company and limited authority over its subsidiaries. The primary regulator of each subsidiary of a financial holding company will depend on the type of activity conducted by the subsidiary. For example, broker-dealer subsidiaries will be regulated largely by securities regulators and insurance subsidiaries will be regulated largely by insurance authorities.

&#160;

United has no current plans to register as a financial holding company.

&#160;

United must also register with the Georgia Department of Banking and Finance (the &#8220;DBF&#8221;) and file periodic information with the DBF. As part of such registration, the DBF requires information with respect to the financial condition, operations, management and intercompany relationship of United and the Bank and related matters. The DBF may also require such other information as is necessary to keep itself informed concerning compliance with Georgia law and the regulations and orders issued thereunder by the DBF, and the DBF may examine United and the Bank. Although the Bank operates branches in North Carolina, east Tennessee and upstate South Carolina; neither the North Carolina Banking Commission, the Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions, nor the South Carolina Commissioner of Banking examines or directly regulates out-of-state holding companies.

&#160;

United is an &#8220;affiliate&#8221; of the Bank under the Federal Reserve Act, which imposes certain restrictions on (1) loans by the Bank to United, (2) investments in the stock or securities of United by the Bank, (3) the Bank taking the stock or securities of an &#8220;affiliate&#8221; as collateral for loans by the Bank to a borrower, and (4) the purchase of assets from United by the Bank. Further, a bank holding company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit, lease or sale of property or furnishing of services.

&#160;

The Bank and each of its subsidiaries are regularly examined by the FDIC. The Bank, as a state banking association organized under Georgia law, is subject to the supervision of, and is regularly examined by, the DBF. Both the FDIC and the DBF must grant prior approval of any merger, consolidation or other corporation reorganization involving the Bank.

&#160;

Payment of Dividends. United is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank. Most of the revenue of United results from dividends paid to it by the Bank. There are statutory and regulatory requirements applicable to the payment of dividends by the Bank, as well as by United to its shareholders.

&#160;

Under the regulations of the DBF, a state bank with an accumulated deficit (negative retained earnings) may declare dividends (reduction in capital) by first obtaining the written permission of the DBF and FDIC. If a state bank has positive retained earnings, it may declare a dividend without DBF approval if it meets all the following requirements:

&#160;

(a) total classified assets as of the most recent examination of the bank do not exceed 80% of equity capital (as defined by regulation); (b) the aggregate amount of dividends declared or anticipated to be declared in the calendar year does not exceed 50% of the net profits after taxes but before dividends for the previous calendar year; and (c) the ratio of equity capital to adjusted assets is not less than 6%. &#160;

&#160; 10 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The payment of dividends by United and the Bank may also be affected or limited by other factors, such as the requirement to maintain adequate capital above regulatory guidelines. In addition, if, in the opinion of the applicable regulatory authority, a bank under its jurisdiction is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice (which, depending upon the financial condition of the bank, could include the payment of dividends), such authority may require, after notice and hearing, that such bank cease and desist from such practice. The FDIC has issued a policy statement providing that insured banks should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings. In addition to the formal statutes and regulations, regulatory authorities consider the adequacy of the Bank&#8217;s total capital in relation to its assets, deposits and other such items. Capital adequacy considerations could further limit the availability of dividends from the Bank.

&#160;

Under rules adopted by the Federal Reserve in November 2011, known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (&#8220;CCAR&#8221;) Rules, bank holding companies with $50 billion or more of total assets are required to submit annual capital plans to the Federal Reserve and generally may pay dividends and repurchase stock only under a capital plan as to which the Federal Reserve has not objected. The CCAR rules will not apply to United for so long as our total consolidated assets remain below $50 billion. However, it is anticipated that United capital ratios will be important factors considered by the Federal Reserve in evaluating whether proposed payments of dividends or stock repurchases may be an unsafe or unsound practices.

&#160;

Due to its accumulated deficit, the Bank must receive pre-approval from the DBF and FDIC to pay cash dividends (reduction in capital) to United in 2016. In 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Bank paid a cash dividend of $77.5 million, $129 million and $50.0 million, respectively, to United as approved the DBF and FDIC. The dividends were paid out of capital surplus rather than the accumulated deficit. United declared cash dividends on its common stock in 2015 and 2014 of 22 cents and 11 cents, respectively, but did not declare any dividends in its common stock in 2013.

&#160;

Capital Adequacy. Banks and bank holding companies are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by state and federal banking agencies. Capital adequacy guidelines involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weighting and other factors.

&#160;

The Federal Reserve and the FDIC have implemented substantially identical risk-based rules for assessing bank and bank holding company capital adequacy. These regulations establish minimum capital standards in relation to assets and off-balance sheet exposures as adjusted for credit risk. &#8220;Total capital&#8221; is composed of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital. &#8220;Tier 1 capital&#8221; includes common equity, retained earnings, qualifying non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, a limited amount of qualifying cumulative perpetual stock at the holding company level, minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, less goodwill, most intangible assets and certain other assets. &#8220;Tier 2 capital&#8221; includes, among other things, perpetual preferred stock and related surplus not meeting the Tier 1 capital definition, qualifying mandatorily convertible debt securities, qualifying subordinated debt and allowances for possible loan and lease losses, subject to limitations. The Federal Reserve and the FDIC use the leverage ratio in tandem with the risk-based ratio to assess the capital adequacy of banks and bank holding companies. The Federal Reserve will require a bank holding company to maintain a leverage ratio well above minimum levels if it is experiencing or anticipating significant growth or is operating with less than well-diversified risks in the opinion of the Federal Reserve. The FDIC, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the &#8220;OCC&#8221;) and the Federal Reserve also require banks to maintain capital well above minimum levels.

&#160;

In July 2013, the Federal Reserve published the Basel III Capital Rules establishing a new comprehensive capital framework applicable to all depository institutions, bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $500 million or more and all and savings and loan holding companies except for those that are substantially engaged in insurance underwriting or commercial activities (collectively, &#8220;banking organizations&#8221;). The rules implement the December 2010 framework proposed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the &#8220;Basel Committee&#8221;), known as &#8220;Basel III&#8221;, for strengthening international capital standards as well as certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act.

&#160;

The Basel III Capital Rules substantially revised the risk-based capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and depository institutions, including United and the Bank, compared to the prior U.S. risk-based capital rules. The Basel III Capital Rules:

&#160;

&#183; defined the components of capital and address other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions&#8217; regulatory capital ratios; &#183; addressed risk weights and other issues affecting the denominator in banking institutions&#8217; regulatory capital ratios and replaced the prior risk-weighting approach, which was derived from the Basel I capital accords of the Basel Committee, with a more risk-sensitive approach based, in part, on the standardized approach in the Basel Committee&#8217;s 2004 &#8220;Basel II&#8221; capital accords; &#183; introduced a new capital measure called &#8220;common equity Tier 1&#8221; (&#8220;CET1&#8221;); &#183; specified that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and &#8220;additional Tier 1 capital&#8221; instruments meeting specified requirements; and &#183; implemented the requirements of Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act to remove references to credit ratings from the federal banking agencies&#8217; rules. &#160;

The Basel III Capital Rules became effective for United and the Bank on January 1, 2015 subject to a phase in period.

&#160;

The Basel III Capital Rules require United and the Bank to maintain:

&#160;

&#160; 11 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221; (which is added to the 4.5% CET1 ratio as that buffer is phased in over four years to 2.5%, effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7% upon full implementation); &#183; a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 6% Tier 1 capital ratio as that buffer is phased in over four years to 2.5%, effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5% upon full implementation); &#183; a minimum ratio of total capital (that is, Tier 1 plus Tier 2) to risk-weighted assets of at least 8%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 8% total capital ratio as that buffer is phased in over four years to 2.5%, effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5% upon full implementation); and &#183; a minimum leverage ratio of 4%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average assets. &#160;

In addition, Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act implemented the prompt corrective action provisions that Congress enacted as a part of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (the &#8220;1991 Act&#8221;). The &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; provisions set forth five regulatory zones in which all banks are placed largely based on their capital positions. Regulators are permitted to take increasingly harsh action as a bank&#8217;s financial condition declines. The FDIC is required to resolve a bank when its ratio of tangible equity to total assets reaches 2%. Better capitalized institutions are generally subject to less onerous regulation and supervision than banks with lesser amounts of capital.

&#160;

The FDIC has adopted regulations implementing the prompt corrective action provisions of the 1991 Act, as revised by the Basel III Capital Rules effective January 1, 2015, which place financial institutions in the following five categories based upon capitalization ratios: (1) a &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; institution has a Total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10%, a Tier 1 risk-based ratio of at least 8%, a CET1 risk-based ratio of 6.5% and a leverage ratio of at least 5%; (2) an &#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221; institution has a Total risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%, a Tier 1 risk-based ratio of at least 6%, a CET1 risk-based ratio of 4.5% and a leverage ratio of at least 4%; (3) an &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221; institution has a Total risk-based capital ratio of under 8%, a Tier 1 risk-based ratio of under 6%, a CET1 risk-based ratio of under 4.5% or a leverage ratio of under 4%; (4) a &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; institution has a Total risk-based capital ratio of under 6%, a Tier 1 risk-based ratio of under 4%, a CET1 risk-based ratio of under 3% or a leverage ratio of under 3%; and (5) a &#8220;critically undercapitalized&#8221; institution has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets of 2% or less. Institutions in any of the three undercapitalized categories would be prohibited from declaring dividends or making capital distributions. The FDIC regulations also allow it to &#8220;downgrade&#8221; an institution to a lower capital category based on supervisory factors other than capital.

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, the FDIC categorized the Bank as &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; under current regulations.

&#160;

The Basel III Capital Rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1. Under prior capital standards, the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income items included in capital were excluded for the purposes of determining regulatory capital ratios. Under the Basel III Capital Rules, the effects of certain accumulated other comprehensive items are not excluded; however, certain banking organizations, including United and the Bank, may make a one-time permanent election to continue to exclude these items. United and the Bank made this election in first quarter 2015 in order to avoid significant variations in the level of capital depending upon the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the fair value of United&#8217;s available-for-sale securities portfolio. The Basel III Capital Rules also eliminate the inclusion of certain instruments, such as trust preferred securities, from Tier 1 capital of bank holding companies. Instruments issued prior to May 19, 2010 are grandfathered for bank holding companies with consolidated assets of $15 billion or less (subject to the 25% of Tier 1 capital limit).

&#160;

The &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221; is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking organizations with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer (or below the combined capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer, when the latter is applied) will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall.

&#160;

Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 began on January 1, 2015 and will be phased-in over a four-year period (beginning at 40% on January 1, 2015 and an additional 20% per year thereafter). The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 at the 0.625% level and will be phased in over a four-year period increasing by that amount on each subsequent January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019.

&#160;

The Basel III Capital Rules prescribe a standardized approach for risk weightings that expand the risk-weighting categories from the current four Basel I-derived categories (0%, 20%, 50% and 100%) to a much larger and more risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the assets, generally ranging from 0% for U.S. government and agency securities, to 600% for certain equity exposures, and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories. Consistent with the Dodd-Frank Act, the Basel III Capital Rules replace the ratings-based approach to securitization exposures, which is based on external credit ratings, with the simplified supervisory formula approach in order to determine the appropriate risk weights for these exposures. Alternatively, banking organizations may use the existing gross-up approach to assign securitization exposures to a risk weight category or choose to assign such exposures a 1,250% risk weight. In addition, the Basel III Capital Rules provide more advantageous risk weights for derivatives and repurchase-style transactions cleared through a qualifying central counterparty and increase the scope of eligible guarantors and eligible collateral for purposes of credit risk mitigation.

&#160;

&#160;

Management believes that, as of December 31, 2015, United and the Bank would meet all capital adequacy requirements under the Basel III Capital Rules on a fully phased-in basis as if such requirements were currently in effect.

&#160;

Consumer Protection Laws. The Dodd-Frank Act centralized responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating a new agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (&#8220;CFPB&#8221;), and giving it the power to promulgate and enforce federal consumer protection laws. Depository institutions are subject to the CFPB&#8217;s rule writing authority, and existing federal bank regulatory agencies retain examination and enforcement authority for such institutions. The CFPB and United&#8217;s existing federal regulator, the FDIC, are focused on the following:

&#160;

&#183; risks to consumers and compliance with the federal consumer financial laws; &#183; the markets in which firms operate and risks to consumers posed by activities in those markets; &#183; depository institutions that offer a wide variety of consumer financial products and services; &#183; depository institutions with a more specialized focus; and &#183; non-depository companies that offer one or more consumer financial products or services. &#160;

Stress Testing. As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the federal bank regulatory agencies have implemented stress testing requirements for certain financial institutions, including bank holding companies and state chartered banks, with more than $10 billion in total consolidated assets. Although these requirements do not apply to institutions with $10 billion or less in total consolidated assets, the federal bank regulatory agencies emphasize that all banking organizations, regardless of size, should have the capacity to analyze the potential impact of adverse market conditions or outcomes on the organization&#8217;s financial condition. Based on this regulatory guidance, United and the Bank will be expected to consider the institution&#8217;s interest rate risk management, commercial real estate concentrations and other credit-related information, and funding and liquidity management during this analysis of adverse outcomes.

&#160;

Volcker Rule. The Dodd-Frank Act amended the BHC Act to require the federal bank regulatory agencies to adopt rules that prohibit banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in and sponsoring certain unregistered investment companies (defined as hedge funds and private equity funds). The statutory provision is commonly called the &#8220;Volcker Rule&#8221;. The Federal Reserve adopted final rules implementing the Volcker Rule on December 10, 2013. Although United continues to evaluate the impact of the Volcker Rule and the final rules adopted by the Federal Reserve thereunder, United does not currently anticipate that the Volcker Rule will have a material effect on its operations and the operations of its subsidiaries, including the Bank, as United does not engage in businesses prohibited by the Volcker Rule. United may incur costs to adopt additional policies and systems to ensure compliance with the Volcker Rule.

&#160;

Durbin Amendment. The Dodd-Frank Act included provisions which restrict interchange fees to those which are &#8220;reasonable and proportionate&#8221; for certain debit card issuers and limits the ability of networks and issuers to restrict debit card transaction routing. This statutory provision is known as the &#8220;Durbin Amendment&#8221;. The Federal Reserve issued final rules implementing the Durbin Amendment on June 29, 2011. In the final rules, interchange fees for debit card transactions were capped at $0.21 plus five basis points in order to be eligible for a safe harbor such that the fee is conclusively determined to be reasonable and proportionate. Another related rule also permits an additional $0.01 per transaction &#8220;fraud prevention adjustment&#8221; to the interchange fee if certain Federal Reserve standards are implemented, including an annual review of fraud prevention policies and procedures. With respect to network exclusivity and merchant routing restrictions, it is now required that all debit cards participate in at least two unaffiliated networks so that the transactions initiated using those debit cards will have at least two independent routing channels. The interchange fee restrictions contained in the Durbin Amendment, and the rules promulgated thereunder, apply to debit card issuers with $10 billion or more in total consolidated assets. United&#8217;s total consolidated assets as of December 31, 2015 were $9.63 billion, which is below the Durbin Amendment&#8217;s $10 billion threshold. It is expected, however, that United&#8217;s normal business growth will cause its total assets to exceed the Durbin Amendment&#8217;s $10 billion threshold in the near future. United is still evaluating the impact of complying with the Durbin Amendment.

&#160;

Incentive Compensation. The federal bank regulatory agencies have issued guidance on incentive compensation policies (the &#8220;Incentive Compensation Guidance&#8221;) intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of financial institutions do not undermine the safety and soundness of such institutions by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The Incentive Compensation Guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an institution, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a financial institution&#8217;s incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the institution&#8217;s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the institution&#8217;s board of directors.

&#160;

&#160; 13 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The Federal Reserve will review, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of financial institutions, such as United, that are not &#8220;large, complex banking organizations.&#8221; These reviews will be tailored to each financial institution based on the scope and complexity of the institution&#8217;s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. The findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination. Deficiencies will be incorporated into the financial institution&#8217;s supervisory ratings, which can affect the institution&#8217;s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against a financial institution if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the institution&#8217;s safety and soundness and the institution is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies.

&#160;

The scope and content of federal bank regulatory agencies&#8217; policies on executive compensation are continuing to develop and are likely to continue evolving in the near future. It cannot be determined at this time whether compliance with such policies will adversely affect United&#8217;s ability to hire, retain and motivate its key employees.

&#160;

Cybersecurity. Recent cyber attacks against banks and other financial institutions that resulted in unauthorized access to confidential customer information have prompted the federal bank regulatory agencies to issue extensive guidance on cybersecurity. These agencies are likely to devote more resources to this part of their safety and soundness examination than they may have in the past. 

&#160; 

Commercial Real Estate. The federal bank regulatory agencies, including the FDIC, restrict concentrations in commercial real estate lending and have noted that recent increases in banks&#8217; commercial real estate concentrations have created safety and soundness concerns in the current economic downturn. The regulatory guidance mandates certain minimal risk management practices and categorizes banks with defined levels of such concentrations as banks requiring elevated examiner scrutiny. The Bank has concentrations in commercial real estate loans in excess of those defined levels. Although management believes that United&#8217;s credit processes and procedures meet the risk management standards dictated by this guidance, regulatory outcomes could effectively limit increases in the real estate concentrations in the Bank&#8217;s loan portfolio and require additional credit administration and management costs associated with those portfolios.

&#160;

Source of Strength Doctrine. Federal Reserve regulations and policy requires bank holding companies to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary banks. Under this policy, United is expected to commit resources to support the Bank.

&#160; 

Loans. Inter-agency guidelines adopted by federal bank regulatory agencies mandate that financial institutions establish real estate lending policies with maximum allowable real estate loan-to-value limits, subject to an allowable amount of non-conforming loans as a percentage of capital.

&#160;

Transactions with Affiliates. Under federal law, all transactions between and among a state nonmember bank and its affiliates, which include holding companies, are subject to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W promulgated thereunder. Generally, these requirements limit these transactions to a percentage of the bank&#8217;s capital and require all of them to be on terms at least as favorable to the bank as transactions with non-affiliates. In addition, a bank may not lend to any affiliate engaged in non-banking activities not permissible for a bank holding company or acquire shares of any affiliate that is not a subsidiary. The FDIC is authorized to impose additional restrictions on transactions with affiliates if necessary to protect the safety and soundness of a bank. The regulations also set forth various reporting requirements relating to transactions with affiliates.

&#160; 

Financial Privacy. In accordance with the GLB Act, federal banking regulatory agencies adopted rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non-public information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties. These limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a nonaffiliated third party. The privacy provisions of the GLB Act affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors.

&#160;

Anti-Money Laundering Initiatives and the USA Patriot Act. A major focus of governmental policy on financial institutions in recent years has been aimed at combating terrorist financing. This has generally been accomplished by amending existing anti-money laundering laws and regulations. The U.S. Department of the Treasury (&#8220;Treasury&#8221;) has issued a number of implementing regulations which apply various requirements of the USA Patriot Act of 2001 to the Bank. These regulations impose obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their customers. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat terrorist financing, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution.

&#160;

Future Legislation. Various legislation affecting financial institutions and the financial industry is from time to time introduced in Congress. Such legislation may change banking statutes and the operating environment of United and its subsidiaries in substantial and unpredictable ways, and could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance depending upon whether any of this potential legislation will be enacted, and if enacted, the effect that it or any implementing regulations would have on the financial condition or results of operations of United or any of its subsidiaries. With the current economic environment, the nature and extent of future legislative and regulatory changes affecting financial institutions is not known at this time.
