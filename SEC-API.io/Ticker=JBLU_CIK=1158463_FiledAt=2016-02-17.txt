 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

OVERVIEW 

General 

JetBlue Airways Corporation, or JetBlue, is New York's Hometown Airline&#8482;. In 2015, JetBlue carried over 35 million &#32;passengers with an average of 900 &#32;daily flights and served 93 &#32;destinations in the United States, the Caribbean and Latin America. 

JetBlue was incorporated in Delaware in August 1998 and commenced service on February 11, 2000. As of the end of 2015 , we are the fifth &#32;largest passenger carrier in the U.S. based on available seat miles, or ASMs. We believe our differentiated product and culture combined with our competitive cost structure enables us to compete effectively in the high-value geographies we serve. Looking to the future, we plan to continue to grow in our high-value geographies, invest in industry leading products and provide award winning service by our more than 18,000 &#32;dedicated employees, whom we refer to as Crewmembers. Going forward we believe we will continue to differentiate ourselves from other airlines enabling us to continue to attract a greater mix of customers and to drive further profitable growth. We are focused on driving to deliver solid results for our shareholders, our customers and our Crewmembers. 

&#32;As used in this Report, the terms "JetBlue", the "Company", "we", "us", "our" and similar terms refer to JetBlue Airways Corporation and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise. Our principal executive offices are located at 27-01 Queens Plaza North, Long Island City, New York 11101 and our telephone number is (718) 286-7900. 

Our Industry and Competition 

The U.S. airline industry is extremely competitive, challenging and results are often volatile. It is uniquely susceptible to external factors such as downturns in domestic and international economic conditions, weather-related disruptions, the spread of infectious diseases, the impact of airline restructurings or consolidations, U.S. military actions or acts of terrorism. We operate in a capital and energy intensive industry that has high fixed costs as well as heavy taxation and fees. Airline returns are sensitive to slight changes in fuel prices, average fare levels and passenger demand. The principal industry competitive factors include fares, brand and customer service, route networks, flight schedules, aircraft types, safety records, code-sharing and interline relationships, in-flight entertainment and connectivity systems and frequent flyer programs. 

Price competition is strong in our industry. Our ability to operate successfully and grow in this environment depends on, among other things, our ability to operate at costs equal to or lower than our competitors. 

Since 2001, the majority of traditional network airlines have undergone significant financial restructuring including bankruptcies, mergers and consolidations. These types of restructurings typically result in a lower cost structure through a reduction of labor costs, restructuring of commitments including debt terms, leases and fleet, modification or termination of pension plans, increased workforce flexibility, and innovative offerings. These actions also have provided the restructuring airline significant opportunities for realignment of route networks, alliances and frequent flyer programs. Each factor has had a significant influence on the industry's improved profitability. 

&#32; 2015 &#32;OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS 

We believe our differentiated product and culture, competitive costs and high-value geography relative to the other airlines contributed to our continued success in 2015 . Our 2015 &#32;operational highlights include: 

&#8226; Product enhancements - Throughout 2015 &#32;we continued to invest in industry-leading products which we believe will continue to differentiate our product offering from the other airlines. 

&#9702; In June 2014, we launched our premium transcontinental product called Mint&#8482;. It includes 16 fully lie-flat seats, four of which are in suites with a privacy door, a first in the U.S. domestic market. During 2015 , we announced additional transcontinental Mint TM &#32;service, as well as added two international Mint TM &#32;destinations, Barbados and Aruba. 

&#9702; We continued to install our Fly-Fi&#8482; in-flight internet service across our Airbus fleet, and completed retrofitting all of our Airbus A321 and A320 aircraft by the end of October 2015. Our first Fly-Fi&#8482; enabled Embraer E190 aircraft made its inaugural commercial flight in October 2015 . We anticipate retrofitting our remaining Embraer E190 aircraft with Fly-Fi&#8482; during 2016, at which point, free Fly-Fi&#8482; service will be available on our entire fleet. 

&#9702; We introduced Fare Options during the second quarter of 2015 . As a result, customers have a choice to purchase tickets from three branded fares: Blue, Blue Plus, and Blue Flex. Each fare includes different offerings, such as free checked bags, reduced change fees, and additional TrueBlue &#174; &#32;points. 

&#9702; Innovation continues to be a major driver in our product offerings. We were the first airline to accept Apple Pay in-flight. Our customers have been able to use their iPhone for all onboard purchases since March 2015 . In December 2015 , we released an enhanced suite of mobile applications aimed at bringing even more convenience to our customers. With the latest update, customers have even more control over their JetBlue Experience with the ability to select and change seat assignments after check in, purchase Even More TM &#32;Space seats or other ancillary services, and use their phone's camera feature to input credit card and passport information. 

&#8226; Fleet &#32;- In 2015 , we converted six of the 10 Airbus A321 deliveries scheduled for 2016 to our Mint TM &#32;cabin configuration. During the fourth quarter, we bought out the leases on six Airbus A320 aircraft. In 2015, we took delivery of 12 Airbus A321 aircraft, two of which were equipped with our Mint&#8482; cabin layout. 

&#8226; Network - We continued to expand and grow in our high-value geography. In 2015, we expanded our network with six new BlueCities, bringing our total as of the end of December 2015 to 93 BlueCities, and added several connect-the-dot routes. With the success of our Mint&#8482; service between New York and California, we launched new routes to the Caribbean in the fall of 2015 and expect to begin Mint&#8482; service from Boston in March 2016. 

&#8226; TrueBlue &#174; &#32;and partnerships &#32;- We expanded our portfolio of commercial airline partnerships throughout 2015 and announced code-sharing agreements with Icelandair, Royal Air Maroc, Silver Airways and Seaborne Airlines. 

&#8226; Customer Service - &#32;JetBlue and our Crewmembers were recognized in 2015 for industry leading customer service. 

&#9702; J.D. Power and Associates recognized JetBlue and our Crewmembers for the 11 th &#32;consecutive year as the &#8220;Highest in Airline Customer Satisfaction among Low-Cost Carriers.&#8221; Our score climbed to 801 on a 1,000-point scale, making us the first airline to ever surpass 800 points within the segment. 

&#9702; We also received the top score on the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) among airlines. Our score of 81 is 10 points above the average for the airline industry. Additionally, we received 7 out of 7 stars for safety, and 5 out of 5 stars for our product offering from Airline Ratings. 

&#8226; Our Crewmembers - &#32; During 2015, our Crewmembers recognized JetBlue as one of "America's "Best Places to Work" by Forbes. JetBlue ranked #19 through a survey that asked individuals how likely they would be to recommend their employer to someone else. 

JETBLUE EXPERIENCE 

&#32;We offer our customers a distinctive flying experience which we refer to as the "JetBlue Experience." We believe we deliver award winning service that focuses on the customer experience from booking their itinerary to arrival at their final destination. Typically, our customers are neither high-traffic business travelers nor ultra-price sensitive travelers. Rather, we believe we are the carrier of choice for the majority of travelers who have been underserved by other airlines as we offer a differentiated product and award winning customer service. 

Differentiated Product and Culture &#160; 

Delivering the JetBlue Experience to our customers through our differentiated product and culture is core to our mission to inspire humanity. We look to attract new customers to our brand and provide current customers reasons to come back by continuing to innovate and evolve the JetBlue Experience. We believe we can adapt to the changing needs of our customers and a key element of our success is the belief that competitive fares and quality air travel need not be mutually exclusive. 

Our award winning service begins from the moment our customers purchase a ticket through one of our distribution channels such as www.jetblue.com , our mobile applications or our reservations centers. In the second quarter of 2015 , we launched our new pricing model, Fare Options. Customers can now purchase tickets at one of three branded fares: Blue, Blue Plus, and Blue Flex. Each fare includes different offerings such as free checked bags, reduced change fees, and additional TrueBlue &#174; &#32;points, with all fares including our core offering of free in-flight entertainment, free brand name snacks and free non-alcoholic beverages. Customers can choose to &#8220;buy up&#8221; to an option with additional offerings. These fares allow customers to select the products or services they need or value when they travel; without having to pay for the things they do not need or value. 

Upon arrival at the airport, our customers are welcomed by our dedicated Crewmembers and can choose to purchase one or more of our ancillary options such as Even More &#8482; &#32;Speed, allowing them to enjoy an expedited security experience in most domestic JetBlue locations. Customers who select our Blue Flex option or purchase a Mint &#8482; &#32;seat receive Even More &#8482; &#32;Speed as part of their fare. We additionally have mobile applications for both Apple and Android devices which have robust features including real-time flight information updates and mobile check-in for certain routes. Our applications are designed to enhance our customers' travel experience and are in keeping with the JetBlue Experience. 

Once onboard our aircraft, customers enjoy seats in a comfortable layout with the most legroom in the main cabin of all U.S. airlines, based on average fleet-wide seat pitch. Our Even More &#8482; &#32;Space seats are available for purchase across our fleet, giving customers the opportunity to enjoy additional legroom. Customers on certain transcontinental or Caribbean flights have the option to purchase our premium service, Mint &#8482; , which has 16 fully lie-flat seats, including four suites with privacy doors. 

Our in-flight entertainment system onboard our Airbus A320 and Embraer E190 aircraft includes 36 channels of free DIRECTV &#174; , 100 channels of free SiriusXM &#174; &#32;satellite radio and premium movie channel offerings from JetBlue Features &#174; . Customers on our Airbus A321 aircraft have access to 100 channels of DIRECTV &#174; , 100+ channels of SiriusXM &#174; &#32;radio and premium movie channel offerings from JetBlue Features &#174; . Our Mint &#8482; &#32;customers enjoy 15-inch flat screen televisions to experience our in-flight entertainment offerings. In December 2013, we began to retrofit our Airbus fleet with Fly-Fi &#8482; , a broadband product, with connectivity that we believe is significantly faster than airlines featuring K U -band satellites and older ground to air technology. Our entire Airbus fleet is equipped with Fly-Fi &#8482; &#32;and we are in the process of retrofitting our entire Embraer E190 fleet. Our first flight of our first Fly-Fi &#8482; &#32;enabled Embraer E190 operated in October 2015 . In November 2014, we announced the introduction of Fly-Fi &#8482; &#32;Hub, a content portal where customers can access a wide range of movies, television shows and additional content from their own personal devices. In 2015, Amazon, MLB.tv and Vice were added to our list of existing partners which include Coursera, FOX, HarperCollins Publishers, National Geographic, Rouxbe and Time Inc. We expect to add additional content from partner providers during 2016. 

All customers may enjoy an assortment of free and unlimited brand name snacks and non-alcoholic beverages, and have the option to purchase additional products such as blankets, pillows, headphones, premium beverages and premium food selections. Our Mint &#8482; &#32;customers have access to an assortment of complimentary food, beverages and products including a small-plates menu, artisanal snacks, alcoholic beverages, a blanket, pillows and headphones. 

Our Airbus A321 aircraft in a single cabin layout have 190 seats and those with our Mint &#8482; &#32;offering have 159 seats. Our Airbus A320 aircraft have 150 seats while our Embraer E190 aircraft have 100 seats. At our Investor Day in November 2014, we announced a cabin restyling program across our fleet that will enable an improved customer experience while freeing up valuable onboard space. Starting in the second half of 2016, we intend to introduce Airbus' new innovative galley and lavatory module on our single cabin layout Airbus A321 aircraft. Beginning in July 2016, future deliveries of our single cabin layout Airbus A321 will arrive with 200 seats. We expect to complete retrofitting our existing Airbus A321 single cabin layout aircraft to the 200 seats configuration by the end of 2016. 

As part of our cabin restyling program we expect to increase the seat density on our Airbus A320 fleet. Commencing in 2017, we plan to reconfigure our Airbus A320 aircraft with new seats, larger TV screens with up to 100 channels of free DIRECTV &#174; , and free gate-to-gate Fly-Fi &#8482; . We anticipate reconfiguring our Airbus A320 aircraft to have 162 seats. 

Because of our network strength in leisure destinations, we also sell vacation packages through JetBlue Getaways &#8482; , a one-stop, value-priced vacation service for self-directed packaged travel planning. These packages offer competitive fares for air travel on JetBlue along with a selection of JetBlue recommended hotels and resorts, car rentals and local attractions. 

We work to provide a superior air travel experience, including communicating openly and honestly with customers about delays and service disruptions. We are the only major U.S. airline to have a Customer Bill of Rights. This program was introduced in 2007 to provide compensation to customers who experience inconveniences. This Customer Bill of Rights commits us to high service standards and holds us accountable if we fall short. 

In 2015 , we completed 98.6% &#32;of our scheduled flights. Unlike most other airlines, we have a policy of not overbooking flights. 

Our customers have repeatedly indicated the distinctive JetBlue Experience is an important reason why they select us over other carriers. We measure and monitor customer feedback regularly which helps us to continuously improve customer satisfaction. One way we do so is by measuring our net promoter score, or NPS. This metric is used by companies in a broad range of industries to measure and monitor the customer experience. Many of the leading consumer brands that are recognized for great customer service receive high NPS scores. We believe a higher NPS score has positive effects on customer loyalty and ultimately leads to increased revenue. 

Network/ High-Value Geography 

We are a predominately point-to-point system carrier, with the majority of our routes touching at least one of our six focus cities: New York, Boston, Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood, Orlando, Long Beach and San Juan, Puerto Rico. During 2015 , over 86% &#32;of our customers flew on non-stop itineraries. 

Leisure traveler focused airlines are often faced with high seasonality. As a result, we continually work to manage our mix of customers to include both business travelers and travelers visiting friends and relatives, or VFR. VFR travelers tend to be slightly less seasonal and less susceptible to economic downturns than traditional leisure destination travelers. Understanding the purpose of our customers' travel helps us optimize destinations, strengthen our network and increase unit revenues. All six of our focus cities are in regions with a diverse mix of traffic and were profitable in 2015 . 

As of December 31, 2015 , our network served 93 &#32;BlueCities in 28 &#32;states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and 19 &#32;countries in the Caribbean and Latin America. In 2015 , we commenced service to six &#32;new BlueCities including Antigua, our 34 th &#32;BlueCity in the Caribbean and Latin America. We also made changes across our network by announcing new routes between existing BlueCities. We group our capacity distribution based upon geographical regions rather than on a mileage or a length-of-haul basis. The historic distribution of ASMs, or capacity, by region for the years ending December 31 &#32;was:

(1) Domestic operations as defined by the Department of Transport, or DOT, include Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, but for the purposes of the capacity distribution table above we have included these locations in the Caribbean and Latin America region. 

Our network growth over the past few years has been focused on the business traveler in Boston as well as travelers to the Caribbean and Latin America region. We expect to focus on increasing our presence in Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood where we believe there is an opportunity to increase our operations to destinations throughout the Caribbean and Latin America. Our plan is supported by significant investment from the Broward County Aviation Department in the airport and surrounding facilities. 

With the decision by the United States and Cuban authorities to allow scheduled air service to resume between the two nations, we are currently reviewing the formal application to schedule JetBlue service to Cuba. We believe our experience operating charter flights to Cuba and our historical success in other Caribbean and Latin American markets, such as Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, will position us to be the air carrier of choice in Cuba. 

In 2016, we anticipate further expanding our network and have previously announced service to the following new destinations:

Airline Commercial Partnerships &#160; 

Airlines frequently participate in commercial partnerships with other carriers in order to increase customer convenience by providing inter-connectivity, code-sharing, coordinated flight schedules, frequent flyer program reciprocity and other joint marketing activities. As of December 31, 2015 , we had 43 &#32;airline commercial partnerships. Our commercial partnerships typically begin as an interline agreement allowing a customer to book one itinerary with tickets on multiple airlines. During 2015 , we entered into seven new interline agreements and four new code-sharing agreements. Code-sharing is a practice by which one airline places its name and flight number on flights operated by another airline. In 2016, we expect to continue to seek additional strategic opportunities through new commercial partners as well as assess ways to deepen select current airline partnerships. We plan to do this by expanding code-share relationships and other areas of cooperation such as frequent flyer programs. We believe these commercial partnerships allow us to better leverage our strong network and drive incremental traffic and revenue while improving off-peak travel. 

Marketing 

JetBlue is a widely recognized and respected global brand. JetBlue created a new category in air travel and our brand stands for high service quality at a reasonable cost. This brand has evolved into an important and valuable asset which identifies us as a safe, reliable, high value airline. Similarly, we believe customer awareness of our brand has contributed to the success of our marketing efforts. It enables us to promote ourselves as a preferred marketing partner with companies across many different industries. 

We market our services through advertising and promotions in various media forms including popular social media outlets. We engage in large multi-market programs, local events and sponsorships across our route network as well as mobile marketing programs. Our targeted public and community relations efforts reflect our commitment to the communities we serve, as well as promoting brand awareness and complementing our strong reputation. 

Distribution 

Our participation in global distribution systems, or GDS, supports our profitable growth, particularly in the business market. We find business customers are more likely to book through a travel agency or a booking product which relies on a GDS platform. Although the cost of sales through this channel is higher than through our website, the average fare purchased through GDS is generally higher and often covers the increased distribution costs. We currently participate in several major GDS and online travel agents, or OTA. Due to the majority of our customers booking travel on our website, we maintain relatively low distribution costs despite our increased participation in GDS and OTA in recent years. 

Our primary and preferred distribution channel to customers is through our website, www.jetblue.com , our lowest cost channel. In the first half of 2015, we introduced a new merchandising platform for www.jetblue.com &#32;with our business partner Datalex in addition to merchandising capabilities on our kiosks and in our self-service channels with our business partner IBM. 

Customer Loyalty Program 

TrueBlue &#174; &#32;is our customer loyalty program designed to reward and recognize loyal customers. Members earn points based upon the amount paid for JetBlue flights and services from certain commercial partners. Our points do not expire, the program has no black-out dates or seat restrictions, and any JetBlue destination can be booked if the TrueBlue &#174; &#32;member has enough points to exchange for the value of an open seat. Mosaic &#174; &#32;is an additional level for our most loyal customers who either (1) fly a minimum of 30 times with JetBlue and acquire at least 12,000 base flight points within a calendar year or (2) accumulate 15,000 base flight points within a calendar year. Over 1.4 million &#32;TrueBlue &#174; &#32;one-way redemption awards were flown during 2015 , representing approximately 4% &#32;of our total revenue passenger miles. 

We currently have co-branded loyalty credit cards available to eligible U.S. residents, as well as co-brand agreements in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic to allow cardholders to earn TrueBlue &#174; &#32;points. Beginning in the first quarter of 2016, we anticipate launching a new co-branded credit card partnership with Barclaycard &#174; on the MasterCard &#174; network. We believe our marketing campaign announcing the launch of the new co-branded card will have promising conversion rates from existing cardholders of our co-branded American Express &#174; &#32;credit cards as well as drive a significant number of new member enrollments. We also have co-branded loyalty credit cards issued by Banco Santander Puerto Rico and MasterCard &#174; &#32;in Puerto Rico as well as Banco Popular Dominicano and MasterCard &#174; &#32;in the Dominican Republic. These credit cards allow customers in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic to take full advantage of our TrueBlue &#174; &#32;loyalty program. 

We have a separate agreement with American Express &#174; &#32;that allows any American Express &#174; &#32;cardholder to convert Membership Rewards &#174; &#32;points into TrueBlue &#174; &#32;points. We have various agreements with other loyalty partners, including hotels and car rental companies, that allow their customers to earn TrueBlue &#174; &#32;points through participation in our partners&#8217; programs. We intend to continue to develop the footprint of our co-branded credit cards and pursue other loyalty partnerships in the future. 

OPERATIONS AND COST STRUCTURE 

Historically, our cost structure has allowed us to price fares lower than many of our competitors and is a principal reason for our profitable growth. Our current cost advantage relative to some of our competitors is due to, among other factors, high aircraft utilization, new and efficient aircraft, relatively low distribution costs, and a productive workforce. Because our network initiatives and growth plans necessitate a low cost platform, we are continually focused on our competitive costs, operational excellence, efficiency improvements which also contribute to lower costs and enhancing critical elements of the JetBlue Experience. 

Route Structure 

Our point-to-point system is the foundation of our operational structure, with the majority of our routes touching at least one of our six focus cities. This structure allows us to optimize costs as well as accommodate customers' preference for non-stop itineraries. A vast majority of our operations are centered in and around the heavily populated northeast corridor of the U.S., which includes the New York and Boston metropolitan areas. This airspace is some of the world's most congested and drives certain operational constraints. 

Our peak levels of traffic over the course of the year vary by route; the East Coast to Florida/Caribbean peak from October through April and the West Coast peak in the summer months. Many of our areas of operations in the Northeast experience poor winter weather conditions, resulting in increased costs associated with de-icing aircraft, canceled flights and accommodating displaced customers. Many of our Florida and Caribbean routes experience bad weather conditions in the summer and fall due to thunderstorms and hurricanes. As we enter new markets we could be subject to additional seasonal variations along with competitive responses by other airlines. 

&#8226; New York metropolitan area - We are New York's Hometown Airline TM . &#32;The majority of our flights originate in the New York metropolitan area, the nation's largest travel market. John F. Kennedy International Airport, or JFK, is New York's largest airport, and we are the largest airline at JFK as measured by domestic seats and our 2015 operations accounted for more than 37% of seats offered on domestic routes from JFK. As JFK is a slot controlled airport we have been able to continue to grow our operations by adding more seats per departure with the delivery of 25 Airbus A321 aircraft in total as of December 31, 2015 , as well as continuing to optimize routes based upon load factor and costs. We operate from Terminal 5, or T5, and in November 2014 we opened T5i, an international arrivals facility that expands our current T5 footprint. We believe T5i will enable us to increase operational efficiencies, provide savings, streamline our operations and improve the overall travel experience for our customers arriving from international destinations. We also serve New Jersey's Newark Liberty International Airport, or Newark, New York City's LaGuardia Airport, or LaGuardia, Newburgh, New York's Stewart International Airport and White Plains, New York's Westchester County Airport. We are the leading carrier in the average number of flights flown per day between the New York metropolitan area and Florida. 

&#8226; Boston - We are the largest carrier in terms of flights and capacity at Boston's Logan International Airport. By the end of 2015 &#32;we flew to 59 &#32;non-stop destinations from Boston and served almost twice as many non-stop destinations than any other airline. Our operations accounted for more than 26% of all seats offered. We continue to capitalize on opportunities in the changing competitive landscape by adding routes, frequencies and increasing our relevance to local travelers. In 2015 , we continued to see a boost in the Boston market with two airline partners starting international routes directly to Boston, bringing the total number of airline partners flying routes to Boston to 14 by the end of the year. Our plan is to grow Boston with a general target of 150 flights per day. In June 2015 , we announced Mint&#8482; will be offered on flights to San Francisco in the first quarter of 2016, Los Angeles in fall 2016, as well as seasonal international service to Barbados. In November 2015, we unveiled Phase I of our $50 million Terminal C upgrade which included new kiosks and ticket counters. Twenty-five kiosks and thirty check-in counters are in use in the North Pod of the terminal. Phase II of the upgrade, funded by the Massachusetts Port Authority, or Massport, has begun on the South Pod which is aimed to mirror the check-in experience of the North Pod. Updated digital flight information displays and a connector between Terminal C and international flights at Terminal E are also expected to be completed during 2016. Additionally Massport recent and planned future investments in Boston include a new Centralized Baggage Inspection System during 2015 and a post-secure connection to the International Terminal planned for 2016. 

&#8226; Caribbean and Latin America - At the end of 2015 &#32;we had 34 BlueCities in the Caribbean and Latin America and we expect our presence to continue to grow. Our only focus city outside of the Continental U.S. is San Juan, Puerto Rico. We are the largest airline in Puerto Rico serving more non-stop destinations than any other carrier. We are also the largest airline in the Dominican Republic, serving six airports in the country in 2015. While the Caribbean and Latin American region is a growing part of our network, operating in this region can present operational challenges, including working with less developed airport infrastructure, political instability and vulnerability to corruption. In July 2015, we began charter flights between New York and Havana, Cuba. As of December 31, 2015 , we had six weekly round trips to Cuba, including flights from Tampa and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood with various charter partners. As the second largest U.S. airline to the Caribbean, we believe Cuba will one day play an important role in our overall network in the region. 

&#8226; Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood - We are the largest carrier at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, with approximately 22% of all seats offered in 2015 . During 2015 , we started service to eight new destinations and grew departures by approximately 15%. We expect Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood to continue to be our fastest growing focus city in 2016. Flying out of Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood instead of nearby Miami International Airport helps preserve our competitive cost advantage through lower cost per enplanement. In 2012, Broward County authorities commenced a multi-year, $2.3 billion refurbishment effort at the airport and surrounding facilities including the construction of a new south runway. We operate primarily out of Terminal 3 which is scheduled to be refurbished and connected to the upgraded and expanded international terminal by 2018. We will have additional facilities in the new international terminal to support our international arrivals. Our primary Terminal 3 allows for easy access to the expanded and enhanced airfield. We expect the connection of these terminals will streamline operations for both Crewmembers and customers. Due to these factors, it's ideal location between the U.S. and Latin America as well as South Florida's high-value geography, we intend to focus on Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood growth going forward. 

&#8226; Orlando - We are the second largest carrier in terms of capacity at Orlando International Airport, or Orlando, with 13% of all seats offered in 2015 . Orlando is JetBlue's fourth largest focus city with 27 &#32;non-stop destinations and a growing mix of traffic including leisure, VFR and business travelers. Our centralized training center, known as JetBlue University, is based in Orlando. In 2015 , we opened the Lodge at OSC which is adjacent to our training center and is used for lodging our Crewmembers when they attend training. 

&#8226; Los Angeles area - We are the sixth largest carrier in the Los Angeles area measured by seats, operating from Long Beach Airport, or Long Beach, Los Angeles International Airport, or LAX, and Burbank's Bob Hope Airport. We are the largest carrier in Long Beach, with almost 84% of all seats offered in 2015 &#32;being operated by JetBlue. We are currently working with the city of Long Beach and the community to ensure a request is made to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection to add a Federal Inspection Site at the airport, which would enable us to serve international destinations from Long Beach. In June 2014, we started operating our premium transcontinental service, Mint&#8482;, from LAX, which has continued to grow during 2015, with up to ten daily round trips between JFK and LAX expected in 2016. In June 2015 , we announced Mint&#8482; will be offered on flights from Boston to LAX in fall 2016. 

Fleet Structure 

We currently operate Airbus A321, Airbus A320 and Embraer E190 aircraft types. In 2015 , our fleet had an average age of 8.3 &#32;years and operated an average of 11.9 &#32;hours per day. By scheduling and operating our aircraft more efficiently we are able to spread related fixed costs over a greater number of ASMs. 

The reliability of our fleet is essential to ensuring our operations run efficiently and we are continually working with our aircraft and engine manufacturers to enhance our performance. 

We are working with the Federal Aviation Administration, or FAA, in efforts towards implementing the Next Generation Air Transportation System, or NextGen, by 2020. NextGen technology is expected to improve operational efficiency in the congested airspaces in which we operate. In 2012, we equipped 35 of our Airbus A320 aircraft to test ADS-B Out, a satellite based technology aimed to facilitate the communication between pilots and air traffic controllers. Even though it is still in the testing phase we have already seen benefits from the ADS-B Out equipment including being able to reroute flights over the Gulf of Mexico to avoid bad weather, an area where the current FAA radar coverage is not complete. In 2012, we also became the first FAA certified Airbus A320 carrier in the U.S. to use satellite-based Special Required Navigation Performance Authorization Required, or RNP AR, approaches at two of JFK's prime and most used runways, 13L and 13R. 

Fleet Maintenance 

Consistent with our core value of safety, our FAA-approved maintenance programs are administered by our technical operations department. We use qualified maintenance personnel and ensure they have comprehensive training. We maintain our aircraft and associated maintenance records in accordance with, if not exceeding, FAA regulations. Fleet maintenance work is divided into three categories: line maintenance, heavy maintenance and component maintenance. 

The bulk of our line maintenance is handled by JetBlue technicians and inspectors. It consists of daily checks, overnight and weekly checks, "A" checks, diagnostics and routine repairs. 

Heavy maintenance checks, or "C" checks, consist of a series of more complex tasks taking from one to four weeks to accomplish and are typically performed once every 15 months. All of our aircraft heavy maintenance work is performed by third party FAA-approved facilities such as Embraer, Pemco, Haeco and Lufthansa Technik AG, and are subject to direct oversight by JetBlue personnel. We outsource heavy maintenance as the costs are lower than if we performed the tasks internally. 

Component maintenance on equipment such as engines, auxiliary power units, landing gears, pumps and avionic computers are all performed by a number of different FAA-approved third party repair stations. We have maintenance agreements with MTU Maintenance Hannover GmbH, or MTU, for our Airbus aircraft engines and with GE Engine Services, LLC for our Embraer E190 aircraft engines. We also have an agreement with Lufthansa Technik AG for the repair, overhaul, modification and logistics of certain Airbus components. Many of our maintenance service agreements are based on a fixed cost per flying hour. These fixed costs vary based upon the age of the aircraft and other operating factors impacting the related component. Required maintenance not otherwise covered by these agreements is performed on a time and materials basis. All other maintenance activities are sub-contracted to qualified maintenance, repair and overhaul organizations. 

Aircraft Fuel 

Aircraft fuel continues to be one of our largest expenses. Its price and availability has been extremely volatile due to global economic and geopolitical factors which we can neither control nor accurately predict. We use a third party to assist with fuel management service and to procure most of our fuel. Our historical fuel consumption and costs for the years ended December 31 were:

We attempt to protect ourselves against the volatility of fuel prices by entering into a variety of derivative instruments. These include swaps, caps, collars, and basis swaps with underlyings of jet fuel, crude and heating oil. 

Financial Health 

We strive to maintain financial strength and a cost structure that enables us to grow profitably and sustainably. In the first years of our history, we relied upon financing activities to fund much of our growth. Starting in 2007, growth has largely been funded through internally generated cash from operations. Since 2011, while we have invested approximately $3.8 billion in capital assets, we have also generated approximately $4.5 billion in cash from operations, resulting in approximately $0.7 billion in free cash flow. Our improving financial results have resulted in better credit ratings, which in turn allows for more attractive financing terms. Since 2011, we have also reduced our total debt balance by nearly $1.3 billion. 

JetBlue Technology Ventures 

In November 2015, JetBlue created a new wholly-owned subsidiary, JetBlue Technology Ventures, LLC, or JTV. We anticipate that JTV will invest in or partner with emerging technology companies within the travel, hospitality and lifestyle industries. As of December 31, 2015 , JTV had not made any investments. 

TWA Flight Center Hotel Development 

In 2015, the Board of Commissioners of the Port Authority of New York &#38; New Jersey, or the PANYNJ approved a construction plan to redevelop the TWA Flight Center at JFK on its nearly six-acre site into a hotel with over 500 rooms, meeting spaces, restaurants, a spa and an observation deck. The complex is planned to feature two six-story hotel towers. As part of the plan, a 75-year lease agreement involves Flight Center Hotel LLC, a partnership of MCR Development, LLC and JetBlue. We estimate our ultimate ownership in the hotel to be approximately 5% to 10% of the final total investment. 

LiveTV 

LiveTV, LLC, or LiveTV, was formerly a wholly owned subsidiary of JetBlue. It provides in-flight entertainment and connectivity solutions for various commercial airlines including JetBlue. In June 2014, we sold LiveTV and its subsidiaries LTV Global, Inc, and LiveTV International, Inc., to Thales Holding Corporation, or Thales. In September 2014, following the receipt of regulatory approval, we sold LiveTV Satellite Communications, LLC, a subsidiary of LiveTV, to Thales. Following the completion of these sales, LiveTV operations ceased to be subsidiaries of JetBlue and are no longer presented in our consolidated financial statements. JetBlue, ViaSat Inc. and LiveTV have worked together to develop and support in-flight broadband connectivity for JetBlue which is being marketed as Fly-Fi &#8482; . JetBlue expects to continue to be a significant customer of LiveTV through its in-flight entertainment and onboard connectivity products and services. 

CULTURE 

Our People 

Our success depends on our Crewmembers delivering terrific customer service experience in the sky and on the ground. One of our competitive strengths is a service orientated culture grounded in our five key values; safety, caring, integrity, passion and fun. We believe a highly productive and engaged workforce enhances customer loyalty which in turn increases shareholder returns. Our goal is to hire, train and retain a diverse workforce of caring, passionate, fun and friendly people who share our mission to inspire humanity. 

Our culture is first introduced to new Crewmembers during the screening process and then at an extensive new hire orientation program at JetBlue University. The orientation focuses on the JetBlue strategy and emphasizes the importance of customer service, productivity and cost control. We provide continuous training for our Crewmembers including technical training, a specialized captain leadership training program unique in the industry, a leadership program for current company managers, an emerging managers program, regular training focused on the safety value and front line training for our customer service teams. 

Our growth plans necessitate and facilitate opportunities for talent development. In 2008, we launched the University Gateway Program, one of our many pilot recruitment initiatives, which made us the first airline to provide a training program for undergraduate students interested in becoming JetBlue First Officers. 

We believe a direct relationship between Crewmembers and our leadership is in the best interests of our Crewmembers, our customers and our shareholders. Except for our pilots, our Crewmembers do not have third-party representation. In April 2014, JetBlue pilots elected to be solely represented by the Air Line Pilots Association, or ALPA. The National Mediation Board, or NMB, certified ALPA as the representative body for JetBlue pilots and we are working with ALPA to reach our first collective bargaining agreement. We have individual employment agreements with each of our non-unionized FAA licensed Crewmembers which consist of dispatchers, technicians, inspectors and air traffic controllers. Each employment agreement is for a term of five years and renews for an additional five-year term, unless the Crewmember is terminated for cause or the Crewmember elects not to renew. Pursuant to these employment agreements, Crewmembers can only be terminated for cause. In the event of a downturn in our business, resulting in a reduction of flying and related work hours, we are obligated to pay these Crewmembers a guaranteed level of income and to continue their benefits. We believe that through these agreements we provide what we believe to be industry-leading job protection language. We believe these agreements provide JetBlue and Crewmembers flexibility and allow us to react to Crewmember needs more efficiently than collective bargaining agreements. 

A key feature of the direct relationship with our Crewmembers is our Values Committees which are made up of peer-elected frontline Crewmembers from each of our major work groups, except pilots. They represent the interests of our workgroups and help us run our business in a productive and efficient way. We believe this direct relationship with Crewmembers drives higher levels of engagement and alignment with JetBlue&#8217;s strategy, culture and overall goals. 

We believe the efficiency and engagement of our Crewmembers is a result of our flexible and productive work rules. We are cognizant of the competition for productive labor in key industry positions and new government rules requiring higher qualifications as well as more restricted hours that may result in potential labor shortages in the upcoming years. 

Our leadership team communicates on a regular basis with all Crewmembers in order to maintain this direct relationship and to keep them informed about news, strategy updates and challenges affecting the airline and the industry. Effective and frequent communication throughout the organization is fostered through various means including email messages from our CEO and other senior leaders at least weekly, weekday news updates to all Crewmembers, employee engagement surveys, a quarterly Crewmember magazine and active leadership participation in new hire orientations. Leadership is also heavily involved in periodic open forum meetings across our network, called &#8220;pocket sessions&#8221; which are often videotaped and posted on our intranet. By soliciting feedback for ways to improve our service, teamwork and work environment, our leadership team works to keep Crewmembers engaged and makes our business decisions transparent. Additionally we believe cost and revenue improvements are best recognized by Crewmembers on the job. 

Our average number of full-time equivalent employees for the year ended December 31, 2015 &#32;consisted of 2,857 &#32;pilots, 3,108 &#32;flight attendants, 3,977 &#32;airport operations personnel, 573 &#32;technicians (whom other airlines may refer to as mechanics), 1,268 &#32;reservation agents, and 2,754 &#32;management and other personnel. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , we employed an average of 12,351 &#32;full-time and 4,511 &#32;part-time employees. 

Crewmember Programs 

We are committed to supporting our Crewmembers through a number of programs including: 

&#8226; Crewmember Resource Groups (CRGs) - These are groups of Crewmembers formed to act as a resource for both the group members as well as JetBlue. The groups serve as an avenue to embrace and encourage different perspectives, thoughts and ideas. At the end of 2015 , we had four CRGs in place: JetPride, Women in Flight, Vets in Blue, and new for 2015 &#32;BlueConexion. 

&#8226; JetBlue Crewmember Crisis Fund (JCCF) - This organization was formed in 2002 as a non-profit corporation and recognized by the IRS as of that date as a tax-exempt entity. JCCF was created to assist JetBlue Crewmembers and their immediate family members (IRS Dependents) in times of crisis. Funds for JCCF grants come directly from Crewmembers via a tax-deductible payroll deduction. The assistance process is confidential with only the fund administrator and coordinator knowing the identity of the Crewmembers in need. 

&#8226; JetBlue Scholars &#32;- Developed in 2015, this program offers a new and innovative model to our Crewmembers wishing to further their education. Crewmembers enrolled in the program can earn a bachelor's degree through self-directed online college courses facilitated by JetBlue. The first term of JetBlue Scholars began in January 2016. 

&#8226; &#32;Lift Recognition Program - Formed in 2012, this Crewmember recognition program encourages Crewmembers to celebrate their peers for living JetBlue's values by sending e-thanks through an on-line platform. Our CEO Crew, periodically hosts an event for the Crewmembers who receive the highest Lift award recognitions in each quarter of the year. In 2015 , we saw more than 100,000 &#32;Lift nominations. 

Community Programs 

JetBlue is strongly committed to supporting the communities and BlueCities we serve through a variety of community programs including: 

&#8226; Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) - The CSR team was established to support not-for-profit organizations focusing on youth and education, environment, and community in the BlueCities we serve. The team organizes and supports community service projects, charitable giving and non-profit partnerships such as KaBOOM! and Soar with Reading. 

&#8226; JetBlue Foundation - Organized in 2013 as a non-profit corporation, this foundation is a JetBlue-sponsored organization to advance aviation-related education and to continue our efforts to promote aviation as a top career choice for students. The foundation intends to do this by igniting interest in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. The foundation is legally independent from JetBlue and has a Board of Directors as well as an Advisory Committee, both of which are made up of Crewmembers. The foundation is recognized by the IRS as a tax-exempt entity. 

&#8226; USO Center T5/JFK - Continuing our tradition of proudly supporting the men, women and families of the military, in September 2014 we opened a USO Center in T5 at JFK. The Center is open seven days a week, 365 days per year for military members and their families traveling on any airline at JFK, not just JetBlue. This center is fully stocked with computers, televisions, gaming devices/stations, furniture, iPads, food, beverages and much more. In conjunction with leading airport design firm Gensler, Turner Construction Company, the PANYNJ and more than 28 contractors and individual donors, 100% of the space, services, labor and materials were donated to ensure the USO Center would be free of any financial burden. Crewmembers donate time to help run the center. 

&#8226; T5 Farm &#32;- &#32;Creating a healthier airport environment is a core pillar of JetBlue's sustainability philosophy. Through a partnership with TERRA brand and support from GrowNYC and the PANYNJ, we have created the T5 Farm, a blue potato farm and produce garden at T5. The T5 Farm aims to serve as an agricultural and educational resource for the community, as well as absorb rainwater and runoff, reducing the possibility of flooding in the adjacent areas. Items from the T5 Farm are donated to local food pantries. 

REGULATION 

Airlines are heavily regulated, with rules and regulations set by various federal, state and local agencies. We also operate under specific regulations due to our operations within the high density airspace of the northeast U.S. Most of our airline operations are regulated by U.S. governmental agencies including: 

DOT - The DOT primarily regulates economic issues affecting air service including, but not limited to, certification and fitness, insurance, consumer protection and competitive practices. They set the requirement that carriers cannot permit domestic flights to remain on the tarmac for more than three hours. The DOT also requires that the advertised price for an airfare or a tour package including airfare, e.g., a hotel/air vacation package, has to be the total price to be paid by the customer, including all government taxes and fees. It has the authority to investigate and institute proceedings to enforce its economic regulations and may assess civil penalties, revoke operating authority and seek criminal sanctions. 

FAA - The FAA primarily regulates flight operations, in particular, matters affecting air safety. This includes but is not limited to airworthiness requirements for aircraft, the licensing of pilots, mechanics and dispatchers, and the certification of flight attendants. It requires each airline to obtain an operating certificate authorizing the airline to operate at specific airports using specified equipment. Like all U.S. certified carriers, we cannot fly to new destinations without the prior authorization of the FAA. After providing notice and a hearing, it has the authority to modify, suspend temporarily or revoke permanently our authority to provide air transportation or that of our licensed personnel for failure to comply with FAA regulations. It can additionally assess civil penalties for such failures as well as institute proceedings for the imposition and collection of monetary fines for the violation of certain FAA regulations. When significant safety issues are involved, it can revoke a U.S. carrier's authority to provide air transportation on an emergency basis, without providing notice and a hearing. It monitors our compliance with maintenance as well as flight operations and safety regulations. It maintains on-site representatives and performs frequent spot inspections of our aircraft, employees and records. It also has the authority to issue airworthiness directives and other mandatory orders. This includes the inspection of aircraft and engines, fire retardant and smoke detection devices, collision and windshear avoidance systems, noise abatement and the mandatory removal and replacement of aircraft parts that have failed or may fail in the future. We have and maintain FAA certificates of airworthiness for all of our aircraft and have the necessary FAA authority to fly to all of the destinations we currently serve. 

TSA and U.S. Customs and Border Protection &#32; - The TSA and the U.S. Customs and Board Protection, or CBP, operate under the Department of Homeland Security and are responsible for all civil aviation security. This includes passenger and baggage screening; cargo security measures; airport security; assessment and distribution of intelligence; security research and development; international passenger screening; customs; and agriculture. It also has law enforcement powers and the authority to issue regulations, including in cases of national emergency, without a notice or comment period. It can also assess civil penalties for such failures as well as institute proceedings for the imposition and collection of monetary fines for the violation of certain regulations. 

Taxes &#38; Fees - The airline industry is one of the most heavily taxed in the U.S., with taxes and fees accounting for approximately 17% of the total fare charged to a customer. Airlines are obligated to fund all of these taxes and fees regardless of their ability to pass these charges on to the customer. The TSA sets the September 11, or 9/11, Security Fee which is passed to the customer. On July 21, 2014, the 9/11 Security Fee was increased from $2.50 per enplanement, with a maximum of $5 per one-way trip, to $5.60 per enplanement, regardless of the number of connecting flights. On December 19, 2014, the fee was amended and a round trip was limited to a maximum of $11.20. Effective December 28, 2015, the APHIS Aircraft Inspection fee increased from $70.75 to $225 per international aircraft arriving in the U.S. 

State and Local - We are subject to state and local laws and regulations in a number of states in which we operate and the regulations of various local authorities operating the airports we serve. 

Airport Access - JFK, LaGuardia, Newark and Reagan National are Slot-controlled airports subject to the "High Density Rule" and successor rules issued by the FAA. These rules were implemented due to the high volume of traffic at these popular airports located in the northeast corridor airspace. The rules limit the air traffic in and out of these airports during specific times; however, even with the rules in place, delays remain among the highest in the nation due to continuing airspace congestion. We additionally have Slots at other Slot-controlled airports governed by unique local ordinances not subject to the High Density Rule, including Westchester County Airport in White Plains, NY and Long Beach (California) Municipal Airport. 

Airport Infrastructure - The northeast corridor of the U.S. contains some of the most congested airspaces in the world. The airports in this region are some of the busiest in the country, the majority of which are more than 60 years old. Due to high usage and aging infrastructure, issues arise at these airports that are not necessarily seen in other parts of the country. At JFK, the recent completion of high-speed taxiways, in addition to the runway renovations finished in 2015, enables landing aircraft the ability to exit the runway faster. The Unified Terminal Structure project at LaGuardia has been delayed and is still pending final approval which is expected in early 2016. Once underway, it is expected to open to passengers in 2019. 

Foreign Operations - International air transportation is subject to extensive government regulation. The availability of international routes to U.S. airlines is regulated by treaties and related agreements between the U.S. and foreign governments. We currently operate international service to Antigua and Barbuda, Aruba, the Bahamas, Barbados, Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cura&#231;ao, the Dominican Republic, Grenada, Haiti, Jamaica, Mexico, Peru, Saint Lucia, St. Maarten, Trinidad and Tobago and the Turks and Caicos Islands. As previously announced, during 2016 we plan to begin service to Ecuador. To the extent we seek to provide air transportation to additional international markets in the future, we would be required to obtain necessary authority from the DOT and the applicable foreign government. 

We believe we are operating in material compliance with DOT, FAA, TSA and applicable international regulations as well as hold all necessary operating and airworthiness authorizations and certificates. Should any of these authorizations or certificates be modified, suspended or revoked, our business could be materially adversely affected. 

Other 

Environmental - We are subject to various federal, state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment. This includes the discharge or disposal of materials and chemicals as well as the regulation of aircraft noise administered by numerous state and federal agencies. 

The Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 recognizes the right of airport operators with special noise problems to implement local noise abatement procedures as long as those procedures do not interfere unreasonably with the interstate and foreign commerce of the national air transportation system. Certain airports, including San Diego and Long Beach airports in California, have established restrictions to limit noise which can include limits on the number of hourly or daily operations and the time of such operations. These limitations are intended to protect the local noise-sensitive communities surrounding the airport. Our scheduled flights at Long Beach and San Diego are in compliance with the noise curfew limits, but on occasion when we experience irregular operations we may violate these curfews. We have agreed to a payment structure with the Long Beach City Prosecutor for any violations which we pay quarterly to the Long Beach Public Library Foundation. The payment is based on the number of infractions in the preceding quarter. This local ordinance has not had, and we believe it will not have, a negative effect on our operations. 

We use our JetBlue Sustainability program on www.jetblue.com/green/ &#32;to educate our customers and Crewmembers about environmental issues and to inform the public about our environmental protection initiatives. Our most recent corporate sustainability report for 2015 &#32;is available on our website and addresses our environmental programs, including those aimed at curbing greenhouse emissions, our recycling efforts and our focus on corporate social responsibility. 

Foreign Ownership - Under federal law and DOT regulations, we must be controlled by U.S. citizens. In this regard, our president and at least two-thirds of our board of directors must be U.S. citizens. Further, no more than 24.99% of our outstanding common stock may be voted by non-U.S. citizens. We believe we are currently in compliance with these ownership provisions. 

Other Regulations - All airlines are subject to certain provisions of the Communications Act of 1934 due to their extensive use of radio and other communication facilities. They are also required to obtain an aeronautical radio license from the FCC. To the extent we are subject to FCC requirements, we take all necessary steps to comply with those requirements. 

Our labor relations are covered under Title II of the Railway Labor Act of 1926 and are subject to the jurisdiction of the NMB. In addition, during periods of fuel scarcity, access to aircraft fuel may be subject to federal allocation regulations. 

Civil Reserve Air Fleet - We are a participant in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet Program, which permits the U.S. Department of Defense to utilize our aircraft during national emergencies when the need for military airlift exceeds the capability of military aircraft. By participating in this program, we are eligible to bid on and be awarded peacetime airlift contracts with the military. 

Insurance 

We carry insurance of types customary in the airline industry and at amounts deemed adequate to protect us and our property as well as comply with both federal regulations and certain credit and lease agreements. As a result of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, aviation insurers significantly reduced the amount of insurance coverage available to commercial airlines for liability to persons other than employees or passengers for claims resulting from acts of terrorism, war or similar events. This is known as war risk coverage. At the same time, these insurers significantly increased the premiums for aviation insurance in general. The U.S. government agreed to provide commercial war-risk insurance for U.S. based airlines, covering losses to employees, passengers, third parties and aircraft. Prior to the end of U.S. government war-risk insurance coverage, JetBlue obtained comparable coverage in the commercial market starting in 2014 as part of our overall hull and liability insurance coverage.
