AMVAC 

AMVAC is a California corporation that traces its history from 1945 and is a specialty chemical manufacturer that develops and markets products for agricultural, commercial and consumer uses. It manufactures and formulates chemicals for crops, turf and ornamental plants, and human and animal health protection. These chemicals, which include insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, molluscicides, growth regulators, and soil fumigants, are marketed in liquid, powder, and granular forms. In prior years, AMVAC considered itself a distributor-formulator, but now AMVAC primarily manufactures, distributes, and formulates its own proprietary products or custom manufactures or formulates for others. AMVAC has historically expanded its business through both the acquisition of established chemistries (which it has revived in the marketplace) and the development and commercialization of new compounds through licensing arrangements. Below is a description of the Company&#146;s acquisition/licensing activity over the past five years. 

On October 26, 2015, AMVAC entered into a license and supply agreement with Badische Anilin-und Soda-Fabrik (&#147;BASF&#148;) under which BASF sold and AMVAC acquired certain assets relating to the imazaquin product line. Imazaquin is an herbicide that is used on soybeans and for certain non-crop applications. 

On April 29, 2015 the registrant&#146;s international subsidiary, AMVAC C.V., completed the acquisition of certain assets related to the bromacil herbicide product line from DuPont Crop Protection. The assets acquired included the Hyvar &#174; and Krovar &#174; trademarks, product registrations, product registration data, customer information, access to certain know-how, technical registrations and associated registration data in all markets outside of North America. Bromacil is a broad spectrum residual herbicide used on crops such as pineapples, citrus, agave and asparagus, and is marketed globally under the Hyvar &#174; and Krovar &#174; brands 

On April 6, 2015 the registrant&#146;s international subsidiary, AMVAC C.V., completed the acquisition of certain assets related to the Nemacur &#174; insecticide/nematicide product line from Adama Agricultural Solutions Ltd (&#147;Adama&#148;). The assets acquired include trademarks, product registrations, associated registration data, and customer information that relate to the marketing and sale of this crop protection product in Europe. Nemacur is used to control soil insects and nematodes on many fruit and vegetable crops. 

On March 25, 2013, AVD made an equity investment in TyraTech Inc. (&#147;TyraTech&#148;), a Delaware corporation that specializes in developing, marketing and selling pesticide products containing natural oils and other natural ingredients. As of December 31, 2015, the Company&#146;s ownership position in TyraTech was approximately 15.11%. 

On October 7, 2011, AMVAC completed the acquisition of the international rights to the cotton defoliant product tribufos (sold under the trade name Def &#174; ) from Bayer CropScience AG (&#147;BCS AG&#148;). The acquired assets include registrations and data rights, rights relating to manufacturing and formulation know-how, inventories and the trademark Def.

&#160;

Def complements AMVAC&#146;s existing cotton defoliant product Folex &#174; , which it has marketed since 2002. This acquisition also complements the U.S. rights to Def that the Company purchased from BCS AG on July 21, 2010. Both Folex and Def are fast and effective cotton defoliants that facilitate the removal of leaves surrounding the cotton boll and, in combination with other products, function as a harvest aid. 

Seasonality 

The agricultural chemical industry, in general, is cyclical in nature. The demand for AMVAC&#146;s products tends to be seasonal. Seasonal usage, however, does not necessarily follow calendar dates, but more closely follows varying growing seasonal patterns, weather conditions, geography, weather related pressure from pests and customer marketing programs. 

Backlog 

AMVAC does not believe that backlog is a significant factor in its business. AMVAC primarily sells its products on the basis of purchase orders, although from time to time it has entered into requirements contracts with certain customers. 

Customers 

The Company&#146;s largest three customers accounted for 18%, 12% and 8% of the Company&#146;s sales in 2015; 20%, 11% and 8% in 2014; and 17%, 13%, and 8% in 2013. 

Distribution 

AMVAC predominantly distributes its products domestically through national distribution companies and buying groups or co-operatives, that purchase AMVAC&#146;s goods on a purchase order basis and, in turn, sell them to retailers/growers/end-users. The Company&#146;s domestic and international distributors, agents, or customers typically have long-established relationships with retailers/end-users, far-reaching logistics and transportation capabilities and customer service expertise. The markets for AMVAC products vary by region, target crop, use and type of distribution channel. AMVAC&#146;s customers are experts at addressing these markets. The Company manages its international sales through its Netherlands&#146; entity which has sales offices in Mexico or Costa Rica and, employed sales force executives or sales agents in other territories. 

Competition 

In its many marketplaces, AMVAC faces competition from both domestic and foreign manufacturers. Many of our competitors are larger and have substantially greater financial and technical resources than AMVAC. AMVAC&#146;s ability to compete depends on its ability to develop additional applications for its current products and expand its product lines and customer base. AMVAC competes principally on the basis of the quality and efficacy of its products, price and the technical service and support given to its customers. 

Generally, the treatment against pests of any kind is broad in scope, there being more than one way or one product for treatment, eradication, or suppression. In some cases, AMVAC has attempted to position itself in smaller niche markets which are no longer addressed by larger companies. In other cases, for example in the Midwestern corn market, the Company competes directly with larger competitors. 

Manufacturing 

Through its four domestic manufacturing facilities (see Item 2, Properties), AMVAC synthesizes many of the technical grade active ingredients that are in its end-use products. Further, AMVAC formulates and packages the majority of its end-use products at its own facilities or at the facilities of third-party formulators. 

Raw Materials 

AMVAC utilizes numerous companies to supply the various raw materials and components used in manufacturing its products. Many of these materials are readily available from domestic sources. In those instances where there is a single source of supply or where the source is not domestic, AMVAC seeks to secure its supply by either long-term (multi-year) arrangements or purchasing on long lead times from its suppliers. AMVAC believes that it is considered to be a valued customer to such sole-source suppliers.

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

AMVAC&#146;s proprietary product formulations are protected, to the extent possible, as trade secrets and, to a lesser extent, by patents. Certain of the Company&#146;s closed delivery systems are patented and AMVAC has made applications for related inventions to expand its equipment portfolio, particularly with respect to its Smart Integrated Multi-Product Precision Application System, (&#147;SIMPAS&#148;) technology. Further, AMVAC&#146;s trademarks bring value to its products in both domestic and foreign markets. AMVAC considers that, in the aggregate, its trademarks, licenses, and patents constitute a valuable asset. While it does not regard its business as being materially dependent upon any single trademark, license, or patent, it believes that its developmental equipment technology may bring significant value in future years. 

EPA Registrations 

AMVAC&#146;s products also receive protection afforded by the terms of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (&#147;FIFRA&#148;) legislation. The legislation makes it unlawful to sell any pesticide in the United States, unless such pesticide has first been registered by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (&#147;U.S. EPA&#148;). Substantially all of AMVAC&#146;s products are subject to U.S. EPA registration and periodic re-registration requirements and are registered in accordance with FIFRA. This registration by U.S. EPA is based, among other things, on data demonstrating that the product will not cause unreasonable adverse effects on human health or the environment, when it is used according to approved label directions. In addition, each state, requires a specific registration before any of AMVAC&#146;s products can be marketed or used in that state. State registrations are predominantly renewed annually with a smaller number of registrations that are renewed on a multiple year basis. Foreign jurisdictions typically have similar registration requirements by statute. The U.S. EPA, state, and foreign agencies have required, and may require in the future, that certain scientific data requirements be performed on registered products sold by AMVAC. AMVAC, on its own behalf and in joint efforts with other registrants, has furnished, and is currently furnishing, certain required data relative to specific products. 

Under FIFRA, the federal government requires registrants to submit a wide range of scientific data to support U.S. registrations. This requirement results in operating expenses in such areas as regulatory compliance with U.S. EPA and other such bodies in the markets in which the Company sells its products, and the production of new products or new formulations of existing products. AMVAC expensed $9,831, $14,084, and $16,526 during 2015, 2014 and 2013 respectively, on these activities.

Environmental 

During 2015, AMVAC continued activities to address environmental issues associated with its facility in Commerce, CA. (the &#147;Facility&#148;). An outline of the history of those activities follows. 

In 1995, the California Department of Toxic Substances Control (&#147;DTSC&#148;) conducted a Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (&#147;RCRA&#148;) Facility Assessment (&#147;RFA&#148;) of those facilities having hazardous waste storage permits. In March 1997, the RFA culminated in DTSC accepting the Facility into its Expedited Remedial Action Program. Under this program, the Facility was required to conduct an environmental investigation and health risk assessment. Depending on the findings of these investigations, the Facility might also be required to develop and implement remedial measures to address any historical environmental impairment. 

This activity then took two paths: first, the RCRA permit closure and second, the larger site characterization. 

With respect to the RCRA permit closure, in 1998, AMVAC began the formal process to close its hazardous waste permit at the Facility (which had allowed AMVAC to store hazardous waste longer than 90 days) as required by federal regulations. Formal regulatory closure actions began in 2005 and were completed in 2008, as evidenced by DTSC&#146;s October 1, 2008 acknowledgement of AMVAC&#146;s Closure Certification Report. 

With respect to the larger site characterization, soil and groundwater characterization activities began in December 2002 in accordance with the Site Investigation Plan that was approved by DTSC. Additional activities were conducted from 2003 to 2014, with oversight provided by DTSC. Additional review of groundwater and soil data is being conducted in response to federally-mandated initiatives of similarly affected sites. Risk assessment activities have been concluded. The Company submitted a draft remedial action plan to DTSC in February 2015, received formal DTSC comments in January 2016, and will submit a revised remedial action plan in early 2016. Until the remedial action plan has been submitted and comments are received from DTSC, it is uncertain whether the cost associated with further investigation and potential remediation activities will have a material impact on the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements or its results of operations. Thus, the Company is unable to determine what sort of remediation is probable, nor can the cost of remediation be reasonably estimated (the scope can vary depending upon the risk assessment and many other factors). Accordingly, the Company has not recorded a loss contingency with respect thereto. 

AMVAC is subject to numerous federal and state laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee health and safety at its four manufacturing facilities. The Company continually adapts its manufacturing process to the environmental control standards of the various regulatory agencies. The U.S. EPA and other federal and state agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that could have an impact on the Company&#146;s operations. 

AMVAC expends substantial funds to minimize the discharge of materials in the environment and to comply with the governmental regulations relating to protection of the environment. Wherever feasible, AMVAC recovers and recycles raw materials and increases product yield in order to partially offset increasing pollution abatement costs. 

The Company is committed to a long-term environmental protection program that reduces emissions of hazardous materials into the environment, as well as to the remediation of identified existing environmental concerns. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, the Company employed 347 employees. The Company employed 382 employees as of December 31, 2014 and 499 employees as of December 31, 2013. From time to time, due to the seasonality of its business, AMVAC uses temporary contract personnel to perform certain duties primarily related to packaging of its products. None of the Company&#146;s employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. The Company believes it maintains positive relations with its employees.

Domestic operations 

AMVAC is a California corporation that was incorporated under the name of Durham Chemical in August 1945. The name of the corporation was subsequently changed to AMVAC in January 1973. As the Company&#146;s main operating subsidiary, AMVAC owns and/or operates the Company&#146;s domestic manufacturing facilities and is also the parent company (owns 99%) of AMVAC CV. AMVAC manufactures, formulates, packages and sells its products in the USA and is a wholly owned subsidiary of AVD. 

GemChem is a California corporation that was incorporated in 1991 and was subsequently purchased by the Company in 1994. GemChem sells into the pharmaceutical, cosmetic and nutritional markets, in addition to purchasing key raw materials for the Company. GemChem is a wholly owned subsidiary of AVD. 

DAVIE owns real estate for corporate use only. See also Part I, Item 2 of this Annual Report. DAVIE is a wholly owned subsidiary of AVD. 

On November 30, 2012, AMVAC and TyraTech formed a Delaware limited liability company, Envance, in which the Company owned 60% and TyraTech held 40% of the equity interest. Subsequently, on April 1, 2015, the Company entered into an agreement with TyraTech to change its ownership from 60% to 87%. Envance has the rights to develop and commercialize pesticide products and technologies made from natural oils in global consumer, commercial, professional, crop protection and seed treatment markets and has begun bringing products to market. Envance is headquartered in TyraTech&#146;s facility in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. 

International operations 

In July 2012, the Company formed AMVAC C.V., which is incorporated in the Netherlands, for the purpose of managing foreign sales on behalf of the Company. AMVAC C.V. is owned jointly by AMVAC as the general partner, and AVD International, LLC (also formed in July 2012 as a wholly owned subsidiary of AMVAC), as the limited partner, and is therefore a wholly owned subsidiary of AMVAC. 

AMVAC BV is a registered Dutch private limited liability company that was formed in July 2012. AMVAC BV is located in the Netherlands and is wholly owned by AMVAC C.V. During 2015, the international business sold the Company&#146;s products in 54 countries, as compared to 57 countries in 2014. 

The Company opened an office in 2008 in Costa Rica, to conduct business in Costa Rica and other countries in Central America. The office is operated by AMVAC CR Srl and markets chemical products for agricultural and commercial uses. 

The Company opened an office in Basel, Switzerland in 2006. The office is operated by AMVAC S. The Company formed the new subsidiary to expand its resources dedicated to business development opportunities to maintain the Company&#146;s registrations in that country. Also in 2006, the Company formed a Brazilian entity which operates as AMVAC B. It functions primarily to maintain the Company&#146;s registrations in that country. 

The Company opened an office in 1998 in Mexico to conduct business primarily in Mexico. The office is operated by AMVAC M Srl and markets chemical products for agricultural and commercial uses. In November 2013, a Mexican entity, AMVAC M Srl, was incorporated to conduct business in Mexico; this entity is part of the new international business structure and is a wholly owned subsidiary of AMVAC BV. 

The Company classifies as export sales all products bearing foreign labeling shipped to a foreign destination.

Risk Management 

The Company regularly monitors matters, whether insurable or not, that could pose material risk to its operations, financial performance or the safety of its employees and neighbors. The Risk Committee of the Board of Directors (&#147;Board&#148;) was formed in 2010, consists of three members of the Board and meets regularly. In fact, all members of the Board attend Risk Committee meetings. Working with senior management, the committee continuously evaluates the Company&#146;s risk profile, identifies mitigation measures and ensures that the Company is prudently managing these risks. In support of the Risk Committee, senior management has appointed a risk manager and designated several senior executives to lead teams focused on addressing each of several of the most material risks facing the Company; these groups perform analysis with the benefit of operational knowledge. The top risks identified by management and being addressed by risk teams (in no particular order) include: adverse political and regulatory climate; managing high levels of inventory and associated reduced levels of manufacturing activity; succession planning and bench strength; maintaining a competitive edge in the marketplace; the possibility of an environmental event; undervaluation of the Company; availability of acquisition and licensing targets and cyber terrorism. Over the course of 2015, the Company continued to implement its enterprise risk management program, which extends to all areas of potential risk and is a permanent feature in the Company&#146;s operation. In addition, the Company continually evaluates insurance levels for product liability, property damage and other potential areas of risk. Management believes its facilities and equipment are adequately insured against loss from usual business risks.
