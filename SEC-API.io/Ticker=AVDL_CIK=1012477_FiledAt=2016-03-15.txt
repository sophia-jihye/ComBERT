 Item 1. Business &#160;

General Overview

&#160;

Flamel Technologies S.A. (&#8220;Flamel,&#8221; the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we&#8221; or &#8220;us&#8221;) is a specialty pharmaceutical company utilizing core competencies in drug delivery and formulation development to create safer and more efficacious pharmaceutical products to address unmet medical needs and/or reduce overall healthcare costs. The Company has a balanced business model consisting of:

&#160;

(i) an Unapproved Marketed Drugs (&#8220;UMDs&#8221;) business with two approved products in the USA, Bloxiverz &#174; (neostigmine methylsulfate injection) and Vazculep &#174; (phenylephrine hydrochloride injection) that are currently marketed, and a third product currently being reviewed by the FDA, all obtained through the acquisition of &#201;clat Pharmaceuticals, LLC&#8217;s (or &#8220;&#201;clat&#8221;) portfolio on March 13, 2012, (ii) a branded pediatric business, acquired through the acquisition of FSC Laboratories and FSC Pediatrics (&#8220;FSC&#8221;) on February 8, 2016; and (iii) a branded business, focusing on the development of products utilizing Flamel&#8217;s proprietary drug delivery platforms. &#160;

The branded products that are based on Flamel&#8217;s proprietary drug delivery platforms target high-value solid oral and alternative dosage forms using 505(b)(2) and Biosimilar pathways where the Company can develop strong intellectual property positions and deliver meaningful patient benefits. Flamel is headquartered in Lyon, France and has operations in St. Louis, Missouri and Charlotte, NC, USA, and Dublin, Ireland.

&#160;

Corporate Information

&#160;

The Company was incorporated as a s oci&#233;t&#233; anonyme (or SA), a form of corporation under the laws of the Republic of France, in August 1990 as Flamel Technologies S.A. and its shares, represented by American Depositary Shares, began to be quoted on the NASDAQ National Market in 1996 and are now quoted on the NASDAQ Global Market. As per the Company&#8217;s by-laws, its legal existence expires in 2099, unless extended. Flamel&#8217;s principal place of business is located at Parc Club du Moulin &#224; Vent, 33, avenue du Docteur Georges L&#233;vy, 69200 Venissieux, France (a suburb of Lyon); phone number +33 472 78 34 34, fax number +33 472 78 34 35. Its website is www.flamel.com.

&#160;

The Company currently has two direct wholly owned operating subsidiaries: Flamel US Holdings, Inc., and Flamel Irish Holdings, Ltd. Flamel US Holdings, Inc. is a Delaware corporation, created for the acquisition of &#201;clat in March 2012 and is the acquiring entity of FSC Holdings, LLC (&#8220;FSC Holdings&#8221;). &#201;clat Pharmaceuticals, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (&#8220;&#201;clat), is a wholly owned subsidiary of Flamel US Holdings, Inc. Talec Pharma, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (&#8220;Talec&#8221;), is a wholly owned subsidiary of &#201;clat. FSC Therapeutics, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (&#8220;FSC Therapeutics&#8221;) is a wholly owned subsidiary of FSC Holdings, LLC and owns the intangible property acquired in the acquisition of FSC Holdings on February 8, 2016. FSC Laboratories, Inc. is a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of FSC Holdings. FSC Pediatrics, Inc. is a Delaware corporation and is a wholly owned subsidiary of FSC Laboratories. Flamel Irish Holdings, Ltd is a corporation organized under the laws of Ireland. Its wholly owned subsidiary, Flamel Ireland, Ltd., a corporation organized under the laws of Ireland, is where all intangible property was relocated on December 16, 2014. A complete list of the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries can be found in Exhibit 21.1 to this annual report on form 10-K.

&#160;

Our Business Model

&#160;

Since the acquisitions of &#201;clat and FSC, we have implemented a balanced business model allowing Flamel to (i) commercialize niche branded (Bloxiverz and Vazculep) and generic pharmaceutical products in the U.S., (ii) commercialize branded products and devices in the pediatric therapeutic area (Karbinal &#8482; ER ,Aciphex &#174; Sprinkle &#8482; , Cefaclor and Flexichamber &#174; (for more details, see &#8220;&#8211; Lead Products&#8221; in this Part I, Item 1), and (iii) blend novel, high-value internally developed products with our drug delivery and capabilities (for more details, see &#8220;&#8211; Other Products Under Development&#8221; in this Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). 

&#160;

Flamel&#8217;s business model allows us to select, develop, and then license or acquire niche branded products mainly in the U.S. for FDA approval and commercialization. By adopting this strategy, the Company makes itself less dependent on the often changing strategies of partners in the future. Nevertheless, Flamel still explores development, supply and licensing opportunities for either its drug delivery platforms (Micropump &#174; oral sustained release platform, and its derivatives LiquiTime &#174; and Trigger Lock &#8482; , and the long acting injectable platform Medusa &#8482; ; see &#8220;&#8211; Flamel&#8217;s Drug Delivery Platforms Overview&#8221; in this Part I, Item 1 for details) or its proprietary products (as the case may be; see &#8220;&#8211; Other Products Under Development&#8221; in this Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for details) with carefully selected third parties, but, unlike our historical operations, will not be dependent completely on those partnerships to create revenue and profit opportunities.

&#160;

Business Strengths and Strategies

&#160;

&#201;clat, which has focused on pursuing U.S. Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;) approvals through the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway (see &#8220;&#8211; Patent Restoration and Exclusivity&#8221; in this Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K), and FSC, which has focused on the commercialization of pediatric products and devices, add to our Company&#8217;s marketing and licensing knowledge of the commercial and regulatory process in the U.S, which we believe enhances the ability of the Company to identify potential product candidates for development, leverage new opportunities for the application of our drug delivery platforms, and license and market products in both the U.S. and EU.

&#160;

&#160; -4- &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

We anticipate this commercialization capability will allow us to retain a greater portion of the economic benefits associated with sales not only of our proprietary products, but additional Unapproved Marketed Drug products as well (see &#8220;&#8211; Other Products Under Development &#8211; Additional Products using the Unapproved Marketed Drug (or UMD) Strategy&#8221;) in this Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). In addition, we intend to pursue FDA approval of new products developed using our drug delivery platforms (see &#8220;&#8211; Other Products Under Development &#8211; Proprietary pipeline to deliver several regulatory filings (US and/or EU) through 2018&#8221; in this Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K).

&#160;

Our versatile, proprietary drug delivery platforms (Micropump &#174; , LiquiTime &#174; , Trigger Lock &#8482; , Medusa &#8482; ) allow us to select unique product development opportunities, representing either &#8220;life cycle&#8221; opportunities for marketed chemical and biological drugs (via 505(b)(2) or ANDA regulatory paths), or innovative formulation opportunities for NCEs or NBEs (via NDA regulatory path). Our drug delivery platforms allow us to generate competitive differentiated product profiles. These product development opportunities offer the ability to grow market share and to protect market position, through patent protection and/or product differentiation in multiple marketplaces. As part of our new business model, several products formulated using our proprietary drug delivery platforms are currently under various stages of development at Flamel. These products will be marketed either by the Company and/or by partners via licensing/distribution agreements (see &#8220;&#8211; Other Products Under Development &#8211; Proprietary pipeline to deliver several regulatory filings (US and/or EU) through 2018&#8221;) in this Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K).

&#160;

The key elements of our strategy that enable us to build upon our strengths are:

&#160;

&#183; Maximizing the commercial potential of our Unapproved Marketed Drug and pediatric products; &#183; Continuing to build commercially successful products utilizing Micropump; &#183; Identifying and optimizing time-to-market for our (not yet approved) drug delivery platforms, i.e. LiquiTime, Trigger Lock and Medusa. &#183; Maximizing the technical potential of our existing drug delivery platforms for developing new and proprietary products; &#183; Developing and validating additional drug delivery platforms utilizing our current drug delivery platforms; and &#183; Leveraging the capabilities of our existing (and future) proprietary products and/or drug delivery platforms with pharmaceutical and biotechnology partners. &#160;

Developments in 2015 and 2016

&#160;

On March 27, 2015, we announced positive results of first-in-man (&#8220;FIM&#8221;) clinical trial with LiquiTime guaifenesin. Three different twice-daily formulations of LiquiTime guaifenesin were evaluated against immediate release guaifenesin tablets dosed every four hours in a four-way crossover pharmacokinetic study with 16 healthy volunteers (see &#8220;- Proprietary Pipeline Products in this Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K).

&#160;

On April 7, 2015, we announced the departure of Mr. Steve Lisi, Senior Vice President of Business and Corporate Development at Flamel. Simultaneously, Flamel also reaffirmed its product revenue guidance for 2015 of $170 to $185 million for combined sales of Bloxiverz &#174; and Vazculep &#174; .

&#160;

On June 26, 2015, we announced the appointment of Ms. Sandra Hatten as Senior Vice President of Quality and Regulatory Affairs and Mr. Gregory Davis as Vice President of Business and Corporate Development.

&#160;

On June 29, 2015, we announced positive results from two pilot pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in healthy volunteers of FT227, an abuse-deterrent, extended-release, oral hydromorphone product using its proprietary Trigger Lock drug delivery platform. The PK studies were intended to provide sufficient data for the Company to select a preferred prototype formulation to move forward into pivotal studies (see &#8220;- Proprietary Pipeline Products&#8221; in this Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K).

&#160;

On September 9, 2015, we announced that we had received a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date of April 30, 2016 from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for our third Unapproved Marketed Drug product (see &#8220;- Additional Unapproved Marketed Drug Products in this Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K).

&#160;

On October 5, 2015, we announced that our Irish subsidiary, Flamel Ireland Limited, had licensed exclusive U.S. rights to the LiquiTime drug delivery platform to Perrigo Company plc&#8217;s Irish subsidiary, Elan Pharma International Limited, for the U.S. Over-the-Counter (OTC) drug market. Ibuprofen and guaifenesin were included along with five potential new products (for more details see &#8220;&#8211; Products In Development With Partners&#8221; in this Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K).

&#160;

On November 23, 2015, we announced the appointment of Mr. Michael Kanan as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

&#160;

On December 22, 2015, we announced positive interim results from a Phase 1a clinical trial in healthy volunteers of a once weekly subcutaneous injection formulation of exenatide using our Medusa technology (FT228). The study achieved all safety and PK assessment objectives throughout ascending single dose administrations of FT228. The safety profile of FT228 was favorable in healthy volunteers up to a dose of 140 mcg, with an extremely low incidence of the gastrointestinal side effects commonly related to twice daily subcutaneous administration of exenatide (nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, loss of appetite), in addition to a low incidence of mild injection site reactions. We plan to initiate a Phase 1b study of FT228 in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus patients in the first quarter of 2016. One dose per week of FT228 will be administered over a one month period in order to assess safety in patients, the steady-state PK profile and the product&#8217;s potential effect on surrogate biomarkers for the disease.

&#160;

&#160; -5- &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

On January 8, 2016, we provided an update on the Company&#8217;s corporate progress as it related to a number of initiatives, including ongoing clinical programs and 2016 revenue guidance. We announced that we would be submitting a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) for once-nightly Micropump sodium oxybate in the first quarter of 2016 and upon approval would commence patient recruitment likely in the second quarter. We also announced that we had requested a meeting with FDA in the first quarter of 2016 to discuss continued development of FT227 related to Trigger Lock and expect to initiate licensing discussions for the technology in early 2016. Additionally, we announced our plans to move the first two LiquiTime products, ibuprofen and guaifenesin, into pivotal testing in 2016. Finally, we provided product revenue guidance for 2016 in the range of $100 to $120 million.

&#160;

On February 8, 2016, we announced the acquisition of FSC Holdings, LLC, together with its wholly owned subsidiaries FSC Pediatrics, Inc., FSC Therapeutics, LLC, and FSC Laboratories, Inc. from Deerfield CSF, LLC, an affiliate of Deerfield Management, one of the Company&#8217;s major shareholders. (see Note 19: Subsequent Events to the consolidated financial statements within Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.). FSC is a Charlotte, NC-based specialty pharmaceutical company that markets three pediatric pharmaceutical products indicated for infection, allergy, gastroesophageal disease (GERD), and a medical device for the administration of aerosolized medication using pressurized Metered Dose Inhalers (pMDIs) for the treatment of asthma. Under the terms of the acquisition, Flamel will pay $20.25 million over a five year period to Deerfield for all of its equity interests in FSC Holdings. Specifically, Flamel will pay $1.05 million annually for five years and will make a final payment in January 2021 of $15.0 million. Flamel will also pay Deerfield a 15% royalty per annum on net sales of the current FSC products, up to $12.5 million for a period not exceeding ten years. 

&#160;

Lead Products

&#160;

Bloxiverz &#174; (neostigmine methylsulfate injection), Flamel&#8217;s first NDA approval . Bloxiverz&#8217;s NDA was filed on July 31, 2012. Bloxiverz was approved by the FDA on May 31, 2013 and was launched in July 2013. Bloxiverz is a drug used intravenously in the operating room for the reversal of the effects of non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents after surgery. Bloxiverz was the first FDA-approved version of neostigmine methylsulfate. Today, neostigmine is the most frequently used product for the reversal of the effects of other agents used for neuromuscular blocks. There are approximately 5 million vials sold annually in the U.S. On January 8, 2015 and December 28, 2015, the FDA approved Fresenius Kabi USA (&#8220;Fresenius&#8221;)&#8217;s NDA for neostigmine methylsulfate (for both 0.5 mg/1mL and 1 mg/1mL strengths) and an ANDA submitted by Eurohealth International, an affiliate of West-Ward Pharmaceuticals Corp., neostigmine methylsulfate (for both 0.5 mg/1mL and 1 mg/1mL strengths), respectively. In 2014, we recognized a total amount of $10.2 million as revenues from product sales and $150.3 million in 2015 (for more details, see &#8220;&#8211; Results of Operations&#8221; in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). In the future, the volume of sales of Bloxiverz is dependent upon the competitive market dynamics between Flamel, APP, West-Ward and any subsequent ANDA approvals that may occur. Additionally, an alternative product marketed by Merck, Bridion (sugammadex), was approved in early 2016 and will likely reduce the size of the neostigmine market.

&#160; 

Vazculep &#174; (phenylephrine hydrochloride injection), Flamel&#8217;s second NDA approval. On June 28, 2013, the Company filed an NDA for a second product developed by &#201;clat, Vazculep (phenylephrine hydrochloride injection). The product was approved by the FDA on June 27, 2014. Flamel&#8217;s subsidiary &#201;clat Pharmaceuticals started shipping Vazculep&#8482; (in 1mL single use vials, and 5mL and 10mL pharmacy bulk package vials) to wholesalers in October 2014. There are approximately 7 million vials sold annually in the U.S. Vazculep is the only FDA-approved version of phenylephrine hydrochloride to be available in all three vial sizes. West-Ward Pharmaceuticals Corp. (&#8220;West Ward&#8221;) commercializes the 1mL single-dose vial, as an approved product in the U.S. The volume of sales of Vazculep is dependent upon the competitive landscape in the marketplace.

&#160; 

Karbinal &#8482; ER (carbinoxamine maleate extended-release oral suspension). Karbinal ER is an H1 receptor antagonist (antihistamine) indicated for children two years of age and older, is the only first generation extended release oral suspension antihistamine available in U.S. Karbinal ER provides physicians with a new, effective and easy to use treatment option for children with seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis that need symptomatic relief for runny nose, sneezing, itchy nose or throat and itchy and watery eyes. Karbinal ER was launched in 2015 and is exclusively licensed from Tris Pharma.

&#160; 

AcipHex &#174; Sprinkle &#8482; (rabeprazole sodium). AcipHex Sprinkle is a delayed-release capsule, in dosages of 5 mg and 10 mg, indicated for the treatment of GERD in children 1 to 11 years of age for up to 12 weeks. AcipHex Sprinkle can be sprinkled on a small amount of soft food (e.g., applesauce, fruit or vegetable based baby food, or yogurt) or the capsule granules can be emptied into a small amount of liquid (e.g., infant formula, apple juice, or pediatric electrolyte solution). The U.S. marketing rights for this product were acquired from Eisai Inc. and the product was launched in 2015. 

&#160; 

Cefaclor for Oral Suspension, 125 mg/5 mL, 250 mg/5 mL and 375 mg/5 mL . Cefaclor is indicated for the treatment of otitis media, lower respiratory infections, pharyngitis and tonsillitis, urinary tract infections, and skin and skin structure infections, caused by susceptible organisms. It is a second generation cephalosporin antibiotic used to treat certain infections, caused by susceptible bacteria. Cefaclor was launched in 2015. 

&#160; 

Flexichamber &#8482;. Flexichamber is a collapsible holding chamber for use by patients under the care or treatment of a licensed healthcare professional to administer aerosolized medication from most pressurized Metered Dose Inhalers (MDI), is a prescription medical device. Flexichamber is comprised of antistatic materials to help improve delivery of medication from MDIs to the patient, while minimizing the adherence of the medication to the walls of the chamber. Flexichamber can be used with or without a mask. FSC received FDA 510(k) clearance for Flexichamber in October 2014 and the product is expected to be launched in 2016. 

&#160; 

&#160; -6- &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Coreg CR &#174; , the Micropump-based marketed product. Coreg CR is an extended-release formulation (once-a-day) of Coreg ( i.e. carvedilol phosphate), a non-selective antagonist of Beta 1, Beta 2 adrenergic receptors and a selective antagonist of Alpha 1 adrenergic receptors. Coreg and Coreg CR are the only beta blockers indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction following myocardial infarction. Coreg CR was developed in partnership with GlaxoSmithKline (&#8220;GSK&#8221;) and is approved, marketed and sold in the U.S since 2007. To date, we have generated (i) $23 million in milestone payments and (ii) $62.5 million in royalty revenue from Coreg CR. Until December 1, 2014, we received royalty revenue of $6.3 million and a total amount of $6.7 million from product sales. In December 2014, as part of the divestiture of our development and manufacturing facility (&#8220;Pessac Facility&#8221;), the Company transferred the Supply Agreement for Coreg CR and, transferred and assigned to Recipharm all rights, titles and interests in the royalties of the License Agreements by and between Flamel and GSK (for more details, see &#8220;&#8211; Strategic Alliances&#8221; in this Part I, Item 1, and Note 17: Discontinued Operations to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K).

&#160;

Other Products Under Development

&#160; 

Additional Unapproved Marketed Drug Products . The Company still intends to develop and seek NDA or ANDA approval for select products that are currently marketed in the U.S. but are currently not approved by the FDA. One of the Company&#8217;s principle criteria is previously, well established efficacy. This strategy should create opportunities, to have the only approved version of products in niche markets, potentially enjoying a period of defacto exclusivity through the 505(b)(2) approval pathway. However, this strategy has a limited number of opportunities where a meaningful return on investment is possible. Through &#201;clat, Flamel has acquired additional opportunities beyond Bloxiverz and Vazculep:

&#160;

&#183; Flamel filed one of these products in mid-2015 and received a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date of April 30, 2016 from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Based on IMS and other third-party data, the Company estimates that current U.S. market sales of the unapproved versions of this drug are in the range of $100 million per year. &#183; Another UMD Product is currently being reviewed internally and the Company anticipates its development in 2016. &#160;

Proprietary Pipeline Products . Five product development opportunities ( i.e. four using Micropump or LiquiTime or Trigger Lock, and one using Medusa) have been selected for internal development. After setting differentiated targeted product profiles and establishing development plans, pharmaceutical development activities have been initiated.

&#160;

&#183; Sodium Oxybate , a Micropump based formulation for one single dose before bedtime for patients suffering from narcolepsy, eliminating the need for a second dose. The results of Flamel&#8217;s FIM clinical study in healthy volunteers, published in April 2014, demonstrated elimination of the need for a second, middle of the night dose, as is required with JAZZ&#8217;s Xyrem &#174; product. This was further confirmed by a second clinical study performed at higher doses, published in December 2014. The elimination of the second dose for narcolepsy patients not only provides more convenience, but could also benefit patients by eliminating or reducing the current disruption in nighttime sleep. The potential for additional benefits of Micropump Sodium Oxybate, including improved safety, will be examined in future clinical studies. Prior to commencement of clinical studies, the Company plans to submit to the FDA, a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) for once-nightly Micropump sodium oxybate in the first quarter of 2016. SPAs serve as a way to reduce the risks associated with clinical studies, as the acceptance represents general agreement by the FDA of a pivotal trial&#8217;s design, endpoints and analyses. Upon acceptance and approval of the SPA by the FDA, we plan to commence patient recruitment. The clinical trial is expected to run through early to mid-2017. It is expected to be a placebo-controlled efficacy study of approximately 200-300 patients and will be conducted at between 50 and 60 clinical sites in North America and Europe. In conjunction with the SPA, we expect to file for Investigational Medicinal Product Dossier (IMPD) approval in the EU. Any additional studies, such as pivotal pharmacokinetic (PK) studies, needed for a New Drug Application (NDA) approval will be run simultaneously, and the target for trial completion is mid-2017. Ultimately, we believe we will be able to demonstrate improved efficacy, improved safety and improved patient satisfaction over the standard of care, JAZZ&#8217;s Xyrem &#174; , a twice nightly sodium oxybate formulation, which generated approximately $955 million in revenues in 2015. &#160;

&#183; Ibuprofen , LiquiTime-based formulation for twice-daily dosing for the treatment of pain. Flamel&#8217;s pharmacokinetic results, published in September 2014, demonstrated equivalent exposure (or &#8220;AUC&#8221;) to immediate-release ibuprofen, similar onset and similar blood levels at 12 hours, with no safety or tolerability issues. In October 2015, we entered into a license agreement with Elan Pharma International Limited (&#8220;Elan&#8221;) for the U.S. OTC rights to LiquiTime including our ibuprofen product (see &#8220;&#8211; Products In Development With Partners in this Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). In consultation with Elan, Flamel anticipates a US regulatory filing in 2017. Additionally, Flamel may follow such filing with a later filing in the European Union, either by itself or with another licensing partner. LiquiTime ibuprofen opens the door to the OTC cough, cold and allergy markets, where LiquiTime delivery platform can provide significant benefit through combination products containing frequently used together active ingredients with tailored and extended release profiles. &#160;

&#160; -7- &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; Guaifenesin , LiquiTime-based formulation for twice-daily dosing for the treatment of chest congestion associated with various indications (common cold, infections, or allergies). Flamel&#8217;s pharmacokinetic results, published in March 2015, clearly met the intention of the study, i.e. to allow selecting the best formulation prototype, which satisfied most of the criteria necessary for proving bioequivalence of AUC to the immediate release guaifenesin tablets, for further optimization and scale up. Our guaifenesin product was also part of the license agreement with Elan. We plan, in consultation with Elan, to begin pivotal testing in 2016. This second product will expand our twice-daily oral suspension offerings for the OTC market in the near future. &#160;

&#183; &#160; Exenatide , a once a week Medusa-based injectable formulation of exenatide (FT228), a glucagon-like peptide-1 (&#8220;GLP-1&#8221;) agonist for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Flamel&#8217;s preclinical results in minipigs, published in June 2014, demonstrated improved bioavailability versus commercially available once-a-week exenatide, similar release profiles for two successive injections, no adverse clinical signs and an excellent local tolerability. The pharmacokinetics profile of Medusa-exenatide was compatible with a release over one week in human. In 2015, we completed a Phase 1a clinical trial in healthy volunteers of a once weekly subcutaneous injection formulation of exenatide. The trial was conducted in two periods. The first, a 2-arm study of 20 healthy volunteers in each arm, evaluated the safety and PK profiles of FT228 versus Byetta&#174;, a twice daily injection of exenatide marketed by Astra Zeneca, at a total dose of 10 mcg. The second, a 2-arm study of 20 healthy volunteers in each arm, evaluated the safety and PK profiles of FT228 at total doses of 70 mcg and 140 mcg. The safety profile of FT228 was favorable in healthy volunteers up to a dose of 140 mcg, with an extremely low incidence of the gastrointestinal side effects commonly related to twice daily subcutaneous administration of exenatide (nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, loss of appetite), in addition to a low incidence of mild injection site reactions. Two subjects dropped out of the study prior to completion of the 140 mcg dosing for reasons unrelated to the clinical trial. The study achieved all safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) assessment objectives throughout ascending single dose administrations of FT228. We initiated a Phase 1b study of FT228 in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus patients in the first quarter of 2016. One dose per week of FT228 is being administered for a one month period at two different doses in order to assess safety in patients, the steady-state PK profile and the product&#8217;s potential effect on surrogate biomarkers for the disease. &#160;

&#183; &#160; Hydromorphone . Flamel also has a Trigger Lock-based abuse-deterrent, extended-release, oral hydromorphone product (FT227) in development. Hydromorphone is used for relief of moderate to severe pain in patients requiring continuous around-the-clock opioid treatment for an extended period of time. We announced in June 2015, positive results from two pilot pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in healthy volunteers of FT227. The PK studies were intended to provide sufficient data for the Company to select a preferred prototype formulation to move forward into pivotal studies. The studies compared three FT227 prototypes to the comparator product Jurnista &#169; (sold as Exalgo &#169; in the United States) in both fasted and fed conditions at a dose of 32mg. Under fasted conditions, comparing the AUC and the Cmax of FT227 to Jurnista in 16 subjects, the results identified a FT227 formulation that met the bioequivalence criteria for both parameters. Under fed conditions (14 subjects), the same formulation was bioequivalent in terms of AUC to Jurnista but outside of the Cmax bioequivalence criterion at the lower confidence interval level. Comparing the effect of food on the PK parameters of the FT227 prototypes across the two studies, no notable difference is seen in either AUC or Cmax in fed and fasted conditions. This suggests that administration of FT227 will not be subject to a clinically relevant food effect. In both studies FT227 was well tolerated and no serious adverse events were reported. In addition, Flamel has generated substantial in vitro data comparing the abuse deterrence properties of FT227 compared to other marketed abuse-deterrent opioid products. The Company is confident that Trigger Lock is a robust platform for opioids that will set a high standard in terms of abuse deterrence. Further in vitro data have been generated on FT227 by an independent contract research organization which confirmed the excellent abuse deterrent properties of the product. FT227 is designed to be filed as a 505(b)(2) New Drug Application (NDA). We recently requested a meeting with the FDA to discuss the further development of FT227 and expect to initiate licensing discussions for the technology in early 2016.

Products in development with partners.

&#160;

Following the rationalization of the Company&#8217;s products pipeline, as described below under the caption &#8220;Proprietary Intellectual Property.&#8221;, the four partnerships that remained in effect in 2013, were either terminated in 2014 or transferred to Recipharm AB, as part the divestiture of our Pessac Facility. As a term of this divestiture, Recipharm will be allowed to use Micropump platform for the continued manufacturing of microparticles for Coreg CR&#174;, marketed by GlaxoSmithKline in the USA (for more details see above &#8220;&#8211; Lead Products&#8221; in this Part I, Item 1, and below &#8220;&#8211; Strategic Alliances&#8221; in this Part I, Item 1 and &#8220;&#8211; Manufacturing&#8221; in this Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K).

&#160;

We entered into an Exclusive License Agreement on September 30, 2015, with Elan Pharma International Limited, a subsidiary of Perrigo Company plc, for the U.S. rights to our LiquiTime drug delivery platform for the U.S. (OTC) drug market. Under the multi-product license agreement, we received an upfront payment of $6.0 million and will be eligible for at least $50 million in approval and launch milestones. In addition, we will receive mid-single digit royalties on net sales of the products. Flamel and Elan believe there is a large market opportunity for other OTC extended release liquid drug formulations, including products containing active ingredient combinations for the US cough/cold market, which analysts have estimated between $6 billion to $8 billion annually.

Competition and Market Opportunities 

&#160;

Competition

&#160;

Competition in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry is intense and is expected to increase. We compete with academic laboratories, research institutions, universities, joint ventures, and other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including other companies developing niche brand or generic specialty pharmaceutical products or drug delivery platforms. Some of these competitors may also be our business partners. There can be no assurance that our competitors will not obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that would make it difficult or impossible for us to compete with their products. Furthermore, major technological changes can happen quickly in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. Such rapid technological change, or the development by our competitors of technologically improved or differentiated products, could render our drug delivery platforms obsolete or noncompetitive.

&#160;

The drug delivery industry landscape has dramatically changed over the past decade and even more so during the past five years, largely as a function of the growing importance of generic drugs. The growth of generics (typically small molecules) and of large molecules (biosimilars) has been accelerated by the demand for less expensive pharmaceutical products. As a result, the pricing power of pharmaceutical companies will be more tightly controlled in the future.

&#160;

In addition, the overall landscape of the Pharma/Biotech industry has changed, as consolidation has reduced our pool of potential partners and further accelerated the competition among drug delivery and specialty pharmaceutical companies. Over the past ten years, numerous stand-alone drug delivery companies have been acquired (partly or entirely) by pharmaceutical, biotech, generic or other drug delivery companies. By acquiring drug delivery platforms, those companies are internalizing their previously outsourced R&#38;D efforts while potentially preventing competitors from accessing the acquired technologies. In the meantime, certain drug delivery companies have consolidated their existing positioning or have entered new markets via M&#38;A transactions and/or restructuring.

&#160;

Just as Flamel has undertaken a strategy of developing and commercializing its own products, few of Flamel&#8217;s &#8220;historical&#8221; competitors still pursue a sole drug delivery business model as many others have moved or are moving to the Specialty Pharma model. A few examples include Alkermes, Depomed, Ethypharm and Octoplus.

&#160;

Our drug delivery platforms primarily compete with technologies from companies such as:

&#160;

&#160;

Flamel&#8217;s Specialty Pharma model (focusing on optimized re-formulations development capabilities) competes with a number of companies, based upon the product being developed. Examples of companies with whom we or future partners would compete, given our current pipeline, include Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Purdue Pharma, Tris Pharma and others. Flamel as a specialty pharmaceutical company has various capabilities, including the use of the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, the life cycle management of drugs, and direct commercialization of drugs.

&#160;

Market Opportunities

&#160;

Drug delivery platforms are of particular interest for managing the life cycle of pharmaceutical products, as they offer many advantages:

&#160;

&#183; improvements in bioavailability &#183; pharmacokinetic improvements &#183; enhanced efficacy &#183; reduction of adverse events &#183; improved patient compliance &#160;

Drug delivery capabilities also provide companies the ability to protect the improved drugs by allowing patent protection to the differentiated drugs the technologies provide. Market exclusivity can also be granted for improvements to existing drugs. BCC Research estimated the global drug delivery market to worth an estimated $188 billion in 2014 and that the market grew to $194 billion in 2015. The increased number of geriatric patients and the demand for convenient drug delivery options offer major opportunities for the development of innovative and easy-to-use drug delivery platforms. In 2015, FDA&#8217;s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (&#8220;CDER&#8221;) approved 41 novel new drugs, as new molecular entities (&#8220;NMEs&#8221;) under New Drug Applications (NDAs) or as new therapeutic biologics under Biologics License Applications (&#8220;BLAs&#8221;) (FDA, Novel New Drugs 2014, Summary, January 2015). Additionally, the FDA approved 82 &#8220;first time generic drugs&#8221; (FDA, ANDA (Generic) Drug Approvals in 2015, www.fda.gov).

&#160;

Market opportunities for its current proprietary pipeline are estimated by Flamel to be worth at least several hundred million dollars each. For example, Xyrem &#174; (sodium oxybate) recorded $955 million in sales in the U.S. for 2015 (source: Jazz press release Full Year And Fourth Quarter 2015 Financial Results, February 23, 2016); OTC ibuprofen products recorded sales in the U.S. beyond $480 million including combination products in 2015 (source: IMS). The U.S. cough, cold, pain and allergy markets targeted by our LiquiTime-based products, is estimated between $6 billion and $8 billion annually &#8211; (source: Nielsen Data Trend). Sales of GLP-1 drugs exceeded $3 billion in 2015 according to IMS and the U.S. market for prescription painkillers exceeded $7 billion in 2015 (source: IMS).

&#160;

The industry faces many challenges. There are four main forces currently affecting all pharmaceutical and drug delivery companies and forcing the industry to adapt and to change: (i) the rise of generics; (ii) the rise in costs for new product development; (iii) the commoditization and acquisition of drug delivery technologies; (iv) the integration of the drug delivery-based formulation development occurs at much earlier stage in the overall pharmaceutical development; and (v) the higher regulatory and reimbursement hurdles.

&#160;

These forces have affected the small molecule space to a greater extent, as biologics enjoy higher barriers to entry and have been sheltered as a consequence. But they are at work in the biologics space as well. In particular, in today&#8217;s environment, a drug has to demonstrate significant therapeutic efficacy advantage over current standard of care in order to successfully solicit third party payer coverage. Alternatively, changes in the delivery of a drug must create a demonstrable reduction in costs. Dosing convenience, by itself, is no longer sufficient to gain reimbursement acceptance. It has a serious impact on drug delivery companies as they have to now demonstrate, through costly Phase 3 trials, therapeutic efficacy of their new formulations. The FDA has actually encouraged drug companies developing enhanced formulations to use an abbreviated regulatory pathway: the 505(b)(2) NDA. Most drug delivery companies today are using this approach or the supplemental NDA pathway (&#8220;sNDA&#8221;). An NDA or sNDA is necessary to market an already approved drug for a new indication, or in a different dosage form or formulation. However, the sNDA approach requires cross-referencing the originator&#8217;s drug dossier, and eventually an alliance with the originator&#8217;s company for commercialization.

&#160;

Because the drug delivery industry is highly competitive, participants must find ways to lessen the pressure and increase profitability. Flamel, resulting from the combination of its existing proprietary drug delivery platforms with the established commercial capability of &#201;clat, has evolved into a Specialty Pharma company focusing on re-formulations and requiring shorter product development cycles by using a &#8220;fast track&#8221; NDA mechanism (505(b)(2)). The pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors, with an impending &#8220;patent cliff&#8221;, are forcing Big Pharma/Biotech to reorganize and creating niche opportunities for Specialty Pharma companies like the &#8220;new&#8221; Flamel.

&#160;

Flamel&#8217;s Drug Delivery Platforms 

&#160;

Overview

&#160;

Flamel owns and develops drug delivery platforms that address key formulation challenges, leading to the development of differentiated drug products for administration in various forms ( e.g. capsules, tablets, sachets or liquid suspensions for oral use; or injectables for subcutaneous administration) and can be applied to a broad range of drugs (novel, already-marketed, or off-patent):

&#160;

&#160; -11- &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; Micropump &#174; is a microparticulate system that allows the development and marketing of modified and/or controlled release of solid, oral dosage formulations of drugs (Micropump&#174;-carvedilol and Micropump&#174;-aspirin formulations have been approved in the U.S. and in the E.U., respectively. &#160;

&#183; LiquiTime &#174; allows development of modified/controlled release oral products in a liquid suspension formulation particularly suited to children or for patients having issues swallowing tablets or capsules. &#160;

&#183; Trigger Lock &#8482; allows development of abuse-resistant modified/controlled release formulations of narcotic/opioid analgesics and other drugs susceptible to abuse. &#160;

We believe the versatility of Micropump which permits us to develop differentiated product profiles (modified/controlled release formulations) under various dosage forms including capsules, tablets, sachets and liquid suspensions (LiquiTime) for oral use, is a competitive advantage. With Trigger Lock potentially addressing the issue of narcotic/opioid analgesics abuse, we have broad and versatile presentations to serve most markets from pediatric to geriatric.

&#160;

&#183; Medusa &#8482; allows the development of extended/modified release of injectable dosage formulations of drugs ( e.g. peptides, polypeptides, proteins, and small molecules). &#160;

We believe also that the Medusa platform provides a competitive advantage for developing differentiated injectable product profiles. Medusa-based formulations permit drugs&#8217; full activity to be preserved in an extended release format with other potential advantages being, improved solubility, stability, and resistance to aggregation. Overall, Medusa&#8482; can improve the patient experience through a change in the route of administration ( e.g. switching from intravenous to subcutaneous injection) and may improve compliance through reduction of administration frequency ( e.g. from once-a-day to once-a-week).

&#160;

The Company will continue to selectively partner its proprietary formulations capabilities and will either commercialize products based on its drug delivery platforms on its own or partner them.

&#160;

Micropump &#174; : Delivery Platform for the Modified and/or Controlled Release of Solid, Oral Dosage Formulations of Drugs

&#160;

Flamel&#8217;s Micropump platform permits either extended or delayed delivery of small molecule drugs via the oral route. Micropump consists of a multiple-particulate system containing 5,000 to 10,000 microparticles per capsule or tablet. The 200-500 microns diameter-sized microparticles are released in the stomach and pass into the small intestine, where each microparticle, operating as a miniature delivery system, releases the drug at an adjustable rate and over an extended period of time. The design of the Micropump microparticles allows an extended release in the Gastro-Intestinal (&#8220;GI&#8221;) tract allowing mean plasma residence times to be extended for up to 24 hours. The microparticles&#8217; design can be adapted to each drug&#8217;s specific characteristics by modifying the coating composition and thickness as well as the composition of the excipients encapsulated with the drug. The resultant formulations can potentially offer improved efficacy (by extending therapeutic coverage), reduced toxicity and/or side effects (by reducing Cmax or peak drug concentration in the plasma, or by reducing intra- and inter-patient variability), and improved patient compliance (by reducing frequency of administration). The platform is applicable to poorly soluble (&#60; 0.01mg/L) as well as highly soluble (&#62; 500g/L) and to low dose ( e.g. 4 mg) or high dose ( e.g. 1,000 mg) drugs, while providing excellent mouth feel and taste masking properties. Micropump allows the achievement of extremely precise pharmacokinetic profiles extended (and/or delayed) release of single or combination of drugs, in a variety of formats (such as tablets, capsules, sachet, or liquids (LiquiTime), while preserving the targeted release rate over the shelf-life of the product.

&#160;

Considering R&#38;D costs for reformulating a drug are typically substantially lower than for developing NCEs, &#8220;reformulation approvals&#8221; provide an opportunity to extend the exclusivity period of already marketed drugs or create new market exclusivity for off-patent drug. The Micropump platform has successfully transitioned to commercial stage with Coreg CR &#174; (see &#8220;&#8211; Lead Products&#8221;) in this Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Flamel currently has additional Micropump-based internal products in development including sodium oxybate for narcolepsy, which has been successfully tested in two Phase 1 clinical studies; see &#8220;&#8211; Proprietary Product Pipeline&#8221; in this Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K).

&#160;

Micropump (and related products) is patent protected (see &#8220;&#8211; Proprietary Intellectual Property&#8221;). Coreg CR &#174; Micropump-based microparticles are now being manufactured for GSK by Recipharm (see &#8220;&#8211; Strategic Alliances&#8221; in this Part I, Item 1 and &#8220;&#8211; Manufacturing&#8221; in this Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K).

&#160;

LiquiTime &#174; : Delivery Platform for the Modified/Controlled Release of Liquid, Oral Dosage Formulations of Drugs

&#160;

The U.S. sales of drugs (Rx and OTC) in liquid form for oral administration exceeded $5.8 billion for the year 2015 (source: IMS). Amongst marketed &#8220;extended release&#8221; (twice-a-day or once-daily) liquid products are Tussionex &#174; (hydrocodone polistirex and chlorpheniramine polistirex) and its branded and generic alternatives, Delsym &#174; and Delsym Children &#174; (dextromethorphan polistirex developed and sold by Reckitt Benckiser plc.) and Quillivant XR marketed by Pfizer. These products totaled $249 million sales in 2015 (source: IMS).

&#160;

&#160; -12- &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Flamel&#8217;s LiquiTime platform uses Micropump&#8217;s competitive advantages to allow us to develop modified/controlled release ( e.g. zero-order kinetics) in liquid suspension formulations. The LiquiTime products are particularly suitable for dosing to children and for use by patients having issues swallowing tablets or capsules. Unlike the other product examples described in the previous paragraph, which are all based on ion exchange resin technology, LiquiTime does not have the limitation of having to work solely with ionic drugs and therefore has applicability to a much broader range of drug molecules. As with Micropump, LiquiTime can be applied to the development of combination products and it is readily able to be scaled-up to commercial quantities. We believe that LiquiTime, designed to provide a controlled, extended release of oral liquids principally for pediatric and geriatric patients will be also effective for certain prescription products. The increasing number of geriatric patients and the demand for convenient drug delivery options for children offer striking opportunities for the development of LiquiTime-based formulations. Flamel has described two LiquiTime-based products in development: ibuprofen LiquiTime and guaifenesin LiquiTime both successfully tested in FIM clinical studies. The rights to these products along with the LiquiTime technology has been licensed to Elan Pharm International Limited for U.S. OTC rights. The first pivotal clinical study could be expected to be initiated as early as in the end of 2016 with respect to these products (see &#8220;Proprietary Product Pipeline&#8221; in this Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K).

&#160;

LiquiTime (and related products) is patent protected (see &#8220;&#8211; Proprietary Intellectual Property&#8221; in this Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K).

&#160;

Trigger Lock &#8482; : Delivery Platform for Abuse-Resistant Modified/Controlled Release Formulations of Narcotic/Opioid Analgesics

&#160;

A major problem faced by the industry is the growing abuse and misuse of opioids by drug abusers, who attempt to extract the opioids from the drug products for the purposes of injection or otherwise achieve the immediate release of the large doses contained in extended release products. The proportion of narcotic/opioid analgesics abuse associated with emergency room admissions has more than tripled in ten years, from 6.8% in 1998 to 26.5% in 2008 (TEDS report, July 15, 2010). Narcotic/opioid analgesics abuse continues to increase as current products remain easy to abuse. In 2010, enough prescription painkillers were prescribed to medicate every American adult every 4 hours for one month (PBS 2013). The number of prescription medicine abusers in 2010 was 8.76 million, 5.1 million of whom abused painkillers (drugabuse.com 2013). The market for opioid drugs, used to treat patients suffering from severe and chronic pain in the seven major markets (USA, Japan, and five European countries) was estimated to exceed $7.4 billion in 2010, dominated by oxycodone. In 2015, the U.S. sales of oral opioid drugs (hydrocodone, hydromorphone, morphine, oxycodone and oxymorphone, including combination products) exceeded $6.4 billion (source: IMS).

&#160;

Flamel&#8217;s Trigger Lock platform utilizes Micropump&#8217;s competitive advantages to allow the development of abuse-resistant modified/controlled release formulations of narcotics and other drugs susceptible to abuse:

&#160;

&#183; Micropump particles are extremely difficult to crush to extract the narcotic/opioid analgesics; &#183; Additional formulation modifications are made to prevent other less publicized methods of abusing controlled release technologies are available; and, &#183; Trigger Lock can provide products that are either bioequivalent to or have improved pharmacokinetics over marketed narcotic/opioid analgesics. &#183; The FDA&#8217;s moves to restrict the prescribing of extended-release opioid analgesics should benefit abuse-resistant formulations, such as Trigger Lock. The FDA issued a &#8220;Draft Guidance for Abuse Deterrent Opioids&#8221; on January 9, 2013. &#183; We believe that Trigger Lock has the potential to satisfy the FDA Draft Guidance for Abuse Deterrent Opioids: &#183; Laboratory-based in vitro manipulation and extraction studies (Category 1) &#8211; Success with Trigger Lock &#183; Pharmacokinetic studies (Category 2) &#8211; Success with Trigger Lock &#183; Clinical abuse potential studies (Category 3) &#8211; To be performed prior marketing &#183; Analysis of post marketing data to assess the impact of an abuse-resistant formulation on actual abuse in a community setting (Category 4) &#8211; To be performed post marketing &#183; Flamel has one Trigger Lock-based internal product, hydromorphone, under development for which certain PK and independent in-vitro abuse resistance data was gathered in 2015; a pivotal clinical study is expected to be initiated in 2016 (see &#8220;&#8211; Proprietary Product Pipeline&#8221; in this Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). &#183; Trigger Lock (and related products) is patent protected (see &#8220;&#8211; Proprietary Intellectual Property&#8221; in this Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). &#160;

Medusa &#8482; Delivery Platform for the Modified/Controlled Release of Injectable Dosage Formulations of Drugs

&#160;

U.S. sales for injectable products in 2015 were $132 billion, including nearly $16 billion for &#8220;long-acting&#8221; products (source: IMS). Conversely, global sales of biologics were between $190 to $222 billion in 2014 according to various analysts, and are expected to exceed $386 billion by 2019 (source: BCC Research).

&#160;

Flamel&#8217;s Medusa, a hydrogel depot formulation approach that does not alter the drug substance, enables the modified/controlled delivery from one day up to one week of drugs. Medusa is particularly suited to the development of subcutaneously administered formulations.

&#160;

The Medusa platform consists of proprietary and versatile drug carrier polymers that form hydrogel depots after injection. Medusa polymers are made of glutamic acid, a naturally occurring aminoacid, and alpha tocopherol (Vitamin E). These polymers are amphiphilic and spontaneously form stable hydrogels in water. These hydrogels contain hydrophobic nanodomains rich in Vitamin E and hydrophilic polyglutamate that are exposed to water. The hydrogels are robust over a wide range of pH values and can be stored, in particular as a stable freeze-dry form, that can be easily reconstituted in water for Injection. Those polymers have been proven to be safe and biodegradable. A comprehensive ADME and regulatory toxicology package for the key Medusa polymer was completed in 2014 in order to update the Type IV Drug Master File (&#8220;DMF&#8221;) filed with the FDA in February 2011.

&#160;

&#160; -13- &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The drug is loaded in the hydrogel (nano- or micro-gel) via non-covalent, hydrophobic and electrostatic, bonds. Once in the body, the hydrogel releases the drugs in a controlled manner with no initial burst effect, lower Cmax and uniform plasma concentration, over an extended period of time. Both drug loading (in fully aqueous solution, and usually, under solvent- and surfactant-free conditions) and release (essentially by displacement of the loaded drug by circulating endogenous proteins) are non-denaturing, which preserves structural integrity - and hence activity - of the drug. The transient, non-covalent interactions dictate the pharmacokinetic parameters (Cmax and bioavailability in particular) of the released drugs.

&#160;

Flamel is focusing on Medusa-based &#8220;biobetter&#8221; development opportunities, which can be summarized as follows:

&#160;

&#183; Proven biologic drugs with established markets and proven clinical development approaches; &#183; Product differentiation e.g. improvement of pharmacokinetic (and potentially pharmacodynamics) parameters; &#183; Protection of market position through product differentiation and/or patent extension; and, &#183; Ability to grow market share and resist price competition. &#160;

Flamel has one Medusa-based internal product in development (see &#8220;&#8211; Proprietary Product Pipeline&#8221; in this Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). Flamel completed a Phase 1(a) study of its once-a-week Medusa exenatide product in 2015 and initiated a Phase 1(b) study in Q1 2016.

&#160;

Medusa is patent protected until June 2031 in the United States (see &#8220;&#8211; Proprietary Intellectual Property&#8221; in this Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K).

&#160;

In 2014, Flamel engaged in a rationalization process of its patent portfolio to focus on key patent families that protect our core drug delivery platforms. As a result of this process, the total number of patents is significantly lower than in previous years. As of December 31, 2015, we owned the following patent and patent applications:

The Company&#8217;s granted patents protecting its drug delivery platforms have the following latest dates of expiration by technology platform:

&#160;

Drug Delivery &#160; Date of expiration of granted patents Platforms &#160; U.S. &#160; Europe Micropump &#174; &#160; July 2027 &#160; May 2030 LiquiTime &#174; &#160; September 2025 &#160; April 2023 Trigger Lock&#8482; &#160; April 2027 &#160; May 2026 Medusa&#8482; &#160; June 2031 &#160; November 2024 &#160;

Flamel&#8217;s key patents include protection for the following:

&#160;

&#183; Micropump&#174; platform is patented under multiple granted patents. Among them is Flamel&#8217;s Micropump&#174;-related key patent, WO 2003/030878, which discloses an efficacious coating formulation for providing delayed and sustained release of an active ingredient with absorption limited to the upper part of intestinal tract. It is granted in the U.S. as US Patent 8,101,209 and will expire on October 2025. It covers Coreg CR&#174; formulation and, as such, has been listed at the FDA Orange Book by our partner GSK on February 23, 2012. Equivalent patents are granted in China, Hong Kong, Israel, India, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Canada, South Africa, Mexico (expiry date: October 2022) and in France (expiry date: October 2021). Patent applications are pending in Brazil and Europe; and, would expire on October 2022. &#160;

&#183; LiquiTime&#174; platform is protected by a Flamel&#8217;s patent granted in the U.S. (US 7,906,145; expiry date: September 2025) and in South Korea, Canada, Israel, Japan, Australia, China, Austria, Belgium, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Germany, Spain, France, United Kingdom, Italy, Ireland, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden, Turkey, India, Mexico, South Africa that expire on April 2023.

Strategic Alliances

&#160;

The four partnerships left in 2013, after the rationalization of the Company&#8217;s products pipeline initiated in 2012, have, in 2014, either been terminated or transferred to Recipharm, as part the divestiture of our Pessac Facility, as follows:

&#160;

&#183; In May 2014: Effective termination of pilot (feasibility) study agreement, including an option for a license to be exercised prior engaging IND-/IMPD-enabling studies, with an undisclosed large international pharmaceutical company for the development of a Medusa&#8482;-enabled formulation of a partner&#8217;s controlled compound for cardiovascular indication (confidential); &#160;

&#183; In August 2014: Effective termination of the license and development agreement with an undisclosed specialty pharmaceutical company for the development of a Micropump-based, once-daily formulation of a central nervous system medication that is currently being marketed by that partner. Before the termination, we recognized $2.3 million in development and license fees in 2014; &#160;

&#183; In December 2014: The multi-year development partnership agreement with an undisclosed, large international pharmaceutical company was transferred to Recipharm, as part the divestiture of Pessac Facility. Before this divestiture, we received $2.0 million in development fees in 2014 classified as Discontinued Operations; and, &#160;

&#160; -15- &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; In December 2014: As part the divestiture of our development and manufacturing facility, the royalty payment under the license agreement and the supply agreement with GSK were, respectively, delegated and transferred to Recipharm. &#160;

&#183; Before the divestiture, we received royalty revenue of $6.3 million and a total amount of $6.7 million as revenues from product sales in 2014 (see &#8220;Note 17: Discontinued Operations to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). As a result of this divestiture, Flamel and Recipharm have entered into a five year services and manufacturing agreement to support the development of Flamel&#8217;s proprietary portfolio. Additionally, Recipharm has an option, for a certain period of time, to negotiate with Flamel for the European rights to product that Flamel plans to license for sale in the European market. In addition, Recipharm and Flamel have agreed to enter into a license agreement whereby Recipharm will be allowed to selectively offer Flamel&#8217;s drug delivery platforms in its CDMO business, further enhancing the economic benefits to both companies. &#160;

In 2014 about 41% of our revenues came from partnerships. Today, however, the Company&#8217;s business is financially less dependent on its need to work with partners to develop products using our drug delivery platforms. By design, we now have revenue generating marketed products and products in late stage development that are not dependent on these partnerships (see &#8220;&#8211; Lead Products&#8221; in this Part I, Item 1 and &#8220;&#8211; Other Products Under Development&#8221; in this Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K).

&#160;

Nonetheless, we are still open to entering into new partnerships, in particular, with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies providing new formulation development opportunities (especially, based on partners&#8217; proprietary or controlled therapeutic compounds), but also for certain of our proprietary products that Flamel and/or its US marketing unit, &#201;clat, will not market itself (such as the LiquiTime-based OTC products in late stage developments) and access to complementary expertise (regulatory, medical and commercial). Under such partnership agreements, our partners typically assume responsibility for all formulation development, manufacturing, polymer supply, clinical, regulatory and marketing costs and make payments to us at the time the agreement is signed and upon the achievement of significant technical, pre-clinical, clinical and regulatory milestones. We also typically are entitled to receive royalty payments on the sales of products that incorporate our drug delivery platforms.

&#160;

Manufacturing

&#160;

The manufacturing facilities for our drug delivery platforms were located in Pessac, France, near Bordeaux (hereinafter referred as &#8220;Pessac Facility&#8221;). This Pessac Facility provided us with two commercial scale production lines for the manufacture of Coreg CR &#174; microparticles, and another production line used for other Micropump, and LiquiTime/Trigger Lock-based formulations ( i.e. the production of certain pharmaceutical products, including commercial scale quantities of our intermediate formulated products). During 2014, our commercial manufacturing capacity utilization ranged from 50% to 65% of total capacity.

&#160;

On December 1, 2014, the Pessac Facility was divested to Recipharm. This divestiture agreement allows Flamel to retain access to the development and manufacturing capabilities of Pessac Facility for all its drug delivery platforms. In particular, this facility can support, like any CDMO, certain of our needs for scale-up activities and clinical batch manufacturing for our Micropump, LiquiTime and Trigger Lock platforms, as well as for the synthesis of Medusa&#8217;s polymers and technical batch manufacturing for non-clinical studies pertaining to our Medusa-based formulations. In addition, this agreement permits us to utilize other Recipharm&#8217;s manufacturing facilities for the development and/or manufacture of our proprietary pipeline if needed.

&#160;

The Pessac Facility was never used for the production of finished products commercialized by our US operations. Indeed, the manufacture of the UMDs products marketed by the Company&#8217;s US operations is outsourced to cGMP compliant and FDA-audited CDMOs in accordance with supply agreements.

&#160;

Flamel intends to continue to outsource to third party contract manufacturing companies like Recipharm when appropriate. For example, in 2014, Flamel has transferred the scale up of certain of its own proprietary products to CDMOs in the U.S. This will be beneficial to the Company for products that will ultimately be submitted and sold in the United States.

&#160;

Government Regulation

&#160;

The design, testing, manufacturing and marketing of certain new or substantially modified drugs, biological products or medical devices must be approved, cleared or certified by regulatory agencies, regulatory authorities and Notified Bodies under applicable laws and regulations, the requirements of which may vary from country to country. This regulatory process is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. In the United States, the FDA regulates such products under various federal statutes, including the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (&#8220;FDCA&#8221;) and the Public Health Service Act. Similar requirements exist in the Member States of the European Union and are imposed by the European Commission and the competent authorities of EU Member States. There can be no assurance that we or our collaborative partners will be able to obtain such regulatory approvals or clearances or certification of conformity on a timely basis, if at all, for any products under development. Delays in receipt or failure to receive such approvals, clearances, or certifications of conformity, the revocation of previously received approvals or clearances, or certifications of conformity, or failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

&#160;

&#160; -16- &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

We believe our delivery platforms, when used in conjunction with therapeutic pharmaceuticals, and development products acquired from &#201;clat, are subject to drug and biological product approval or marketing authorization requirements. In the United States and the European Union, biological products, such as therapeutic proteins and peptides, generally are subject to the same FDA and EU regulatory requirements as other drugs, although some differences exist. For example, a biologic license application (BLA) is submitted for approval for commercialization of some biological products instead of the New Drug Application (&#8220;NDA&#8221;) or Abbreviated New Drug Application (&#8220;ANDA&#8221;) used for other drugs. Also, unlike other drug products, some biological products are subject to FDA lot-by-lot release requirements and those approved under a BLA currently cannot be the subject of ANDAs. However, the FDA is working on a variety of issues pertaining to the possible development of biosimilars and there can be no assurance that this type of submission will continue to be unavailable for biological products. Additionally, our delivery platforms likely will be regulated by the FDA as &#8216;combination products&#8217; if they are used together with a biologic or medical device. In order to facilitate pre-market review of combination products, the FDA designates one of its centers to have primary jurisdiction for the pre-market review and regulation of both components. In the European Union, applications for marketing authorization of innovative drugs, which are essentially products that are neither generics nor biosimilars, are addressed on a case-by-case basis by the European Medicines Agency (&#8220;EMA&#8221;), followed by a decision of the European Commission, or by the competent authorities of the EU Member States.

&#160;

New Drug and Biological Product Development and Approval Process

&#160;

United States and European Union

&#160;

Regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries has a significant impact on the development, manufacture, and marketing of biological and drug products and on ongoing research and product development activities. The products of all of our pharmaceutical and biotechnology partners as well as our own products will require regulatory approval by governmental agencies and regulatory authorities prior to commercialization. In particular, these products are subject to manufacturing according to stringent cGMP quality principles, and rigorous, pre-clinical and clinical testing and other pre-market approval requirements by the FDA, the European Commission and regulatory authorities in other countries. In the United States and the European Union, various statutes and regulations also govern, or influence the manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, record keeping and marketing of pharmaceutical and biological products. The lengthy process of seeking these approvals, and the subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial resources.

&#160;

The FDA and European Union&#8217;s statutes, regulations, or policies may change and additional statutes or government regulations may be enacted which could prevent or delay regulatory approvals of biological or drug products. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the U.S. or abroad.

&#160;

Regulatory approval, when and if obtained, may be limited in scope. In particular, regulatory approvals will restrict the marketing of a product to specific uses. Approved biological and other drugs, as well as their manufacturers, are subject to ongoing review (including requirements and restrictions related to record keeping and reporting, FDA, European Commission and EU Member States competent authorities&#8217; approval of certain changes in manufacturing processes or product labeling, product promotion and advertising, and pharmacovigilance, which includes monitoring and reporting adverse reactions, maintaining safety measures, and conducting dossier reviews for marketing authorization renewal). Discovery of previously unknown problems with these products may result in restrictions on their manufacture, sale or use, or in their withdrawal from the market. Failure to comply with regulatory requirements may result in criminal prosecution, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production or injunction, as well as other actions affecting the commercial prospects of our pharmaceutical and biotechnology partners&#8217; potential products or uses or products that incorporate our technologies. Any failure by our pharmaceutical and biotechnology partners to comply with current or new and changing regulatory obligations, and any failure to obtain and maintain, or any delay in obtaining, regulatory approvals, could materially adversely affect our business.

&#160;

The process for new drug and biological product development and approval has many steps, including:

&#160;

Chemical and Formulation Development

&#160;

Pharmaceutical formulation taking into account the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug or biological substance is the beginning of a new product. If initial laboratory experiments reveal that the concept for a new drug or biological product looks promising, then a variety of further development steps and tests complying with internationally recognized guidance documents will have to be continued, in order to provide for a product ready for testing in animals and, after sufficient animal test results, also in humans.

&#160;

Concurrent with pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, companies must continue to develop information about the properties of the drug product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product, and the manufacturer must develop and validate methods for testing the quality, purity and potency of the final products. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf-life.

&#160;

Pre-Clinical Testing

&#160;

Once a biological or drug candidate is identified for development, the candidate enters the pre-clinical testing stage. This includes laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as animal studies of pharmacology (mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics) and toxicology which may have to be conducted over lengthy periods of time, to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product as formulated. Pre-clinical tests must be conducted in compliance with good laboratory practice regulations, the Animal Welfare Act and its regulations in the US and the Clinical Trials Directive and related national laws and guidelines in the EU Member States. Violations of these laws and regulations can, in some cases, lead to invalidation of the studies, then requiring such studies to be replicated. In some cases, long-term pre-clinical studies are conducted while clinical studies are ongoing.

&#160;

&#160; -17- &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Investigational New Drug Application

&#160; 

USA: The entire body of chemical or biochemical, pharmaceutical and pre-clinical development work necessary to administer investigational drugs to human volunteers or patients is summarized in an Investigational New Drug (&#8220;IND&#8221;) application to the FDA. The IND becomes effective if not rejected by the FDA within thirty (30) days after filing. There is no assurance that the submission of an IND will eventually allow a company to commence clinical trials. All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of a qualified investigator in accordance with good clinical practice regulations to ensure the quality and integrity of clinical trial results and data. These regulations include the requirement that, with limited exceptions, all subjects provide informed consent. In addition, an institutional review board (&#8220;IRB&#8221;), composed primarily of physicians and other qualified experts at the hospital or clinic where the proposed studies will be conducted, must review and approve each human study. The IRB also continues to monitor the study and must be kept aware of the study&#8217;s progress, particularly as to adverse events and changes in the research. Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if adverse events occur. Failure to adhere to good clinical practices and the protocols, and failure to obtain IRB approval and informed consent, may result in FDA rejection of clinical trial results and data, and may delay or prevent the FDA from approving the drug for commercial use.

&#160; 

European Union : The European equivalent to the IND is the Investigational Medicinal Product Dossier (&#8220;IMPD&#8221;) which likewise must contain pharmaceutical, pre-clinical and, if existing, previous clinical information on the drug substance and product. An overall risk-benefit assessment critically analyzing the non-clinical and clinical data in relation to the potential risks and benefits of the proposed trial must also be included. The intended clinical trial must be submitted for authorization by the regulatory authority(ies) of each EU Member States in which the trial is intended to be conducted prior to its commencement. The trial must be conducted on the basis of the protocol as approved by an Ethics Committee(s) in each EU Member State (EU equivalent to IRBs) before the trial commences. Before submitting an application to the competent authority, the sponsor must register the trial in the EudraCT database where it will be provided with a unique EudraCT number.

&#160;

Clinical Trials

&#160;

Typically, clinical testing involves the administration of the drug or biological product first to healthy human volunteers and then to patients with conditions needing treatment under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator, usually a physician, pursuant to a &#8216;protocol&#8217; or clinical plan reviewed by the FDA and the competent authorities of the EU Member States along with the IRB or Ethics Committee (via the IND or IMPD submission). The protocol details matters such as a description of the condition to be treated, the objectives of the study, a description of the patient population eligible for the study and the parameters to be used to monitor safety and efficacy.

&#160;

Clinical trials are time-consuming and costly, and typically are conducted in three sequential phases, which sometimes may overlap. Phase I trials consist of testing the product in a small number of patients or normal volunteers, primarily for safety, in one or more dosages, as well as characterization of a drug&#8217;s pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic profile. In Phase II, in addition to safety, the product is studied in a patient population to evaluate the product&#8217;s efficacy for the specific, targeted indications and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. Phase III trials typically involve additional testing for safety and clinical efficacy in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed sites. With limited exceptions, all patients involved in a clinical trial must provide informed consent prior to their participation. Meeting clinical endpoints in early stage clinical trials does not assure success in later stage clinical trials. Phase I, II, and III testing may not be completed successfully within any specified time period, if at all.

&#160;

The FDA and the competent authorities of EU Member States monitor the progress of each clinical trial phase conducted under an IND or IMPD and may, at their discretion, reevaluate, alter, suspend or terminate clinical trials at any point in this process for various reasons, including a finding that patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or a determination that it is unethical to continue the study. The FDA, the European Commission and the competent authorities of EU Member States can also request that additional clinical trials be conducted as a condition to product approval. The IRB, the Ethics Committee, and sponsor also may order the temporary or permanent discontinuance of a clinical trial at any time for a variety of reasons, particularly if safety concerns arise. Such holds can cause substantial delay and in some cases may require abandonment of product development. These clinical studies must be conducted in conformance with the FDA&#8217;s bioresearch monitoring regulations, the Clinical Trials Directive and/or internationally recognized guidance (such as &#8220;ICH&#8221;, or &#8220;International Conference on Harmonization&#8221;).

&#160;

New Drug Application or Biological License Application

&#160;

After the completion of the clinical trial phases of development, if the sponsor concludes that there is substantial evidence that the drug or biological candidate is effective and that the drug is safe for its intended use, an NDA or &#8220;BLA&#8221; (&#8220;Biological License Application&#8221;) may be submitted to the FDA. The application must contain all of the information on the drug or biological candidate gathered to that date, including data from the pre-clinical and clinical trials, information pertaining to the preparation of the drug or biologic, analytical methods, product formulation, details on the manufacture of finished products, proposed product packaging, labeling and stability (shelf-life). NDAs and BLAs are often over 100,000 pages in length. If FDA determines that a Risk Evaluation And Mitigation Strategy (&#8220;REMS&#8221;) is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks, a sponsor may be required to include as part of the application a proposed REMS, including a package insert directed to patients, a plan for communication with healthcare providers, restrictions on a drug&#8217;s distribution, or a medication guide to provide better information to consumers about the drug&#8217;s risks and benefits. Submission of an NDA or BLA does not assure FDA approval for marketing.

&#160;

&#160; -18- &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The FDA reviews all submitted NDAs and BLAs before it accepts them for filing (the U.S. prerequisite for dossier review). It may refuse to file the application and request additional information rather than accepting an application for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA or BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use. As part of this review, the FDA may refer the application to an appropriate advisory committee, typically a panel of clinicians, for review, evaluation and a recommendation. There is a strong presumption for advisory committee review for any drug containing an active ingredient not previously approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (&#8220;PDUFA&#8221;), submission of an NDA or BLA with clinical data requires payment of a fee. In return, the FDA assigns an action date of 10 months from acceptance of the application to return of a first &#8216;complete response,&#8217; in which the FDA may approve the product or request additional information. (Although PDUFA also provides for a six-month &#8220;priority review&#8221; process, we do not anticipate it applying to any of our products or our partners&#8217; products.) There can be no assurance that an application will be approved within the performance goal timeframe established under PDUFA, if at all. If the FDA&#8217;s evaluation of the NDA or BLA is not favorable, the FDA usually will outline the deficiencies in the submission and request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, or even in lieu of asking for additional information, the FDA may decide that the marketing application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval and issue a complete response letter, communicating the agency&#8217;s decision not to approve the application.

&#160;

FDA approval of an NDA or BLA will be based, among other factors, on the agency&#8217;s review of the pre-clinical and clinical data submitted, a risk/benefit analysis of the product, and an evaluation of the manufacturing processes and facilities. Data obtained from clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA has substantial discretion in the approval process and may disagree with an applicant&#8217;s interpretation of the data submitted in its NDA or BLA. For instance, FDA may require us to provide data from additional preclinical studies or clinical trials to support approval of certain development products acquired from &#201;clat. Among the conditions for NDA or BLA approval is the requirement that each prospective manufacturer&#8217;s quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMP standards and requirements. Manufacturing establishments often are subject to inspections prior to NDA or BLA approval to assure compliance with cGMPs and with manufacturing commitments made in the relevant marketing application.

&#160;

Patent Restoration and Exclusivity

&#160;

The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, establishes two abbreviated approval pathways for drug products that are in some way follow-on versions of already approved products.

&#160; 

Generic Drugs . A generic version of an approved drug is approved by means of an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, by which the sponsor demonstrates that the proposed product is the same as the approved, brand-name drug, which is referred to as the &#8220;Reference Listed Drug,&#8221; or &#8220;RLD&#8221;. Generally, an ANDA must contain data and information showing that the proposed generic product and RLD (1) have the same active ingredient, in the same strength and dosage form, to be delivered via the same route of administration, (2) are intended for the same uses, and (3) are bioequivalent. This is instead of independently demonstrating the proposed product&#8217;s safety and effectiveness, which are inferred from the fact that the product is the same as the RLD, which the FDA previously found to be safe and effective.

&#160; 

505(b)(2) NDAs . If a product is similar, but not identical, to an already approved product, it may be submitted for approval via an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the Act. Unlike an ANDA, this does not excuse the sponsor from demonstrating the proposed product&#8217;s safety and effectiveness. Rather, the sponsor is permitted to rely to some degree on published scientific literature and the FDA&#8217;s finding that the RLD is safe and effective, and must submit its own data of safety and effectiveness to an extent necessary because of the differences between the products. With regard to certain UMD products, we intend to submit 505(b)(2) NDAs, relying solely on published scientific literature. We do not plan to conduct additional preclinical studies or clinical trials for these 505(b)(2) NDAs; and, if we were required to do so, would review the continued value of the product.

&#160; 

RLD Patents . An NDA sponsor must advise the FDA about patents that claim the drug substance or drug product or a method of using the drug. When the drug is approved, those patents are among the information about the product that is listed in the FDA publication, Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, which is referred to as the Orange Book. The sponsor of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application seeking to rely on an approved product as the RLD must make one of several certifications regarding each listed patent. A &#8220;Paragraph III&#8221; certification is the sponsor&#8217;s statement that it will wait for the patent to expire before obtaining approval for its product. A &#8220;Paragraph IV&#8221; certification is a challenge to the patent; it is an assertion that the patent does not block approval of the later product, either because the patent is invalid or unenforceable or because the patent, even if valid, is not infringed by the new product.

&#160;

Once the FDA accepts for filing an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application containing a Paragraph IV certification, the applicant must within 20 days provide notice to the RLD NDA holder and patent owner that the application with patent challenge has been submitted, and provide the factual and legal basis for the applicant&#8217;s assertion that the patent is invalid or not infringed. If the NDA holder or patent owner file suit against the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant for patent infringement within 45 days of receiving the Paragraph IV notice, FDA is prohibited from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for a period of 30 months from the date of receipt of the notice. If the RLD has NCE exclusivity and the notice is given and suit filed during the fifth year of exclusivity, the 30-month stay does not begin until five years after the RLD approval. The FDA may approve the proposed product before the expiration of the 30-month stay if a court finds the patent invalid or not infringed or if the court shortens the period because the parties have failed to cooperate in expediting the litigation.

&#160; 

&#160; -19- &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Regulatory Exclusivities . The Hatch-Waxman Act may provide periods of regulatory exclusivity for products that would serve as RLDs. If a product is a &#8220;new chemical entity,&#8221; or NCE, &#8211; generally meaning that the active moiety has never before been approved in any drug &#8211; there may be a period of five years from the product&#8217;s approval during which the FDA may not accept for filing any ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for a drug with the same active moiety. An ANDA or 505(b)(2) application may be submitted after four years, however, if the sponsor makes a Paragraph IV certification challenging a listed patent. Because it takes time for the FDA to review and approve an application once it has been accepted for filing, five-year NCE exclusivity usually effectively means the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application is not approved for a period well beyond five years from approval of the RLD.

&#160;

A product that is not an NCE may qualify for a three-year period of exclusivity, if the NDA contains clinical data that were necessary for approval. In that instance, the exclusivity period does not preclude filing or review of the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application; rather, the FDA is precluded from granting final approval to the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until three years after approval of the RLD. Additionally, the exclusivity applies only to the conditions of approval that required submission of the clinical data. For example, if an NDA is submitted for a product that is not an NCE, but that seeks approval for a new indication, and clinical data were required to demonstrate the safety or effectiveness of the product for that use, the FDA could not approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for another product with that active moiety for that use. For example, Coreg CR received three-year exclusivity for the clinical trials that demonstrated the safety and efficacy of the new, controlled-release dosage form; that exclusivity, which has expired, blocked other controlled-release products.

&#160;

Patent Term Restoration. Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, a portion of the patent term lost during product development and FDA review of an NDA or 505(b)(2) application is restored if approval of the application is the first permitted commercial marketing of a drug containing the active ingredient. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of the IND and the date of submission of the NDA, plus the time between the date of submission of the NDA and the date of FDA approval of the product. The maximum period of restoration is five years, and the patent cannot be extended to more than 14 years from the date of FDA approval of the product. Only one patent claiming each approved product is eligible for restoration and the patent holder must apply for restoration within 60 days of approval. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, or PTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for patent term restoration. When any of our products is approved, we intend to seek patent term restoration for an applicable patent when it is appropriate.

&#160;

Other Countries

&#160;

Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a pharmaceutical product by regulatory authorities must be obtained in any other country prior to the commencement of marketing of the product in that country. The approval procedure may vary from country to country, can involve additional testing, and the time required may differ from that required for FDA approval. Under European Union legislation, product authorization is granted for an initial period of five years. The authorization may subsequently be renewed for an unlimited period on the basis of a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the competent authorizing authority. In the EU, marketing authorization of drugs is according to either a centralized, decentralized or mutual recognition procedure, generally depending on the nature and type of drug. Certain designated drugs may be authorized only in accordance with the centralized procedure by the European Commission following an opinion by the European Medicines Agency (&#8220;EMA&#8221;). The centralized procedure is mandatory for pharmaceutical products developed by means of biotechnological processes (recombinant DNA, controlled expression of genes coding, hybridoma and monoclonal antibody methods), products containing new actives substances indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, diabetes and neuro-degenerative diseases, orphan designated medicinal products and advanced therapy products. Other pharmaceutical products may be authorized in accordance with the centralized procedure where it is demonstrated that they contain new active substances or are demonstrated to have a significant therapeutic benefit, or where they constitute a scientific or technical innovation, or are in the interest of patients at Community level. Where authorization is in accordance with the decentralized or mutual recognition procedures, approval is either by &#8220;mutual recognition,&#8221; whereby the authorization granted by the competent authorities of one EU Member States are recognized by the authorities of other EU Member States, or where the competent authorities of each EU Member State authorize a product on the basis of an identical dossier, with one national authority taking care of the dossier intensively and coordinating activities. To the extent possible, clinical trials of our products are designed to develop a regulatory package sufficient for the grant of marketing authorization in the EU approval according to the Community Code on medicinal products.

&#160;

Regulatory approval of prices for certain drugs is required in France and in many other countries outside the United States. In particular, many EU Member States make the reimbursement of a product within the national social security system conditional on the agreement by the seller not to sell the product above a fixed price in that country. Also common is the unilateral establishment of a reimbursement price by the national authorities, often accompanied by the inclusion of the product on a list of reimbursable products. Related pricing discussions and ultimate governmental approvals can take several months to years. Some countries require periodic pricing updates and renewals at intervals ranging from two to five years. Some countries also impose price freezes or obligatory price reductions. We cannot assure you that, if regulatory authorities establish lower prices for any product incorporating our technology in any one EU Member State, this will not have the practical effect of requiring our collaborative partner correspondingly to reduce its prices in other EU Member States. We can offer no assurance that the resulting prices would be sufficient to generate an acceptable return on our investment in our products.

Regulation of Combination Drugs

&#160;

Medical products containing a combination of drugs or biological products may be regulated as &#8216;combination products&#8217; in the United States. A combination product generally is defined as a product comprising components from two or more regulatory categories ( e.g. , drug/device, device/biologic, drug/biologic). Each component of a combination product is subject to the requirements established by the FDA for that type of component, whether a drug, biologic or device.

&#160;

To determine which FDA center or centers will review a combination product submission, companies may submit a request for assignment to the FDA. Those requests may be handled formally or informally. In some cases, jurisdiction may be determined informally based on FDA experience with similar products. However, informal jurisdictional determinations are not binding on the FDA. Companies also may submit a formal Request for Designation to the FDA Office of Combination Products. The Office of Combination Products will review the request and make its jurisdictional determination within 60 days of receiving a Request for Designation.

&#160;

In order to facilitate pre-market review of combination products, the FDA designates one of its centers to have primary jurisdiction for the pre-market review and regulation of both components. The determination whether a product is a combination product or two separate products is made by the FDA on a case-by-case basis. It is possible that our delivery platforms, when coupled with a drug, biologic or medical device component, could be considered and regulated by the FDA as a combination product.

&#160;

If the primary mode of action is determined to be a drug, the product will be reviewed by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (&#8220;CDER&#8221;) either in consultation with another center or independently. If the primary mode of action is determined to be a medical device, the product would be reviewed by Center for Devices and Radiological Health (&#8220;CDRH&#8221;) either in consultation with another center, such as CDER, or independently. In addition, FDA could determine that the product is a biologic and subject to the jurisdiction of the Center for Biologic Evaluation and Research (&#8220;CBER&#8221;), although it is also possible that a biological product will be regulated by CDER.

&#160;

In the European Union, drug combinations, that is, drug products containing two or more drug substances each of which has to contribute a proven advantage of therapy ( e.g. , synergism, less adverse reactions), are subject to drug regulations like all others. Products combining drug substances or drugs with a device may be subject to device and/or drug regulations, or may be classified as medical devices, depending on the individual case.

&#160;

Marketing Approval and Reporting Requirements

&#160;

If the FDA approves an NDA or BLA, the product becomes available for physicians to prescribe. The FDA may require post-marketing studies, also known as Phase IV studies, as a condition of approval to develop additional information regarding the safety of a product. These studies may involve continued testing of a product and development of data, including clinical data, about the product&#8217;s effects in various populations and any side effects associated with long-term use. After approval, the FDA may require post-marketing studies or clinical trials, as well as periodic status reports, if new safety information develops. These post-marketing studies may include clinical trials to investigate known serious risks or signals of serious risks or identify unexpected serious risks. Failure to conduct these studies in a timely manner may result in substantial civil fines and can result in withdrawal of approval.

&#160;

In addition, the FDA may require distribution to patients of a medication guide such as a REMS for prescription products that the agency determines pose a serious and significant health concern in order to provide information necessary to patients&#8217; safe and effective use of such products.

&#160;

In the European Union, the marketing authorization of a medicinal product may be made conditional on the conduct of Phase IV post-marketing studies. Failure to conduct these studies in relation to centrally authorized products can lead to the imposition of substantial fines. Moreover, Phase IV studies are often conducted by companies in order to obtain further information on product efficacy and positioning on the market in view of competitors and to assist in application for pricing and reimbursement.

&#160;

Post-Marketing Obligations

&#160;

Any products manufactured and/or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including recordkeeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, submitting other periodic reports, drug sampling and distribution requirements, notifying the FDA and gaining its approval of certain manufacturing or labeling changes, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements, submitting periodic reports to the FDA, maintaining and providing updated safety and efficacy information to the FDA, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. For example, with respect to the &#201;clat product Vazculep, the FDA has required the Company to conduct post-marketing clinical and non-clinical studies to be completed between 2016 and 2019.

&#160;

Drug and biologics manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and to list their products with the FDA. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities in the United States and abroad in order to assure compliance with the applicable cGMP regulations and other requirements. Facilities also are subject to inspections by other federal, foreign, state or local agencies. In complying with the cGMP regulations, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in recordkeeping and quality control to assure that the product meets applicable specifications and other post-marketing requirements. Failure of the Company or our licensees to comply with FDA&#8217;s cGMP regulations or other requirements could have a significant adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition and results of operations.

&#160;

&#160; -21- &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Also, newly discovered or developed safety or efficacy data may require changes to a product&#8217;s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, additional pre-clinical or clinical studies, or even in some instances, revocation or withdrawal of the approval. Violations of regulatory requirements at any stage, including after approval, may result in various adverse consequences, including the FDA&#8217;s delay in approving or refusal to approve a product, withdrawal or recall of an approved product from the market, other voluntary or FDA-initiated action that could delay or restrict further marketing, and the imposition of civil fines and criminal penalties against the manufacturer and NDA or BLA holder. In addition, later discovery of previously unknown problems may result in restrictions on the product, manufacturer or NDA or BLA holder, including withdrawal of the product from the market. Furthermore, new government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development, or affect the conditions under which approved products are marketed.

&#160;

The Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 provides the FDA with expanded authority over drug products after approval. This legislation enhances the FDA&#8217;s authority with respect to post-marketing safety surveillance, including, among other things, the authority to require additional post-marketing studies or clinical trials, labeling changes as a result of safety findings, registering clinical trials, and making clinical trial results publicly available.

&#160;

In the European Union, stringent pharmacovigilance regulations oblige companies to appoint a suitably qualified and experienced Qualified Person resident in the European Economic Area, to prepare and submit to the competent authorities adverse event reports within specific time lines, prepare Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSURs) and provide other supplementary information, report to authorities at regular intervals and take adequate safety measures agreed with regulatory agencies as necessary. Failure to undertake these obligations can lead to the imposition of substantial fines.

&#160;

Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009

&#160;

The Hatch-Waxman construct applies only to conventional chemical drug compounds, sometimes referred to as small molecule compounds approved under an NDA. On March 23, 2010, however, the &#8220;Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act&#8221; of 2009, or &#8220;BPCIA&#8221;, was signed into law. It creates an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are &#8220;biosimilar&#8221; to a previously approved biological product, which is called the &#8220;reference product.&#8221; This abbreviated approval pathway is intended to permit a biosimilar product to come to market more quickly and less expensively than if a &#8220;full&#8221; BLA were submitted, by relying to some extent on FDA&#8217;s previous review and approval of the reference product to which the proposed product is similar. If a proposed biosimilar product meets the statutory standards for approval (which include demonstrating that it is highly similar to the reference product and there are no clinically meaningful differences in safety, purity or potency between the products), the proposed biosimilar may be approved on the basis of an application that is different than the standard BLA. In addition, a biosimilar product may be approved as interchangeable with the reference product if the proposed product application meets standards intended to ensure that the biosimilar product can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product.

&#160;

Other Regulation

&#160; 

Controlled Substances Act . Our Trigger Lock delivery platform is designed to control the release of narcotics and other active ingredients subject to abuse. Narcotics are &#8220;controlled substances&#8221; under the Controlled Substances Act. The federal &#8220;Controlled Substances Act&#8221; (&#8220;CSA&#8221;), Title II of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, regulates the manufacture and distribution of narcotics and other controlled substances, including stimulants, depressants and hallucinogens. The CSA is administered by the &#8220;Drug Enforcement Administration&#8221; (&#8220;DEA&#8221;), a division of the U.S. Department of Justice, and is intended to prevent the abuse or diversion of controlled substances into illicit channels of commerce.

&#160;

Any person or firm that manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports, or exports any controlled substance (or proposes to do so) must register with the DEA. The applicant must register for a specific business activity related to controlled substances, including manufacturing or distributing, and may engage in only the activity or activities for which it is registered. The DEA conducts periodic inspections of registered establishments that handle controlled substances and allots quotas of controlled drugs to manufacturers and marketers&#8217; failure to comply with relevant DEA regulations, particularly as manifested in the loss or diversion of controlled substances, can result in regulatory action including civil penalties, refusal to renew necessary registrations, or proceedings to revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations can lead to criminal prosecution. In addition to these federal statutory and regulatory obligations, there may be state and local laws and regulations relevant to the handling of controlled substances or listed chemicals.

&#160; 

cGMP. Current Good Manufacturing Practices rules apply to the manufacturing of drugs and medical devices. Our manufacturing facilities and laboratories are subject to inspection and regulation by French regulatory authorities in accordance with applicable EU provisions governing cGMP and may also be subject to the United States&#8217; and other countries&#8217; regulatory agencies. Mutual recognition agreements for government inspections exist between the United States, the EU, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.

&#160;

In addition to regulations enforced by the FDA, we are also subject to French, U.S. and other countries&#8217; rules and regulations governing permissible laboratory activities, waste disposal, handling of toxic, dangerous or radioactive materials and other matters. Our R&#38;D involves the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals, viruses and various radioactive compounds. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by French, EU, U.S. and other foreign rules and regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated.

&#160; 

&#160; -22- &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Health Care Fraud and Abuse. We are subject to a number of federal and state laws pertaining to health care &#8220;fraud and abuse,&#8221; such as anti-kickback and false claims laws. Under anti-kickback laws, it is illegal for a prescription drug manufacturer to solicit, offer, receive, or pay any remuneration in exchange for, or to induce, the referral of business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug. Due to the breadth of the statutory provisions and the absence of guidance via regulations and that there are few court decisions addressing industry practices, it is possible that our practices might be challenged under anti-kickback or similar laws. False claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented for payment to third-party payors (such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs) claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Our sales and marketing activities relating to our products could be subject to scrutiny under these laws. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, the possibility of exclusion from federal health care programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) and corporate integrity agreements, which impose, among other things, rigorous operational and monitoring requirements on companies. In addition, similar sanctions and penalties can be imposed upon executive officers and employees, including criminal sanctions against executive officers. As a result of the potential penalties that can be imposed on companies and individuals if convicted, allegations of such violations often result in settlements even if the company or individual being investigated admits no wrongdoing. Settlements often include significant civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, and corporate integrity agreements. If the government were to allege or convict us or our executive officers of violating these laws, our business could be harmed. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring similar actions. In addition to the reasons noted above, our activities could be subject to challenge due to the broad scope of these laws and the increasing attention being given to them by law enforcement authorities. There also are an increasing number of federal and state laws that require manufacturers to make reports to states on pricing, marketing information, and payments and other transfers of value to healthcare providers. Many of these laws contain ambiguities as to what is required to comply with the laws. Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent authorities.

&#160;

Healthcare Reimbursement

&#160;

In both U.S. and foreign markets, sales of our potential products as well as products of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that incorporate our technology into their products, if any, will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement by third-party payers, such as government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. The U.S. market for pharmaceutical products is increasingly being shaped by managed care organizations, pharmacy benefit managers, cooperative buying organizations and large drugstore chains. Third-party payers are challenging the price and cost effectiveness of medical products and services. Uncertainty particularly exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. There can be no assurance reimbursement will be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our product development investment. Legislation and regulations affecting the pricing of pharmaceuticals may change before our proposed products are approved for marketing and any such changes could further limit reimbursement for medical products and services.

&#160;
