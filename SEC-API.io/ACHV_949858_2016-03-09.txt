BUSINESS 

OVERVIEW OF OUR BUSINESS 

We are an emerging leader in next generation cancer therapeutics. Our mission is to accelerate transformative therapies to improve the lives of people living with cancer and other serious diseases. We have developed a pipeline of late-stage product candidates that are designed to block the production of specific proteins that promote treatment resistance in cancer. We believe our therapies have the potential to redefine treatment outcomes in a variety of cancers. We have three product candidates in our pipeline: custirsen, apatorsen and OGX-225, each of which has a distinct mechanism of action and represents a unique opportunity for cancer drug development. Of the product candidates in our pipeline, custirsen and apatorsen are clinical-stage assets being evaluated in two phase 3 studies and four phase 2 studies, respectively. 

Product Candidates Overview and Recent Developments 

Our product candidates&#8212;custirsen, apatorsen and OGX-225&#8212;focus on mechanisms of treatment resistance in cancer patients and are designed to block the production of specific proteins that we believe promote treatment resistance and survival of tumor cells and are over-produced in response to a variety of cancer treatments. Our aim in targeting these particular proteins is to disable the tumor cell&#8217;s adaptive defenses, thereby rendering the tumor cells more susceptible to attack with a variety of cancer therapies. We believe this approach will increase survival time and improve the quality of life for cancer patients. 

Custirsen 

Custirsen is currently being evaluated in two phase 3 trials; one in patients with prostate cancer and one in patients with non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC. Custirsen is designed to inhibit the production of clusterin, a protein we believe promotes survival of cancer cells when overexpressed in a variety of tumors. We and collaborating investigators have conducted one phase 3 clinical trial and five phase 2 clinical trials to evaluate the ability of custirsen to enhance the effects of therapy in prostate, non-small cell lung and breast cancers. Results have been presented for each of these trials. Refer to the discussion below under the headings &#8220;Our Product Candidates&#8212;Custirsen&#8212;Current Custirsen Development Activities&#8221; and &#8220;Our Product Candidates&#8212;Custirsen&#8212;Summary of Results of Custirsen Clinical Trials&#8221; for further details.

Apatorsen 

Apatorsen is our product candidate designed to inhibit production of heat shock protein 27, or Hsp27, a cell-survival protein expressed in many types of cancers including bladder, non-small cell lung, pancreatic, prostate and breast cancers. Hsp27 expression is stress-induced, including by many anti-cancer therapies. Overexpression of Hsp27 is thought to be an important factor leading to the development of treatment resistance and is associated with metastasis and negative clinical outcomes in patients with various tumor types.

Hsp27 can also function as an immunomodulatory protein by a number of mechanisms that include altering important membrane expressed proteins on monocytes and immature dendritic cells; this alteration results in tumor-associated immune cells that are not functional in identifying and killing cancer cells. The induction of anti-inflammatory cytokines by Hsp27 may also play a role in down-regulating lymphocyte activation leading to additional unresponsive immune cells. 

We and collaborating investigators have conducted, or are in the process of conducting, two phase 1 and seven randomized phase 2 clinical trials that have been designed to evaluate the ability of apatorsen to enhance various treatments in patients with bladder, lung, pancreatic and prostate cancers. Final results have been presented for the first completed phase 1 trial evaluating various cancers. Final results have been presented for two trials (phase 1 and phase 2) in bladder cancer and initial results for one phase 2 trial in prostate cancer and one phase 2 trial in pancreatic cancer. Refer to the discussion below under the headings &#8220;Our Product Candidates&#8212;Apatorsen&#8212;Current Apatorsen Development Activities&#8221; and &#8220;Our Product Candidates&#8212;Apatorsen&#8212;Summary of Results of Apatorsen Clinical Trials&#8221; for further details. 

In 2013, we initiated the ORCA (Ongoing Studies Evaluating Treatment Resistance in CAncer) program, which encompasses clinical studies designed to evaluate whether inhibition of Hsp27 can lead to improved prognosis and treatment outcomes for cancer patients. Our goal is to advance cancer treatment by conducting clinical trials for apatorsen across multiple cancer indications including bladder, lung, pancreatic and prostate cancers. We are conducting parallel clinical trials to evaluate apatorsen in several cancer indications and treatment combinations to accelerate the development of apatorsen. As part of this strategy, we are supporting specific investigator-sponsored trials to allow assessment of a broader range of clinical indications for future OncoGenex-sponsored trials and possible market approval. The ORCA trials, with exception of the Pacific&#8482; trial, are designed to provide information that will be useful for designing future phase 3 trials and may be used as supportive studies for registration, if applicable. Due to small sample sizes, data from these trials are not likely to result in statistically significant differences in either progression free survival, or PFS, or survival.

In addition to the Borealis-1 and Borealis-2 clinical trials in metastatic bladder cancer in the ORCA program, we are evaluating apatorsen for the potential treatment of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, or NMIBC. We have completed a pre-Investigational New Drug meeting with FDA in preparation for a separate Investigational New Drug, or IND, application to evaluate apatorsen for intravesical administration in combination with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin, or BCG, treatment in patients with NMIBC. FDA had no objection to the study population or classification of subpopulations in the proposed study design and deemed the proposed definitions of primary and secondary endpoints acceptable. Refer to the discussion below under the headings &#8220;Our Product Candidates&#8212;Apatorsen&#8212;Current Apatorsen Development Activities&#8221; and &#8220;Our Product Candidates&#8212;Apatorsen&#8212;Summary of Planned Apatorsen Clinical Trials&#8221; for further details.

OGX-225 

OGX-225 is our product candidate designed to inhibit the production of Insulin Growth Factor Binding Proteins -2 and -5, or IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-5, two proteins that when overexpressed affect the growth of cancer cells. Increased IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-5 production are observed in many human cancers, including prostate, breast, colorectal, non-small cell lung, glioblastoma, acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, neuroblastoma, and melanoma. The increased production of these proteins is linked to faster rates of cancer progression, treatment resistance, and shorter survival duration in humans.

Preclinical studies with human prostate and breast cancer cells have shown that reducing IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-5 production with OGX-225 sensitized these tumor types to hormone ablation therapy or chemotherapy and induced tumor cell death. We have completed IND enabling toxicology studies for OGX-225. 

Financial Overview 

In 2015, we recognized $18.2 million in collaboration revenue attributable to a collaboration agreement with Teva. We have devoted substantially all of our resources to the development of our product candidates. 

We incurred a loss for the year ended December 31, 2015 of $16.8 million and had an accumulated deficit at December 31, 2015 of $176.8 million and $58.2 million of total assets. We expect to continue to incur additional losses in the future as we continue our research and development activities. 

To date, we have funded our operations primarily through private and public placements of equity securities as well as upfront payments and custirsen expense reimbursements received from the collaboration agreement with Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., or Teva, which was terminated in April 2015. Pursuant to the Termination Agreement, Teva paid to us, as advanced reimbursement 

for certain continuing research and development activities rel ated to custirsen, an amount equal to $27.0 million less approximately $3.8 million, which reduction represented a hold-back amount of $3.0 million and $0.8 million for certain third-party expenses incurred by Teva between January 1, 2015 and April 24, 201 5. We are responsible for all custirsen-related expenses incurred from and after January 1, 2015. 

Based on our current expectations, we believe that our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments will be sufficient to fund our currently planned operations into the third quarter of 2017 . Depending on timing of enrollment or event-driven final analyses, the expected key milestones and activities are as follows: &#160;

OUR PRODUCT CANDIDATES 

We have two clinical-stage product candidates, custirsen in phase 3 and apatorsen in phase 2, and one preclinical-stage product candidate, OGX-225. 

Custirsen 

Overview of Custirsen 

Through our clinical trials, we are treating cancer patients with custirsen with the goal of reducing clusterin production. Clusterin is a protein that is over-produced in several types of cancer and in response to many cancer treatments, including hormone ablation therapy, chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Preclinical and other data suggest that clusterin promotes tumor cell survival. Increased clusterin production has been linked to faster rates of cancer progression, treatment resistance and shorter survival duration. Since increased clusterin production is observed in many human cancers, including prostate, non-small cell lung, breast, ovarian, bladder, renal, pancreatic, colon, anaplastic large cell lymphoma and melanoma, we believe that custirsen may have broad market potential to treat many cancer indications and disease stages. 

A broad range of preclinical studies have shown that reducing clusterin production with custirsen: (i) facilitates tumor cell death by sensitizing human prostate, non-small cell lung, breast, ovarian, bladder, renal and melanoma tumor cells to various chemotherapies; and (ii) sensitizes prostate tumor cells to hormone ablation therapy and sensitizes prostate and non-small cell lung tumor cells to radiation therapy. Preclinical studies also indicate that reducing clusterin production with custirsen re-sensitizes docetaxel-resistant prostate tumor cells to docetaxel. 

Our phase 1 clinical trials evaluated the safety of custirsen and established a recommended dose of custirsen in combination with docetaxel (assessed two different docetaxel schedules), a gemcitabine and a platinum chemotherapy regimen and hormone ablation therapy. Docetaxel, mitoxantrone , cabazitaxel, gemcitabine and platinums (cisplatin and carboplatin) are all examples of chemotherapy agents. Clinical data from our phase 1 trial in prostate cancer patients demonstrated that weekly intravenous administration of custirsen resulted in drug distribution to prostate cancer tissue and over 92% inhibition of its target, clusterin mRNA, in prostate tumor cells in these patients at the 640mg dose, which was the highest dose evaluated in this clinical trial. This dose was determined by the clinical investigators to be well tolerated and therefore was established as the recommended dose. 

We have conducted five phase 2 clinical trials and one phase 3 trial to evaluate the ability of custirsen to enhance the effects of therapy in patients with prostate, non-small cell lung and breast cancer. Data from eac h of the trials demonstrates that adding custirsen to therapy shows potential benefits, including: 

&#160;

&#183; 

longer survival duration for patients with worse poor prognostic factors when custirsen was added to first-line docetaxel compared to first-line docetaxel alone in patients with metastatic CRPC (randomized phase 3 trial); 

&#160;

&#183; 

longer survival duration when custirsen was added to first-line docetaxel compared to first-line docetaxel alone in patients with CRPC (randomized phase 2 trial); 

&#160;

&#183; 

longer survival duration when custirsen was added to either mitoxantrone or docetaxel as second-line chemotherapy compared to survival duration observed in two prior published trials of CRPC patients receiving second-line chemotherapy and comparable survival compared to results observed with cabazitaxel; 

&#160;

&#183; 

decreased on-treatment serum clusterin levels compared to baseline levels of the patient population; analysis of study data found that lower serum clusterin levels during treatment were predictive of survival; 

&#160;

&#183; 

increased frequency of pain palliation when compared to results with either mitoxantrone or cabazitaxel second-line chemotherapy in the phase 3 TROPIC trial, and increased frequency and duration of pain palliation when custirsen was added to either mitoxantrone or docetaxel as second-line chemotherapy when compared to the frequency and duration of pain palliation observed in the TAX 327 Study for first-line chemotherapy alone in patients with CRPC; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

longer survival duration when custirsen was added to gemcitabine and a platinum-containing chemotherapy compared to the survival duration reported in prior published results from randomized clinical trials in NSCLC patients receiving gemcitabine and a platinum-containing chemotherapy. 

Refer to the discussion below under the heading &#8220;Summary of Results of Custirsen Clinical Trials&#8221; for further details including safety summary. 

The U.S. Adopted Name for the custirsen drug product is custirsen sodium, which is the generic name. 

Current Custirsen Development Activities 

The following clinical trials are currently ongoing: 

&#160;

&#183; 

The AFFINITY Trial: The phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate a survival benefit for custirsen in combination with cabazitaxel treatment as second-line chemotherapy in patients with CRPC. AFFINITY was initiated in August 2012 and completed enrollment of approximately 630 patients in September 2014. In January 2015, an interim futility analysis was completed and per recommendation of an Independent Data Monitoring Committee, or IDMC, the trial continued as planned. 

Exploratory analyses from the phase 3 SYNERGY trial showed a significant survival benefit in men who received custirsen and who were at increased risk for poor outcomes. Men with an increased risk for poor outcomes are identified as having two or more of five common features: poor performance status, elevated prostate specific antigen, or PSA, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, or LDH, decreased hemoglobin, and the presence of liver metastasis. 

Based on these findings, we sought advice from regulatory authorities to amend the AFFINITY trial to include these learnings and to adjust the statistical analysis plan accordingly. Both the FDA and European Medicines Agency, or EMA, were supportive of the proposed amendment to the AFFINITY protocol and statistical analysis plan. The following protocol amendment was submitted in all participating countries where the trial is being conducted:

&#160;

o 

The inclusion of a co-primary survival objective for evaluating survival benefit in a subpopulation of men who were at increased risk for poor outcomes as well as for all men enrolled into the study, known as the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. 

&#160;

o 

A revised statistical analysis plan including the hypothesized hazard ratio, or HR, for the subpopulation who were at an increased risk for poor outcomes specified to be 0.69 with the critical HR &#8804; 0.778. The hypothesized HR for the ITT population, remains unchanged as 0.75 with the critical HR &#8804; 0.820. 

&#160;

o 

The revised statistical analysis plan included an interim analysis for the ITT population at the same time as the final analysis for the subpopulation. This interim analysis had both futility and early efficacy criteria defined for the ITT population. 

The co-primary survival analysis for the poor prognostic subpopulation and the interim analysis for the ITT population in the AFFINITY trial were completed in December 2015. The co-primary survival results for the subpopulation of men who had multiple poor prognostic risk factors revealed that the combination of custirsen and cabazitaxel did not meet the rigorous criteria required to demonstrate an improvement in overall survival (hypothesized hazard ratio &#60; 0.69, one-sided 

p value &#60; 0.015). Based on the interim analysis for the ITT population, the IDMC recom mended that the trial continue as planned. Both the IDMC and we remain blinded to all analyses and final results are expected in the third quarter of 2016, depending on timing of the event-driven final ITT analysis. 

&#160;

&#183; 

The ENSPIRIT Trial: The phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate a survival benefit for custirsen in combination with docetaxel treatment as second-line chemotherapy in patients with NSCLC. This trial was initiated in September 2012. 

The first interim futility analysis was completed in August 2014. A protocol amendment was submitted and approved by all regulatory agencies in participating countries, to amend the statistical design and analysis plan of the ENSPIRIT trial including the following:

&#160;

o 

A revised statistical analysis plan including the hypothesized HR, to be 0.75 with the critical HR of &#8804; 0.84, reducing the required sample size from 1,100 to 700 patients. This change maintained 90% power while assessing for a more clinically relevant survival benefit when adding custirsen to second-line docetaxel. 

&#160;

o 

A revision to the final interim futility analysis with more rigorous criteria in order to continue the trial due to lack of futility. This was successfully completed in July 2015, and the trial continued as planned. 

&#160;

o 

The inclusion of an additional objective to analyze survival outcome based on NSCLC histology as part of the other non-primary analyses. 

We believe these amendments, specifically the revised statistical thresholds, are more appropriately aligned to the interests of both treating clinicians and their patients. Based on current ENSPIRIT enrollment projections and the changes outlined in the protocol amendment, we believe final survival results could be available in the first half of 2017, depending on completion of enrollment and timing of the event-driven final analysis. 

Custirsen has received Fast Track designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for second-line treatment of metastatic CRPC when combined with cabazitaxel and prednisone and for the second-line treatment of advanced NSCLC when combined with docetaxel in patients with disease progression following treatment with a first-line, platinum-based chemotherapy doublet regimen. 

Summary of Results of Custirsen Clinical Trials 

One phase 3 and five phase 2 clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate the ability of custirsen to enhance the effects of therapy in patients with prostate, non-small cell lung and breast cancer. The following is a summary of the completed clinical trials evaluating custirsen in combination with chemotherapy. 

Summary of Final Results of the SYNERGY Phase 3 Clinical Trial in Patients with metastatic CRPC

The trial enrolled 1,022 men at 124 sites across the United States and Europe between 2010 and 2012. Patients were randomized to receive either 640 mg of custirsen per week by intravenous infusion in combination with docetaxel or docetaxel alone, which remains the standard of care for first-line chemotherapy treatment in patients with metastatic CRPC. Top-line results were reported in April 2014 indicating that the addition of custirsen to first-line docetaxel chemotherapy did not meet the primary endpoint of a statistically significant improvement in overall survival in men with metastatic CRPC, compared to docetaxel alone (median survival 23.4 months vs 22.2 months, respectively; hazard ratio 0.93 and one-sided p value 0.207). However, subsequent exploratory analyses showed improved overall survival for men who had the worst poor prognostic scores and received custirsen. Prognostic scoring for each patient allowed classification into good, mid and poor prognostic subgroups. The figure below shows the survival difference for docetaxel plus custirsen treatment compared to docetaxel alone for the poor prognostic subgroup. For the good and mid prognostic subgroups combined, there was no survival difference for docetaxel plus custirsen treatment compared to docetaxel alone (also shown in the figure below). 

In summary, exploratory analyses indicated a survival benefit in patients who had the worst prognostic scores based on a number of poor prognosis factors when treated with custirsen in combination with docetaxel compared to docetaxel alone:

&#160;

&#183; 

the exploratory multivariate analysis indicated that the significant predictors of overall survival in this study were low performance status, presence of liver metastases, opioid usage for prostate cancer pain, anemia, high levels of PSA in the blood as well as high blood levels of LDH and alkaline phosphatase, also known to be common poor prognostic laboratory indicators, and 

&#160;

&#183; 

the unadjusted hazard ratio, a measure used to compare the death rates between groups, showed a 27% lower rate of death for patients who were at increased risk for poor outcomes and received custirsen. 

As part of our phase 1, 2 and 3 clinical trials, custirsen has been administered to more than 1,300 patients with multiple types of cancer. Some of the patients experienced a variety of adverse events, the majority of which are associated with other treatments in the protocol and with the disease. The majority of adverse events were mild and the most common adverse events associated with custirsen consisted of flu-like symptoms. The most common moderate and severe adverse events occurring in more than 3% of patients who received custirsen and docetaxel in the completed phase 3 SYNERGY trial were fatigue, fever and neutropenia, weakness, diarrhea, pulmonary embolism (a blood clot that blocks an artery in the lungs), and pneumonia. These events also occurred in patients who received docetaxel alone in the completed phase 3 SYNERGY trial.

Summary of Final Results of Phase 2 Clinical Trial in Patients with CRPC Receiving Custirsen and Docetaxel as First-Line Chemotherapy 

Final results of a randomized phase 2 trial evaluating the benefit of combining custirsen with first-line docetaxel in patients with CRPC were published in the September 20, 2010 issue of the Journal of Clinical Oncology, or JCO.

The trial enrolled 82 patients at 12 sites in Canada and the United States from September 2005 to December 2006. Patients were randomized to one of two treatment arms to receive either 640 mg of custirsen per week by intravenous infusion in combination with docetaxel or docetaxel alone. Analyses indicated a survival benefit in patients treated with custirsen in combination with docetaxel compared to docetaxel alone: 

&#160;

&#183; 

median overall survival among patients treated with custirsen plus docetaxel was 23.8 months compared to 16.9 months for patients treated with docetaxel alone, indicating a 6.9 month survival advantage in the custirsen arm; 

&#160;

&#183; 

the unadjusted hazard ratio, a measure used to compare the death rates between treatment groups, was 0.61, representing a 39% lower rate of death for patients receiving custirsen; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

a prospectively defined multivariate analysis indicated that the significant predictors of overall survival in this study were treatment arm, performance status and presence of metastases other than in bone or lymph nodes. In the multivariate analysis, patients treated with custirsen had a rate of death 51% lower than patients treated with docetaxel alone (HR=0.49; p=0.012). 

Study investigators concluded that custirsen treatment was well tolerated in combination with docetaxel. Patients receiving custirsen had an increased incidence of mild fever, chills and elevated creatinin e levels (a laboratory measure for reduced kidney function) and a moderate to significant decrease in circulating lymphocytes in the blood (another laboratory measure) without any increase in infection rate compared to patients receiving docetaxel alone. L ymphocytes are a type of white blood cell involved in the body&#8217;s defense against infections. Based on final results of this randomized phase 2 trial, the phase 3 SYNERGY trial was designed to evaluate the overall survival benefit of custirsen in patients t reated with first-line chemotherapy. 

Summary of Results of Phase 2 Clinical Trial in Patients Receiving Custirsen and Docetaxel as Second-Line Chemotherapy 

Data from a phase 2 clinical study of custirsen in combination with docetaxel retreatment or mitoxantrone as second-line chemotherapy in patients with metastatic CRPC were published in the September 1, 2011 issue of Clinical Cancer Research, or CCR. In this phase 2 trial, patients who were previously treated with a first-line, docetaxel-based chemotherapy regimen and progressed on or within six months of discontinuation of docetaxel treatment were randomized to receive custirsen plus either docetaxel retreatment or mitoxantrone. Initially, 42 patients were randomized, received at least one cycle of custirsen and chemotherapy and were included in the analysis: 20 patients received docetaxel retreatment plus custirsen and 22 patients received mitoxantrone plus custirsen. The protocol was amended to allow additional patients to be enrolled in the docetaxel retreatment arm and 25 additional patients were enrolled. 

Data from the clinical trial are summarized as follows: 

&#160;

&#183; 

The median overall survival duration for the custirsen plus mitoxantrone arm was 11.5 months (95% C.I.: 6.1-15.2 months). For the custirsen plus docetaxel retreatment arm, the median overall survival was 15.8 months (95% C.I.:9.9-23.3 months) for the 20 randomized patients and 12.8 months (95% C.I.:9.9-17.0 months) for the combined patient population (n=45) that included 25 additional patients with high serum clusterin levels at enrollment beyond the 20 randomized patients. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Analyses presented in the CCR manuscript demonstrated that treatment with custirsen in combination with chemotherapy significantly lowered serum clusterin levels as compared to baseline levels, and that average serum clusterin levels during treatment were predictive of survival, with low serum clusterin levels correlating to longer survival. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Pain responses were observed in 62% of evaluable patients, with 88% of these patients having a durable response of three months or more. 

Summary of Results of Phase 2 Clinical Trial in Patients with NSCLC Receiving Custirsen and Gemcitabine/Platinum as First-Line Chemotherapy 

Data from a phase 2 clinical study of custirsen in patients with advanced NSCLC was published in the January 2012 issue of Journal of Thoracic Oncology, or JTO. This study evaluated custirsen in combination with gemcitabine and a platinum chemotherapy (cisplatin or carboplatin) as first-line chemotherapy in 81 patients with advanced NSCLC. Eighty-one percent of the patients had stage IV disease at enrollment, and 16% had squamous cell carcinoma. 

Data from the clinical trial are summarized as follows:

Summary of Preliminary Results of Phase 2 Clinical Trial in Patients with Advanced Breast Cancer Receiving Custirsen and Docetaxel as First- or Second-Line Chemotherapy 

In January 2009, results of a phase 2 clinical trial in 15 patients with advanced breast cancer were published in the scientific journal CCR; this study evaluated custirsen in combination with docetaxel as first-line or second-line chemotherapy. The authors concluded that the combination of custirsen and docetaxel at 75 mg/m 2 was well tolerated, and some clinical activity was seen in the patients with metastatic breast cancer. 

Summary of Preliminary Results of Phase 2 Clinical Trial in Patients with CRPC Receiving Custirs en and Hormone Ablation Therapy 

This trial was an investigator-sponsored trial that evaluated weekly custirsen with androgen withdrawal therapy for a three-month duration in patients with high-risk, localized prostate carcinoma prior to radical prostatectomy. Results of the trial indicated that custirsen was detectable in prostate tissue for 14 days after the last administration, that clusterin expression was decreased in cells from lymph nodes as well as from prostate specimens, and that patients who received custirsen plus androgen withdrawal therapy had higher levels of apoptosis (cell death) compared with patients who never received androgen withdrawal therapy or who received only androgen withdrawal therapy. 

Summary of Results of Phase 3 Clinical Trial in Patients with CRPC Receiving a Taxane and Custirsen/Placebo Following Prior Docetaxel; Discontinued due to enrollment 

Results of a randomized phase 3 trial evaluating the pain palliation benefit of custirsen in combination with taxane chemotherapy (docetaxel retreatment or cabazitaxel) in patients with CRPC following prior docetaxel were presented at the ASCO GU Symposium in January 2014. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, called the SATURN trial, durable pain palliation for &#179; 12 weeks duration was the primary endpoint. 

The trial was stopped after 20 months, during which 14 subjects were randomized. Restrictive protocol-specified criteria of stable baseline pain and consistent analgesic use prevented the ability to complete trial enrollment. 

Data from the clinical trial are summarized as follows: 

&#160;

&#183; 

durable pain palliation of &#179; 12 weeks duration was achieved in 3/14 subjects: n=1/7 (14%, taxane + placebo arm) and n=2/7 (29%, taxane + custirsen arm); 

&#160;

&#183; 

custirsen was generally well tolerated when administered in combination with a taxane (docetaxel or cabazitaxel) and prednisone; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

median (95% CI) overall survival by Kaplan-Meier analyses was 7.8 months (3.2, 11.5) (taxane + placebo) and 11.8 months (9.8, 15.7) (taxane + custirsen).

Apatorsen 

Overview of Apatorsen 

Apatorsen is our product candidate that is designed to inhibit production of Hsp27, a cell-survival protein expressed in many types of cancers including bladder, prostate, breast, pancreatic and non-small cell lung cancer. Hsp27 expression is stress-induced, including by many anti-cancer therapies. Overexpression of Hsp27 is thought to be an important factor leading to the development of treatment resistance and is associated with metastasis and negative clinical outcomes in patients with various tumor types. 

A number of preclinical studies have shown that reducing Hsp27 production induces tumor cell death in prostate, non-small cell lung, bladder and pancreatic cancer cells. The studies also suggest that reducing Hsp27 production sensitizes prostate tumor cells to hormone ablation therapy. These preclinical studies have also shown that inhibiting the production of Hsp27 in human prostate, bladder, lung, breast, ovarian and pancreatic tumor cells sensitizes the cells to chemotherapy. 

Hsp27 has been reported by others to function as an immunomodulatory protein by a number of mechanisms that include altering important membrane expressed proteins on monocytes and immature dendritic cells; this alteration results in tumor-associated immune cells that are not functional in identifying and killing cancer cells. The induction of anti-inflammatory cytokines by Hsp27 may also play a role in down-regulating lymphocyte activation leading to additional unresponsive immune cells.

In 2013, we initiated the ORCA (Ongoing Studies Evaluating Treatment Resistance in CAncer) program which encompasses clinical studies designed to evaluate whether inhibition of Hsp27 can lead to improved prognosis and treatment outcomes for cancer patients. Our goal is to advance cancer treatme nt by conducting clinical trials for apatorsen across multiple cancer indications including bladder, lung, pancreatic and prostate cancers. We are conducting parallel clinical trials to evaluate apatorsen in several cancer indications and treatment combina tions to accelerate the development of apatorsen. As part of this strategy, we are supporting specific investigator-sponsored trials to allow assessment of a broader range of clinical indications for future OncoGenex-sponsored trials and possible market ap proval. The ORCA trials, with exception of the Pacific&#8482; trial, are designed to provide information that will be useful for designing future phase 3 trials and may be used as supportive studies for registration, if applicable. Due to small sample sizes, da ta from these trials are not likely to result in statistically significant differences in either PFS or survival. 

&#160;

Ongoing Trials 

&#160;

&#183; 

The Borealis-2&#8482; Trial: The investigator-sponsored, randomized phase 2 trial evaluating apatorsen in combination with docetaxel treatment compared to docetaxel treatment alone in patients with advanced or metastatic bladder cancer who have disease progression following first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients may also continue weekly apatorsen infusions as maintenance treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity if they complete all 10 cycles of docetaxel, or are discontinued from docetaxel due to docetaxel toxicity. This trial was initiated in April 2013 and patient enrollment was completed in September 2015. The trial randomized approximately 200 patients and results are expected in the second half of 2016. 

&#160;

&#183; 

The Spruce&#8482; Trial: The investigator-sponsored, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial evaluating apatorsen plus carboplatin and pemetrexed therapy compared to carboplatin and pemetrexed therapy in patients with previously untreated advanced non-squamous NSCLC. Patients continued weekly apatorsen or placebo infusions as maintenance treatment until disease progression if they completed a minimum of 3 cycles of chemotherapy treatment. The aim of the trial is to determine if adding apatorsen to carboplatin and pemetrexed therapy can extend PFS outcome. Additional analyses are expected to include tumor response rates, overall survival, safety, tolerability and the effect of therapy on Hsp27 levels. Patients who are at increased risk for poor outcomes will also be prospectively evaluated. This trial was initiated in August 2013 and patient enrollment was completed in February 2015. The trial randomized approximately 155 patients. Primary endpoint data for PFS was reported in January 2016 and did not reach the statistical significance required to demonstrate a benefit. A potential PFS benefit was observed in patients with high baseline serum Hsp27 status when treated with apatorsen. The study is ongoing and overall survival results are expected in the second half of 2016. 

&#160;

&#183; 

The Spruce-2&#8482; Trial (formerly referred to as the Cedar Trial): The investigator-sponsored, randomized phase 2 trial evaluating apatorsen plus gemcitabine and carboplatin therapy or gemcitabine and carboplatin therapy alone in patients with previously untreated advanced squamous NSCLC. Patients also continue weekly apatorsen infusions as maintenance treatment after chemotherapy until disease progression. The aim of the trial is to determine if adding apatorsen to gemcitabine and carboplatin therapy can extend PFS outcome. Additional analyses will include tumor response rates, overall survival, safety, and health-related quality of life. Additional analyses are expected to determine the effect of therapy on Hsp27 levels, explore potential biomarkers that may help predict response to treatment and survival outcomes in patients who were at increased risk for poor outcomes. The trial was initiated in July 2014 and is enrolling patients. The trial is expected to randomize approximately 140 patients. 

&#160;

&#183; 

The Pacific&#8482; Trial: The investigator-sponsored, randomized phase 2 trial evaluating apatorsen in men with CRPC who are experiencing a rising PSA while receiving Zytiga&#174; (abiraterone acetate). The aim of the trial is to determine if adding apatorsen to Zytiga treatment can reverse or delay treatment resistance by evaluating the PFS rate at a milestone Day 60 assessment. Other secondary endpoints such as PSA and objective responses, time to disease progression, CTCs and Hsp27 levels are expected to be evaluated. The trial completed enrollment of 72 patients in March 2016. 

Summary of Planned Apatorsen Clinical Trials 

In addition to the Borealis-1 and Borealis-2 clinical trials in metastatic bladder cancer in the ORCA program, we are evaluating apatorsen for the potential treatment of NMIBC. We have completed a pre-IND meeting with FDA in preparation for a separate IND application to evaluate apatorsen for intravesical administration in combination with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin, or BCG, treatment in patients with NMIBC. FDA had no objection to the study population or classification of subpopulations in the proposed study design and deemed the proposed definitions of primary and secondary endpoints acceptable. 

Summary of Completed Results of Apatorsen Clinical Trials 

Preliminary or final results have been presented for a phase 1 clinical trial in patients with solid tumors, a phase 1 clinical trial in patients with superficial or muscle-invasive bladder cancer, a randomized phase 2 trial in metastatic CRPC, a randomized phase 2 in metastatic bladder cancer and a randomized phase 2 trial in metastatic pancreatic cancer. The following is a summary of the preliminary or final results from these trials. 

Summary of Preliminary Results of Apatorsen Randomized Phase 2 Clinical Trial in Patients with Untreated Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer

Rainier enrolled and treated 130 patients with previously untreated metastatic pancreatic cancer. Patients were randomized to receive apatorsen in combination with ABRAXANE&#174; (paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension) (albumin-bound) and gemcitabine compared to ABRAXANE and gemcitabine alone. Patients were to receive up to six cycles of weekly intravenous therapy. The addition of apatorsen to ABRAXANE and gemcitabine did not demonstrate an overall survival benefit in the study when compared to ABRAXANE and gemcitabine alone. A potential benefit was observed in a subgroup of patients with high baseline serum Hsp27 status (14% of total) when treated with apatorsen (PFS HR= 0.40; 95% CI 0.19-0.86 and survival HR= 0.57; 95% CI 0.26-1.25). Overall, higher baseline Hsp27 status correlated with worse survival outcome. The study was sponsored and conducted by Sarah Cannon Research Institute, or SCRI, and further results were presented at the Gastrointestinal, or GI, Cancers Symposium meeting in January 2016. The study investigators concluded that these promising results in pancreatic cancer patients with high baseline Hsp27 status warrant further study of apatorsen in this population. We do not intend to pursue additional trials in pancreatic cancer at this time.

Summary of Preliminary Results of Apatorsen Randomized Phase 2 Clinical Trial in Patients with Metastatic Bladder Cancer

Borealis-1 enrolled and treated 179 patients with documented metastatic or locally inoperable transitional cell carcinoma, or TCC, of the urinary tract who had not previously received chemotherapy for metastatic disease and were not candidates for potentially curative surgery or radiotherapy. Patients were randomized to receive standard chemotherapy (gemcitabine/cisplatin) in combination with apatorsen at two dose levels (600 mg and 1000 mg) or gemcitabine/cisplatin plus placebo. Patients received up to six cycles of weekly intravenous therapy. Patients received weekly apatorsen or placebo maintenance therapy until disease progression or other reason for withdrawal from protocol treatment if they had completed a minimum of four cycles of chemotherapy. The primary endpoint of the trial was overall survival. Secondary endpoints included PFS, disease response and safety assessments for the two doses of apatorsen.

In December 2014, we announced overall trial results indicated that the addition of 600mg apatorsen to standard of care chemotherapy showed a 14% reduction in risk of death (overall survival hazard ratio (HR) = 0.86) and a 17% reduction in progressive disease and death (PFS HR = 0.83) when compared to chemotherapy alone. Subsequent exploratory analyses showed improved overall survival for those patients who received 600mg apatorsen and had poor prognosis over various prognostic factors such as performance status. Over one-third of the patients in the trial had lower performance status, as defined by a Karnofsky score of 80% or less. These patients derived the greatest benefit from 600mg apatorsen in combination with chemotherapy, resulting in a 50% reduction in risk of death (overall survival HR = 0.50) compared to chemotherapy alone. Less benefit was observed in the 1000mg apatorsen arm due to increased adverse events leading to a higher rate of discontinuation of both apatorsen and chemotherapy. Apatorsen 600mg was well tolerated in combination with chemotherapy. These data were presented at the 2015 ASCO Annual Meeting. We believe these results provide future direction for defining the patient population for a subsequent phase 3 trial.

Summary of Preliminary Results of Apatorsen Randomized Phase 2 Clinical Trial in Patients with CRPC 

This randomized, controlled phase 2 trial completed enrollment of 74 patients who had minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic advanced prostate cancer and who have not yet received chemotherapy. The trial was designed to determine the potential benefit of apatorsen by assessing the number of patients without disease progression at 12 weeks post-study treatment with or without apatorsen. Preliminary study results presented at ESMO in September 2012 showed a higher number of patients without disease progression at 12 weeks and greater declines in PSA and CTCs in patients receiving apatorsen plus prednisone treatment compared to those receiving prednisone alone. A manuscript with final results is in development.

Apatorsen infusion reactions occurred and were primarily grade 1 or 2 chills, diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, flushing, pyrexia and vomiting. Other adverse events in two or more patients receiving apatorsen were dizziness, hot flashes, m uscular weakness, and hypertension. Grade 3-4 laboratory treatment-emergent adverse events in two or more patients receiving apatorsen included lymphopenia (12%), hyperglycemia (12%), and elevated creatinine (6%). 

Summary of Preliminary Results of Apatorsen Phase 1 Clinical Trial in Patients with Superficial Bladder Cancer 

This investigator-sponsored phase 1 trial was designed to determine the effects of apatorsen on Hsp27 expression and tumor response rates when administered into the bladder using intravesical instillation. In addition, the trial measured the direct effect of delivering apatorsen by intravesical instillation on expression of Hsp27 in bladder tumor cells. This clinical trial was primarily funded by the National Cancer Institute of Canada. 

Preliminary results from this trial were presented at the ASCO 2012 Genitourinary Cancers Symposium in February 2012 and demonstrated a trend towards decreased levels of Hsp27 and increased tumor cell death rates after intravesical treatment with apatorsen. In the apatorsen treated patients who experienced a complete pathologic response, the absence of residual disease made it difficult to fully assess the effect of apatorsen on Hsp27 expression. Therefore, the analysis was based mainly on the remaining patients who had evaluable tumor tissue. Results showed that eight of 24 patients (33%) had no pathologic evidence of disease. A manuscript with final results is in development.

Summary of Results of Apatorsen Phase 1 Clinical Trial in Patients with Solid Tumors 

Apatorsen has been evaluated in a phase 1 trial in patients with breast, prostate, ovarian, or NSCLC who have failed potentially curative treatments or for whom a curative treatment does not exist. Final results of this phase 1 trial were presented in an oral presentation at the ASCO 2010 annual meeting. The phase 1 trial evaluated 42 patients treated with apatorsen as a single agent and 22 patients treated with apatorsen in combination with docetaxel who had failed up to six prior chemotherapy treatments. Apatorsen as a single agent administered weekly was evaluated at doses from 200 mg up to 1000 mg in five cohorts of approximately six patients per cohort. Two further cohorts evaluated apatorsen at the 800 and 1000 mg doses combined with docetaxel. Patients could receive up to 10 21-day cycles. 

Most adverse events were mild (grade 1 or 2) and mainly occurred during the three &#8220;loading doses&#8221; given over nine days prior to weekly dosing. The most frequently reported adverse events in the apatorsen monotherapy arms were infusion-related reactions and chills. The most frequently reported adverse events in the apatorsen plus docetaxel arms were infusion-related reactions, chills, fatigue, diarrhea, pruritus (itching), nausea and back pain. The incidence of laboratory toxicity was determined based on laboratory data. The majority of laboratory toxicities were Grade 1 or Grade 2. Serious adverse events were reported for approximately half the patients. The most common events were disease progression and dyspnea (shortness of breath), reported for five subjects each, and febrile neutropenia, reported for four subjects. Increased blood creatinine (a test of kidney function) and hydronephrosis (obstruction of the urine flow from the kidney due to tumor blockage) were reported for two subjects each. All remaining serious adverse events were reported for one subject each. 

Thirty patients had baseline and at least one post-baseline assessment of measurable disease. A total of eight of 30 patients (27%) had a decrease in measurable disease from baseline of at least 15%. For patients treated with monotherapy, three patients had tumor reductions and for patients treated with combined therapy with docetaxel, five patients had tumor reductions. 

Thirty-three of 36 patients with prostate cancer had at least one post-baseline PSA. Three of 21 in the monotherapy cohorts had reductions in PSA greater than or equal to 30% as did six of 12 in the combination therapy cohorts. Six of seven patients with ovarian cancer had both baseline and post-baseline CA-125 (an ovarian tumor marker) measurements. All were treated with monotherapy. Three patients had a reduction of CA-125. 

Decreases in both total CTCs and Hsp27+CTCs were observed. Hsp27+CTCs were decreased in 71% of evaluable patients. 

In approximately 35% of patients, serum Hsp27 protein levels were decreased by 30% or greater over a time period of at least six weeks.

OGX-225 

Overview of OGX-225 

OGX-225 is our product candidate designed to inhibit the production of Insulin Growth Factor Binding Proteins -2 and -5, or IGFBP-2, IGFBP-5, two proteins that when overexpressed affect the growth of cancer cells. Increased IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-5 production are observed in many human cancers, including prostate, breast, colorectal, non-small cell lung, glioblastoma, acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, neuroblastoma, and melanoma. The increased production of these proteins is linked to faster rates of cancer progression, treatment resistance, and shorter survival duration in humans.

Preclinical studies with human prostate and breast cancer cells have shown that reducing IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-5 production with OGX-225 sensitized these tumor types to hormone ablation therapy or chemotherapy and induced tumor cell death. We have completed IN D enabling toxicology studies for OGX-225.

Second-Generation Antisense Technology 

Custirsen, apatorsen and OGX-225 are based on second-generation antisense drug chemistry and belong to the drug class known as antisense therapeutics. On a product-by-product basis, we have collaborated with Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (formerly Isis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), or Ionis, and selectively licensed technology from Ionis to combine Ionis&#8217; second-generation antisense chemistry with our proprietary gene target sequences to create inhibitors that are designed to down-regulate certain proteins associated with cancer resistance. In contrast to first-generation antisense chemistry, second-generation antisense chemistry has improved target binding affinity, increased resistance to degradation, and improved tissue distribution. These improvements result in slower clearance of the therapies from the body, which allow for less frequent dosing and thereby make treatment easier on patients at a lower associated cost. For example, clinical data from our phase 1 clinical trial evaluating custirsen in combination with neoadjuvant hormone therapy in prostate cancer patients demonstrated that weekly intravenous administration of custirsen resulted in drug distribution to prostate cancer tissue and over 92% inhibition of its target, clusterin mRNA, in prostate tumor cells in these patients. These data demonstrate that, following systemic administration, custirsen entered tumor cells and effectively inhibited clusterin production. 

OVERVIEW OF MARKET AND TREATMENT 

In North America, cancer has recently surpassed heart disease as the leading cause of death in the United States. The American Cancer Society estimates that approximately 1.7 million new cancer cases are expected to be diagnosed in 2016. Cancer is the second most common cause of death in the United States, accounting for nearly 1 of every 4 deaths. Approximately 600,000 Americans are expected to die of cancer in 2016. 

Typically, cancer treatments are given sequentially and can include hormone therapy, surgery, radiation therapy, immunotherapy and chemotherapy. Although a particular therapy may initially be effective, tumor cells often react to therapeutic treatment by increasing the production of proteins that afford them a survival advantage, enabling them to become resistant to therapy, multiply, and spread to additional organs. As a result, many patients progress through multiple different therapies and ultimately die from the disease. 

OUR STRATEGY 

Our objective is to develop and commercialize new cancer therapies that address resistance to therapies in cancer patients. Key elements of our strategy include: 

&#160;

&#183; 

gaining market approval for custirsen by conducting registration trials that demonstrate efficacy and safety, in both prostate and lung cancer; 

&#160;

&#183; 

advancing apatorsen by conducting clinical trials across multiple cancer indications for apatorsen, including bladder, lung and prostate cancers. We are conducting parallel clinical trials to evaluate apatorsen in several cancer indications and treatment combinations to accelerate the development of apatorsen. We are supporting specific investigator-sponsored trials to allow assessment of a broader range of clinical indications for future OncoGenex-sponsored trials and possible market approval; 

&#160;

&#183; 

developing and commercializing new cancer therapies, including OGX-225, to inhibit treatment resistance in cancer patients. We plan to leverage our expertise in development to bring new products to market as soon as possible. We intend to maintain and develop our relationship with the Vancouver Prostate Centre and develop relationships with other research institutions in order to identify additional product candidates; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

optimizing the development of our product candidates through use of outsourcing and internal expertise. In order to increase efficiency and lower our overhead, we outsource, and plan to continue to outsource, preclinical and manufacturing activities. We have chosen to establish critical product development functions in-house, including clinical trial management and regulatory affairs. 

LICENSE AND COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS 

Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 

Custirsen 

In November 2001, OncoGenex Technologies entered into an agreement with Ionis to jointly develop and commercialize custirsen. This strategic relationship provided us with access to Ionis&#8217; proprietary position in second-generation antisense chemistry for use in custirsen, and Ionis&#8217; expertise in developing antisense therapeutics, including its manufacturing expertise, and allowed us to develop custirsen cost efficiently. Under this agreement, we paid 65%, and Ionis paid 35%, of the costs resulting from the development and commercialization of custirsen. In July 2008, we and Ionis amended this agreement to provide that we are solely responsible for the costs and development of custirsen, and, in turn, we incurred certain financial obligations to Ionis, primarily related to sharing revenue received by us from a third party as a result of a licensing transaction. 

Under the amended agreement, Ionis assigned to OncoGenex Technologies its rights in the patents claiming the composition and therapeutic methods of using custirsen, and granted OncoGenex Technologies a worldwide, nonexclusive license to their know-how and patents covering our core antisense technology and manufacturing technology solely for use with custirsen. The key product related patent that Ionis assigned to OncoGenex Technologies was U.S. Patent number 6,900,187 having an expiration date of at least 2021, and the key core antisense technology patents Ionis licensed OncoGenex Technologies are U.S. Patent number 7,919,472 having an expiration date of 2026 and its foreign equivalents pending in Australia, Canada, the European Patent Convention and Japan. In addition, Ionis agreed that so long as OncoGenex Technologies or its commercialization partner is using commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize custirsen, Ionis will not research, develop or commercialize an antisense compound designed to modulate clusterin. The amended agreement will continue until OncoGenex Technologies or its commercialization partner is no longer developing or commercializing custirsen or until Ionis terminates the agreement for an uncured failure by OncoGenex Technologies to make a payment required under the agreement. 

Licensing revenue that is based on a percentage of net sales of a licensor is defined as Royalty Revenue, while other licensing revenue, with the exception of fair market value of equity and reimbursement of research and development expenses, is defined as Non-Royalty Revenue. We will pay Ionis royalties comprised of a base percentage of net sales of custirsen and a percentage of Royalty Revenue we receive in excess of a certain threshold up to a certain cap. The amount of the royalties payable to Ionis depends on whether Ionis owes royalty payments to third parties pursuant to its license agreements with such parties. Our total royalty obligations to Ionis will depend on net sales of custirsen during the period and if Ionis owes royalty payments to third parties. In addition, we are required to pay Ionis 20% of all Non-Royalty Revenue we receive. 

In May and November 2015, we received communications from Ionis requesting payment of 30% of the $23.2 million paid by Teva under the Termination Agreement, as well as 30% of any amounts paid by Teva upon release of the $3.0 million holdback amount. In January 2016, Ionis filed a lawsuit and claims that OncoGenex Technologies is in breach of the license agreement for failing to pay Ionis a share of the advance reimbursement payment from Teva and other non-monetary consideration received from Teva in connection with the termination of the Collaboration Agreement. Ionis seeks damages in the amount of at least $10 million and a declaratory judgment that, based on OncoGenex Technologies&#8217; alleged breach, Ionis has the right to terminate the license agreement. We do not believe that any payments are due to Ionis. Under the Ionis license agreement, no payment is due to Ionis on any consideration that we receive for the reimbursement for research and development activities. The amounts paid or payable by Teva under the Termination Agreement constitute an advanced reimbursement for certain continuing research and development activities related to custirsen and certain other antisense inhibitors of clusterin, and therefore, no payments are owed to Ionis. We intend to vigorously defend the lawsuit and, based on our preliminary review, we believe we have valid defenses.

We paid Ionis $10 million in January 2010 as Ionis&#8217; share of Non-Royalty Revenue received by us in December 2009 in connection with our collaboration agreement with Teva. We did not make any further payments to Ionis in 2015 under the terms of the agreement with Ionis. 

Neither we nor Ionis can pursue the development or commercialization of any antisense compound for clusterin outside of the agreement with Ionis. This arrangement will continue until custirsen is no longer being developed or commercialized or until the agreement with Ionis is earlier terminated due to an uncured material breach. 

To facilitate the execution and performance of the collaboration agreement with Teva, we and Ionis agreed to further amend our agreement, which amendment provided that, among other things, if we are the subject of a change of control with a third party, where the surviving entity immediately following such change of control has the right to develop and sell the product, then (i) a milestone payment of $20 million will be due and payable to Ionis 21 days following the first commercial sale of the product in the United States and (ii) unless such surviving entity had previously sublicensed the product and a royalty rate payable to Ionis by us has been established, the applicable royalty rate payable to Ionis will thereafter be the maximum amount payable under our agreement with Ionis. Any non-royalty milestone amounts previously paid will be credited towards the $20 million milestone if not already paid. As a result of the $10 million milestone payment paid to Ionis in relation to the collaboration agreement with Teva, the remaining amount owing in the event of change of control discussed above is a maximum of $10 million. 

OncoGenex Technologies has agreed to indemnify Ionis and persons affiliated with Ionis against liabilities resulting from the development, manufacture, use, handling, storage, sale or other commercialization or disposition of custirsen caused by OncoGenex Technologies&#8217; or its licensees&#8217; or sublicensees&#8217; gross negligence or willful misconduct, or caused by OncoGenex Technologies&#8217; material breach of our agreement with Ionis. 

Apatorsen 

In January 2005, OncoGenex Technologies entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Ionis to jointly identify antisense compounds designed to inhibit the production of proteins encoded by specified gene targets. OncoGenex Technologies is solely responsible for all product development activities for antisense compounds under this collaboration. This relationship provides OncoGenex Technologies with access to Ionis&#8217; proprietary position in second generation antisense chemistry for use in specified products. OncoGenex Technologies was permitted to designate up to two collaboration gene targets for collaborative research, development and commercialization. In April, 2005, Hsp27 was confirmed as a collaboration gene target, and we and Ionis jointly designed and screened antisense compounds for this gene target. OncoGenex Technologies&#8217; right to designate a second collaboration gene target expired on January 5, 2007. 

Under the terms of the agreement, in the event that OncoGenex Technologies abandons apatorsen, Ionis may elect to unilaterally continue development of apatorsen, in which case it must provide Ionis with a worldwide license or sublicense (as the case may be) of its relevant technology solely to develop and commercialize apatorsen in exchange for a royalty on Ionis&#8217; sales of apatorsen. 

Under the terms of the agreement, OncoGenex Technologies may be obligated to make certain milestone payments to Ionis contingent upon the occurrence of certain clinical development and regulatory events related to apatorsen. It is also obligated to pay to Ionis certain milestone payments, as well as certain low to mid-single digit royalties on net sales for apatorsen, with the amount of royalties depending on whether third-party royalty payments are owed. We paid Ionis USD$0.8 million in 2010 upon the initiation of a phase 2 clinical trial of apatorsen in patients with CRPC. We did not make any royalty payments to Ionis under the terms of the agreement in 2015. 

OncoGenex Technologies has agreed to indemnify Ionis and certain persons affiliated with Ionis against liabilities caused by its and its licensees&#8217; and sublicensees&#8217; gross negligence or willful misconduct, its material breach of the collaboration and license agreement, and the manufacture, use, handling, storage, sale or other disposition of apatorsen that is sold by OncoGenex Technologies or its affiliates, agents or sublicensees. 

The term of the collaboration and license agreement will continue for each product until the later of 10 years after the date of the first commercial sale of apatorsen and the expiration of the last to expire of any patents required to be licensed in order to use or sell apatorsen, unless OncoGenex Technologies abandons apatorsen and Ionis does not elect to unilaterally continue development of apatorsen. 

University of British Columbia 

Custirsen 

Efforts conducted at the Vancouver Prostate Centre are owned and managed by the University of British Columbia, or UBC. Under a license agreement entered into in November 2001, as amended, UBC granted to OncoGenex Technologies an exclusive, worldwide license to commercialize its existing intellectual property and any improvements related to clusterin. This technology, combined with Ionis&#8217; second-generation antisense chemistry, is our product candidate custirsen. In connection with entering into the license agreement, we issued to UBC shares of OncoGenex Technologies that were exchanged in the Arrangement for 15,243 shares of our common stock. OncoGenex Technologies agreed to pay UBC low single digit royalties on milestones and the revenue from sales of 

custirsen . OncoGenex Technologies is obligated to pay UBC CAD$2,000 in annual maintenance fees. In January 2010, we paid UBC CAD$0.3 million as a result of upfront payments we received from Teva in December 2009 in connection with the collaboration agreement. The o ccurrence and receipt of future milestone payments and the generation of royalty revenue are uncertain. We did not make any royalty or milestone payments to UBC under the terms of the agreement in 2015. 

OncoGenex Technologies agreed to use its commercially reasonable efforts to develop and exploit the licensed technology and any improvements. OncoGenex Technologies also agreed to promote, market and sell any resulting products and to cause the market demand for such products to be satisfied. OncoGenex Technologies is permitted to sublicense the technology, subject to certain consent and other requirements. OncoGenex Technologies directs patent prosecution and is responsible for all fees and costs related to the preparation, filing, prosecution and maintenance of the patent rights underlying the license agreement. OncoGenex Technologies indemnifies UBC and certain of UBC&#8217;s affiliates against liability arising out of the exercise of any rights granted pursuant to the agreement. The term of the agreement will expire on the later of 20 years from its effective date and the expiration of the last patent licensed under the agreement. Subject to patent term extensions, the current granted patent for custirsen expires in the United States in 2021 and would expire in all other jurisdictions by 2020. OncoGenex Technologies has additional patent applications pending that, if issued and not invalidated, may extend the expiration date of the last-to-expire patents. OncoGenex Technologies may also file additional patent applications related to clusterin that could potentially extend the expiration date of the last to expire patent in this area. 

Apatorsen 

Under a license agreement entered into in April 2005, as amended, UBC granted to OncoGenex Technologies an exclusive, worldwide license to commercialize its existing intellectual property and any improvements related to Hsp27. This technology, combined with Ionis&#8217; second-generation antisense chemistry, is our product candidate apatorsen. In connection with entering into the license agreement, OncoGenex Technologies issued to UBC shares that were exchanged in the Arrangement for 6,533 shares of our common stock. OncoGenex Technologies also agreed to pay UBC low single digit royalties on the revenue from sales of apatorsen, which royalty rate may be reduced in the event that OncoGenex Technologies must pay additional royalties under patent licenses entered into with third parties in order to manufacture, use or sell apatorsen. OncoGenex Technologies may be obligated to make milestone payments to UBC contingent upon the occurrence of certain clinical development and regulatory events related to apatorsen. OncoGenex Technologies is obligated to pay UBC CAD$2,000 in annual maintenance fees. We paid UBC CAD$0.1 million in 2010 in relation to the initiation of a phase 2 trial of apatorsen in patients with CRPC. The occurrence and receipt of upfront and milestone payments and the generation of royalty revenue are uncertain. We did not make any royalty payments to UBC under the terms of the agreement in 2015.

Subject to certain exceptions, OncoGenex Technologies agreed to use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) develop and exploit the licensed technology and any improvements and (ii) promote, market and sell any resulting products. OncoGenex Technologies is permitted to sublicense the technology, subject to certain consent and other requirements. OncoGenex Technologies directs patent prosecution and is responsible for all fees and costs related to the preparation, filing, prosecution and maintenance of the patent rights underlying the license agreement. OncoGenex Technologies indemnifies UBC and certain of UBC&#8217;s affiliates against liability arising out of the exercise of any rights granted pursuant to the agreement. The term of the agreement will expire on the later of 20 years from its effective date and the expiration of the last patent licensed under the agreement. Depending on the outcome of the pending patent applications in the licensed patent family, and subject to any applicable patent term extensions, a patent issuing from this family would expire in all jurisdictions by 2023. OncoGenex Technologies may also file additional patent applications related to Hsp27 that could potentially extend the expiration date of the last to expire patent in this area. 

OGX-225 

Pursuant to the terms of our third-party license agreement relating to OGX-225, we will owe payments upon the completion of product development milestones, as well as low to mid-single digit royalties on product sales. We did not make any milestone or royalty payments to third parties under the terms of the agreement in 2015. 

We are also obligated to pay annual license fees to third parties with respect to these product candidates. These amounts are disclosed in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Contractual Obligations,&#8221; which is incorporated herein by reference. 

Summary of Milestone Obligations by Product Candidate

GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS 

Drug Approval Process 

Regulation by government authorities in the United States and other countries is a significant factor in our ongoing research and development activities and in the production and marketing of our products. In order to undertake clinical trials and to produce and market products for human use, mandatory procedures and safety standards established by the FDA in the United States and by comparable agencies in other countries must be followed. 

The standard process before a pharmaceutical agent may be marketed includes the following steps: 

&#160;

&#183; 

preclinical studies, including laboratory evaluation and animal studies to test for initial safety and efficacy; 

&#160;

&#183; 

submission to national health authorities of an IND or Clinical Trials Application, or CTA, or equivalent dossier, which must be accepted by each national health authority before human clinical trials may commence in that country; 

&#160;

&#183; 

adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug in its intended population and use(s); 

&#160;

&#183; 

submission to appropriate national and/or regional regulatory health authorities of a New Drug Application, or NDA, or equivalent marketing authorization application, which application is not automatically accepted for review; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

approval by appropriate regulatory health authorities of the marketing authorization application prior to any commercial sale or shipment of the drug in each country or jurisdiction. 

As part of the regulatory health authority approval for each product, the drug-manufacturing establishment is subject to inspection by the FDA and must comply with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, requirements applicable to the production of pharmaceutical drug products. The facilities, procedures and operations of manufacturers must be determined to be adequate by the FDA before product approval. 

Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of the active drug substance and its formulation in animals to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the drug and its formulation. Prior to initiating the first clinical testing of a new drug product candidate, the results of the preclinical studies are submitted to regulatory health authorities as part of an IND or CTA, and must be accepted before the proposed clinical trial(s) can begin. 

Clinical trials for cancer therapeutics involve the administration of the investigational drug to patients with a defined disease state, under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator. 

Clinical trials are conducted in accordance with protocols that detail the parameters to be used to monitor safety and efficacy. Each protocol is submitted to regulatory health authorities as part of the IND or CTA in each country where clinical trials are to be conducted. Each clinical trial is approved and monitored by independent Institutional Review Boards, or IRB, or Ethics Committees who consider ethical factors, informed consent documents, the safety of human subjects and the possible liability of the institutions conducting a clinical trial. The IRB or Ethics Committee may require changes in the clinical trials protocol, which may delay initiation or completion of the trial. 

Clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases, althoug h the phases may overlap. In phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug to humans, the drug is tested for safety and clinical pharmacology. Phase 2 trials involve more detailed evaluation of the safety and efficacy of the drug in patients with a defined disease. Phase 3 trials consist of large-scale evaluations of safety and efficacy of the investigational drug compared to accepted standard therapy in a defined disease. 

The process of completing clinical testing and obtaining regulatory approval for a new product takes a number of years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources. The FDA, or another regulatory authority, may not grant approval on a timely basis, if at all. We may encounter difficulties in securing regulatory approval or unanticipated costs, which may delay or preclude the commercialization of our product candidates. For instance, regulatory authorities may conclude that the data submitted in a marketing authorization application, such as a NDA, are not adequate to support approval of a pharmaceutical agent and may require further clinical and preclinical testing, re-submission of the application, and further review. Even after initial approval has been obtained, an indication may be limited or conditioned on the provision of further studies to support an approved indication, and further studies will be required to gain approval for the use of a product for clinical indications other than those for which the product was approved initially. Also, regulatory authorities require post-marketing surveillance programs to monitor the drug product&#8217;s side effects. 

Marketing of pharmaceutical products outside of the United States is subject to regulatory requirements that vary from country to country. In the European Union, the general trend has been towards coordination of common standards for clinical testing of new drug products. Centralized approval in the European Union is coordinated through the EMA. 

The level of regulation outside the United States and the European Union varies widely. The time required to obtain regulatory approval from regulatory agencies in each country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA or EMA approval. In addition, in certain markets, reimbursement is subject to governmentally mandated prices. 

CONTRACT RESEARCH AGREEMENTS 

Consistent with our strategy to outsource certain product development activities, we have established contract research agreements for, preclinical, clinical, manufacturing and some data management services. We choose which business or institution to use for these services based on their expertise, capacity and reputation and the cost of the service. 

We also provide quantities of our product candidates to academic research institutions to investigate the mechanism of action and evaluate novel combinations of product candidates with other cancer therapies in various cancer indications. These collaborations expand our research activities for product candidates with modest contribution from us. 

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES 

For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, our expenditures for research and development activities were $25.1 million, $46.2 million and $55.3 million, respectively. Such research and development expenses primarily related to the advancement of our product candidates custirsen and apatorsen. 

MANUFACTURING 

We do not own facilities for the manufacture of materials for clinical or commercial use. We rely and expect to continue to rely on contract manufacturers to manufacture our product candidates in accordance with cGMP, for use in clinical trials, as well as for process development as required. We will ultimately depend on contract manufacturers for the manufacture of our products, when and if we have any, for commercial sale. 

To date, all active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, and drug product for custirsen and apatorsen has been manufactured by third parties on a purchase order basis, under cGMP. If our product candidates are approved for commercial sale in the future, we may be required to contract with larger contract manufacturers that can meet higher commercial drug quantities. 

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 

Our success depends in part on our ability and that of our collaborators to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our product candidates, technology, and know-how, to prevent others from infringing on the proprietary rights of our product candidates, and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. 

Patents 

We have a license from UBC and Ionis to use, make, have made, or make improvements upon custirsen, apatorsen and OGX-225. In addition, Ionis has assigned a three-member patent family related to clusterin antisense to OncoGenex Technologies, and we have a pending family of applications on an apatorsen formulation.

We have been granted non-exclusive rights to all intellectual property owned, licensed or otherwise controlled by Ionis as of the date of our agreements with Ionis that relate to second-generation antisense chemistry and that are required for our product candidates (such as custirsen, apatorsen and OGX-225). Ionis is generally restricted from engaging in research, development and commercialization of antisense compounds related to clusterin, Hsp27, IGFBP-5 and IGFBP-2, other than as provided in the collaboration and license agreement related to each target. Ionis directs patent prosecution and is responsible for all fees and costs related to the preparation, filing, prosecution and maintenance of these patent rights, which extend to numerous jurisdictions throughout the world. Individual patents have terms of protection depending on the laws of the countries in which the applications are made. 

We direct patent prosecution, and are responsible for all fees and costs related to the preparation, filing, prosecution and maintenance of the patent rights for intellectual property under license from UBC covering custirsen, apatorsen and OGX-225. We file patent applications for this intellectual property in the United States, Canada, Europe (through the European Patent Office), Japan and other jurisdictions. 

Composition of matter patents covering custirsen, apatorsen and OGX-225 have been issued in the United States and certain other jurisdictions. Additional patent applications covering all of these products, as well as other technologies, are pending in the United States and certain other countries. 

Generally, patents issued in the United States are effective for 20 years from the earliest non-provisional filing date, if the application from which the patent issues was filed on or after June 8, 1995 (otherwise the term is the longer of 17 years from the issue date and 20 years from the earliest non-provisional filing date). The duration of patent terms for non-U.S. patents is typically 20 years from the earliest corresponding national or international filing date. Our licensed UBC patent estate, based on those patents and applications existing now and expected by us to issue, will expire in years ranging from 2020 to 2024, which dates do not include extensions that may be available. Patent term extensions, specifically to make up for regulatory delays, are available in the United States, Europe and Japan. Although we believe that some or all of our product candidates will meet the criteria for patent term extensions, we can provide no assurance that we will obtain such extensions. 

We also rely on unpatented trade secrets, proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation, which we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our corporate partners, collaborators, employees and consultants in our drug development research. We can provide no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets or know-how will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. Further, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to protect our trade secrets or that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques. 

Trademarks 

We own several trademarks registered in the United States, including word marks ONCOGENEX&#8482;, ORCA&#8482;, Spruce&#8482;, and Rainier&#8482;, and design marks ORCA, Pacific, Borealis-1, Borealis-2, and the helical totem element that accompanies the clinical trial trademarked identifiers. In Canada, we have corresponding trademark registrations for all but Rainier&#8482;, which is pending. As requested by Cedars-Sinai, we have cancelled our trademark for the Cedar design in the United States and Canada. 

We can provide no assurance that our registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names will not infringe upon third-party rights or will be acceptable to regulatory agencies. 

COMPETITION 

The life sciences industry is highly competitive, and we face significant competition from many pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are researching and marketing products designed to address cancer indications for which we are currently developing products or for which we may develop products in the future. We are aware of several other companies which are developing therapeutics that seek to promote tumor cell death. Several therapies have been recently approved by the FDA, and we expect more to be approved in the future. 

Many oncology drugs in clinical trials are being developed for the four primary indications: lung, breast, colorectal, and prostate cancers. Certain of these drugs are designed, like custirsen, apatorsen and OGX-225, to interfere with mechanisms potentially involved with treatment resistance. If new drugs targeting mechanisms of treatment resistance are approved for sale for the indications 

that we are evaluating in advance of our product candidates or even a fter their commercialization, the market&#8217;s interest in our product candidates may be reduced. We are aware of several other companies developing therapeutic products, whether antisense or otherwise, which seek to promote tumor cell death by inhibiting prot eins believed to promote cell survival. Our competitors may seek to identify gene sequences, protein targets or antisense chemistry different from ours, and outside the scope of our intellectual property protection, to develop antisense therapeutics that s erve the same function as our product candidates. Our competitors may also seek to use mechanisms other than antisense to inhibit the proteins that our product candidates are designed to inhibit. 

Some of our product candidates&#8217; development plans include pursuing prostate and lung cancer indications. Substantial advancements in the treatment of prostate and lung cancer have occurred in the past two years and new products from our competitors have been approved for marketing on the basis of showing a survival advantage. Many of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial resources and expertise than we do in manufacturing and developing products, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing. These entities also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, as well as in acquiring products and technologies complementary to our programs. Standard treatments vary considerably by cancer indication, and new drugs may be more effective in treating one cancer indication than another. In addition, cancer is a difficult disease to treat and it is likely that no one therapeutic will replace all other therapies in any particular indication. Therapeutic strategies for treating cancer are increasingly focused on combining a number of drugs in order to yield the best results. Since custirsen and apatorsen are intended to be used in multiple cancer indications and target the tumors&#8217; adaptive survival mechanisms, these drugs may potentially be synergistic with many new and currently marketed therapies. Our ability to compete successfully will depend largely on our ability and, where applicable, the ability of our collaborators to: 

&#160;

&#183; 

maintain or establish development programs in combination with new agents that may replace or diminish the markets for which we are currently developing our product candidates; 

&#160;

&#183; 

establish that our product candidates are well tolerated and result in a clinical benefit when administered to cancer patients; 

&#160;

&#183; 

establish that our product candidates address significant unmet needs for patients, resulting in prioritization of our product candidates over other treatment options; 

&#160;

&#183; 

advance the development of our lead programs, including the enrollment of patients for our clinical trials; 

&#160;

&#183; 

gain regulatory approval for our product candidates in their respective first indications as well as expand into additional indications; 

&#160;

&#183; 

commercialize our lead product candidates successfully, which includes convincing physicians, insurers and other third-party payors of the advantages of our products over current therapies, when and if they have advantages; 

&#160;

&#183; 

obtain intellectual property protection and protect the exclusivity for our product candidates and products, when and if we have any; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

acquire other product candidates to expand our pipeline. 

EMPLOYEES 

As of December 31, 2015, we had a total of 41 employees, of whom 23 were engaged in research and development functions, including clinical development, regulatory affairs and manufacturing, and 18 were engaged in general and administrative functions, including accounting and finance, administration, and corporate communications. In February 2016, we announced a plan to reduce operating expenses, which included a workforce reduction of 11 employees.

All of our employees have entered into non-disclosure agreements regarding our intellectual property, trade secrets and other confidential information. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement, nor have we experienced any work stoppages. We believe that we maintain satisfactory relations with our employees. 

From time to time, we also use outside consultants to provide advice on our clinical development plans, research programs, administration and potential acquisitions of new technologies. 

FINANCIAL INFORMATION 

We manage our operations and allocate resources as a single reporting segment. Financial information regarding our operations, assets and liabilities, including our total revenue and net loss for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 and our total assets as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, is included in our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

COMPANY INFORMATION 

We were incorporated in California in October 1991 and subsequently reorganized as a Delaware corporation in March 1995. Our principal executive offices are located at 19820 North Creek Parkway, Bothell Washington 98011, and our telephone number is (425) 686-1500. 

In August 2008, our company, then named Sonus Pharmaceuticals, Inc., completed its acquisition, or the Arrangement, of OncoGenex Technologies, a Canadian corporation, as contemplated by the Arrangement Agreement between the companies. We then changed our name to OncoGenex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. As a result of the Arrangement, OncoGenex Technologies became our wholly owned subsidiary.
