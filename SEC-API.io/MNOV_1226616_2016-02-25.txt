Overview

We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on acquiring and developing novel, small molecule therapeutics for the treatment of serious diseases with unmet medical needs and a commercial focus on the U.S. market. Our current strategy is to focus our development activities on MN-166 (ibudilast) for neurological disorders such as progressive multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and substance dependence ( e.g., methamphetamine dependence, opioid dependence, and alcohol dependence), and MN-001 (tipelukast) for fibrotic diseases such as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Our pipeline also includes MN-221 (bedoradrine) for the treatment of acute exacerbation of asthma and MN-029 (denibulin) for solid tumor cancers.

MN-166 (ibudilast) is currently in development for several different neurological disorders. We completed a Phase 2 clinical trial of MN-166 (ibudilast) for the treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS) in 2008, in which positive safety and neuroprotective efficacy indicators were observed. We have successfully partnered with investigators on an ongoing Phase 2b clinical trial of MN-166 (ibudilast) in primary progressive and secondary progressive MS which is conducted by NeuroNEXT and funded by the NIH&#8217;s National Institute on Neurological Diseases and Stroke (NINDS). In June 2015, we announced that the progressive MS trial completed randomization of 255 subjects, which exceeded the goal of 250 subjects that were planned for participation. In August 2014, we announced plans to initiate a clinical trial of MN-166 (ibudilast) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and this trial is currently ongoing. In February 2015, we announced that the ALS study had enrolled 30 of the 60 subjects planned for participation. In April 2015, we announced that interim safety data from the ongoing ALS study was presented at the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) 67th Annual Meeting in Washington, DC. There were no safety or tolerability concerns in the MN-166 (ibudilast) treatment group compared with the placebo treatment group after three months of treatment, and the independent safety medical monitor recommended that the ALS study continue as planned. In September 2015, we announced that the first advanced ALS patient, using non-invasive ventilation (NIV), enrolled in the ongoing ALS study. We amended the protocol to expand its recruitment to include advanced ALS patients in the trial, and this amendment was approved by the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration). The amended protocol plans enrollment of 60 advanced ALS patients with NIV support in the study in addition to 60 patients without NIV support. In November 2015, we announced that the FDA approved the protocol of a new clinical trial in ALS patients to evaluate MN-166 (ibudilast) by measuring its effects using a novel imaging technology that will complement the conventional assays typically utilized in ALS trials. On February 17, 2016, we entered into an agreement to collaborate with Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) to study the effects of MN-166 (ibudilast) on reducing brain microglial activation in ALS subjects which can be monitored by 

a biomarker . In December 2015, we announced that th e FDA granted Fast Track designation to MN-166 (ibudilast) for th e treatment of patients with ALS . In June 2015, we announced that the FDA granted orphan-drug designation to MN-166 (ibudilast) for treatment of Krabbe disease . In January 2016, we announced that the FDA granted Rare Pediatric Disease Designation to MN-166 (ibudilast) for treatment of Type 1 - Early Infantile Krabbe disease. &#160; In the area of addiction, investigators at UCLA completed a Phase 1b clinical trial of MN-166 (ibudilast) in methamphetamine (MA)-dependent volunteers, funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), and the results were presented at the Annual Meeting of the College on Problems of Drug Dependence (CPDD) in June 2013. In September 2012 we announced approva l and funding by NIDA of a Phase 2 clinical trial studying the use of MN-166 (ibudilast) for the treatment of MA addiction. In collaboration with UCLA, this clinical trial commenced in 2013 and is currently ongoing. In 2010, investigators at Columbia Unive rsity and the New York State Psychiatric Institute (NYSPI) completed a Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of MN-166 (ibudilast) in opioid withdrawal that was funded by NIDA. Investigators at Columbia University and the NYSPI are currently conducting a NIDA-funded, Phase 2a clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of MN-166 (ibudilast) in the treatment of patients addicted to prescription opioids or heroin. Positive interim data from this study was reported in August 2014 , and data from this study was presented at th e 77th Annual Meeting of the College on Problems of Drug Dependence (CPDD) in June 2015 . In August 2013, we announced that researchers at UCLA were granted approval and funding by National Institute on Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse (NIAAA) of a clinical tr ial to evaluate the use of MN-166 (ibudilast) for the treatment of alcohol dependence, and we announced in June 2015 that the study completed enrollment of 24 subjects . In December 2015, we announced that results of the alcohol dependence study were prese nted at the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology (ACNP)&#8217;s 54th Annual Meeting. MN-166 (i budilast ) , but not placebo, significantly decreased basal, daily alcohol craving over the course of the study ( p &#60;0.05) . MN-166 (i budilast ) did not affect cue- a nd stress-induced alcohol craving. H owever, MN-166 (i budilast ) increased positive mood during both the cue reactivity and stress procedures . MN-166 (i budilast ) was safe and well-tolerated during the study . 

MN-001 (tipelukast) is currently in development for fibrotic diseases including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). In 2014, we announced positive results of MN-001 (tipelukast) in two different NASH mouse models and began preparing for clinical development of MN-001 (tipelukast) for the treatment of NASH in the U.S. In January 2015, we announced that the IND (Investigation New Drug) application for MN-001 (tipelukast) for the treatment of NASH is open with the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) and the FDA agreed that we may proceed with a Phase 2 study. In April 2015, the FDA granted Fast Track designation to MN-001 (tipelukast) for the treatment of patients with NASH with fibrosis. In July 2015, we announced that the FDA approved a second protocol for a clinical trial evaluating MN-001 (tipelukast) for a NASH indication which targets NASH patients with hypertriglyceridemia. In November 2015, we announced initiation of a clinical trial to investigate MN-001 (tipelukast) for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia in NASH patients. In June 2014, we announced positive results of MN-001 (tipelukast) in a mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis and began preparations to pursue clinical development of MN-001 (tipelukast) in IPF. In October 2014, we announced that the FDA granted Orphan-Drug designation to MN-001 (tipelukast) for treatment of IPF, which will provide seven years of marketing exclusivity if MN-001 (tipelukast) is approved for IPF. In February 2015, we announced that the FDA approved the protocol for a clinical trial of MN-001 (tipelukast) for the treatment of moderate to severe IPF. Importantly, due to safety data from previous clinical studies of MN-001 (tipelukast), the FDA agreed that we may proceed with a Phase 2 study as the first clinical trial of MN-001 (tipelukast) in IPF. In September 2015, we announced that the FDA granted Fast Track designation to MN-001 (tipelukast) for the treatment of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). In October 2015, we announced initiation of a Phase 2 clinical trial of MN-001 (tipelukast) to treat moderate to severe IPF at Penn State. 

We completed a Phase 2 clinical trial of MN-221 for the treatment of acute exacerbations of asthma treated in the emergency room and conducted an End-of-Phase 2 (EOP2) meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October 2012. We plan to conduct further development of MN-221 according to the feedback received from the FDA following the EOP2 meeting. In that meeting, the FDA identified the risk/benefit profile of MN-221 as a focal point for further development and advised that a clinical outcome, such as a reduction in hospitalizations, would need to be a pivotal trial primary endpoint. Previously completed Phase 2 studies have evaluated the potential for MN-221 to reduce hospitalizations due to acute exacerbations of asthma. We believe the appropriate clinical development for MN-221 will involve conducting dose regimen and acute exacerbations of asthma trial design optimization studies prior to commencing pivotal trials. Currently, we are working to identify a partner for financial support before further clinical development is commenced. 

We have acquired licenses to MN-166, MN-001, MN-221, and MN-029 for the development of these product candidates. We have pursued development of these product candidates in various indications including progressive MS, ALS, various addictions, NASH, IPF, acute exacerbations of asthma, and solid tumor cancers. 

Our Strategy 

Our goal is to build a sustainable biopharmaceutical business through the successful development of differentiated products for the treatment of serious diseases with unmet medical needs in high-value therapeutic areas. Key elements of our strategy are as follows:

&#160;

&#183; 

Pursue the development of MN-166 (ibudilast) for multiple potential indications primarily through non-dilutive financings. 

We intend to advance our diverse MN-166 (ibudilast) program primarily through a combination of investigator-sponsored trials and trials funded through government grants or other grants. In addition to providing drug supply and regulatory support, we are funding portions of the consortium-sponsored trials. For example, we have contributed financially to the Secondary and Primary Progressive Ibudilast NeuroNEXT Trial in Multiple Sclerosis (SPRINT-MS) Phase 2 clinical trial of MN-166 (ibudilast) for the treatment of progressive MS, which is primarily funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and are contributing financially to the Carolinas Neuromuscular ALS-MDA Center clinical trial of MN-166 (ibudilast) for the treatment of ALS. We intend to enter into additional strategic alliances to support further clinical development of MN-166 (ibudilast).

&#160;

&#183; 

Pursue the development of MN-001 (tipelukast) for fibrotic diseases such as NASH and IPF. 

We intend to advance development of MN-001 (tipelukast) through a combination of investigator-sponsored trials with or without grant funding as well as trials we may fund.

&#160;

&#183; 

Strategically partner with one or more leading pharmaceutical companies to complete late-stage product development and successfully commercialize our products. 

We develop and maintain relationships with pharmaceutical companies that are therapeutic category leaders. Upon completion of proof-of-concept Phase 2 clinical trials, we intend to enter into strategic alliances with leading pharmaceutical companies who seek late-stage product candidates, such as MN-166, MN-221, MN-001 and MN-029, to support further clinical development and product commercialization.

Our Product Candidates and Programs

Our product development programs address diseases that we believe are not well served by currently available therapies and represent significant commercial opportunities. We believe that we have product candidates that offer innovative therapeutic approaches that may provide significant advantages relative to current therapies.

Our product acquisitions have focused primarily on product candidates with significant preclinical and early clinical testing data that have been developed by the licensors outside of the U.S. We utilize the existing data in preparing Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) or their foreign equivalents, and in designing and implementing additional preclinical or clinical trials to advance the regulatory approval process in the U.S. or abroad.

Following are the details of our product development programs:

MN-166 (ibudilast)

MN-166 (ibudilast) is a novel, first-in-class, oral, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective agent. Ibudilast inhibits macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and certain phosphodiesterases (PDEs). Ibudilast also attenuates activated glia cells, which play a major role in certain neurological conditions. While it has been in use for more than 20 years in Japan and Korea for the treatment of asthma and post-stroke dizziness, we are developing ibudilast for the treatment of primary progressive and secondary progressive MS, ALS, and drug dependence. We licensed MN-166 (ibudilast) from Kyorin Pharmaceuticals (Kyorin) in 2004. FDA has granted Fast Track designation to MN-166 (ibudilast) for the treatment of methamphetamine dependence and for the treatment of ALS.

We have filed patent applications for multiple uses of ibudilast for the treatment of neurological conditions, as well as patent applications on analogs that have the potential to be second generation molecules. Some of the patent estate has received allowance in the U.S. and foreign countries.

Primary and Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis: MS is a complex disease with predominantly unknown etiology and affects approximately 2.3 million people worldwide, according to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, or NMSS. Also according to NMSS, approximately 85 percent of people with MS are initially diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS, or RRMS, and most people who are initially diagnosed with RRMS will eventually transition to secondary progressive MS, or SPMS. About 10 percent of people with MS are diagnosed with primary progressive MS, or PPMS. There are no therapies generally considered safe and efficacious in PPMS or SPMS in the absence of relapses. There is a great need for a safe, effective, and conveniently administered 

therapy for patients with PPMS and SPMS. MN-166 (i budilast ) may meet these needs. Based on promising results from a Phase 2a trial in relapsing MS completed in 2008, investig ators from NeuroNEXT, a NIH-funded Phase 2 clinical trial network, have begun to evaluate ibudilast in PPMS and SPMS patients in the U.S. SPRINT-MS is a Phase 2, randomized, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the safety and tolerability of ibudilast (up t o 100 mg/day) over two years in PPMS and SPMS patients. Recruitment and enrollment at 28 medical centers in the U.S. commenced in late 2013 and randomization of 255 subjects was completed in June 2015. T he trial is expected to be completed in 2017. 

Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS): ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig&#8217;s disease, is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord. The nerves lose the ability to trigger specific muscles, which causes the muscles to become weak. As a result, ALS affects voluntary movement and patients in the later stages of the disease may become totally paralyzed. Life expectancy of an ALS patient is usually 2-5 years. According to the ALS Association, there are approximately 30,000 ALS patients in the U.S. and approximately 5,600 people in the U.S. are diagnosed with ALS each year. Riluzole is the only pharmaceutical treatment approved for ALS in the U.S., but it has limited efficacy. We are working with Carolinas Neuromuscular/ALS-MDA Center at Carolinas HealthCare System Neurosciences Institute, which is conducting an ongoing clinical trial of ibudilast in ALS. The trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study which includes a six-month treatment period followed by a six-month open-label extension. The study will evaluate several efficacy endpoints in addition to monitoring the safety and tolerability of MN-166 (ibudilast) 60 mg/day versus placebo when administered in combination with riluzole in 60 subjects with ALS. Subject enrollment began in October 2014. In February 2015, we announced that the ALS study had enrolled 30 of the 60 subjects planned for participation. In September 2015, we announced that the first advanced ALS patient, using non-invasive ventilation (NIV), enrolled in the ongoing ALS study. We amended the protocol to expand its recruitment to include advanced ALS patients in the trial. The amended protocol plans enrollment of 60 advanced ALS patients with NIV support in the study in addition to 60 patients without NIV support. In December 2015, we announced that the FDA granted Fast Track designation to MN-166 (ibudilast) for the treatment of patients with ALS. 

Methamphetamine addiction: Methamphetamine (MA) is a central nervous system stimulant drug that is similar in structure to amphetamine. It is a Schedule II drug, meaning that it has high abuse potential and low therapeutic potential. According to the SAMHSA 2014 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, there are approximately 569,000 current MA abusers age 12 and older in the U.S. According to the Rand Corporation, the national estimate of the economic burden of MA use, based on the most recent year for which data are available, is approximately $23.4 billion. Currently, there is no pharmaceutical treatment approved for MA dependence. Based on non-clinical results with ibudilast&#8217;s effects in an animal model of MA relapse, investigators at UCLA conducted a Phase 1b clinical trial funded by NIDA to examine the safety and preliminary efficacy of ibudilast in non-treatment-seeking, MA-dependent users in an inpatient trial that was completed in 2012. Subsequently, UCLA investigators received NIDA grant funding for an ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial that commenced in 2013 for evaluation of ibudilast in MA-dependent users in an outpatient trial setting. 

We were granted Fast Track designation from the FDA for ibudilast for the treatment of MA dependence in February 2013. Fast track designation is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs that are intended to treat serious diseases and have the potential to fill an unmet medical need. An important feature of the FDA&#8217;s Fast Track program is that it emphasizes early and frequent communication between the FDA and the sponsor throughout the entire drug development and review process to improve the efficiency of product development. Accordingly, Fast Track status can potentially lead to a shortened timeline to ultimate drug approval.

Opioid withdrawal and dependency: According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration&#8217;s (SAMHSA) 2014 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, there are approximately 1.9 million people age 12 or older with pain reliever use disorder (includes those with dependence or abuse) and approximately 586,000 people age 12 or older with heroin use disorder (includes those with dependence or abuse) in the U.S. Access to prescription opioids has recently become more difficult due to more stringent policies on prescribing opioids. An unintended consequence of this policy is increased use of heroin. Heroin is attractive to prescription opioid addicts because it is cheaper and more accessible than prescription opioids. Heroin poses serious health issues, such as risk of HIV and Hepatitis C infection, overdose and death (Knopf, 2012). The economic costs of nonmedical use of prescription opioids in the U.S. in 2006 (Hansen et al. , 2011) was estimated to total more than $50 billion annually; lost productivity and crime accounted for 94% of the total economic burden. There is an urgent, significant unmet medical need for a safe, effective non-addictive, non-opioid therapy for the treatment of prescription opioid and heroin addiction. In 2010, investigators at Columbia University and NYSPI completed a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled in-unit Phase 1b/2a clinical trial to evaluate the ability of ibudilast to reduce opioid withdrawal symptoms in humans. The trial was funded by NIDA. Subsequently, investigators at Columbia/NYSPI commenced a NINDA-funded Phase 2a clinical trial of ibudilast for the treatment of prescription opioid dependency. In August 2014, we announced positive interim results of this ongoing study and data from this study was presented at the 77th Annual Meeting of the College on Problems of Drug Dependence (CPDD) in June 2015. 

Alcohol addiction: According to SAMHSA&#8217;s 2014 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, there are approximately 17.0 million people with alcohol use disorder (includes those with dependence or abuse) aged 12 and older in the U.S. The Centers for 

Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that alcohol abuse costs the U.S. $2 49 billion in 2010 , the latest year for which complete data are ava ilable. Currently, medicines approved by the FDA to treat alcohol dependence include Antabuse &#174; , Vivitrol &#174; , Campral &#174; and Revia &#174; . However, the search for a safe and effective drug remains elusive due to limited success of these FDA-approved compounds (Witkiewitz et al ., 2012). In a non-clinical trial (Bell et al ., 2013), i budilast was examined in rats and mice and was found to reduce alcohol drinking in alcohol-preferring P rats and high-alcohol drinking (HAD1) rats by 50%, and in mice made dependent o n alcohol at doses which had no effect on non-dependent mice. Concurrently, investigators at UCLA received funding from the NIAAA to initiate a Phase 2a study to evaluate ibudilast in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled within-subject crossover design to determine the safety, tolerability and initial human laboratory efficacy of ibudilast in a sample of 24 non-treatment seeking individuals with either alcohol abuse or dependence. Participants will be treated with ibudilast and placebo. The study was initiated in early 2014 and completed enrollment of 24 subjects June 2015. R esults of the alcohol dependence study were presented at the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology (ACNP)&#8217;s 54th Annual Meeting in December 2015 . MN-166 (i budilast ) , bu t not placebo, significantly decreased basal, daily alcohol craving over the course of the study ( p &#60;0.05) . MN-166 (i budilast ) did not affect cue- and stress-induced alcohol craving. H owever, MN-166 (i budilast ) increased positive mood during both the cue r eactivity and stress procedures . MN-166 (i budilast ) was safe and well-tolerated during the study . 

MN-221 (bedoradrine)

MN-221 (bedoradrine) is a novel, highly selective &#223; 2 -adrenergic receptor agonist being developed for the treatment of acute exacerbations of asthma. We licensed MN-221 from Kissei Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Kissei) in February 2004. Current inhaled beta-agonist treatments for asthma exacerbations are limited by bronchoconstriction or insufficient airflow due to inflammation and airway constriction, which reduces the amount of inhaled drug that can get into the lungs. In addition, the amount of inhaled treatments a patient can tolerate is limited due to the potential for cardiovascular side effects ( e.g. increased heart rate).

MN-221 is designed to treat acute exacerbations of asthma via intravenous (i.v.) infusion, bypassing constricted airways to deliver the drug directly to the lungs. Preclinical studies showed MN-221 to have a high affinity for the &#223; 2 -adrenergic receptor, found primarily in the lungs, and a much lower affinity for the &#223; 1 -adrenergic receptor found primarily in cardiac tissue. MN-221&#8217;s improved delivery to the lungs and its cardiac safety profile may help fill an unmet need for patients with acute exacerbations of asthma, helping them to breathe easier and avoid a costly hospital stay.

Acute Exacerbation of Asthma: According to the most recent data available from the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics, there were 1.75 million emergency department visits, 439,000 hospitalizations, and 3,404 deaths due to asthma in 2010. According to the U.S. National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, the direct costs associated with hospital care due to asthma were estimated at $5.5 billion in the U.S. in 2010. Nearly 10% of hospitalized patients have life-threatening asthma that requires admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). 

We completed a Phase 2b randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial (N=175) evaluating MN-221 in patients with acute exacerbations of asthma in the emergency department setting. MN-221 did not statistically meet the primary endpoint, improvement in FEV 1 (Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second) compared to placebo. However, MN-221 showed a significant benefit over placebo for FEV 1 (liters) Area Under the Curve (AUCHr 0-1,0-2,0-3 ) of change from baseline (p=0.043, p=0.050, p=0.066 respectively). The trial also demonstrated a reduction in hospital admissions with MN-221 added to standard drug treatments. Moreover, there was a significant improvement in clinical symptoms with MN-221-treated patients, and the safety profile of MN-221 continues to be positive as no safety/tolerability issues of clinical significance were observed.

In October 2012 we met with the FDA to review future development of this product candidate. The FDA identified the risk/benefit profile of MN-221 as a focal point for further development and advised that a clinical outcome, such as a reduction in hospitalizations, would need to be a pivotal trial primary endpoint. We have decided that future MN-221 development will be designed based on the feedback received from the FDA and that any future MN-221 clinical trial development for asthma will be partner-dependent from a funding perspective.

MN-001 (tipelukast)

MN-001 (tipelukast) is a novel, orally bioavailable small molecule compound which exerts its effects through several mechanisms to produce its anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory activity in preclinical models, including leukotriene (LT) receptor antagonism, inhibition of PDEs (mainly 3 and 4), and inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO). The 5-LO/LT pathway has been postulated as a pathogenic factor in fibrosis development and MN-001 (tipelukast)&#8217;s inhibitory effect on 5-LO and the 5-LO/LT pathway is considered to be a novel approach to treat fibrosis. MN-001 (tipelukast) has been shown to down-regulate expression of genes that promote fibrosis including LOXL2, Collagen Type 1 and TIMP-1. MN-001 (tipelukast) has also been shown to down-regulate expression of genes that promote inflammation including CCR2 and MCP-1. In addition, histopathological data shows that MN-001 (tipelukast) reduces fibrosis in multiple animal models. We licensed MN-001 (tipelukast) from Kyorin in 2002. In addition to granting 

MN-001 (tipelukast) Fast -Track designation for the treatment of NASH with fibrosis, the FDA has also granted MN-001 (tipelukast) Orphan-Drug designation and Fast-Track designation for treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). 

Previously, we evaluated MN-001 (tipelukast) for its potential clinical efficacy in asthma and completed a Phase 2 study in asthma with positive results. MN-001 (tipelukast) has been exposed to more than 600 subjects and is considered generally safe and well-tolerated.

Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) : Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a condition in which there is fat in the liver along with inflammation and damage to liver cells. NASH is a common liver disease that resembles alcoholic liver disease but occurs in people who drink little or no alcohol. According to the U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), NASH prevalence in the U.S. is 2-5%, and an additional 10-20% of Americans have "fatty liver." The underlying cause of NASH is unclear, but it most often occurs in persons who are middle-aged and overweight or obese. Many patients with NASH have elevated serum lipids, diabetes or pre-diabetes. Progression of NASH can lead to liver cirrhosis. Liver transplantation is the only treatment for advanced cirrhosis with liver failure. At this time, there is no treatment for NASH. We completed a pre-clinical study evaluating MN-001 (tipelukast)&#8217;s potential clinical efficacy for the treatment of NASH. MN-001 (tipelukast) administered orally once daily (10, 30, and 100 mg/kg for three weeks) was evaluated in the STAM&#8482; (NASH-HCC) mouse model of NASH, as measured by liver biochemistry and histopathology, NAFLD activity score (NAS), and percent of fibrosis and gene expression. MN-001 (tipelukast), in a dose-dependent manner, significantly reduced fibrosis area compared with placebo (p&#60;0.01) as demonstrated by a reduction in liver hydroxyproline content, supporting MN-001 (tipelukast)&#8217;s anti-fibrotic properties. MN-001 (tipelukast) significantly improved NAS (p&#60;0.01). MN-001 (tipelukast), in this animal model, improved NASH pathology by inhibiting hepatocyte damage (p&#60;0.01) and ballooning (p&#60;0.01). At the same time, MN-001 (tipelukast) was also shown to reduce certain gene expression levels in the liver, thus implying that MN-001 (tipelukast) prevents the formation of fibrosis in the NASH model. We completed a second preclinical study that examined the potential clinical efficacy of MN-001 (tipelukast) for the treatment of advanced NASH. This study used mice in more advanced stages of NASH as compared to the first study of MN-001 (tipelukast) in a NASH mouse model. MN-001 (tipelukast) showed anti-NASH and anti-fibrotic effects in the advanced NASH mouse model. NAFLD activity score was significantly reduced in the MN-001 (tipelukast) treated group compared to the non-treated group (p&#60;0.001). The reduction was observed consistently in all NAS components including hepatocyte ballooning score (p&#60;0.001), lobular inflammation score (p&#60;0.01), and steatosis score (p&#60;0.05). Percent fibrosis area was also reduced in the MN-001 (tipelukast) treated group (p&#60;0.01). In addition, alpha-SMA-positive staining area was significantly reduced in the MN-001 treated group (p&#60;0.001). Collectively, these results provide compelling evidence that MN-001 (tipelukast) warrants further evaluation for the treatment of NASH in humans. We have an open IND and the FDA has approved two different Phase 2 clinical trial protocols, one of which targets NASH patients with hypertriglyceridemia, for MN-001 (tipelukast) for the treatment of NASH in the U.S. We have initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial to investigate MN-001 (tipelukast) for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia in NASH patients. The FDA has granted Fast Track designation to MN-001 (tipelukast) for the treatment of patients with NASH with fibrosis. 

Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF): Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a progressive disease characterized by scarring of the lungs that thickens the lining, causing an irreversible loss of the tissue's ability to transport oxygen. The causes of PF vary and can be due to anti-cancer drug therapy or exposure to chemicals. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is one type of PF without a clear cause. According to the Pulmonary Fibrosis Foundation, IPF affects between 132,000 &#8211; 200,000 people in the U.S., and an estimated 50,000 new cases are diagnosed annually. The prognosis for IPF is poor with a median survival of only two to three years following diagnosis and more than two-thirds of IPF patients die within five years. We completed a pre-clinical study evaluating MN-001 (tipelukast)&#8217;s potential clinical efficacy for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis. MN-001 (tipelukast), which was administered orally once daily (30, 100 and 300 mg/kg) for 2 weeks, was evaluated in a mouse model of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis (PF) as measured by CT evaluation of lung density, degree of pulmonary fibrosis using the Ashcroft score based on histopathological staining, and hydroxyproline content, which is an indicator of fibrosis or storage of collagen in tissue. MN-001 (tipelukast) significantly decreased the Ashcroft score compared to Vehicle group (p&#60;0.05) after 2 weeks of treatment and MN-001 (tipelukast) reduced lung density when compared to the Vehicle-treated group. Moreover, lung hydroxyproline content was significantly reduced compared to the Vehicle group (p&#60;0.01). These results show that treatment with MN-001 (tipelukast) has significant anti-fibrogenic effects in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice. We have an open IND and FDA has approved a Phase 2 clinical trial protocol for MN-001 (tipelukast) for the treatment of moderate to severe IPF in the U.S. We have initiated this Phase 2 clinical trial of MN-001 (tipelukast) to treat moderate to severe IPF at Penn State. The FDA has granted orphan-drug designation to MN-001 (tipelukast) for treatment of IPF. Orphan-drug designation will provide MediciNova with seven years of marketing exclusivity for MN-001 (tipelukast) for the treatment of IPF if it is approved for this indication. The FDA has also granted Fast Track designation to MN-001 (tipelukast) for the treatment of patients with IPF. 

MN-029 ( d enibulin) 

MN-029 (denibulin) is a novel tubulin binding agent (TBA) under development for the treatment of solid tumors. It exerts its activity through reversible inhibition of tubulin polymerization resulting in disruption of the cell cytoskeleton, which causes the cancer cells to deform in shape and ultimately leads to extensive central necrosis of the solid tumor. We licensed MN-029 from Angiogene Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. (Angiogene) in 2002.

Several preclinical pharmacology studies have assessed the mechanism of action and anti-tumor activity of MN-029 in vivo in rodent models of breast adenocarcinoma, colon carcinoma, lung carcinoma and KHT sarcoma. In these studies, MN-029 damaged poorly formed tumor blood vessels by weakening tumor blood vessel walls and causing leakage, clotting and eventual vascular shutdown within the tumor, in addition to the direct effect over tumor cells. These studies suggest that MN-029 acts quickly and is rapidly cleared from the body, which may reduce the potential for some adverse effects commonly associated with chemotherapy. Shutdown of tumor blood flow in tumor models was confirmed through the use of dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. In two Phase I clinical studies we conducted, MN-029 was well-tolerated at doses that reduced tumor blood flow.

The first Phase 1 trial determined the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) level of single doses of MN-029 given every three weeks in 34 subjects with refractory cancer. The MTD was determined to be 180 mg/m 2 and appeared to be safe as a single i.v. dose administered every three weeks for as many as 25 cycles. There were no clinically significant changes in routine laboratory assessments, vital signs, or ECG monitoring. The most commonly reported adverse events (AEs) were similar to others chemotherapies&#8212;vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, and fatigue. There were a total of nine serious adverse events (SAEs) and study discontinuations due to AEs. In a preliminary evaluation of anti-tumor activity, no patient had a complete response or partial response; however stable disease was seen in 12 patients. MN-029 had a desired vascular effect in seven of 11 patients that were administered drug at dose levels of &#179; 120 mg/m 2 . Nine patients continued into extended cycles of treatment.

The second Phase 1 study was conducted to determine the safety, tolerability and MTD of single doses of MN-029 given every seven days for a total of three doses (Days 1, 8 and 15), followed by 13-day recovery (Days 16-28) in subjects with advanced/metastatic solid tumor cancer. Subjects who tolerated treatment with MN-029 could receive additional cycles. All 20 subjects reported at least one AE related to study drug. The most common AEs considered related to study drug were vomiting, nausea, arthralgia and headache. There were no clinically significant changes in routine laboratory assessments, vital signs or ECG monitoring. There was one SAE considered unrelated to study drug. Consistent with the previous Phase 1 trial, MN-029 up to dose levels of 180 mg/m 2 appeared to be safe and well tolerated. One subject had a partial response which lasted for 74 days. Stable disease was observed in seven subjects. The results suggested an effect of MN-029 on vascular perfusion; however, a larger sample size is warranted.

In January 2014, we were granted a new patent from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office which covers MN-029 (denibulin) di-hydrochloride. The patent, which will expire no earlier than July 2032, has claims that cover a compound, pharmaceutical composition and method of treating certain cell proliferation diseases, including solid tumors, based on denibulin di-hydrochloride. We have filed patent applications based on this U.S. patent in certain foreign countries, and some of them have been granted. We plan to pursue further development of MN-029 for the treatment of solid tumors.

Sales and Marketing 

We currently have no marketing and sales capabilities and we expect to rely on a strategic partner to complete late stage product development and commercialize our products.

Manufacturing

We rely on third parties to manufacture bulk active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) and finished investigational products for research, development, preclinical and clinical trials. We expect to continue to rely on third-party manufacturers for the manufacture of the API and finished products for our clinical and any future commercial production requirements. We believe that there are several manufacturing sources available at commercially reasonable terms to meet our clinical requirements and any future commercial production requirements for the API of our products and the finished drug products.

For the MN-166 (ibudilast) development program, we have sourced and imported delayed-release ibudilast capsules, marketed in Japan as Pinatos &#174; , from Taisho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Taisho).

Pursuant to the terms of our license agreement with Kissei for MN-221, Kissei has the exclusive right to manufacture the commercial supply of the API for MN-221. If we enter into a supply agreement with Kissei, we will purchase from Kissei all API that we require for the commercial supply of MN-221, if such product candidate is approved for commercial sale by the FDA or other regulatory authorities.

Intellectual Property and License Agreements

Since our inception in September 2000, we have entered into license agreements with pharmaceutical companies which cover our current product candidates. We have also entered into license agreements with universities, including the University of Colorado, which cover additional intellectual property related to our product candidates. In general, we seek to procure patent protection for our anticipated products, or obtain such protection from the relevant patents owned by our licensors. We hold licensed rights under two issued and active U.S. patents. We also hold licensed rights to 52 issued foreign patents corresponding to these U.S. patents. In addition to these licensed rights, we hold 20 issued U.S. patents and have filed 11 additional U.S. patent applications. We also hold 57 issued and pending foreign patents and applications corresponding to these U.S. patents and patent applications. We are not aware of any third-party infringement of the patents owned or licensed by us and are not party to any material claims by third parties of infringement by us of such third parties&#8217; intellectual property rights. The following is a description of our existing license agreements and intellectual property rights for each of our product candidates.

MN-166 (ibudilast)

On October 22, 2004, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Kyorin for the development and commercialization of MN-166 (ibudilast). Kyorin is a fully integrated Japanese pharmaceutical company and is listed on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. We obtained an exclusive, worldwide (excluding Japan, China, South Korea and Taiwan), sub-licensable license to the patent rights and know-how related to MN-166 (ibudilast) for the treatment of MS, except for ophthalmic solution formulations. MN-166 (ibudilast) is not covered by a composition of matter patent. The U.S. method of use patent for MN-166 (ibudilast) in MS underlying the license is set to expire on August 10, 2018. Corresponding method of use patents in certain foreign countries are set to expire on August 10, 2018. Under the terms of the agreement, we granted to Kyorin an exclusive, royalty-free, sub-licensable license to use the preclinical, clinical and regulatory databases to develop ophthalmic products incorporating the MN-166 (ibudilast) compound anywhere in the world and non-ophthalmic products incorporating the MN-166 (ibudilast) compound outside of our territory.

The license agreement may be terminated by either party following an uncured breach of any material provision in the agreement by the other party. We may terminate the agreement for any reason with 90 days&#8217; written notice to Kyorin or, in the event that a third party claims that MN-166 (ibudilast) infringes upon such third party&#8217;s intellectual property rights, with 30 days&#8217; written notice.

The term of this agreement is determined on a country-by-country basis and extends until the later of the expiration of the obligation to make payments under the agreement or the last date on which the manufacture, use or sale of the product would infringe a valid patent claim held by Kyorin but for the license granted by the agreement or the last date of the applicable market exclusivity period. In the absence of a valid patent claim and generic competition in a particular country, the agreement will expire on the earlier of five years from the date of the first commercial sale of the product by us or the end of the second consecutive calendar quarter in which generic competition exists in such country.

Under the license agreement, we have paid Kyorin $700,000 to date, and we are obligated to make payments of up to $5.0 million based on the achievement of certain clinical and regulatory milestones. We are also obligated to pay a royalty on net sales of the licensed products. 

We own, co-own or hold licenses to six issued U.S. patents and four pending U.S. patent applications as well as 29 issued and pending foreign patent applications covering MN-166 (ibudilast) and its analogs. These patents and patent applications are primarily related to our development portfolio of small molecule-based products and are currently directed to methods of treating various indications using ibudilast and its analogs.

We have been granted a U.S. patent which covers the use of MN-166 (ibudilast) for the treatment of progressive forms of MS. The patent, which was granted in March 2012, will expire no earlier than November 2029, not including a potential extension under patent term restoration rules, and covers a method of treating PPMS or SPMS by administering ibudilast either alone or in combination with other drugs. Counterparts of this patent application have been granted in certain foreign jurisdictions. We have been granted a patent which covers the use of MN-166 (ibudilast) for the treatment of neuropathic pain in the U.S. and it expires no earlier than December 2025. We have been granted a patent which covers the use of MN-166 (ibudilast) for the treatment of drug addiction or drug dependence or withdrawal syndrome in the U.S. and it expires no earlier than January 2030. Counterparts of this patent application have been granted in certain foreign jurisdictions. We have been granted a patent that covers the use of MN-166 (ibudilast) to enhance opioid analgesia in acute pain settings from the European Patent Office (EPO) and it expires no earlier than January 2028.

MN-221 (bedoradrine)

On February 25, 2004, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Kissei for the development and commercialization of MN-221. Kissei is a fully integrated Japanese pharmaceutical company and is listed on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. We obtained an exclusive, worldwide (excluding Japan), sub-licensable license to various patent rights and know-how related to MN-221 and other compounds disclosed or included in, or covered by, these patent rights, for all indications. This license includes an exclusive license under one U.S. patent and certain corresponding patents in foreign countries and is sub-licensable upon receipt of the written consent of Kissei. The U.S. patent for MN-221 has composition of matter and method of use claims. The U.S. composition of matter patent underlying the license issued on October 17, 2000 and is set to expire no earlier than February 18, 2017, which does not include a potential extension under patent term restoration rules. Corresponding composition of matter patents in various other countries are set to expire no earlier than February 18, 2017.

In addition to the licensed patents, we have filed patent applications in the U.S. and certain foreign countries regarding additional uses and formulations of MN-221. We have been granted a U.S. patent which covers the use of MN-221 for the treatment of acute exacerbations of asthma and it expires no earlier than November 2030. This patent includes claims covering the use of MN-221 (bedoradrine) in combination with a standard of care treatment regimen and covers different routes of administration, including intravenous, oral and inhalation. Counterparts of this patent application are pending in certain foreign jurisdictions. We have been granted a U.S. patent that covers the use of MN-221 for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome and it expires no earlier than April 2031.

The license agreement may be terminated by either party following an uncured breach of any material provision in the agreement by the other party, and we may terminate the agreement for scientific or commercial reasons upon 100 days&#8217; prior written notice to Kissei during the development phase and 180 days&#8217; prior written notice to Kissei during the commercialization phase.

The term of the agreement is determined on a country-by-country basis and extends until the expiration of the last Kissei patent (or equivalent) under license to expire or in the event that a valid claim does not exist or, if a valid claim expired more than ten years from the date of first commercial sale, ten years from the date of first commercial sale. In either case, the term of the agreement would not extend for any particular country past the date on which generic competition exists in such country.

Under the license agreement, we have paid Kissei $1.0 million to date, and we are obligated to make payments of up to $17.0 million based on the achievement of certain clinical and regulatory milestones. We are also obligated to pay a royalty on net sales of the licensed products. Under the terms of the letter agreement we entered into with Kissei in September 2011, we agreed to renegotiate in good faith with Kissei the existing levels of the milestone payment amounts and royalty rates.

MN-001 (tipelukast)

On March 14, 2002, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Kyorin for the development and commercialization of MN-001 (tipelukast). We obtained an exclusive, worldwide (excluding Japan, China, South Korea and Taiwan) sub-licensable license to the patent rights and know-how related to MN-001 (tipelukast) and its active metabolite, MN-002, disclosed and included in, or covered by, these patents, in all indications, except for ophthalmic solution formulations. This license includes an exclusive, sub-licensable license under two U.S. patents and certain corresponding patents in foreign countries. The U.S. composition of matter 

patent for MN-001 (tipelukast) underlying the license expired on February 23, 2009, and the U.S. composition of matter patent for MN-002 underlying the license expired on December 30, 2 011. Foreign composition of matter patents for MN-001 (tipelukast) and MN-002 have also expired. We have been granted 11 U.S. patents covering certain compositions, uses and manufacturing processes associated with MN-001 (tipelukast) and MN-002. Some of th e uses covered by these patents include non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) , non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) , steatosis, ulcerative colitis, and irritable bowel syndrome. We also received a notice of allowance in January 2016 for a pending U.S. patent application which covers MN-001 (tipelukast) and MN-002 for the treatment of advanced NASH with fibrosis. Patent applications corresponding to these U.S. patents were filed in certain foreign countries and some of the foreign patents have issued. 

Under the terms of the agreement, we granted to Kyorin an exclusive, royalty-free, sub-licensable license to use the preclinical, clinical and regulatory databases to develop ophthalmic products incorporating MN-001 (tipelukast) anywhere in the world and non-ophthalmic products incorporating MN-001 (tipelukast) outside of our territory. The license agreement may be terminated by either party following an uncured breach of any material provision in the agreement by the other party, and we may terminate the agreement for any reason with 90 days&#8217; written notice to Kyorin or, in the event that a third party claims that the licensed patent rights or know-how infringe upon such third party&#8217;s intellectual property rights, with 30 days&#8217; written notice.

The term of this agreement is determined on a country-by-country basis and extends until the later of the expiration of the obligation to make payments under the agreement or the last date on which the manufacture, use or sale of the product would infringe a valid patent claim held by Kyorin but for the license granted by the agreement or the last date of the applicable market exclusivity period. In the absence of a valid patent claim and generic competition in a particular country, the agreement will expire on the earlier of five years from the date of the first commercial sale of the product by us or the end of the second consecutive calendar quarter in which generic competition exists in such country.

Under the license agreement, we have paid Kyorin $4.0 million to date, and we are obligated to make payments of up to $5.0 million based on the achievement of certain clinical and regulatory milestones. We are also obligated to pay a royalty on net sales of the licensed products.

MN-029 (denibulin)

On June 19, 2002, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Angiogene for the development and commercialization of the ANG-600 series of compounds. Angiogene is a privately held, British drug discovery company. We obtained an exclusive, worldwide, sub-licensable license to the patent rights and know-how related to the ANG-600 series of compounds disclosed in and included or covered by these patents for all indications. MN-029 is one of the ANG-600 series compounds covered by this license. We have been granted a U.S. patent which covers MN-029 (denibulin) di-hydrochloride and expires no earlier than July 2032. The allowed claims cover a compound, pharmaceutical composition and method of treating certain cell proliferation diseases, including solid tumors, based on denibulin di-hydrochloride. Patent applications corresponding to this U.S. patent were filed in certain foreign countries and patents have been granted or allowed in some of those countries.

The license agreement may be terminated by either party following an uncured breach of any material provision in the agreement by the other party, and we may terminate the agreement at any time by giving 30 days&#8217; advance written notice to Angiogene.

The term of this agreement is determined on a country-by-country basis and extends until the earlier of the expiration of the last Angiogene patent (or equivalent) under license which has a valid claim to expire or 15 years from the date of first commercial sale.

Under the license agreement, we have paid Angiogene $1.4 million to date and are obligated to make payments of up to $16.5 million based on the achievement of certain clinical and regulatory milestones. We are also obligated to pay a royalty on net sales of the licensed products.

General

Our proposed commercial activities may conflict with patents which have been or may be granted to competitors, universities and/or others. Third parties could bring legal action against us, our licensors or our sub-licensees claiming patent infringement and could seek damages or enjoin manufacturing and marketing of the affected product or its use or the use of a process for the manufacturing of such products. If any such actions were to be successful, in addition to any potential liability for indemnification, damages and attorneys&#8217; fees in certain cases, we could be required to obtain a license, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, in order to continue to manufacture, use or market the affected product. We also rely upon unpatented proprietary technology because, in some cases, our interests would be better served by reliance on trade secrets or confidentiality agreements than by patents. However, others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or gain access to or disclose such proprietary technology. We may not be able to meaningfully protect our rights in such 

unpatented proprietary technology. We may also conduct research on other pharmaceutical compounds or technologies, the rights to which may be held by, or be subject to patent rights of, third parties. Accordingly, if products based on such research are commercialized, such commercial activities may infringe patents or other rights, which may require us to obtain a lice nse to such patents or other rights. We are not aware of any third-party infringements of patents we hold or licenses and have not received any material claims by third parties of infringement by us of such parties&#8217; intellectual property rights. 

There can be no assurance that patent applications filed by us or others, in which we have an interest as assignee, licensee or prospective licensee, will result in patents being issued or that, if issued, any of such patents will afford protection against competitors with similar technology or products or could not be circumvented or challenged. For example, we have U.S. patents covering the method of using MN-166 (ibudilast) to treat MS and progressive MS, the method of using MN-166 (ibudilast) to treat addiction and the method of using MN-166 (ibudilast) to treat neuropathic pain, but we do not have any composition of matter patent claims for MN-166 (ibudilast) because that patent has expired. As a result, unrelated third parties may develop products with the same API as MN-166 (ibudilast) so long as such parties do not infringe our method of use patents, other patents we have exclusive rights to through our licensor or any patents we may obtain for MN-166 (ibudilast).

In addition, if we develop certain products that are not covered by any patents, we will be dependent on obtaining market exclusivity under the five-year new chemical entity exclusivity provisions of Hatch-Waxman Act for such products in the U.S. and/or 10-year data exclusivity provisions in Europe. If we are unable to obtain strong proprietary protection for our products after obtaining regulatory approval, competitors may be able to market competing generic products by taking advantage of an abbreviated procedure for obtaining regulatory clearance, including the ability to demonstrate bioequivalency to our product(s) without being required to conduct lengthy clinical trials. Certain of our license agreements provide for reduced royalties or, in some cases, foregone royalties in the event of generic competition.

Competition

The development and commercialization of new drugs is extremely competitive and characterized by extensive research efforts and rapid technological progress. Competition in our industry occurs on a variety of fronts, including developing and bringing new products to market before others, developing new products to provide the same benefits as existing products at lower cost and developing new products to provide benefits superior to those of existing products. We face competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as numerous academic and research institutions and governmental agencies in the U.S. and abroad. Some of these competitors have products or are pursuing the development of drugs that target the same diseases and conditions that are the focus of our product development programs. Many of our competitors have products that have been approved or are in advanced development and may succeed in developing drugs that are more effective, safer and more affordable or more easily administered than ours or that achieve patent protection or commercialization sooner than our products. Our competitors may also develop alternative therapies that could further limit the market for any products that we are able to obtain approval for, if at all.

In many of our target disease areas, potential competitors are working to develop new compounds with different mechanisms of action and attractive efficacy and safety profiles. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, research and development resources (including personnel and technology), clinical trial experience, manufacturing, sales and marketing capabilities and production facilities than we do. Smaller companies also may prove to be significant competitors, particularly through proprietary research discoveries and collaboration arrangements with large pharmaceutical and established biotechnology companies.

MN-166 (ibudilast) for Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (Progressive MS)

Our MN-166 (ibudilast) product candidate is in development for the treatment of progressive MS. Only one drug, mitoxantrone, is approved for treating progressive MS. However, mitoxantrone cannot be used on a long-term basis because of the potential for cardiac toxicity. Other programs in clinical development for progressive MS include Roche&#8217;s ocrelizumab, Novartis&#8217;s BAF312 (siponimod), and AB Science&#8217;s masitinib.

MN-166 (ibudilast) for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)

Our MN-166 (ibudilast) product candidate is in development for the treatment of ALS. Only one drug, riluzole, is approved for treating ALS, and it has limited efficacy. We are aware of additional compounds in clinical development for the treatment of ALS at other companies including Cytokinetics, BrainStorm Cell Therapeutics Inc. and AB Science.

MN-166 (ibudilast) for Drug Addiction

Our MN-166 (ibudilast) product candidate has been in development for treatment of opioid withdrawal and dependence, methamphetamine addiction, and alcohol dependence. Current treatments for opioid withdrawal symptoms include narcotics such as generic methadone and Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals, Inc.&#8217;s Subutex &#174; (buprenorphine) and Suboxone &#174; (buprenorphine + the 

opioid antagonist naloxone). Other products approved for opioid dependence include Al kermes&#8217; Vivitrol &#174; (naltrexone monthly injection), Orexo&#8217;s Zubsolv &#174; (buprenorphine and naloxone), and BioDelivery Sciences&#8217;s Bunavail &#174; (buprenorphine and naloxone). We are aware of additional compounds in development for the treatment of opioid dependence a t companies including Titan Pharmaceuticals. Limited non-narcotic drug candidates for opioid withdrawal symptoms exist. Britannia Pharmaceuticals Limited&#8217;s BritLofex &#174; (Lofexidine), licensed for development in U.S. clinical trials to US WorldMeds LLC, is an &#97; 2 adrenergic receptor agonist like clonidine which may have somewhat less orthostatic hypotension limitations. There are no pharmaceuticals currently approved for the treatment of methamphetamine addiction. Current treatments for alcohol dependence incl ude Antabuse &#174; (disulfiram), Vivitrol &#174; (naltrexone), Campral &#174; (acamprosate), and Revia &#174; (naltrexone). We are aware of additional compounds in de velopment for the treatment of alcohol dependence at other companies including XenoPort, Inc. 

MN-221 (bedoradrine) for Acute Exacerbations of Asthma

Our MN-221 product candidate is being developed for the treatment of acute exacerbations of asthma in the emergency room setting. The current standard of care for acute exacerbations of asthma is inhaled albuterol (a &#223; 2 &#160;-adrenergic receptor agonist), inhaled ipratropium (an anticholinergic) and oral or injected corticosteroids. In addition, subcutaneously administered terbutaline (a &#223; 2 -adrenergic receptor agonist) is sometimes used to treat this condition, particularly in pediatric patients.

MN-001 (tipelukast) for Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH)

Our MN-001 (tipelukast) product candidate is being developed for the treatment of NASH. There are currently no therapeutic products approved for the treatment of NASH. We are aware of compounds in clinical development for the treatment of NASH at other companies including Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Genfit, Galectin Therapeutics, Gilead Sciences, Tobira Therapeutics, Galmed Pharmaceuticals and Conatus Pharmaceuticals.

MN-001 (tipelukast) for Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF)

Our MN-001 (tipelukast) product candidate is also being developed for the treatment of IPF. Products approved in the U.S. for treatment of IPF include Roche&#8217;s (formerly InterMune) Esbriet &#174; (pirfenidone) and Boehringer Ingelheim&#8217;s OFEV &#174; (nintedanib). Other companies working on clinical development programs for treatment of IPF include MedImmune (AstraZeneca) and FibroGen.

MN-029 (denibulin) for Solid Tumor Cancer

Our MN-029 product candidate is being developed for the treatment of solid tumor cancers. Genentech&#8217;s Kadcyla &#174; , a HER2-targeted antibody and microtubule inhibitor conjugate, is approved for treatment of patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who previously were treated with trastuzumab and/or a taxane. Bayer&#8217;s Stivarga &#174; , a kinase inhibitor approved for metastatic colorectal cancer, was also approved for patients with advanced, unresectable (not subject to surgical removal) or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor. We are aware of additional compounds in development for the treatment of solid tumor cancers at companies including Eli Lilly &#38; Company, Hoffmann-La Roche, Novartis AG, and Celgene.

Government Regulation

Government authorities in the U.S. and other countries extensively regulate the research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution, sampling, marketing and import and export of pharmaceutical products and biologics such as those we are developing. In the U.S., the FDA, under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended, and other federal statutes and regulations, subjects pharmaceutical products to extensive and rigorous review. Any failure to comply with applicable requirements, both before and after approval, may subject us, our third-party manufacturers, contractors, suppliers and partners to administrative and judicial sanctions, such as a delay in approving or refusal to approve pending applications, fines, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of manufacturing or marketing, injunctions and/or criminal prosecution.

U.S. Regulatory Approval 

Overview. In the U.S., drugs and drug testing are regulated by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, as well as state and local government authorities. All of our product candidates in development will require regulatory approval by government agencies prior to commercialization. To obtain approval of a new product from the FDA, we must, among other requirements, submit data supporting safety and efficacy, as well as detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product and proposed labeling. Our product candidates are in the early stages of testing and none has been approved. The steps required before a drug can be approved generally involve the following: 

&#160;

&#183; 

completion of nonclinical laboratory, animal studies, and formulation studies; 

&#160;

&#183; 

submission of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin in the U.S.; 

&#160;

&#183; 

completion of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each indication for which approval is sought; 

&#160;

&#183; 

submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application (NDA) accompanied by a substantial user fee; 

&#160;

&#183; 

development of manufacturing processes which conform to FDA-mandated commercial good manufacturing practices (cGMPs) and satisfactory completion of FDA inspections to assess cGMP compliance and clinical investigator compliance with good clinical practices; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

FDA review and approval of an NDA, which process may involve input from advisory committees to the FDA and may include post-approval commitments for further clinical studies and distribution restrictions intended to mitigate drug risks. 

The testing, collection of data, preparation of necessary applications and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources. Additionally, statutes, rules, regulations and policies may change and new regulations may be issued that could delay approvals of our drugs. The FDA may not act quickly or favorably in reviewing our applications, and we may encounter significant difficulties and costs in our efforts to obtain FDA approvals that could delay or preclude us from marketing our product candidates.

Preclinical Tests. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of the product candidate, its chemistry, toxicity, formulation and stability, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product candidate. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and other available information about the product candidate, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. Preclinical tests and studies can take several years to complete and, despite completion of those tests and studies, the FDA may not permit clinical testing to begin. 

The IND Process. An IND must be effective to administer an investigational drug to humans. The IND will automatically become effective 30 days after its receipt by the FDA unless the FDA, before that time, places the IND on clinical hold. At any time thereafter, the FDA may raise concerns or questions about the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND and impose a clinical hold if the FDA deems it appropriate. In such case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin or continue. The IND application process may become extremely costly and substantially delay development of our product candidates. Moreover, positive results in preclinical tests or prior human studies do not necessarily predict positive results in subsequent clinical trials. 

Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events or any findings from tests in laboratory animals that suggest a significant risk for human subjects.

Clinical Trials. Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Phase 1: The potential drug is initially introduced into a small number of healthy human subjects or patients and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, distribution, excretion and metabolism. If the investigational product is considered inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in the target population. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Phase 2: The potential drug is introduced into a limited patient population to assess the efficacy of the drug in specific, targeted indications, assess dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Phase 3: The potential drug is introduced into an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites to further evaluate clinical efficacy and safety. The purpose of the Phase 3 trial is to conduct a risk/benefit analysis of the potential drug and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. It is common to have two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 trials for the FDA to approve an NDA. 

Prior to initiation of each clinical trial, an independent Institutional Review Board (IRB) for each medical site proposing to conduct the clinical tria ls must review and approve the study protocol and study subjects must provide informed consent for participation in the study. 

We cannot be certain that we will successfully complete Phase 1, 2 or 3 testing of our drug candidates within any specific time period, if at all. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA&#8217;s good clinical practices (GCP) requirements. The FDA may order the partial, temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The IRB may also require the clinical trial at that site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB&#8217;s requirements, or may impose other conditions. In addition, we may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time for a variety of reasons, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.

During the development of a new drug, we may request to meet with the FDA at times such as prior to submitting an IND, at the EOP2, and before an NDA is submitted, and meetings are not limited to these certain times. The purpose of the EOP2 meeting is to discuss the Phase 2 clinical trial results and present plans for a pivotal Phase 3 trial that, in our opinion, will support the approval of the new drug. Additional animal safety studies, formulation studies and pharmacology studies are concurrently conducted with the ongoing clinical trials. Also, in compliance with cGMP requirements, the process for manufacturing commercial quantities of the new drug is finalized, with the expectation that the quality, purity, and potency of the drug will meet standards. A sponsor may also request a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA), the purpose of which is to reach agreement with the FDA on the Phase 3 clinical trial protocol design and analysis that will form the primary basis of an efficacy claim.

Fast track designation: The FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biological products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biological products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. Unique to a Fast Track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA. 

Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including a Fast Track program, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an NDA designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. Additionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. Fast Track designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.

U.S. patent term restoration and marketing exclusivity: Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of a drug candidate, some U.S. patents covering the product candidates may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product&#8217;s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent terms for one or more of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA. 

Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain applications of other companies seeking to reference another company&#8217;s NDA. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity 

within the U.S. to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substa nce. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of refe rence to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder. The FDCA a lso provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to th e approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the U.S. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six month s to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued &#8220; Written Request&#8221; for such a trial. 

Regulation outside the United States: In addition to regulations in the U.S., we and our strategic alliance partners will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. 

Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the U.S. have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the European Union, for example, a clinical trial application (CTA) must be submitted to each country&#8217;s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country&#8217;s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed.

The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.

To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug under European Union regulatory systems, we or our strategic alliance partners must submit a marketing authorization application. The application used to file the NDA in the United States is similar to that required in the European Union, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements.

For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.

If we or our strategic alliance partners fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
