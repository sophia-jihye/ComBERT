Our Business Units 

&#160; 

Astro Scientific 

&#160; 

Astro Scientific is a technology incubator that commercializes innovative technologies. Subsidiaries 1 st &#32;Detect and Astrogenetix currently reside in Astro Scientific: 

&#160; 

1 st &#32;Detect 

&#160; 

1 st &#32;Detect develops, manufactures, and sells chemical analyzers for use in the airport security, military, food and beverage, research, breath analysis, and leak detection markets. Our chemical analyzers can identify chemicals with more accuracy and precision than competing analyzers given their extreme sensitivity and specificity. By leveraging a concept from Oak Ridge National Laboratory and a preliminary design initiated by an engagement with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (&#8220;NASA&#8221;) to develop a mass spectrometer for the ISS, the Company developed a chemical analyzer that enables real-time analytics that we believe to be significantly smaller, lighter, faster, and less expensive than competing analyzers. The majority of revenue in 1 st &#32;Detect comes from working as a subcontractor on government contracts. The Company works with prime contractors in adapting our technology to be used in enhancing the government&#8217;s detection capabilities for a variety of applications. 

&#160; 

Astrogenetix 

&#160; 

Astrogenetix is a biotechnology company that is applying a fast-track, on-orbit discovery platform using the ISS to develop vaccines and other therapeutics. NASA has engaged the Center for Vaccine Development at the University of Maryland (&#8220;UMD&#8221;), one of the leading vaccinology institutions in the world, to research the application of a vaccine for Salmonella . NASA is collaborating with UMD, meaning little investment is required of Astrogenetix. 

Astral 

&#160; 

Astral was created to commercialize decades of image enhancement research. Astral sells film-to-digital conversion, image enhancement, and defect removal and color correction services, providing economically feasible conversion of television and feature 35mm and 16mm films to the new 4K UHD/HDR format, the standard for the next generation of digital film distribution to the home. Due to a significant shift in the film scanning industry, most film assets will need to go through an upgrade to 4K to remain relevant for over-the-top distribution (Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, etc.) as television manufacturers sell more 4K UHD/HDR televisions and consumer demand for such content accelerates. Astral is positioned to be a leader in digital conversion and repair of feature films, film-based television series, sporting events shot on film, film libraries, film archives, and consumer media. 

&#160; 

Business Strategy 

&#160; 

Astro Scientific 

1 st &#32;Detect 

Due to the high-speed performance, analytical capability, and flexibility of our product, our best opportunities involve government programs in aviation security and the military, and in applications where real-time, or in-situ, monitoring is required. 

There are currently approximately 15,000 IMS instruments installed at airports worldwide. As the current generation of IMS technology is scheduled to be replaced, we are positioning the company to be the best next-generation solution for this market. We have partnered with an incumbent provider of IMS instrumentation to airports to deliver an instrument with far greater capabilities than IMS. Together with our partner, we were awarded a grant for the Air Cargo and Next Generation Checkpoint program with the DHS S&#38;T, and we are currently in the first phase of what we anticipate to be a three-phase program. 

The military is also looking to enhance its chemical detection capabilities and on September 11, 2014, we announced that, together with Battelle, one of the leading providers of instrumentation to the military, we were awarded a grant for the NGCD program with the Department of Defense&#8217;s Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical and Biological Defense for one of the three variants in the NGCD program called the Multi-Sample Identifier/Multi-Sample Identifier Collector variant. If we win the procurement, the military will procure an estimated 700 units to be used for the following purposes: 

&#8226; 

Evaluating presence of chemicals after suspected chemical release incidents; 

&#8226; 

Continuously evaluating surface contamination following a chemical release to characterize contamination levels; 

&#8226; 

Evaluating the presence of contamination at a sample site; and 

&#8226; 

Confirming decontamination of potentially contaminated personnel and equipment. 

While most of our activities are focused on delivering on the TSA and military programs, we have several ongoing programs in the industrial and commercial markets. Commercial markets are large and diverse, often requiring customized solutions to satisfy customer needs. Significant effort is therefore only reserved for customer-funded joint development programs or programs with large markets where our technology has a unique differentiator. 

Astrogenetix 

From 2008 to 2011, Astrogenetix pursued an aggressive space access strategy to take advantage of the space shuttle program prior to its retirement. This strategy gave Astrogenetix unprecedented access to research in microgravity, as we flew twelve times with experiments in this three year period. NASA has engaged the Center for Vaccine Development at UMD, one of the leading vaccinology institutions in the world, to aid in the filing of an Investigational New Drug (&#8220;IND&#8221;) application for a vaccine for Salmonella . Once filed, we will be seeking partnership with a pharmaceutical company to complete the Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;) approval process and to ultimately commercialize the vaccine. 

Astral 

Astral was launched to commercialize identified government-funded satellite image correction technologies. Along with the acquisition of certain established defect correction technologies, first funded by IBM and Kodak, we believe that Astral is positioned to be a leader in the automated image correction and enhancement industry. We aim for Astral to offer compelling innovative technology solutions that deliver high-quality images and derive high levels of efficiencies through software automation to an industry that traditionally relies on expensive manual labor for image correction and enhancement. Our efforts are currently focused on educating content owners on our industry-leading technology, which includes our digital conversion and enhancement software and our recently introduced HDR software, Astral HDR ICE&#8482;, as the industry prepares to expend a considerable amount of resources on converting their film assets to the new 4K UHD/HDR standards.

&#160; 

Customers, Sales, and Marketing 

&#160; 

Astro Scientific 

1 st &#32;Detect 

&#160; 

1 st &#32;Detect&#8217;s customers include government agencies, research organizations, and industrial companies. Customers have either purchased or leased our instrumentation to evaluate the core technology in connection with exploring joint development of a customized solution or an original equipment manufacturer (&#8220;OEM&#8221;) distribution relationship with 1 st &#32;Detect. Efforts continue to be focused on delivering on our two primary government programs and on acquiring additional joint development partners. 

&#160; 

Astrogenetix 

&#160; 

Astrogenetix does not currently sell products to the market. Instead, its efforts are focused on filing an IND application with the FDA for a Salmonella vaccine. 

Astral 

Astral&#8217;s target customers are content creators and owners such as film studios, libraries, archives, and content processors such as post-production entities and distribution networks. Astral is positioned to leverage the demand generated for 4K UHD/HDR content by the release of the new 4K UHD/HDR standard and the growth in sales of next-generation 4K UHD/HDR televisions. Consumers are increasingly demanding content that is optimized for their new televisions, but the conversion of content lags the sale of 

televisions capable of displaying that content, similar to what we saw with the proliferation of HDTV and 3D. In order to remain relevant in over-the-top distribution (Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, etc.), content owners will need to convert their content to conform to the new standards. 

Competition 

&#160; 

Astro Scientific 

&#160; 

1 st &#32;Detect 

&#160; 

Competition with 1 st &#32;Detect&#8217;s mass spectrometer comes from traditional mass spectrometers and from other chemical sensors based on different technologies, primarily ion mobility spectrometry. 

There are several vendors that compete directly with 1 st &#32;Detect&#8217;s mass spectrometer. However, 1 st &#32;Detect products combine a number of attributes in a single product not currently available in other products. 1 st &#32;Detect&#8217;s competitive advantages include: 

&#8226; 

Our technology allows for near instantaneous results with laboratory-quality sensitivity, specificity, and performance. This compares to traditional mass spectrometers that are very expensive, can take up to several hours for a single analysis, and require a cumbersome clear-out and recalibration process between analyses. 

&#8226; 

Our price point is significantly less than a traditional mass spectrometer, becoming the first instrument that can provide superior mass spectrometry results at a price point similar to technologically inferior ion mobility spectrometers, which can only detect a limited number of chemicals and are prone to false results. 

&#8226; 

The 1 st &#32;Detect offering is significantly smaller, lighter, and much more portable than most other mass spectrometers. Our mass spectrometer can operate from an automobile&#8217;s cigarette lighter port, while traditional mass spectrometers are permanently situated on a table in a laboratory and require 500 watts or more to operate. 

&#8226; 

Our tandem mass spectrometry capability that is integrated with our standard software further improves the specificity of our instrument without the need for additional hardware. This feature isolates specific chemicals of interest so they can be further fragmented in the trap to provide a secondary confirmation of an analysis. Such a feature is usually only available in very expensive laboratory instruments. 

&#8226; 

Sinusoidal Multiplexed Array in Real Time (&#8220;SMART&#8221;) is a feature that eliminates dominant chemicals that may be masking weaker chemicals of interest. 

&#8226; 

Separating us from our competition is our ability to provide &#8220;all of the data, all of the time.&#8221; This attribute allows customers to review the historical results of their manufacturing process, enabling them to quickly identify sources of contamination, unexpected reduced quality of product, and unusual excursions that are often unanticipated. Competitive offerings generally lack this important ability. 

&#8226; 

Developed as a platform technology, 1 st &#32;Detect is able to be adapted to a wider variety of applications than most competing purpose-built instruments. 

Astrogenetix 

&#160; 

There are many developers of vaccines, including most large pharmaceutical companies and many smaller biotechnology firms. However, there are no known competitors to Astrogenetix&#8217;s microgravity vaccine development platform. With its designation as a national laboratory and with emphasis on providing a research platform through 2020, competition from foreign governments, academia, and commercial companies is anticipated. 

Astral 

Astral faces significant competition from several vendors in the scanning and restoration services industry. Our competitors are independent scanning boutiques at one end of the spectrum, and at the other, fully-integrated post-production houses offering a breadth of services, including scanning and restoration. However, the level of automation we have purpose-built into our solutions gives us compelling cost advantages while maintaining the high image quality customers have come to expect. Our solutions are scalable, cost effective, and more consistent when compared to competitors&#8217; traditional manual approaches.
