 ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

&#160;

Unless the context indicates otherwise, all references to "Growblox" refers solely to Growblox Sciences, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and all references to "the Company," "we", "us" or "our" in this Annual Report refers to Growblox and its consolidated subsidiaries.

&#160;

Overview

&#160;

The Company seeks to be an innovative technology and solution company that converts the cannabis plant into medicines, therapies and treatments for a variety of ailments. The Company is developing and utilizing state of the art technologies in plant biology, cultivation and extraction techniques, combined with biotechnology, and plans to produce consistent and measurable medical-grade cannabis, cannabis concentrates and cannabinoid therapies.

Although we believe that maximum shareholder value will ultimately be achieved through the development, production and marketing of certified cannabinoid medicines, therapies and treatments, in order to generate cash flow and near term profitability, we intend to cultivate and dispense cannabis for medical purposes in both Nevada and other states which permit such sales and in which we and our operating partners are able to obtain cultivation and dispensing licenses.

We seek to become a trusted producer of consistent and efficacious medicinal strains and products, combining both cannabinoids and terpenes, which we intend to market in those states within the United States and in other countries where the sale of medical cannabis products are permitted. In addition, subject to obtaining Food and Drug Administrative (FDA) certification, we intend to market our cannabinoid based drug discoveries on a world-wide basis.

We were incorporated in the State of Delaware on April 4, 2001, under the name "Flagstick Venture, Inc." On March 28, 2008, stockholders owning a majority of our outstanding common stock approved changing our then name "Signature Exploration and Production Corp." as our business model had changed.

On March 13, 2014, we entered into a definitive assets purchase agreement for the acquisition of assets, including the Growblox&#8482; cultivation technology which resulted in a change in our corporate name on April 4, 2014, from Signature Exploration and Production Corporation to Growblox Sciences, Inc.

The Company will cultivate cannabis using innovative, but conventional methods in its wholly owned subsidiary, GB Sciences Nevada, LLC ("GBSN"). GBSN is in the final states of opening Phase 1 of an approximately 28,000 sq. ft. facility in Las Vegas, Nevada. When all phases of construction are completed, the facility is expected to produce 6,800 pounds of marijuana per year and generate revenues of $16.9 million, based on a projected wholesale price of $2,500 per pound. Completion of all Phases of this facility is dependent upon the availability of capital to complete construction. Phase 1, due to be completed in August 2016 is expected to produce revenues of $3.4 million per year. The Company has made completion of all Phases of this facility its number one priority.

&#160;

Growblox intends to conduct its business operations, primarily through its subsidiaries in three distinct operating units which we designate as our "Solutions," "Sciences" and "Product" divisions. Our Solutions division involves the development and use of our proprietary suite of controlled-climate indoor agricultural technology growing and cultivation Suites, which we call "TissueBLOX", "GrowBLOX," TM "CureBLOX" &#160; and "ExtractionLAB" &#160; (collectively, the "GrowBLOX Suites"). Our GrowBLOX Suites are engineered and designed to cultivate medical grade cannabis and create cGMP-certified plant extracts, and thereafter to enable us to process and manufacture a variety of pharmaceutical, nutraceutical and cosmeceutical formulations and products based on these certified raw ingredients. The GrowBlox Suite currently exists in prototype. A full production model of the GrowBLOX is scheduled for testing before August 2016.

&#160;

We believe that the key advantage of our GrowBLOX Suites is that they are capable of producing certified raw materials with consistent and measurable profiles of active ingredients. We believe that producing cannabis-based materials with validated chemical compositions is ideal for scientifically rigorous testing of the safety and effectiveness of these materials as a therapy for patients. If these materials are approved by the FDA they can be marketed in patented pharmaceutical compositions. As such, we believe that the medical grade cannabis and other extracts produced in our GrowBLOX Suites can serve as the raw materials for our Science and Products divisions. We will seek to obtain ISO and Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) certifications for the process of growing and processing botanical ingredients in our GrowBlox Suites. The manufacture, licensing, installation and support of such equipment will be the focus of our Growblox Sciences Puerto Rico, LLC subsidiary, which will operate our Solutions division. 

&#160;

Our Science division will seek to create and validate the effectiveness of proprietary formulations of active ingredients derived from the cannabis plant in combination with "big data" driven clinical research and development programs to bring pain relief and potential cures to patients suffering from a variety of neurological and other diseases. Our Science division is currently engaged in preclinical testing of its biopharmaceutical cannabinoid product prototypes to begin future human clinical trials. In addition, we are seeking co-development partners to assist us with growing a phytocannabinoid-based biopharmaceutical product pipeline.

&#160;

We are currently developing and intend to file patent applications for specific, cannabis-based, pharmaceutical formulations that fit within seven broad therapeutic categories. Many of these disease categories are not currently being treated effectively by traditional pharmaceutical companies. Once our patent applications are filed with the U.S. Patent Office, we will submit IND-applications to the FDA and request "orphan drug" designation status for our formulations in some instances or "breakthrough drug" designations in others in order to fast track our clinical trials. In addition, we intend to implement adaptive design clinical trials based on recent FDA-guidance documents. Adaptive design clinical trials have the potential to reduce the total clinical trial time to as little as three to five years, as it has for other new FDA-approved treatments like Gilead's Hepatitis C treatment. Additionally, we believe that our time to market can be reduced because we expect to shortly be able to cultivate and dispense to human recipients consistent and measurable medical-grade cannabis in Nevada and thereafter in other states by licensed dispensaries and oncologists.

It should be emphasized that we face significant hurdles in obtaining FDA approval and certification for our therapies. Not only is the FDA certification process for any proposed pharmaceutical both extremely expensive and time consuming, but the current policy and regulations of the Federal government and some of its agencies are that cannabis has no medical benefit. Despite current Federal policy, there are more than 500 clinical trials currently in process in the United States testing cannabis or marijuana, and they are registered on the FDA-regulated website at www.clinicaltrials.gov . Of these trials, approximately 188 are testing potentially positive clinical effects of cannabis-based therapies.

&#160;

Medical cannabis has been shown in numerous trials to be an effective source of pain therapy and has been indicated as being effective in treating some conditions such as glaucoma, AIDS, multiple sclerosis, chemotherapy-induced nausea and certain seizure disorders. While the therapeutic effects of medical cannabis on these conditions have been well documented in the medical literature, many patients and their physicians have well-founded concerns regarding the consistency, safety and efficacy of medical cannabis that is available any most standard dispensaries. We will seek to alleviate these concerns and increase safety and efficacy through cultivating harvest-to-harvest consistency in the levels of active cannabinoids in our proprietary stains; eliminate harmful pesticides and fungicides in our Growblox Suites growing and curing system.

&#160;

We are also in the preliminary stages of developing, through a third party contactor, a mobile cannabis delivery application - GBLX-PRO. We hope to use GBLX-PRO in dispensary trials to establish correlations between the profiles of active ingredients in the cannabis-based extracts and symptom improvement as reported by patients and confirmed biometrically. GBLX-PRO would be downloaded into a smart phone. Once data on a user of medical cannabis is obtained and the precise formulation of medical grade cannabis is dispensed, the proposed application will permit a user to remotely order additional deliveries or obtain the identical product by using thumb print identification on his or her smart phone. In addition, by use of a "health" wrist watch, the user's blood pressure, pulse rate and potentially sleep patterns and genetic markers can be accessed; all of which, we believe, would be significant in providing "big data" capabilities for the clinical trials to be conducted by our Science division. We therefore believe that these human clinical trials will help establish the safety and efficacy of our raw cannabis-based formulations. However, at this time, the mobile cannabis delivery application exists only as an early prototype. Significant time, effort and expenditures will be required to develop fully operational production versions of this technology.

Our principal executive offices and Science and Product divisions operations are located at 3550 W. Teco Avenue, Las Vegas, Nevada.

&#160;

Our Business Strategy

&#160;

Growblox intends to operate as an intellectual property company that will conduct its business through its subsidiaries. Growblox intends to own all patents and related technologies developed by it and its subsidiaries. In addition, Growblox owns and will seek to own majority interests in each of its existing and future operating subsidiaries.

Although we believe that maximum shareholder value will ultimately be achieved through the development, production and marketing of certified cannabinoid medicines, therapies and treatments, in order to generate cash flow and near term profitability we intend to cultivate and dispense cannabis for medical purposes in both Nevada and other states which permit such sales and in which we and our operating partners are able to obtain cultivation and dispensing licenses.

The completion of pre-clinical and clinical trials and FDA-approvals for a pharmaceutical product is traditionally a long and expensive process. However, we believe that strategic partnering and aggressive licensing of these products at early clinical stages can mitigate some of the risks. If we are able to obtain "orphan drug" or "breakthrough drug" fast track status, this would be very helpful in shortening the process; as is the use of the new adaptive design clinical trial strategy. In order to achieve the strategic goals for our Science division, we intend to enter into partnerships or joint ventures with respected, independent contract research organizations, medical schools and other researchers. To this end, in December 2014, we signed a letter of intent with NRC Research Institute, a respected contract research organization in California. It is contemplated that NRC will focus on designing Phase I/II studies in parallel to simultaneously evaluate safety and efficacy of therapeutics.

&#160;

If we achieve successful outcomes of product prototypes and meet all of our intermediate clinical trial goals, we will seek to proceed with testing using the adaptive design clinical trial strategy that allows us to proceed more quickly through all three human trial phases in a single series. We would then apply for FDA approval. If and when one or more of our drugs, therapies or treatments are approved by the FDA, we will seek to market them either through our Products division or under joint ventures or licensing arrangements with major pharmaceutical companies.

&#160;

There can be no assurance that we will ever be able to enter into any joint ventures or other arrangements with third parties to finance our drug development program or that if we are able to do so, that any of our projected therapies will ever be approved by the FDA. Even if we obtain FDA approval for a therapy, there can be no assurance that it could be successfully marketed or would not be superseded by another cannabis based therapy produced by one or more of our competitors. It also may be anticipated that even if we enter into a joint venture development with a financially stable pharmaceutical or institutional partner, we will still be required to raise significant additional capital in the future to achieve the strategic goals of our Science Division. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such additional capital on reasonable terms, if at all. If our Science Division fails to achieve its goal of producing one or more cannabis based pharmaceuticals or therapies, it would have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition and business prospects.

&#160;

GB Sciences Nevada, LLC and GB Nevada Partners, LLC Separation Agreement

In March 2015, we and GB Sciences Nevada, LLC ("GBSN") entered into a binding memorandum (the "Memorandum") with GBS Nevada Partners, LLC ("GBS Partners"), the minority member of GBSN. Under the terms of such agreement, our equity in GBSN was to increase from 55% to 65%, and GBSN was to retain its existing certification to cultivate and grow cannabis and, if and when issued by Clark County and/or Las Vegas, Nevada, the delivery certification. It was further agreed that, if and when issued, the dispensary certification would be assigned to an entity to be wholly-owned by GBS Partners. In consideration for such assignment, the entity operating the dispensaries was to agree to purchase a minimum of 20% of its inventory of cannabis from GBSN and pay to us 10% of all profits derived from its dispensary business. In addition, GBSN was to retain the delivery certificate and the exclusive right to provide all delivery services on behalf of the dispensaries that are permitted by applicable state and local Nevada law. The actions contemplated by the Memorandum were never taken because the delivery and dispensary certifications have yet to be issued and our ownership of GBSN remains at 55%.

On August 17, 2015, however, we entered into a letter agreement with GB Partners to expand on the actions contemplated by the Memorandum and to effect an ownership separation. The transfer of the license and 100% of ownership to us was approved by Division of Public &#38; Behavioral Health of the Nevada Department of Health and Human Services on November 24, 2015. Pursuant thereto, we became the sole shareholder of GBSN and retain the Clark County cultivation license and state certificates together with all related SUPs and state certificates.

GBS Partners will receive the Clark County and City of Las Vegas dispensary location licenses, together with related SUPs and state certificates. In connection with the foregoing, the parties agreed to enter into a Consignment and Delivery Agreement ("CDA") with a term of ten years subject to optional extensions for additional five year periods. The initial extension is automatic assuming neither party is in breach of the CDA. Further extensions thereafter, will require mutual agreement of the parties.

Pursuant to the CDA, GBS Partners will provide GBSN with 20% of its most prominent in-store retail merchandising shelf space for consignment sales. All after-tax consignment sale proceeds resulting therefrom will be split equally between GBS Partners and GBSN. The CDA will further provide that GBSN will establish and bear all expenses of operating and administrating a local delivery service from the dispensary locations. All product sold through such services will be treated as a consignment sale and as such, all after-tax delivery consignment sale proceeds will be split between GBSN and GBS Partners on an 80/20 basis. The service may also include non-GBSN product to be sold through the service from GBS Partners' county dispensary and in such event, GBSN will retain 20% of the initial sales price thereof.

The CDA will also provide for GBSN to receive a non-dilutable 10% interest in the distributions, profits and equity of all entities that own or have the right to 100% of all dispensary operations. GBSN will also have the right to tag along with any sale or transfer of any direct or derivative interest in the dispensary operation on a pari passu basis.

GBS Partners is required to reimburse GBSN approximately $307,000 for expenses incurred in connection with the application and issuance of an approved provisional state certificate from both the Las Vegas and Clark County dispensaries. Approximately $61,000 of such amount is payable upon the governmental approval of the license transfers. The balance of such amount is payable from the first sale proceeds from dispensary operations and in all events no later than 2 years from the date the county dispensary receives its final certificate of occupancy (the "County Certificate") and opens for business. In the event that the County Certificate is not issued, GBS Partners can defer payment of approximately $153,000 for a maximum of two additional years. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if GBS Partners finances the dispensary operations with a third party resulting in the receipt of net proceeds by GBS Partners, then all expense amounts shall become immediately due and payable.

Agreement with Growblox Sciences Puerto Rico

On May 7, 2015, the Company entered into certain agreements with Growblox Sciences, Puerto Rico, LLC, a limited liability company organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico ("GBSPR"). GBSPR was formed and is being capitalized primarily by Cesar Cordero-Kruger, a prominent business executive and resident of Puerto Rico.

Under the terms of a commercialization agreement between the Company and GBSPR, the Company has granted to GBSPR the exclusive world-wide rights to all of our technology and intellectual property to:

(a) &#160; manufacture, produce, lease and license our indoor series of controlled-climate indoor agricultural technology growing and cultivation chambers engineered and designed to produce medical grade cannabis and other plant extracts (the "Growblox Chambers") and provide remote diagnostic monitoring and servicing of the Growing Chambers to third party growers and processors of hemp, cannabis and other plant extracts; 

(b) &#160; sell to the Company, for resale and distribution throughout the world, in all territories and jurisdictions (including states in the United States) where the sale and use of such products are permitted, any and all pharmaceutical raw materials and products as well as neutraceuticals and cosmeceutical skin care products derived from medical-grade cannabis and hemp raw materials that were cultivated and grown in Growblox Chambers; 

(c) &#160; use the trademarks and packaging developed by the Company to be used to identify all cannabis products grown in Growblox Chambers; 

(d) &#160; provide technical support for the licensing, permitting and other requisite applications for the cannabis business in Puerto Rico and related markets; 

(e) &#160; access all research supporting the Growblox Chambers and educational materials previously developed or collected in the future by the Company to the extent associated or used with GBSPR Business; and 

(f) &#160; access all of the dispensary related technology, proprietary information and contacts including, without limitation, technology, proprietary information, and contacts. 

All rights not granted to GBSPR under the commercialization agreement are retained by the Company and include the (i) right to conduct pre-clinical and clinical trials and ongoing research and development to create cannabis-based therapies for specific clinical conditions based on an understanding of how cannabinoids interact with the natural receptors in the human body; (ii) formulation of targeted combinations of active ingredients to combat specific conditions and diseases; (iii) use of proprietary cannabinoid formulations, to develop palliative and curative pharmaceutical treatment options and products for patients with certain critical diseases; (iv) exclusive right to sell, dispense and market cannabinoid and hemp based pharmaceutical raw materials and products as well as neutraceuticals and cosmeceutical skin care products throughout the world, either directly, through distributors or under other agreements with third parties; and (iv) right, directly, or through one or more of our subsidiaries (other than GBSPR), to cultivate, grow, dispense and sell medical-grade cannabis or marijuana in Nevada and Colorado.

&#160;

To the extent that GBSPR produces and sells to the Company for resale or distribution pharmaceutical raw materials and products, neutraceuticals and/or cosmeceutical skin care products derived from plants cultivated and grown in Growblox Chambers (collectively, the "Finished Products"), the Company has agreed to establish mutually acceptable transfer pricing between GBSPR and the Company for such Finished Products; failing which agreement, an independent third party will arbitrate such pricing and pricing policies. In the event that GBSPR is unable to fulfill 100% of the requirements of the customers for Growblox Chambers or Finished Products, GBSPR will subcontract such production to third parties that are reasonably acceptable to the Company. Neither the Company nor GBSPR may commercially sell (as opposed to leasing or licensing) Growblox Chambers without the consent of both parties.

The grant of rights under the commercialization agreement was subject to the condition that GBSPR obtain not less than $1.25 million of equity financing by no later than September 30, 2015, failing which we could unilaterally terminate the agreement. GBSPR failed to obtain the funds by September 30, 2015 required pursuant to the commercialization agreement. Furthermore, the delivery of the approved production version of the Growblox cultivation unit has not yet been completed and the unit has not been delivered for testing. The Company continues to work with GBSPR to finalize the production version of the GrowBLOX and develop an alternative plan for funding. As of this date, the Company has not cancelled the commercialization agreement and technology license with GBSPR, and would prefer to continue the relationship but, in the absence of a viable funding plan, the Company may cancel the agreements and seek alternative partners for the development and commercialization of the GrowBLOX Suite technology.

Upon consummation of the contemplated $1.25 million capitalization of GBSPR, the Company will be the majority owner of its equity, owning approximately 66% of the GBSPR membership interests; Mr. Cordero-Kruger will own approximately 15.9% of such membership interests, Dr. Andrea Small-Howard, a Director and Chief Technology Officer will own approximately 2.1% of such membership interests and Joseph J. Bianco, a GBSPR Board member will own approximately 8.3% of such membership interests. The remaining percentage of ownership of such membership interests will be owned by other non-related party investors.

Under the terms of the GBSPR operating agreement, Mr. Cordero-Kruger is the managing member of GBSPR, entitled to designate a majority of the five member board of managers of GBSPR, and is delegated with the authority to manage the business of GBSPR, subject only to certain major decisions defined in the operating agreement (dealing primarily with matters of finance, related party transactions and amending agreements among the parties) which require unanimous approval of the Board or approval by the Company. The Company has designated Craig Ellins, President and CEO, and Joseph J. Bianco as members of the GBSPR Board.

The operating agreement also provides that the investors (including Mr. Cordero-Kruger) who have provided the maximum $1.25 million of capital to GBSPR will hold Class A membership interests that entitle them to exclusive rights to certain research and development tax credits available to residents of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The Company and its affiliates and associates hold Class B membership interests, which are identical to the Class A membership interest, other than the right to the research and development tax credits.

Assuming it completes its initial $1.25 million capitalization, GBSPR may seek to raise an additional $4.75 million of capital in 2016 or thereafter to enable it to expand its business activities. The operating agreement provides that the terms of such additional financing, if undertaken, have to be unanimously approved by all members of the GBSPR board, including the Company's designees. Under certain conditions, after three years, the operating agreement provides that Mr. Cordero-Kruger or his designated members of the GBSPR board may require the Company to acquire the remaining equity of GBSPR under a formula or consummate another liquidity event for the members of GBSPR.

There can be no assurance that the proposed initial $1.25 million capitalization of GBSPR will be consummated, or that the contemplated $4.75 million of additional financing will be undertaken or completed upon terms and conditions that are acceptable to GBSPR, if at all. There can also be no assurance that the proposed business activities of GBSPR will be successful, the ongoing research and development will result in pre-clinical trials or clinical trials that will result in the production of any pharmaceutical or related products that will either be commercially accepted or permitted to be sold by the FDA or any other state or federal regulatory authority, or the Company will ever be able to purchase or be permitted to resell medical grade cannabis or other finished products.

Installment Loan Financing &#8211; Convertible Debenture

On May 12, 2015, we entered into a note purchase agreement, (the "NPA") effective as of June 9, 2015, with Pacific Leaf Ventures, LP ( "Pacific Leaf"), pursuant to which Pacific Leaf agreed to make installment loans to us in the aggregate amount of $1.75 million (the "Loans"). The note is convertible at the option of the holder into common shares of the Company at a conversion price of $0.50, subject to anti-dilution adjustments. The purpose of the financing is to provide for the acquisition and installation of an operating facility, equipment and other tangible assets by GB Sciences Nevada. Such facility and equipment will be dedicated to the cultivation of cannabis and the extraction of oils and other constituents present in cannabis, subject at all times to Nevada legal requirements. Currently, the Company expects to achieve operating revenues in October 2016.

On February 8, 2016, the Company entered into the Amended and Restated 6% Senior Convertible Promissory Note ("Amended Note") with Pacific Leaf Ventures, LP ("Pacific Leaf"). The amended agreement modifies the 6% Senior Secure Convertible Promissory Note dated May 12, 2015 and effective as of June 8, 2015, in the principal amount of $1.75 million. 

Per the terms of the amended agreement, Pacific Leaf may make up to $1.0 million in additional advances to the Company under the Amended Note bringing the total in the aggregate to $2.75 million. The note is convertible at the option of the holder into common shares at a conversion price of $0.25, subject to anti-dilution adjustments. The Company has an option to prepay the Amended Note, without premium or penalty, in whole or in part, with accrued interest to the date of such prepayment.

Until the payment in full of the Amended Note, the Investor or its designee shall have the option (the " Option ") to purchase up to a 20% membership interest in GB Sciences Nevada LLC ("GBSN") from GBSN for a purchase price equal to $100,000 for each 2% of membership interest purchased ( i.e. , $1,000,000 if the Option is exercised in full), provided that the Option may not be exercised for less than a 1% membership interest in GBSN. 

In connection with the Amended Note, the Company also entered into the Amended and Restated Royalty Agreement with Pacific Leaf dated and effective as of February 8, 2016. Per the terms of the Amended Royalty Agreement, the royalty rate at any time shall equal to the sum of (i) 9.1%, and (ii) the percentage calculated by dividing the amount advanced in excess of $1.75 million by $1.0 million, multiplied by the gross revenues of GBSN. On the earlier of (i) the seventh anniversary of the royalty payment date, or (ii) the date that all amounts outstanding under the Amended Note have been paid in full, the royalty rate shall be reduced by 50%. 

Under the NPA, Pacific Leaf made advances resulting in total Loans of $2.1 million at March 31, 2016.

There can be no assurance that:

&#183; the Company will be able to comply with the covenants under the Pacific Leaf Note Purchase Agreement so as to enable the Company to receive all of the anticipated funding thereunder; 

&#183; there will not be cost over-runs in connection with the purchase and/or lease of the cultivation facility and related equipment resulting in the proceeds of the Loan being insufficient to enable GBSN to complete the installation and commence production of cannabis for medical purposes; 

&#183; a state business license to operate the medical cannabis facility will be issued, or that the Company or GBSN will not violate existing or newly imposed state, county and city regulations in Nevada that would significant restrict or prohibit its proposed business activities; or 

&#183; the proposed business to be conducted by GBSN with the proceeds of the Loan will prove profitable to the Company or its subsidiaries. 

A default by the Company under the Note Purchase Agreement could have a material adverse effect on the business.

Although the proposed and actual business activities of GBSN are not illegal within the State of Nevada, the production and sale of cannabis products violate federal laws as presently constituted.

Teco Cultivation Facility

Our wholly-owned subsidiary GB Sciences Nevada, LLC ("GBSN") leases a warehouse facility at 3550 W. Teco Avenue, Las Vegas Nevada. GBSN holds a provisional certificate from the Division of Public &#38; Behavioral Health of the Nevada Department of Health and Human Services to operate an establishment to cultivate medical cannabis at its Las Vegas location. The certificate was granted in November 2014 and is considered provisional until the establishment is in compliance with applicable local government requirements and has received a state business operating license.

&#160;

As of March 31, 2016, Pacific Leaf has advanced approximately $2.1 million toward the completion of the build-out of the Company's 28,000 sq. ft. cultivation facility in Las Vegas, Nevada. The money has been used to significantly advance construction. The Company is confident that the facility will be completed and operational by August, 2016. Based on this completion schedule, the Company expects to introduce 800 small cannabis plants to the facility in early August which will lead a revenue generating harvest no later than October 2016.

Additionally, GB Sciences Nevada LLC, the holder of the cannabis cultivation license located in the Teco facility, received notice from its landlord that the lease was in default for technical reasons not related to monthly lease payments. The Company promptly responded and provided evidence that none of the alleged defaults were valid. If, for some reason, the landlord were able to prove a default in the lease and evict the Company from the Teco property, the financial damage to the Company could be material.

Subsequently, an affiliate of Pacific Leaf, W-Net, Inc., entered into an agreement to purchase the building housing our cultivation facility at 3550 West Teco Ave., Clark County, Nevada for a purchase price of $3.9 million. In conjunction with the purchase agreement, the Company agreed to vacate the premises if the purchase did not close pursuant to the purchase agreement. W-Net has informed the Company that it is confident that the purchase will close pursuant to the agreement. Failure of W-Net or its assignees to close the purchase of the facility will have a material adverse effect on the Company's ability to generate revenues from conventional cannabis cultivation.

Management Agreement between Growblox Sciences, Inc. and Compassionate Team of Las Vegas LLC

On August 17, 2015, the Company entered into a Medical Marijuana Establishment Management Agreement with Compassionate Team of Las Vegas LLC ("Compassionate Team") pursuant to the term of which the Company agreed to manage the operation of the Medical Marijuana Establishment for cultivation, located at 2601 Highland Drive, Las Vegas, Clark County, Nevada ("Real Property"). The responsibility and control of all operations shall reside with Compassionate Team as licensee. Growblox Sciences agreed to provide all capital funding to the Medical Marijuana Establishment for cultivation to become fully operational in return for a) 70% of EBITDA and b) assignment of 50% membership interest in Compassionate Team after the facility had reached an EBITDA run rate of $1,000,000 per annum. The effectiveness of the management agreement is depended upon Compassionate Team providing Growblox Sciences with written proof of Provisional Medical Marijuana Establishment Registration Certificate for cultivation and evidence of approved Special Use Permit and a Compliance Permit at the Real Property.

In February 2016, Compassionate Team informed the Company that it planned to purchase an alternative building more suitable for development as a cultivation facility than the existing location. The Agreement was amended to accommodate the new location as well as add a potential dispensary license to be developed and operated by the Company under terms similar to the original Agreement.

Issuance and Transfer of Provisional Cultivation and Production Certificates

On August 14, 2015, Sandra Tiffany, the managing member of GWGA, LLC ("GWGA"), LVIG Holdings LLC ("LVIG") and LVOP Holdings LLC ("LVOP") agreed to transfer the State of Nevada, Division of Public and Behavioral Health (the "Division") provisional Cultivation Establishment Registration Certificates to be issued to GWGA and LVIG and the Division's provisional Production Establishment Registration Certificate to be issued to LVOP to us at such time that the Division allows for the transfer of such certificates.

The Company was to pay consideration to Tiffany of $180,000 to reimburse Tiffany for the cost of buying out her former partners, $50,000 in prior legal fees related to buying out her former partners, and 250,000 shares of Growblox Common Stock. The Company also was to employ Tiffany as General Manager of GB Sciences Nevada LLC. Additionally, the Company was required to finance approximately $1.0 million to build-out the subject cultivation and production facilities.

In January 2016 the Company made the assessment that it did not have sufficient financial resources to meet the commitments under this agreement and would instead focus all its resources on completing its Teco facility. Consequently, Tiffany and the Company sought out third parties with the objective of finding potential venture partners that would assume the original costs of the Tiffany agreement.

In April 2016, after exhausting all opportunities, the Tiffany agreement was cancelled. Sandra Tiffany resigned from the Company and will pursue the development of the provisional Cultivation Establishment Registration Certificates issued to GWGA and LVIG and provisional Production Establishment Registration Certificate issued to LVOP on her own. As a result of cancellation of the Tiffany agreement, we no longer have any interest in GWGA and LVIG certificates.

Cost Saving Measures

The Company is "pre-revenue" until its first cannabis harvest occurs in October 2016. Consequently, its only sources of funds for operations are loans and sales of Common Stock. In order to conserve cash resources and maximize utilization of cash toward completing the Teco cultivation facility, the Company adopted several cost saving measures.

&#183; In January, the Company vacated its offices at 6450 Cameron in Las Vegas, saving $7,000 per month in rent. In May 2016, The Company moved its corporate offices to the Teco facility upon receiving a Certificate of Occupancy for the facility. 

&#183; In March 2016 the Company implemented a furlough of all science-related officers and employees. These employees are expected to return to work the earlier of a) the receipt of revenues from sales of cannabis grown at the Teco facility; or b) identification of critical time-sensitive tasks or projects combined with sufficient resources to pay for the performance of these tasks or projects. As a result of these measures, and other layoffs the Company reduced its expenditures by approximately $45,000 per month. 

Management Changes and Board of Directors Expansion 

Effective July 27, 2015, the Board of Directors hired John Poss as our Chief Financial Officer. Effective December 31, 2015 the Company's Board of Directors also hired John Poss as the Company's President and Chief Operating Officer.

Effective April 29, 2016 the Company's Board of Directors was expanded to five members. As a result of the expansion, the Board of Directors elected Leslie Bocskor, Shane Terry and John Poss to serve as Members of the Board of Directors for a term of three years to fill the three existing vacancies.

The Board of Directors also accepted the resignation of Craig Ellins as Chief Executive Officer of the corporation and immediately appointed Craig Ellins to serve as Chief Innovation Officer of the corporation with no changes in his current employment contract.

The Board of Directors elected John Poss to serve as Interim Chief Executive Officer until such time as the Board of Directors can identify and hire a suitable replacement. Mr. Poss has been serving as the CFO of the Company since August, 2015 and its COO since December 31, 2015. He will continue serving as CFO and COO until suitable replacements can be recruited. 

Competition

&#160;

The medical cannabis industry is subject to intense and increasing competition. Some of our competitors may have substantially greater capital resources, facilities and infrastructure then we have, which may enable them to compete more effectively in this market. These competitors include MedBox, Inc., TerraTech Corp., Cannabis Science, Inc., Peak Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cannabis-Rx, Inc. and Nemus Biosciences, Inc. In addition, the development of therapies and pharmaceutical products based on extracts from the cannabis plant is being undertaken by a number of medical and educational institutions, including the University of Mississippi, which is the only U.S. based entity authorized by the Federal government to cultivate cannabis for research. Such institutions have significantly greater financial resources and facilities than we have

&#160;

Intellectual Property

&#160;

We believe that we have the opportunity to file applications for several potential patents relating to our cultivation and growing technologies. We filed a provisional patent application in 2014 which has expired. We intend to expand our prior claims and refile on or more new patent applications in the near future.

&#160;

Our key technology is the indoor agricultural growing Suite known as the Growblox&#8482;. The Growblox&#8482; is a controlled-climate indoor agricultural growing Suite designed and engineered to cultivate medical-grade cannabis plants. We believe that our Growblox&#8482; Suites create the ideal growing environment for each plant while economically monitoring and adjusting the light, humidity, nutrition, temperature and aeration, The Growblox&#8482; Suites also excludes outside stresses like, toxins, pathogens and pests. We believe that this customized environment ensures maximum harvest of the finest grade products and will consistently deliver the quality and efficacy expected from a medical-grade cannabis product.

&#160;

We believe that the Growblox&#8482; system is economical, environmental and user friendly as it utilizes the following technologies:

&#160;

&#8226; &#160; Growblox's&#8482; AeroVAPOR&#8482; misting system delivers all of the moisture, nutrients and oxygen the cannabis plants need to grow through a misting system that recycles the water used. Absolutely, no gray water remains that would traditionally be released back into the environment. 

&#8226; &#160; Energy-efficient LED lighting system. 

&#8226; &#160; Integrated, intelligent control system that continuously monitors, manages, records, and analyzes the cultivation methodology for optimal growth. 

&#8226; &#160; Remote monitoring system sends alerts via text, email and telephone to scientists, botanists and cultivators, recommending adjustments to the Suites cultivation levels. 

The Growblox Suite currently exists in prototype. A full production model of the GrowBLOX is scheduled for testing before August 2016.

We anticipate filing a number of patent applications for specific, cannabis-based, pharmaceutical formulations that fit within seven broad therapeutic categories using phytocannabinoid ingredients extracted from the cannabis plant. Canabinoids, we believe, either in isolated form or in varying combinations within various prototypes of cannabis plants, are either proven, or have the potential, for treatment of numerous conditions including pain, nausea, seizure and inflammation reduction, tumor inhibition, psychotic and anxiety issue, and muscle spasms. There is no assurance that any or all of these patent applications will be filed in the near future or if filed that letters patent will be issued in the near future, if at all. Even if issued, there is no assurance that our patents will afford us with adequate protection for the intellectual property that we may develop.

Government Regulation and Federal Policy

&#160;

Under the Controlled Substances Act ("CSA"), the policies and regulations of the Federal government and its agencies are that cannabis (marijuana) is a stage 1 narcotic that is addictive and has no medical benefit. Accordingly, and a range of activities including cultivation and the personal use of cannabis is prohibited and subject to prosecution and criminal penalties. Unless and until Congress amends the CSA with respect to medical cannabis, there is a risk that the federal authorities may enforce current federal law, and we may be deemed to be engaged in producing, cultivating, or dispensing cannabis in violation of federal law, or we may be deemed to be facilitating the sale or distribution of drug paraphernalia in violation of federal law with respect to our Company's business operations. Active enforcement of the current federal regulatory position on cannabis may thus indirectly and adversely affect our strategic goals, revenues and profits. The risk of strict enforcement of the CSA in light of Congressional activity, judicial holdings, and stated federal policy remains uncertain. See " Risk Factors " below. 

The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear a case brought by San Diego County, California that sought to establish federal preemption over state medical cannabis laws. The preemption claim was rejected by every court that reviewed the case. The California 4th District Court of Appeals wrote in its unanimous ruling, "Congress does not have the authority to compel the states to direct their law enforcement personnel to enforce federal laws." However, in another case, the U.S. Supreme Court held that, as long as the CSA contains prohibitions against cannabis, under the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution, the United States may criminalize the production and use of cannabis even where states approve its use for medical purposes.

&#160;

In an effort to provide guidance to federal law enforcement, the Department of Justice ("DOJ") has issued Guidance Regarding Cannabis Enforcement to all United States attorneys in a memorandum from Deputy Attorney General David Ogden on October 19, 2009, in a memorandum from Deputy Attorney General James Cole on June 29, 2011 and in a memorandum from Deputy Attorney General James Cole on August 29, 2013. Each memorandum provides that the DOJ is committed to the enforcement of the CSA, but, the DOJ is also committed to using its limited investigative and prosecutorial resources to address the most significant threats in the most effective, consistent and rational way.

&#160;

The August 29, 2013 memorandum provides updated guidance to federal prosecutors concerning cannabis enforcement in light of state laws legalizing medical and recreational cannabis possession in small amounts.

&#160;

The memorandum sets forth certain enforcement priorities that are important to the federal government:

&#160;

&#8226; &#160; Distribution of cannabis to children; 

&#8226; &#160; Revenue from the sale of cannabis going to criminals; 

&#8226; &#160; Diversion of medical cannabis from states where it is legal to states where it is not; 

&#8226; &#160; Using state authorized cannabis activity as a pretext of other illegal drug activity; 

&#8226; &#160; Preventing violence in the cultivation and distribution of cannabis; 

&#8226; &#160; Preventing drugged driving; 

&#8226; &#160; Growing cannabis on federal property; and 

&#8226; &#160; Preventing possession or use of cannabis on federal property. 

The DOJ has not historically devoted resources to prosecuting individuals whose conduct is limited to possession of small amounts of cannabis for use on private property but has relied on state and local law enforcement to address cannabis activity. In the event the DOJ reverses its stated policy and begins strict enforcement of the CSA in states that have laws legalizing medical cannabis and recreational cannabis in small amounts, there may be a direct and adverse impact to our business and our revenue and profits. Furthermore, H.R. 83, enacted by Congress on December 16, 2014, provides that none of the funds made available to the DOJ pursuant to the 2015 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act may be used to prevent certain states, including Nevada and California, from implementing their own laws that authorized the use, distribution, possession, or cultivation of medical cannabis.

In contrast to federal policy, there are currently 25 states and the District of Columbia that have laws and/or regulations that recognize, in one form or another, legitimate medical uses for cannabis and consumer use of cannabis in connection with medical treatment. Many other states are considering similar legislation.
