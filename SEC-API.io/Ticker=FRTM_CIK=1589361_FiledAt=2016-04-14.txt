 ITEM 1. Business. 

&#160; 

Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the terms &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; &#8220;registrant,&#8221; and &#8220;Company&#8221; refer to Mount Tam Biotechnologies, Inc., a Nevada corporation and, where applicable, its wholly-owned subsidiary Mount Tam Biotechnologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (&#8220;Mount Tam&#8221;).

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160;

The Company was established in November 2011 under the name TabacaleraYsidron. On August 13, 2015, the registrant entered into a Share Exchange and Conversion Agreement (the &#8220;Exchange Agreement&#8221;) by and among the registrant and a holder of a majority of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the registrant (the &#8220;Majority Shareholder&#8221;), on the one hand, and Mount Tam, the stockholders of Mount Tam (&#8220;Mount Tam Stockholders&#8221;), and the holders of certain convertible promissory notes of Mount Tam (&#8220;Mount Tam Noteholders&#8221;). Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding equity securities of Mount Tam and the Mount Tam Stockholders and the Mount Tam Noteholders become the controlling stockholders of the registrant. The transactions contemplated by the Exchange Agreement are hereinafter referred to as the &#8220;Share Exchange.&#8221; Prior to the Share Exchange, the registrant was a &#8220;shell company&#8221; (as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act), however, after the Share Exchange the registrant is no longer a shell company.

&#160;

Effective on August 31, 2015, the registrant changed its name from TabacaleraYsidron, Inc. to Mount TAM Biotechnologies, Inc. The name change was effected through a parent/subsidiary short-form merger of Mount TAM Biotechnologies, Inc., our wholly-owned Nevada subsidiary which we formed solely for the purpose of the name change, with and into the Company, with the Company as the surviving corporation. With the exception of the name change, there were no changes to the Company&#8217;s Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws. There will be no mandatory exchange of stock certificates.

&#160;

We are an emerging specialty biopharmaceutical company established to develop and bring to market a portfolio of pharmaceutical products targeting the treatment of autoimmune diseases.

&#160;

Our most advanced product candidate is TAM-01, a pre-clinical stage compound, which represents what we believe to be a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (&#8220; SLE &#8221;), the most common forms of lupus. On August 17, 2014, Mount Tam entered into a Research Collaboration and License Agreement (the &#8220; Buck Institute License Agreement &#8221;) with Buck Institute for Research on Aging, a non-profit research organization devoted to Geroscience and based in Northern California (&#8220; Buck Institute &#8221;), pursuant to which Mount Tam secured a worldwide exclusive license to certain compounds and technology to develop, manufacture and commercialize these compounds in the field of autoimmune diseases.

&#160;

All of our operations are located in the United States. We currently have no products that have obtained marketing approval in any jurisdiction, we have not generated revenues since inception and do not expect to do so in the foreseeable future due to the early stage nature of our current product candidate.

&#160;

A Background on Our Potential Market 

&#160;

We are currently focusing the development of product candidate in the field of SLE, an orphan autoimmune disease.

&#160;

An orphan disease is defined by the US Food and Drug Administration (&#8220; FDA &#8221;) as a medical condition that affect 200,000 people or less. An orphan drug is a medical product developed to treat such a disease.

&#160;

Lupus 

&#160;

According to the Lupus Foundation of America, 1.5 million Americans have some form of lupus and more than 16,000 new cases are reported annually in the United States alone, while other estimates are more conservative. Despite the significantly larger patient population over the defined orphan disease limit, the FDA continues to classify lupus as an orphan disease. The exact etiology of lupus is unknown. As an autoimmune disease, lupus makes the immune system unable to differentiate between healthy tissues and foreign invaders, leading the immune system to attack healthy tissues. This may cause inflammation of the joints, heart, lungs, kidneys, brain and blood vessels. Lupus is a disease that goes through stages of remission and flares.

&#160;

SLE is one of the most common forms of lupus. It is a chronic, inflammatory disorder that can damage any part of the body, including the skin, joints and internal organs. Lupus nephritis (&#8220; LN &#8221;) is a common complication for people with SLE, affecting up to 60% of SLE patients. LN is a kidney inflammation that may lead to significant illness and even death.

&#160;

There is currently no known cure for SLE and no treatment that fully stabilizes the disease. Patients diagnosed with lupus are treated with different types of supportive therapy, primarily consisting of antimalarials, corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and newer biologic agents that primarily address the symptoms of the disease at the expense of significant adverse events of varying severity. Such adverse events include but are not limited to inflammation, joint pain, blood clotting, mouth ulcers, skin rash, skin color changes, damage to the retina of the eye, morbidity, immune suppression, suppressed growth in children, diabetes, osteoporosis and high blood pressure.

&#160;

Our Product Candidate 

&#160;

Our first product candidate, TAM-01, is a rapamycin analog which exerts its action through direct binding and inhibition of the mammalian Target Of Rapamycin (&#8220; mTOR &#8221;). mTOR is a key regulatory pathway which is altered in individuals suffering from autoimmune disorders, including lupus. Based on extensive research conducted by various institutes, mTOR inhibitors may reduce disease activity and normalize T cell activation-induced calcium fluxing in SLE patients. The only effective mTOR targeting drugs currently approved by the FDA, are rapamycin (Sirolimus) and its first generation analogs (Temsirolimus, Everolimus). Unfortunately their utility as therapeutic agents for the treatment of chronic diseases such as SLE is severely limited due to their significant side effects, including impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, and lipid dysregulation. Our product candidate, TAM-01, is a small-molecule inhibitor of mTOR, which has shown in our pharmacology studies to maintain high therapeutic efficacy of rapamycin while significantly reducing or abolishing some of its side effects.

&#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Discovery, lead optimization and pre-development activities (including preliminary scale up) have been completed for TAM-01 and it is ready for initiation of IND-enabling safety studies. A number of pharmacological studies in validated disease models (such as the NZBW/F1J SLE mouse model) have demonstrated that TAM-01 exhibits dose-dependent efficacy similar to rapamycin or Temsirolimus. At 14-week dosage, TAM-01 is shown to reduce disease progression as measured by proteinuria, IgG anti-dsDNA and ANA serum antibody titers. Examination of the kidney pathology of the NZBW/F1J mice showed that TAM-01 ameliorated kidney disease and reduced renal Ig deposits similar to temsirolimus. Additionally, other studies have shown that, in contrast to both rapamycin and Temsirolimus, TAM-01 has minimal impact on glucose levels, glucose tolerance, reduced hyperlipidemia (cholesterol and triglyceride elevations), and no impact on reticulocyte count. TAM-01 has also completed preliminary non-GLP 14-day toxicology, safety, PK, ADME and preliminary scale up manufacturing studies. TAM-01 exhibits significantly higher oral bioavailability than rapamycin, which is expected to result in reduced variability of absorption, and superior pharmacokinetics, making it suitable for administration via a flexible dosing regiment.

&#160;

We are ready to initiate GLP studies in order to prepare and submit an Investigational New Drug (&#8220; IND &#8221;) to the FDA. We intend to advance TAM-01 to phase 1 clinical development in the United States within 18-24 months from the time we have completed our fundraising targets and recruitment of all required personnel. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to begin phase 1 clinical development in this time frame, if at all.

&#160; 

Our Suppliers and Manufacturers 

&#160;

We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We will rely on third-party contract manufacturers, or CMOs, for the manufacture of our product candidate for larger scale preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial quantities of our product candidate that are approved.

&#160;

We do not have any current contractual relationships for the manufacture of commercial supplies of our product candidate if it is approved, and we intend to enter into agreements with a third-party contract manufacturer and one or more back-up manufacturers for the commercial production of our product candidate as it nears potential approval.

&#160;

Any drug products to be used in clinical trials and any approved product that we may commercialize will need to be manufactured in facilities, and by processes, that comply with FDA&#8217;s current good manufacturing practice (&#8220;cGMP&#8221;) requirements and comparable requirements of the regulatory agencies of other jurisdictions in which we are seeking approval.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

We are a development company with no products currently on the market. We face competition from other companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations for collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, in recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientific and management personnel and for licenses to additional technologies. Many of our competitors will have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we have. Our success depends in part on our ability to build, obtain regulatory approval for and market acceptance of, and actively manage a portfolio of drugs that addresses unmet medical needs and creates value in patient therapy.

&#160; 

If approved, TAM-01 would compete with currently marketed drugs and therapies used for treatment of SLE and potentially with drug candidates currently in development. Patients diagnosed with lupus are currently treated with different types of supportive therapy drugs intended to address only the symptoms of the disease. Our main competitor is a biologic drug called Benlysta&#174;, the only FDA approved drug specifically for lupus patients. Benlysta targets and blocks B Lymphocyte Stimulator, which promotes autoimmunity by permitting autoimmune B cells to live longer. TAM-01 intends to take advantage of Benlysta&#8217;s limitations, which include limited efficacy, slow onset of action and a restrictive label.

&#160;

Our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business.

&#160; 

Intellectual Properties and Licenses 

&#160;

We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business and seek to obtain and maintain patents for any patentable aspects of our products and any other inventions that are important to the development of our business. Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain our patent portfolio and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, to defend and enforce our patents, to maintain our licenses to use intellectual property owned by third parties, to preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and to operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen, and maintain our proprietary position in the fields targeted by our diagnostic products and services.

&#160;

On August 17, 2014, Mount Tam entered into the Buck Institute License Agreement. This agreement establishes a joint research effort led by Buck Institute to identify and develop compounds from two specific chemical chemotypes identified therein. We provide certain funding for Buck Institute&#8217;s research efforts performed under the Buck Institute License Agreement. Under the terms of the Buck Institute License Agreement, Buck Institute assigned exclusive, worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize pharmaceutical products that incorporate a compound from one of two chemical compounds, identified therein, and exclusive rights to practice the drug discovery platform technology as necessary to research, develop and commercialize such pharmaceutical products. Such rights include an exclusively licensed library of more than 1,000 compounds. Mount Tam retains rights to inventions made by its employees, and Buck Institute will assign to Mount Tam all inventions made under the Buck Institute License Agreement jointly by its employees and Buck Institute personnel, provided that Mount Tam has complied with its funding obligations set forth in the Buck Institute License Agreement. On March 19, 2015 Mount Tam entered into an amendment to the Buck Institute License Agreement to extend the deadline of funding milestones and its reimbursement obligations for expenses that Buck Institute accrued relating to the patents under the Buck Institute License Agreement. On April 1, 2015, Mount Tam satisfied this revised funding milestone deadline with Buck Institute.

&#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

On October 12, 2015, the Buck Institute delivered to us a letter stating that we had not performed certain covenants set forth in the Buck Institute License Agreement, including certain payment obligations. On October 16, 2015, the Company responded to the October 12, 2015 letter from the Buck Institute, and in such response, the Company proposed to defer payments for up to 90 days. The Buck Institute has not responded to this letter and has taken no formal steps or actions to terminate the Buck Institute License Agreement. Due to the fact that we have not been able to remedy the defaults described in the written notice receive from the Buck Institute, the Buck Institute has the right to terminate the Buck Institute License Agreement upon 90 days written notice to us. We have failed to satisfy certain other payment obligations totaling $238,774 in the aggregate that we owe to the Buck Institute under the Buck Institute License Agreement. Thus, the Buck Institute has the right to terminate the Buck Institute License Agreement upon 90 days notice if material defaults are not cured. Based on our long-standing positive relationship with the Buck Institute, we do not believe that the Buck Institute will terminate the Buck Institute License Agreement. In addition even if we are able to satisfy all of the existing obligations owed to the Buck Institute, given our need for additional capital resources, we may be unable to meet our future obligations under the Buck Institute License Agreement. If the Company is unable to meet its obligations under the Buck Institute License Agreement, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.

&#160;

Within the licensed library is TAM-01. TAM-01&#8217;s composition of matter is patented, having an expiration date of 2023. Additional patents have been filed claiming the improved properties of TAM-01 which have extended projected patent coverage to 2031. TAM-01&#8217;s broad composition of matter coverage is generically claimed in ten major territories, including the United States, Canada, Hong Kong, India and Mexico. The current manufacturing process coverage, including the methods and know-how to manufacture TAM-01, is claimed in filings in ten major territories as well. The expiration date for this technology is 2023, and additional manufacturing process patents are expected to be filed over the next 12-24 months as improvements in manufacturing processes are made.

&#160;

As consideration for the assignments and licenses, we issued Buck Institute 1,200,000 (post-merger) (450,000 pre-merger) shares of our common stock and Mount Tam is obligated to pay to Buck Institute milestone payments on development of its proprietary products claimed by patents assigned or licensed to it by Buck Institute. Mount Tam also is obligated to pay low single digit royalties, including annual minimum royalties, on sales of such products. Should Mount Tam grant licenses or sublicenses to those patents to third parties, Mount Tam is obligated to share a percentage or resulting revenue with Buck Institute. Mount Tam&#8217;s royalty payment obligations are reduced if currently pending patent applications become invalid of if Mount Tam has to pay third parties to obtain certain licenses for the company to manufacture, use, sell or import its products produced pursuant to the Buck Institute License Agreement. Payment obligations terminate on expiration or annulment of the last patent covered by the Buck Institute License Agreement.

&#160;

The Buck Institute License Agreement will terminate upon the expiration of our payment obligations thereunder. Mount Tam can terminate the licenses to any or all licensed patents upon specified advance notice to Buck Institute. Buck Institute may terminate the license provisions of the agreement only for cause. Termination of the Buck Institute License Agreement does not terminate Mount Tam&#8217;s rights in patents assigned to it.

&#160;

Governmental Regulations 

&#160;

To date, we have conducted and will continue to conduct our pre-clinical testing through our partner Buck Institute. We do not have the ability to independently conduct clinical trials for our product candidates, and we rely on Buck Institute or other third parties, such as contract research organizations (&#8220; CRO s&#8221;), medical institutions, and clinical investigators, to perform this function. Our reliance on these third parties for clinical development activities reduces our control over these activities. Although we have, in the ordinary course of business, entered into agreements with these third parties, we continue to be responsible for confirming that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with its general investigational plan and protocol. Moreover, the FDA requires us to comply with regulations and standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practices or cGCPs, for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the trial participants are adequately protected. Our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of these responsibilities and requirements. To date, we believe Buck Institute and other similar entities with which we are working have performed well.

&#160;

The process of complying with FDA guidelines and obtaining approvals from the FDA of applications to market drugs and products is costly, time consuming and subject to unanticipated delays. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain FDA approval for any of our products.

&#160;

Development Activities 

&#160;

To gain regulatory approval of our products, we must demonstrate, through experiments, preclinical studies and clinical trials that our drug product candidate meets the safety and efficacy standards established by the FDA and other international regulatory authorities. In addition, we must demonstrate that all development-related laboratory, clinical and manufacturing practices comply with regulations of the FDA, other international regulators and local regulators.

&#160;

Regulations establish standards for various actions including: drug substances and materials; drug manufacturing operations and facilities; and analytical laboratories and medical development laboratory processes and environments. In each instance, these standards are in connection with research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, and distribution of product candidates, on a product-by-product basis.

&#160;

Pre-clinical Studies and Clinical Trials 

&#160;

Development testing generally begins with laboratory testing and experiments, as well as research studies using animal models to obtain preliminary information on a product&#8217;s efficacy and to identify potential safety issues. The results of these studies are compiled along with other information in an IND application, which is filed with the FDA. After resolving any questions raised by the FDA, which may involve additional testing and animal studies, clinical trials may begin. Regulatory agencies in other countries generally require a Clinical Trial Application to be submitted and approved before each trial can commence in each country.

&#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Clinical trials normally are conducted in three sequential phases and may take a number of years to complete. Phase 1 consists of testing the drug product in a small number of humans, normally healthy volunteers, to determine preliminary safety and tolerable dose range. Phase 2 usually involves studies in a limited patient population to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug product in humans having the disease or medical condition for which the product is indicated, determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and identify possible common adverse effects and safety risks. Phase 3 consists of additional controlled testing at multiple clinical sites to establish clinical safety and effectiveness in an expanded patient population of geographically dispersed test sites to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship for administering the product and to provide an adequate basis for product labeling. Phase 4 clinical trials may be conducted after approval to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication.

&#160;

The conduct of clinical trials is subject to stringent medical and regulatory requirements. The time and expense required to establish clinical sites, provide training and materials, establish communications channels and monitor a trial over a long period of time is substantial. The conduct of clinical trials at institutions located around the world is subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical trials, which vary widely from country to country. Delays or terminations of clinical trials could result from a number of factors, including stringent enrollment criteria, slow rate of enrollment, size of patient population, having to compete with other clinical trials for eligible patients, geographical considerations and others. Clinical trials are monitored by the regulatory agencies as well as medical advisory and standards boards, which could determine at any time to reevaluate, alter, suspend, or terminate a trial based upon accumulated data, including data concerning the occurrence of adverse health events during or related to the treatment of patients enrolled in the trial, and the regulator&#8217;s or monitor&#8217;s risk/benefit assessment with respect to patients enrolled in the trial. If they occur, such delays or suspensions could have a material impact on our bile salt development programs.

&#160;

Regulatory Review 

&#160;

The results of preclinical and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA in a New Drug Application (&#8220; NDA &#8221;), with comparable filings submitted to other international regulators. After the initial submission, the FDA has a period of time in which it must determine if the NDA is complete. After an NDA is submitted, although the statutory period provided for the FDA&#8217;s review is less than one year, dealing with questions or concerns of the agency and, taking into account the statutory timelines governing such communications, may result in review periods that can take several years. If an NDA is accepted for filing, following the FDA&#8217;s review, the FDA may grant marketing approval, request additional information, or deny the application if it determines that the application does not provide an adequate basis for approval. If the FDA grants approval, the approval may be conditioned upon the conduct of post-marketing clinical trials or other studies to confirm the product&#8217;s safety and efficacy for its intended use. Until the FDA has issued its approval, no marketing activities can be conducted in the United States. Similar regulations apply in other countries. There can be no assurance that any of the Company&#8217;s drug candidates will receive FDA approval or the approval of regulators in other countries.

&#160;

Fast Track and Breakthrough Designations 

&#160;

The FDA has various programs, including fast track and breakthrough therapy designations, which are intended to expedite the process for reviewing drugs. Even if a drug qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the drug no longer meets the conditions for qualification. Generally, drugs that are eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs, and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments.

&#160;

Fast track designation is intended to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need. Designation may be granted on the basis of preclinical data. A sponsor of a drug that receives fast track designation will typically have more frequent interactions with FDA during drug development. In addition, products that have been designated as fast track can obtain rolling review.

&#160;

Breakthrough therapy designation is intended to expedite the development and review of drugs for serious or life-threatening conditions. The criteria for breakthrough therapy designation require preliminary clinical evidence that demonstrates the drug may have substantial improvement on at least one clinically significant endpoint over available therapy. A breakthrough therapy designation conveys all of the fast track program features, more intensive FDA guidance on an efficient drug development program, an organizational commitment involving senior managers, and eligibility for rolling review and priority review.

&#160;

A key difference between fast track designation and breakthrough designation is what needs to be demonstrated to qualify for the programs. A breakthrough therapy designation is for a drug that treats a serious or life-threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement on a clinically significant endpoint(s) over available therapies. In contrast, a fast track designation is for a drug that treats a serious or life-threatening condition, and nonclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the serious condition.

&#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

When appropriate, the Company intends to seek fast track designation for our TAM-01 to treat SLE. There can be no assurance that the FDA will grant fast track designation. Even if such designation is provided, it may not result in a faster development or review time. Moreover, fast track designations do not increase the odds of approval. A fast track designation may be rescinded at any time if the drug candidate does not continue to meet the qualifications for these programs.

&#160;

Orphan Drug Designation 

&#160;

Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the US, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Because of the lack of treatments available for patients who suffer from SLE, we expect, but cannot guarantee, that the FDA will classify TAM-01 as an orphan indication. Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not guarantee any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.

&#160;

If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for such drug for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same product as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor&#8217;s product for the same indication or disease. If a drug designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity.

&#160;

Manufacturing Standards 

&#160;

The FDA and other international regulators establish standards and routinely inspect facilities and equipment, analytical and quality laboratories and processes used in the manufacturing and monitoring of products. Prior to granting approval of a drug product, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities, and the facilities of suppliers, to determine that the drug product is manufactured in accordance with cGMP and product specifications. Following approval, the FDA will conduct periodic inspections. If, in connection with a facility inspection, the FDA determines that a manufacturer does not comply with cGMP regulations and product specifications, the FDA will issue an inspection report citing the potential violations and may seek a range of remedies, from administrative sanctions, including the suspension of our manufacturing operations, to seeking civil or criminal penalties.

&#160;

International Approvals 

&#160;

Even if we were to succeed in gaining regulatory approval to market our products in the United States, we will still need to apply for approval with other international regulators if we want to sell outside the United States. Regulatory requirements and approval processes are similar in approach to that of the United States. With certain exceptions, although the approval of the FDA carries considerable weight, international regulators are not bound by the findings of the FDA and there is a risk that foreign regulators will not accept a clinical trial design or may require additional data or other information not requested by the FDA.

&#160;

Post-approval Regulations 

&#160;

Following the grant of marketing approval, the FDA regulates the marketing and promotion of drug products. Promotional claims are generally limited to the information provided in the product package insert for each drug product, which is negotiated with the FDA during the NDA review process. In addition, the FDA enforces regulations designed to guard against conflicts of interest, misleading advertising and improper compensation of prescribing physicians. The FDA will review, among other things, direct-to-consumer advertising, prescriber-directed advertising and promotional materials, sales representative communications to healthcare professionals, promotional programming and promotional activities on the Internet. The FDA will also monitor scientific and educational activities. If the FDA determines that a company has promoted a product for an unapproved use (&#8220;off-label&#8221;), or engaged in other violations, it may issue a regulatory letter and may require corrective advertising or other corrective communications to healthcare professionals. Enforcement actions may also potentially include product seizures, injunctions and civil or criminal penalties. The consequences of such an action and the related adverse publicity could have a material adverse effect on a developer&#8217;s ability to market its drug and its business as a whole.

&#160;

Following approval, the FDA and other international regulators will continue to monitor data to assess the safety and efficacy of an approved drug. A post-approval discovery of previously unknown problems or failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or a recall or withdrawal of the product from the market, as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. Similar oversight is provided by regulators in jurisdictions outside the US.

&#160;

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

None of our products under development has been approved for marketing in the United States or elsewhere. We may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for any of our products under development. If we do not obtain the requisite governmental approvals or if we fail to obtain approvals of the scope we request, we or our licensees or strategic alliance or marketing partners may be delayed or precluded entirely from marketing our products, or the commercial use of our products may be limited. Such events would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

&#160; 

Other Healthcare Laws and Regulations 

&#160;

If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our current or future product candidates, we may also be subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we conduct our business. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing and education programs. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; &#160;

&#160; &#183; federal false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent; &#160;

&#160; &#183; federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters; &#160;

&#160; &#183; the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, other healthcare providers, and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members; &#160;

&#160; &#183; Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information; and &#160;

&#160; &#183; state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry&#8217;s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. &#160;

If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental laws and regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and impact our financial results.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

We currently have three full time employees. In addition, we use advisors and consultants for research and development, clinical, regulatory, legal and administrative activities. We plan to hire additional staff as we expand research, production, business development, and sales and marketing programs. None of our employees are represented by a labor union.

Compliance with Environmental Laws 

&#160;

Our operations may require the use of hazardous materials (including biological materials) which subject us to a variety of federal, provincial and local environmental and safety laws and regulations. Some of the regulations under the current regulatory structure provide for strict liability, holding a party potentially liable without regard to fault or negligence. We could be held liable for damages and fines as a result of our, or others&#8217;, business operations should contamination of the environment or individual exposure to hazardous substances occur. We cannot predict how changes in laws or development of new regulations will affect our business operations or the cost of compliance.
