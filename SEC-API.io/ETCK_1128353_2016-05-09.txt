Introduction 

&#160;

Enerteck Corporation (the "Company" or "EnerTeck Parent"), formerly named Gold Bond Mining Company and then Gold Bond Resources, Inc., was incorporated under the laws of the State of Washington on July 30, 1935. On January 9, 2003, we acquired EnerTeck Chemical Corp. ("EnerTeck Sub") as our wholly owned operating subsidiary. As a result of the acquisition, we are now acting as a holding company, with EnerTeck Sub as our primary operating business. Subsequent to this transaction, on November 24, 2003, we changed our domicile from the State of Washington to the State of Delaware and changed our name from Gold Bond Resources, Inc. to EnerTeck Corporation. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms "we," "us" or "our" refer to EnerTeck Corporation and its consolidated subsidiary. 

&#160;

EnerTeck Sub, our wholly owned operating subsidiary, was incorporated in the State of Texas on November 29, 2000. It was formed for the purpose of commercializing a diesel fuel specific combustion catalyst known as EnerBurn &#210; , as well as other combustion enhancement and emission reduction technologies. Nalco/Exxon Energy Chemicals, L.P. ("Nalco/Exxon L.P."), a joint venture between Nalco Chemical Corporation and Exxon Corporation commercially introduced EnerBurn in 1998. When Nalco/Exxon L.P. went through an ownership change in 2000, our founder, Dwaine Reese, formed EnerTeck Sub. It acquired the EnerBurn trademark and related assets and took over the Nalco/Exxon L.P. relationship with the EnerBurn formulator and blender, and its then supplier, Ruby Cat Technology, LLC ("Ruby Cat"). 

&#160;

Since the first quarter of 2011, we have owned a 40% membership interest in a newly formed entity called EnerTeck Environmental, LLC, which was formed for the purpose of marketing and selling a diesel fuel emission reduction technology with the creators of such specific technology (see "Business of the Company and Current Operations" below). 

&#160;

Business of the Company and Current Operations 

&#160;

We, through our wholly owned subsidiary, specialize in the sales and marketing, and since August 2006, in the manufacturing of a fuel borne catalytic engine treatment for diesel engines known as EnerBurn &#210; . We utilize a sales process that includes detailed proprietary customer fleet monitoring protocols in on-road applications that quantify data and assists in managing certain internal combustion diesel engine operating results while utilizing EnerBurn. Test data prepared by Southwest Research Institute and actual customer usage has indicated that the use of EnerBurn in diesel engines improves fuel economy, lowers smoke, and decreases engine wear and the dangerous emissions of both Nitrogen Oxide (NOx) and microscopic airborne solid matter (particulates). Our principal target markets have included the trucking, heavy construction, maritime shipping, railroad and mining industries, as well as federal, state and international government applications. Each of these industries share certain common financial characteristics, i.e. (i) diesel fuel represents a disproportionate share of operating costs; and (ii) relatively small operating margins are prevalent. Considering these factors, management believes that the use of EnerBurn and the corresponding derived savings in diesel fuel costs can positively affect the operating margins of its customers while contributing to a cleaner environment. 

&#160;

&#160; 4 

&#160; &#160;

We own the EnerBurn trademark and, since July 2006, the EnerBurn formulas and technology. Prior to July 13, 2006, we obtained EnerBurn products and services from Ruby Cat and its affiliates pursuant to arrangement made with Ruby Cat. Pursuant to a memorandum of understanding with Ruby Cat which expired on December 31, 2003, the Company was granted the exclusive, global marketing rights from Ruby Cat and an option to purchase the EnerBurn technology and associated assets by December 31, 2003 for $6.6 million which was not exercised. Following expiration of the memorandum of understanding, Ruby Cat and its affiliates continued to supply EnerBurn products to the Company but not pursuant to a formal written contract. On July 13, 2006, we completed the acquisition of the EnerBurn formulas, technology and associated assets pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement executed as of the same date between the Company and the owner of Ruby Cat (see "Our Purchase of the EnerBurn Technology" below). 

&#160;

The majority of our marketing effort since 2005 has been directed at targeting and gaining a foothold in one of several major target areas, including the inland marine diesel market, trucking, heavy construction and mining. Management has focused virtually all resources at pinpointing and convincing certain large potential customers within these markets, with our diesel fuel additive product lines. While we still believe that this is a valid theory, the results, to date, have been less than we had expected. For example, in 2005, we appointed Custom Fuel Services Inc., a subsidiary of Ingram Barge and which provides dockside and midstream fueling from nine service locations in Louisiana, Kentucky, Illinois, West Virginia, Missouri and Iowa, as our exclusive reseller of EnerBurn and the related technology on the Western Rivers of the United States, meaning the Mississippi River, its tributaries, South Pass, and Southwest Pass, excluding the Intra Coastal Waterway. Since 2006, sales have been sporadic with Custom and we cannot guarantee that we will ever generate meaningful revenues from our relationship with Custom. 

&#160;

A substantial portion of 2010 was spent redirecting our marketing emphasis for our primary product, EnerBurn, to solidify our major customers and expanding to newer, more innovative areas. As such, we have created marketing alliances domestically and internationally with two new marketing groups, EnerGreen Technologies PTY, based in Australia ("EnerGreen"), and G2 Fuel Technologies, LLC ("G2 Technologies"), a minority owned marketing firm working in both the domestic and foreign markets (see "Sales and Marketing Strategy" below").

&#160;

G2 Technologies, our new Certified Minority supplier and distributor, had advised us that several of its customers would start using EnerBurn. We are hopeful that sales will commence during 2016. 

&#160;

As indicated above, since the first quarter of 2011, we have owned a 40% membership interest in a newly formed entity called EnerTeck Environmental, LLC ("EnerTeck Environmental"), which was formed for the purpose of marketing and selling a diesel fuel emission reduction technology with the creators of such specific technology. EnerTeck Environmental was formed as a joint venture with Indian Nation Technologies, LLC ("Indian Nation") located in Comanche, Oklahoma for the testing and manufacture of an innovative new type of environmental equipment for the remediation of diesel engine emissions for diesel engines in the marine industry. Indian Nation has filed a patent for this equipment called PEx &#210; (Particle Extraction) and we will hold the exclusive marketing rights for this technology for the various applications within the marine diesel industry. Testing commenced late in the first quarters of 2011 on a towboat located on the Mississippi River. The test on the PEx technology was been successfully completed, however, due to the financial insolvency of the independent testing company selected by the customer, no certified final results from the tests were presented to either the Company or the client, which could be presented to the California Air Quality Control Board (CARB) for approval. Because the principal tester for the testing company has left the Company without completing his work, it will be necessary to run new tests with a new independent testing group before further progress can be made on achieving CARB and other approvals. Subsequent to year ended 2015, the Company was approached by a new potential JV partner/customer for the PEx technology and a project is being negotiated for the testing. It is anticipated that acceptance of this technology will open vast new marketing opportunities for us in the coming years.

The Industry 

&#160;

General Discussion of Diesel Fuel and Diesel Fuel Additives 

&#160;

As crude oil is heated, various components evaporate at increasingly higher temperatures. First to evaporate is butane, the lighter-than-air gas used in cigarette lighters, for instance. The last components of crude oil to evaporate, and the heaviest, include the road tars used to make asphalt paving. In between are gasoline, jet fuel, heating oil, lubricating oil, bunker fuel (used in ships), and of course diesel fuel. The fuel used in diesel engine applications such as trucks and locomotives is a mixture of different types of molecules of hydrogen and carbon and include aromatics and paraffin. Diesel fuel cannot burn in liquid form. It must vaporize into its gaseous state. This is accomplished by injecting the fuel through spray nozzles at high pressure. The smaller the nozzles utilized and the higher the pressure, the finer the fuel spray and vaporization. When more fuel vaporizes, combustion is more complete, so less soot will form inside the cylinders and on the injector nozzles. Soot is the residue of carbon, partially burned and unburned fuel. 

&#160;

Sulfur is also found naturally in crude oil. Sulfur is a slippery substance and it helps lubricate fuel pumps and injectors. It also forms sulfuric acid when it burns and is a catalyst for the formation of particulate matter (one of the exhaust emissions being regulated). In an effort to reduce emissions, the sulfur content of diesel fuel is being reduced through the refinery process; however, the result is a loss of lubricity. 

&#160;

Diesel fuel has other properties that affect its performance and impact on the environment as well. The main problems associated with diesel fuel include:

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Difficulty getting it to start burning

&#160;

&#183; 

Difficulty getting it to burn completely

&#160;

&#183; 

Tendency to wax and gel

&#160;

&#183; 

With introduction of low sulfur fuel, reduced lubrication

&#160;

&#183; 

Soot clogging injector nozzles

&#160;

&#183; 

Particulate emissions

&#160;

&#183; 

Water in the fuel

&#160;

&#183; 

Bacterial growth

&#160;

Diesel fuel additives have been developed to address the variety of problems associated with diesel fuel performance. 

&#160;

Diesel Fuel and the Environment 

&#160;

Diesel fuel is the most cost effective fuel/engine technology available for heavy-duty industrial and vehicle service. However, environmentally it needs dramatic improvement. Governments worldwide are legislating specifications regarding the fuel itself and diesel engine design. 

&#160;

Today's advanced diesel engines are far cleaner than the smoke-belching diesels of recent decades. Unfortunately, even smokeless diesel engines are not clean enough to meet current stricter air pollution regulations. 

&#160;

While diesel engines are the only existing cost-effective technology making significant inroads in reducing "global warming" emissions from motor vehicles, it is not sufficient to satisfy regulators and legislators. Diesel engines will soon be required to adhere to stringent regulatory/legislative guidelines that meet near "zero" tailpipe emissions, especially on smog-forming nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM) and "toxins"; the organic compounds of diesel exhaust. 

&#160;

Diesel engines can become ultra-clean. Meeting the environmental challenges will require extensive research on clean-diesel technology. Research in this area is currently being sponsored by government agencies, major engine companies, truck manufacturers, automobile makers, catalyst producers and, for fuels, oil refining companies and their technology suppliers. 

&#160;

The search for ultra-clean diesel is far from over. Discoveries and breakthroughs will continue to prevail. Large Fortune 500 companies, as well as small, emerging technology companies are investing hundreds of millions of dollars in research and development worldwide on these and other clean-diesel technologies. 

&#160;

&#160; 6 

&#160; &#160;

Today, there is no economic alternative to diesel engines for most industrial applications. This is true for ocean vessels, tug boats, commercial/recreational vessels, locomotive, trucking, bus transport, construction, mining, agriculture, logging, distributed power generation, and, in many parts of the world, personal transportation. In short, diesel fuel does the world's heavy work. 

&#160;

Products and Services 

&#160;

The Diesel Fuel Additive Product Line 

&#160;

EnerBurn Combustion Catalyst for Diesel Fuel 

&#160;

EnerBurn is a liquid, chemical formulation, presently sold in bulk quantities to fleet and vessel operators, under three product codes differentiated by market application and product concentration, as indicated below: 

&#160;

Product 

Application EnerBurn EC5805A

U.S. On-Road Market EnerBurn EC5931A

U.S. Off-Road Market EnerBurn EC5805C

International Market &#160;

Although added to diesel fuel and generally referred to as a diesel fuel additive within the industry, EnerBurn functions as an engine treatment application by removing carbon deposits from the combustion surfaces of the engine and greatly reducing further carbon deposit buildup. It also provides for an increased rate of combustion. By adding EnerBurn to diesel fuel in accordance with proprietary methodology, it forms a non-hazardous catalytic surface in the diesel engine combustion chamber and on the surface of the piston heads. This surface is visible in the form of a monomolecular film that develops after initiation of treatment and remains active for a period of time after cessation of treatment. 

&#160;

The buildup of carbon within the combustion chamber of a diesel engine can generate greater exhaust opacity and increased engine wear. These carbon deposits can cause piston rings to stick and reduce compression resulting in decreased engine efficiency with extended use. 

&#160;

The unique chemical formulation of EnerBurn, when applied in accordance with proprietary methodology, has been shown to produce benefits in fuel economy, NOx formation, smoke, brake horsepower and engine wear (See "Product Testing", below). 

&#160;

EnerBurn Volumetric Proportioning Injector Equipment (VPI) 

&#160;

Volumetric proportioning injection equipment is used to deliver proper dosage ratios of EnerBurn to the diesel fuel, and are typically offered to our customers in support of an EnerBurn sale. Three equipment vendors supply additive injection equipment to us that is either installed at a bulk fueling depot or onboard the vehicle or vessel. 

&#160;

Product Testing 

&#160;

Southwest Research Institute 

&#160;

The Southwest Research Institute ("SWRI") of San Antonio, Texas has extensively tested the EnerBurn technology. This institute is an independent, nonprofit, applied engineering and physical sciences research and development organization with 11 technical divisions using multidisciplinary approaches to problem solving. The Institute occupies 1,200 acres and provides nearly two million square feet of laboratories, test facilities, workshops, and offices for more the 2,700 employees who perform contract work for industry and government clients. 

&#160;

The extensive testing of EnerBurn conducted by SWRI confirmed product claims of lower highway smoke, reduced NOx emissions, a significant reduction in engine wear and an increase in horsepower. Actual customer usage data has also confirmed the claim that EnerBurn usage reduces fuel consumption. 

&#160;

A new test was completed during the first quarter of 2015 by one of our largest customers at SWRI to demonstrate the effectiveness of EnerBurn on newly developed, more efficient running diesel engines, the results of which have not been fully analyzed and reported to the Company as of the date of this report. Management believes that a successful result from this test should lead to significant new business in the marine, rail and other industries. 

&#160;

&#160; &#160;

EnerBurn Proof of Performance Demonstrations 

&#160;

An integral part of our sales process is to conduct proof of performance demonstrations for potential customers wherein we accumulate historical fleet data that documents the effects of the use of EnerBurn (i.e. advantages in terms of increased fuel economy, a decrease in engine wear and reductions in toxic emissions) on that customer's specific vehicles or vessels. In connection with these proofs of performance demonstrations, we provide fleet monitoring services and forecasts of fuel consumption for purposes of the prospective customer's own analysis. 

&#160;

The results below are indicative of typical customer experiences using EnerBurn. In many instances, customers have directly informed us about their satisfaction with EnerBurn and the fuel savings that its use has provided them. In all cases, our own comparison of the customer provided historical fuel usage data with the EnerBurn usage (which we have monitored) data has proven to us and the customer that the use of EnerBurn has reduced their fuel consumption. In addition to fuel consumption reduction, the decrease in emissions resulting from EnerBurn use is measured with a device called the UEI Intelligent Solutions Meter. Similarly, the percentage reduction in opacity (smoke generated by diesel engines) is measured by the Wager 6500 Meter (manufactured by Robert H. Wager Co., Inc.).

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

An EnerBurn proof of performance demonstration of a long haul truck fleet began in August of 1998. The number of trucks treated with EnerBurn exceeded 3,000-Century Class Freightliners, most of that were equipped with Caterpillar or similar type engines. This company's measurable fuel savings averaged 10.4% over a 3 plus year period while using EnerBurn, resulting in annual fuel savings in excess of $6.5 million. In addition, the company's maintenance department observed significant reductions in metal loss in crankcase wear-parts, although they did not attempt to quantify the value of this phenomenon.

&#160;

&#183; 

A fleet of 24 three-year-old 1400 horsepower Morrison Knudson MK1500 locomotives with Caterpillar 3512 diesel engines were used for a 12-month proof of performance demonstration of the effectiveness of EnerBurn. This demonstration started on July 1, 1999 and clearly documented a 10.8% reduction in fuel consumption and a 9.5% reduction in Brake Specific Fuel Consumption ("BSFC"). The demonstration also reflected a significant reduction in engine wear, confirmed by a 56% reduction in copper content of the lube oil.

&#160;

&#183; 

Three maritime vessels were selected from a large fleet, based on size and typical routes for accessibility of regular fueling at this company's bulk fueling barge. A proof of performance protocol was developed under the guidance and supervision of this company's management. The base line demonstration commenced on July 11, 2001 and the final demonstration was performed on February 28, 2002. One of the three demonstration vessels represented an untreated placebo; two were treated with EnerBurn. The two treated vessels exhibited a measured reduction in fuel consumption of 7% and 9.9%, while the untreated placebo experienced nearly a 10% increase in fuel consumption. Additionally five vessels with different diesel engines were selected for proof of performance under the same protocols yielding results in excess of 10% in fuel savings, significant reductions in opacity, from 33%-86%, reductions of NOx emissions between 11% and 20%.

&#160; Overview of Worldwide Distillate Fuel Consumption 

&#160;

The U.S. Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration ("EIA") estimates that worldwide annual consumption of distillate fuel oil for 2012 was approximately 26,358 thousand barrels per day, with the United States ranked first at 3,741 thousand barrels per day, China ranked second at 3,447 thousand barrels per day and India ranked third at 1,420 thousand barrels per day.

Our Target Markets 

&#160;

Our principal target markets have included the trucking, heavy construction, maritime shipping, railroad and mining industries, as well as federal, state and international government applications. We believe each of these industries shares certain common financial characteristics, i.e. (i) diesel fuel represents a disproportionate share of operating costs; and (ii) relatively small operating margins are prevalent. Considering these factors, management believes that the use of EnerBurn and the corresponding derived savings in diesel fuel costs can positively affect the operating margins of its customers while contributing to a cleaner environment.

&#160;

Sales and Marketing Strategy 

&#160;

The fuel additive industry has historically been mired by a myriad of technically dubious products and potential customers are usually wary of promotional claims by product manufacturers or "snake oil" peddlers as they are sometimes labeled. 

&#160;

Prospective customers in all targeted market sectors and geographic locations are primarily concerned about the potential business risks associated with the adoption of any new fuel or engine treatment. Thus, the first resistant barrier to adoption of a fleet proof of performance demonstration is dispelling fear about impact on engine warranties and any potential business risk associated with a fleet shutdown caused by our product. The potential EnerBurn fuel and maintenance savings are strong motivators but are secondary to risk avoidance. The SWRI fitness for use testing and customer testimonials are paramount in assisting us in addressing these fears. 

&#160;

Potential customers have a strong predisposition to accept only demonstrable proof-of-benefit in their own fleet as justification for any new expenditure. After risk avoidance, the ability to demonstrate and prove results is the primary obstacle for market adoption of the EnerBurn product. 

&#160;

Our sales process begins with a proof of performance demonstration that is a thorough analysis of the potential customer, including fleet type, size, and opportunity. (See "Business - Product Testing - EnerBurn Proof of Performance Demonstrations", above). This is followed with sales presentations at both the executive level and maintenance level. Executive level sales presentations emphasize return on investment ("ROI"), while maintenance level sales presentations emphasize our technology and why it does not impact engine warranties and any potential business risk associated with a fleet shutdown. 

&#160;

Convincing a potential customer to undertake a proof of performance demonstration is a difficult task because there is a significant expense to be borne by the potential customer. Specifically, the potential customer must pay for both the EnerBurn that is used during the demonstration as well as purchase the additive injection equipment that is also needed. The cost will vary according to the potential customer and the industry in which it is in. For a proof of performance demonstration on a typical fleet of 100 diesel engine trucks, the cost of the EnerBurn would be approximately $30,000, while the average cost of the equipment used would be approximately $20,000 to $50,000. The personnel costs related to providing fleet monitoring services and forecasts of fuel consumption for the potential customer's analysis are borne either by the Company, its supplier or the sales agent. For a demonstration involving a fleet of 100 hundred trucks, typically 50 to 100 man-hours are involved. The current sales cycle from inception to full customer implementation is typically six to 12-months from initial customer contact. This includes the two to six months it usually takes for the benefits of EnerBurn to begin to take effect in the subject engines during the proof of performance demonstration period.

&#160;

As indicated above, we have created marketing alliances both domestically and internationally with two marketing groups, EnerGreen and G2 Technologies. We have entered into a Distributorship Agreement with EnerGreen which has a wide network of industrial sector contacts in Australia, Southern Asia, Europe, Brazil, Peru and Paraguay. G2 Technologies has entered into a Reseller and Market Development Agreement with us. G2 Technologies, which is a large minority-owned U.S. defense contractor, intends to sell EnerBurn, injection equipment and emissions control systems to the government and related customers, and has qualified EnerBurn into a government-approved catalog for fuel efficiency and emissions control products. 

&#160;

&#160; &#160;

Our Purchase of the EnerBurn Technology 

&#160;

As mentioned above, prior to July 2006, we obtained EnerBurn products and services from Ruby Cat and its affiliates pursuant to arrangement made with Ruby Cat. Pursuant to a memorandum of understanding with Ruby Cat which expired on December 31, 2003, the Company was granted the exclusive, global marketing rights from Ruby Cat and an option to purchase the EnerBurn technology and associated assets by December 31, 2003 for $6.6 million which was not exercised. Following expiration of the memorandum of understanding, Ruby Cat and its affiliates continued to supply EnerBurn products to the Company but not pursuant to a formal written contract.

&#160;

On July 13, 2006, we acquired the EnerBurn formulas, technology and associated assets pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement executed as of the same date (the "EnerBurn Acquisition Agreement") between the Company and the owner of Ruby Cat (the "Seller"). Pursuant thereto, the Company acquired from the Seller all of its rights with respect to the liquid diesel motor vehicle fuel additives known as EC5805A and EC5931A products (the "Products") as well as its rights to certain intellectual property and technology associated with the Products (collectively, the "Purchased Assets"). The purchase price for the Purchased Assets was $3.0 million, payable as follows: (i) $1.0 million paid on July 13, 2006 in cash, and (ii) the remaining $2.0 million evidenced by a promissory note (the "Note") bearing interest each month at a rate of 4.0% per annum, compounded monthly, and which is to be paid in four annual payments of $500,000 plus accumulated interest to that date on each anniversary of the closing until the entire purchase price is paid in full. In order to secure the debt represented by the Note, the Company executed and delivered to the Seller a Security Agreement in which the Company granted the Seller a first priority lien on the Purchased Assets. The first payment of $500,000 was made in advance in May 2007. An additional $500,000 due July 13, 2008 was also made in advance of the due date, on July 3, 2008. Due to litigation commenced between the Company and the Seller, the Company requested the court to grant it leave to pay the remaining installments under the EnerBurn Acquisition Agreement into the registry of the court pending adjudication of such matter. The court granted the request and the Company paid the third annual installment of $500,000 plus accrued interest into the registry on July 13, 2009. On March 31, 2010, the parties to the lawsuit entered into a settlement agreement pursuant to which, among other things, the remaining installments due under the EnerBurn Acquisition Agreement were paid by the Company on July 22, 2010, along with an additional sum of $75,000. 

&#160;

The EnerBurn Acquisition Agreement provides that for five years after closing the Seller will not, within the United States or anywhere abroad, be engaged in the business of researching, developing, manufacturing, marketing or selling products intended to improve the fuel efficiency of heavy duty diesel engines. 

&#160;

Contemporaneously with the closing, the Company granted the Seller a non-exclusive, fully paid, perpetual, non-revocable, royalty-free, assignable license, to manufacture, market and sell a certain product known as "Thermoboost II", which has the same chemical formulation as one of the Products and which is used exclusively in home heating oil. 

&#160;

Manufacturing 

&#160;

The acquisition of the EnerBurn formulas, technology and associated assets has provided us the ability to transform our business from a sales organization to a fully integrated manufacturer and distributor of EnerBurn. From 2006 to 2009, the manufacturing of our EnerBurn product had been undertaken pursuant to a Manufacturing and Supply Agreement entered into on August 18, 2006 with Independent Contract Packaging, Inc., a Texas corporation located in Cut and Shoot, Texas ("ICP"). Pursuant to the agreement, ICP was appointed as our non-exclusive manufacturer, blender and packager of our EnerBurn product for a term of three years which ended in 2009. We subsequently moved our principal manufacturing operation to Magna Blend of Waxahachie, Texas, with a second company, J. T. Enterprises of Tyler, Texas as our backup manufacturing facility. We have agreed to supply certain tanks and related equipment and raw materials to be used by J. T. Enterprise to manufacture, blend and package the EnerBurn product, and both Magna Blend and J. T. Enterprises have agreed to provide their manufacturing, blending and packaging services on a commercially reasonably prompt basis according to the specifications received from and required by us. For such services, we have agreed to pay each its fees pursuant to an agreed upon fee schedule. On October 3, 2011, a fire broke out at the Magna Blend Chemical plant in Waxahachie, Texas. We replaced the required raw material inventories and moved our blending operations from Magna Blend to ChemJet Chemicals, and facility located in Conroe, Texas.

&#160; &#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The market for products and services that increase diesel fuel economy, reduce emissions and engine wear is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive and management expects it to increase due to the implementation of stricter environmental standards. Competition can come from other fuel additives, fuel and engine treatment products and from producers of engines that have been modified or adapted to achieve these results. In addition, we believe that new technologies, including additives, will further increase competition. 

&#160;

Our primary current competitors include Lubrizol Corporation, Chevron Oronite Company (a subsidiary of Chevron Corporation), Octel Corp., Clean Diesel Technologies, Inc. and Ethyl Corporation. 

&#160;

Many of our competitors have been in business longer than it has, have significantly greater financial, technical, and other resources, or greater name recognition. Our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. Competition could negatively impact our business. Competitive pressures could cause us to lose market share or to reduce the price of its products, either of which could harm its business, financial condition and operating results. 

&#160;

Management believes that the principal competitive factors in the Company's market include the: 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

effectiveness of the product;

&#160;

&#183; 

cost;

&#160;

&#183; 

proprietary technology;

&#160;

&#183; 

ease of use; and

&#160;

&#183; 

Quality of customer service and support.

&#160; 

Government Regulation - Fuel Additive Registration 

&#160;

We need to comply with registration requirements for each geographic jurisdiction in which it sells EnerBurn. On January 21, 2001, the US Environmental Protection Agency, pursuant to the Environmental Protection Act (the "Act") (40 CFR 79.23) issued permit number EC 5805A in connection with the use of EnerBurn. This registration allows EnerBurn to be used anywhere in the United States for highway use in all over-the-road diesel applications. Additionally, on March 30, 2004, we received a second EPA permit, permit number EC 5931A in connection with the use of EnerBurn. This registration allows EC 5931A to be used anywhere in the United States for use in all diesel applications. Under these registrations, we have pass through rights from the formulator, blender and supplier to sell EnerBurn in on-road applications. However, there are provisions in the Act under which the EPA could require further testing. The EPA has not exercised these provisions yet for any additive. Internationally, we intend to seek registration in other countries as we develops market opportunities.

Our business is impacted by air quality regulations and other regulations governing vehicle emissions as well as emissions from stationary engines. If such regulations were abandoned or determined to be invalid, its prospects may be adversely affected. As an example, if crude oil and resulting diesel prices were to reach or approach historical lows, the emphasis for fuel efficiency would be diminished, potentially impacting sales velocity of the products, consequently adversely affecting our performance. Typically, there are registration and regulation requirements for fuel additives in each country in which they are sold. In the United States, fuel and fuel additives are registered and regulated pursuant to Section 211 of the Clean Air Act. 40 CFR Part 79 and 80 specifically relates to the registration of fuels and fuel additives 

&#160;

In accordance with the Clean Air Act regulations at 40 CFR 79, manufacturers (including importers) of gasoline, diesel fuel and additives for gasoline or diesel fuel, are required to have their products registered by the EPA prior to their introduction into commerce. Registration involves providing a chemical description of the fuel or additive, and certain technical, marketing, and health-effects information. The health-effects research is divided into three tiers of requirements for specific categories of fuels and additives. Tier 1 requires a health-effects literature search and emissions characterization. Tier 2 requires short-term inhalation exposures of laboratory animals to emissions and screened for adverse health effects, unless comparable data are already available. Alternative Tier 2 testing can be required in lieu of standard Tier 2 if EPA concludes that such testing would be more appropriate. Certain small businesses are exempt from some or all the Tier 1 and Tier 2 requirements. Tier 3 provides for follow-up research, if necessary.
