Corporate History and Structure 

&#160;

China United Insurance Service, Inc. (&#8220;China United,&#8221; &#8220;CUIS,&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is a Delaware corporation organized on June 4, 2010 by Yi Hsiao Mao, a Taiwanese citizen, and is quoted on the Over the Counter Bulletin Board (&#8220;OTCBB&#8221;). The Company&#8217;s operating companies are in Taiwan and China. Unless context indicates otherwise, reference to the &#8220;Company&#8221; throughout this annual report refers to China United and its subsidiaries. Reference to Action Holdings Financial Limited (&#8220;AHFL&#8221;), refers to the combined operations of AHFL and its Taiwan Subsidiaries. Reference to Anhou refers to the combined operations of Anhou and its subsidiaries.

&#160;

ZLI Holdings Limited (&#8220;CU Hong Kong&#8221;), a wholly owned Hong Kong-based subsidiary of China United, was originally founded by China United, on July 12, 2010 under Hong Kong laws. On October 20, 2010, CU Hong Kong founded a wholly foreign owned enterprise, Zhengzhou Zhonglian Hengfu Consulting Co., Ltd. (&#8220;CU WFOE&#8221;) in Henan province of the PRC.

&#160;

Law Anhou Insurance Agency Co., Ltd. (&#8220;Anhou&#8221;, formerly known as Zhengzhou Anhou Insurance Agency Co., Ltd.) was founded in Henan province of the PRC on October 9, 2003. Anhou provides insurance agency services in the PRC. On November 26, 2013, Anhou changed its name into Law Anhou Insurance Agency Co., Ltd. and obtained its new business license. On December 18, 2013, Anhou obtained its new Professional Insurance Agency License from local bureau of China Insurance Regulatory Commission (&#8220;CIRC&#8221;) which reflects its new name.

&#160;

On September 26, 2013, several new PRC individual investors, namely Yanyan Wang, Zhaohui Chen, Jing Yue, Weizhe Hou, Yong Zhang, Li Chen (&#8220;Anhou New Investors&#8221;) and the original shareholders of Anhou, namely, Shuqin Zhu, Qun Wei, Qunlei Fang and Yanxia Chen (&#8220;Anhou Original Shareholders&#8221;) entered into a shareholders resolution of Anhou, pursuant to which, Anhou Original Shareholders and Anhou New Investors agreed to increase the registered capital of Anhou to RMB50 million ($8,165,895), among which, Yanyan Wang would invest RMB10 million ($1,633,179), accounting for 20%, Zhaohui Chen would invest RMB10 million ($1,633,179), accounting for 20%, Jing Yue would invest RMB7.5 million ($1,224,871), accounting for 15%, Weizhe Hou would invest RMB5 million ($816,589), accounting for 10%, Yong Zhang would invest RMB4.5 million ($734,930), accounting for 9%, and Li Chen would invest RMB3 million ($489,949), accounting for 6%, of the registered capital of Anhou.

&#160;

Due to PRC legal restrictions on foreign ownership and investment in the insurance agency businesses in China, particularly those based on qualifications as well as capital requirements of the investors, Able Capital Holding Co., Ltd., a limited liability company established and registered in Hong Kong, delegated four PRC individuals, namely Yanyan Wang, Zhaohui Chen, Weizhe Hou and Yong Zhang, to invest in Anhou on its behalf.

&#160;

2&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

On October 24, 2013, Anhou completed the registration with local Administration Industry and Commerce (&#8220;AIC&#8221;) on the above-mentioned capital increase. The new business license was issued to Anhou on October 25, 2013.

&#160;

The registered capital increase of Anhou was in response to the promulgations of certain regulations by China Insurance Regulatory Commission (&#8220;CIRC&#8221;). On April 27, 2013, CIRC issued the Decision on Revising the Provisions of the Supervision and Administration of Specialized Insurance Agencies (the &#8220;Decision on Revising the Agency Provisions&#8221;), pursuant to which, CIRC has mandated any insurance agency established subsequent to the Decision on Revising the Agency Provisions to meet a minimum registered capital requirement of RMB50 million ($8,165,890). On May 16, 2013, CIRC issued Notice for Further Clarification on Related Issues of Access to Professional Insurance Intermediary Market (the &#8220;Notice&#8221;), pursuant to which, professional insurance agencies established prior to the issuance of the Decision on Revising the Agency Provisions, with registered capital less than RMB50 million ($8,165,890), can continue operation of their existing business within the provinces where they have the registered office or branch office, but shall not set up any new branches in any province where they do not have the registered office or any branch office.

&#160;

Prior to the capital increase, Anhou, a professional insurance agency with a PRC nationwide license, has a registered capital in the amount of RMB10 million ($1,633,178). The branch offices of Anhou were all in Henan province. To better implement its expansion strategies, Anhou increased its registered capital to RMB50 million ($8,165,890) to meet the requirement of CIRC so that it can set up new branches in any province beyond its current operations in Mainland China.

&#160;

On October 24, 2013, Anhou Original Shareholders entered into share transfer agreements (the &#8220;Share Transfer Agreements&#8221;) with Changrong Hu, a PRC citizen (&#8220;Mr. Hu&#8221; together with Anhou New Investors, &#8220;Anhou Existing Shareholders&#8221;), respectively. Under the Share Transfer Agreements, Anhou Original Shareholders transferred all of their equity interests in Anhou to Mr. Hu for an aggregate transfer price of RMB10 million ($1,633,178). Mr. Hu is currently the legal representative, General Manager and the sole director of Anhou.

&#160;

On October 24, 2013, Anhou completed the share transfer registration with the local AIC. At the end of October 2013, Anhou completed its filing with local CIRC with respect to its previously-conducted share transfer and capital increase.

&#160;

Anhou&#8217;s wholly owned subsidiary Sichuan Kangzhuang Insurance Agency Co., Ltd. (&#8220;Sichuan Kangzhuang&#8221;) was founded on September 4, 2006 in Sichuan province of the PRC, and it provides insurance agency services in the PRC. On August 23, 2010, at Sichuan Kangzhuang&#8217;s general meeting of shareholders, its shareholders voted for transferring all of their equity interests in Sichuan Kangzhuang to Anhou for RMB532,622 ($83,444). On September 6, 2010, the equity transfer agreements were signed between Anhou and each shareholder of Sichuan Kangzhuang. Anhou has complied with all of the applicable laws and regulations with respect to its holding 100% equity interests in Sichuan Kangzhuang.

&#160;

3&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Jiangsu Law Insurance Brokers Co., Ltd. (&#8220;Jiangsu Law&#8221; collectively with Anhou, Sichuan Kangzhuang, the &#8220;Consolidated Affiliated Entities&#8221;, each a &#8220;Consolidated Affiliated Entity&#8221;) was founded on September 19, 2005 in Jiangsu province of the PRC. Jiangsu Law is allowed to provide insurance brokerage services. On August 12, 2010, at Jiangsu Law&#8217;s general meeting of shareholders, its shareholders voted for transferring all of their shareholdings to Anhou for RMB518,000 ($81,153). On September 28, 2010, the equity transfer agreements were signed between Anhou and each individual shareholder of Jiangsu Law. Pursuant to Provisions on the Supervision and Administration of Insurance Brokerage Institutions, effective on October 1, 2009, if an insurance brokerage entity fails to bring its registered capital to no less than RMB10,000,000 ($1,566,661) on or prior to October 1, 2012, the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (&#8220;CIRC&#8221;) or its local counterpart, as applicable, may determine not to extend the insurance brokerage license. To meet such minimum registered capital requirement, on February 11, 2011, Anhou invested RMB4.82 million ($755,131) in Jiangsu Law to increase the registered capital to RMB10 million ($1,566,661). Anhou has complied with all of the applicable laws and regulations with respect to its holding 100% equity interests in Jiangsu Law.

&#160;

On January 16, 2011, China United issued 20,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.00001 par value per share, to several non-US persons for their investment of $300,000 in cash in the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries. The issuance was made pursuant to an exemption from registration contained in Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The consideration was paid to the account of CU Hong Kong by May 6, 2011. All $300,000 was contributed into the bank account of CU WFOE as registered capital.

&#160;

Due to PRC legal restrictions on foreign ownership and investment in insurance agency and brokerage businesses in China, especially those on qualifications as well as capital requirement of the investors, we operate our PRC business primarily through our Consolidated Affiliated Entities in China. We do not hold equity interests in our Consolidated Affiliated Entities. However, through the VIE Agreements (as described in more details below) with Anhou and its shareholders, we effectively control, and are able to derive substantially all of the economic benefits from, these Consolidated Affiliated Entities. On January 19, 2015, the Ministry of Commerce of China (&#8220;MOFCOM&#8221;) published a draft version of a proposed Foreign Investment Law (the &#8220;Draft Foreign Investment Law&#8221;) with an explanatory note. MOFCOM has requested comments from the public on the Draft Foreign Investment Law by February 17, 2015, which, once promulgated, will replace and integrate the three existing laws over foreign investment, however, how these changes will affect entities currently operating in China, particularly foreign controlled variable interest entities, is not entirely clear. See &#8220;Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure in the PRC&#8221;.

&#160;

4&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Our Consolidated Affiliated Entities in China are variable interest entities through which all of our insurance services in China are operated. It is through the VIE Agreements that we have effective control of the Consolidated Affiliated Entities, which allows us to consolidate the financial results of the Consolidated Affiliated Entities in our financial statements. If Anhou and its shareholders fail to perform their obligations under the VIE Agreements, we could be limited in our ability to enforce the VIE Agreements that give us effective control. Furthermore, if we are unable to maintain effective control of our Consolidated Affiliated Entities, we would not be able to continue to consolidate the Consolidated Affiliated Entities&#8217; financial results with our financial results. During each of the fiscal years ended June 30, 2011 and 2012, 100% of our revenues in our consolidated financial statements were derived from our Consolidated Affiliated Entities. For the year ended June 30, 2013, the first fiscal year after the acquisition of AHFL together with its Taiwan Subsidiaries, 92.66% and 7.34% of our revenues in our consolidated financial statements were derived from our Taiwan Subsidiaries and Consolidated Affiliated Entities, respectively. During the six months ended December 31, 2013, 93.72% and 6.28% of our revenues in our consolidated financial statements were derived from our Taiwan Subsidiaries and Consolidated Affiliated Entities, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2014, 93.55% and 6.45% of our revenues in our consolidated financial statements were derived from our Taiwan Subsidiaries and Consolidated Affiliated Entities, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2015, 88.45% 10.71% and 0.84% of our revenues in our consolidated financial statements were derived from our Taiwan Subsidiaries, Consolidated Affiliated Entities and Prime Financial Asia Ltd., respectively.

&#160;

On January 17, 2011, CU WFOE, Anhou and Anhou Original Shareholders entered into a series of agreements known as variable interest agreements (the &#8220;Old VIE Agreements&#8221;) pursuant to which CU WFOE has executed effective control over Anhou through these contractual arrangements. As a result of the capital increase and the share transfer described above, on October 24, 2013, CU WFOE, Anhou and Anhou Existing Shareholders entered into a series of variable interest agreements (the &#8220;VIE Agreements&#8221;), including Power of Attorneys, Exclusive Option Agreements, Share Pledge Agreements, in the same form as the previous Old VIE Agreements, other than the change of shareholder names and their respective shareholdings. The Old VIE Agreements were terminated by and among CU WFOE, Anhou and Anhou Original Shareholders on the same date. The Exclusive Business Cooperation Agreement executed by and between CU WFOE and Anhou on January 17, 2011 remains in full effect. The VIE Agreements now in effect included:

&#160;

(1) An Exclusive Business Cooperation Agreement through which CU WFOE is appointed the exclusive services provider to provide Anhou with complete technical support, business support and related consulting services (as described in the agreement) in exchange for 90% of the net profits (as defined in the agreement) of Anhou. The agreement does not provide that CU WFOE is responsible for the debts of the Consolidated Affiliated Entities. The term of the Exclusive Business Cooperation Agreement began on January 17, 2011 and lasts ten years, unless earlier terminated as provide in the agreement. The term of the agreement may be extended at CU WFOE&#8217;s discretion prior to the expiration thereof. CU WFOE may terminate the agreement at any time with 30 days&#8217; written notice but Anhou may only terminate the agreement if CU WFOE commits gross negligence or a fraudulent act against Anhou; &#160;

(2) a Power of Attorney under which the shareholders of Anhou have vested their collective voting control over Anhou to CU WFOE; &#160;

(3) an Option Agreement under which the shareholders of Anhou granted to CU WFOE the irrevocable right and option to acquire all of their equity interests in Anhou, subject to applicable PRC laws and regulations. The Option Agreement began on October 24, 2013 and lasts ten years, but may be renewed at CU WFOE&#8217;s election; and &#160;

5&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

(4) a Share Pledge Agreement under which the shareholders of Anhou have pledged all of their equity interests in Anhou to CU WFOE to guarantee Anhou&#8217;s performance of its obligations under the Exclusive Business Cooperation Agreement. &#160;

As a holding company with no business other than holding equity interest of our operating subsidiary, CU WFOE in China and Law Broker in Taiwan, we rely principally on dividends to be paid by CU WFOE in China and Law Broker in Taiwan. CU WFOE, being the exclusive service provider to Anhou, relies on the service fees to which it is entitled from Anhou. Pursuant to the Exclusive Cooperation Agreement between CU WFOE and Anhou, CU WFOE has the right to collect 90% of the net profits of Anhou. As Anhou is still operating at a loss, Anhou has not paid any service fees to CU WFOE yet and CU WFOE has not paid any dividend to us to date. We expect Anhou to make a profit beginning in the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016, when it should start to pay service fees to CU WFOE, although there can be no assurance that Anhou will become profitable by that time or ever. Our capability to receive dividends from CU WFOE, convert them into USD and make the repatriation out of China is subject to the applicable PRC restrictions on the payment of dividends by PRC companies, laws and regulations on foreign exchange and restrictions on foreign investment. Law Broker, being the only operating entity for our Taiwan business, is primarily focused on life and property insurance brokerage and agency business. Through years of operation, Law Broker has become one of the leading insurance brokerage firms in Taiwan and has expanded its business across Taiwan, with 26 sales and service outlets (including the headquarters) and 2,329 employees and insurance sales professionals as of December 31, 2015.

&#160;

On February 26, 2014, Anhou completed the registration of the change of its registered address to Room 1906-1910, No. 215 Jiangdong Middle Road, Jianye District, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province with the local AIC of Jiangsu Province. The new business license was issued to Anhou on February 26, 2014. Anhou obtained the Professional Insurance Agency License issued by Jiangsu Bureau of CIRC on April 21, 2014. Anhou has completed the registration of the share pledge with local AIC. Anhou&#8217;s previous headquarters located at Building 4K, Hesheng Plaza, No. 26 Yousheng South Road, Jinshui District, Zhengzhou, Henan province, has been registered as the Henan branch office of Anhou and it obtained the Professional Insurance Agency License issued by Henan Bureau of CIRC on January 3, 2014 and the business license issued by local AIC on January 9, 2014.

&#160;

Anhou owns 100% equity interest in both Sichuan Kangzhuang and Jiangsu Law. The shareholders of Anhou are Changrong Hu, Yanyan Wang, Zhaohui Chen, Jing Yue, Weizhe Hou, Yong Zhang and Li Chen. All of these shareholders are PRC citizens and do not hold any shares in the Company. Pursuant to the VIE Agreements, CU WFOE becomes the primary beneficiary of Anhou and only leaves Anhou shareholders nominal value therein.

All of the 1,000,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock are reclassified from the 1,000,000 common stock held by Mr. Mao and no additional consideration has been paid by Mr. Mao in connection with the Reclassification. Each holder of common stock shall be entitled to one vote for each share of common stock held of record by such holder as of the applicable record date on any matter that is submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Company; while each holder of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to ten votes for each share of Series A Preferred Stock held of record by such holder as of the applicable record date on any matter that is submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Company. On August 8, 2014, Mr. Chung Mei Lo (&#8220;Mr. Lo&#8221;), who had been serving as the Company&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer, resigned from his position with the Company. Following the resignation of Mr. Lo, the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors appointed Mr. Mao as the Company&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer. 

&#160;

On August 24, 2012, the Company, pursuant to an Acquisition Agreement (the &#8220;AHFL Acquisition Agreement&#8221;), acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of AHFL, a limited liability company (&#8220;LLC&#8221;) incorporated under the laws of British Virgin Islands on April 30, 2012, together with its subsidiaries in Taiwan. Subsequent to the acquisition, AHFL becomes a 100% subsidiary of the Company. On July 30, 2013, AHFL, Taiwan Branch (&#8220;AHFLTW&#8221;) was established with registered capital of NT$100,000.

&#160;

&#160;

Law Enterprise acts as a holding company of its operating subsidiaries in Taiwan. Law Broker primarily engages in insurance brokerage and insurance agency service business across Taiwan, while Law Management and Law Agent are not in active operation. We operate our Taiwan business primarily through Law Broker.

&#160;

In the fourth quarter of 2014, the shareholders of the Law Management and Law Agent made the resolution to dissolve Law Management and Law Agent, respectively, because those companies have not been in operation. The dissolution of Law Management and Law Agent was approved by the Taiwan Government on November 26, 2014 and on January 13, 2015, respectively. In accordance with the law in Taiwan, the liquidator was appointed by the shareholders of the Law Management and Law Agent and the liquidator shall complete the liquidation process no later than six months from the appointment date. Both Law Management and Law Agent are under the process of liquidation.

&#160;

7&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Pursuant to the provisions of the AHFL Acquisition Agreement, the Company was to pay NT$15 million (US$468,926) on or prior to March 31, 2013 and NT$7.5 million (approximately US$234,463) subsequent to March 31, 2013 in cash in two installments, subject to certain terms and conditions. In addition the Company agreed to (i) issue 8,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company to the shareholders of AHFL; (ii) issue 2,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company to certain employees of Law Insurance Broker Co., Ltd. (&#8220;Law Broker&#8221;), a subsidiary of AHFL; and (iii) create an employee stock option pool, consisting of available options, exercisable for up to 2,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company.

&#160;

On March 14, 2013, the Company and the selling shareholders of AHFL entered into an Amendment to the AHFL Acquisition Agreement (the &#8220;First Amendment&#8221;), pursuant to which, (i) the cash payment deadline as set forth in the AHFL Acquisition Agreement was extended from March 31, 2013 to March 31, 2015 or at any other time or in any other manner otherwise agreed upon by and among the Company and the selling shareholders of AHFL; and (ii) in lieu of the 2,000,000 employee stock option pool described in the Acquisition Agreement, the Company agreed to use its best efforts, as soon as practically possible, to create an employee stock pool consisting of up to 4,000,000 shares of CUIS common stock, among which 2,000,000 shares shall be solely granted to employees of Law Broker, and the remaining 2,000,000 shares to be granted to employees of affiliated entities of the Company (including Law Broker employees).

&#160;

On March 13, 2015, the Company and the selling shareholders of AHFL entered into a second Amendment to the AHFL Acquisition Agreement (the &#8220;Second Amendment&#8221;), pursuant to which the cash payment deadline as set forth in the Acquisition Agreement was extended from March 31, 2015 to March 31, 2016 or at any other time or in any other manner otherwise agreed upon by and among the Company and the selling shareholders of AHFL.

&#160;

On February 17, 2016, the Company and the selling shareholders of AHFL entered into a third Amendment to the AHFL Acquisition Agreement (the &#8220;Third Amendment&#8221;), pursuant to which, on or prior to June 30, 2016, (i) the Company is committed to complete the listing of the Company&#8217;s shares in a major capital market, where the net proceeds raised through such public offering financing shall be at least US$10,000,000; (ii) the Company is committed to distribute the cash payment in the amount of NT$22.5 million (US$685,059), on a pro rata basis, to the selling shareholders of AHFL and issue 5 million common shares to its selected employees pursuant to its employee stock/option plan, or any alternative plan mutually accepted by the Company and such selling shareholders; and (iii) failure to timely complete either of the above-mentioned criteria shall be deemed as a material breach of the Company under Article 8 of the Acquisition Agreement, whereby the non-breaching party shall be entitled to terminate the Acquisition Agreement and unwind the Acquisition of AHFL by CUIS and restore the status quo of the Company and the Selling Shareholders as if the said acquisition had never happened. If the Company fails to meet either of these criteria and the shareholders of AHFL exercise their right to unwind the Acquisition of AHFL by CUIS, the business and financial prospects of the Company may be severely negatively affected. The Company is doing its best to achieve the targeted milestones as set forth in the third Amendment to the Acquisition Agreement. However, given the tight schedule and harsh general environment, despite every efforts of the Company, it might be really difficult for the Company to do so within the stipulated deadline. Therefore, the Company is actually negotiating with the Selling Shareholders of AHFL to convince them to give up such termination rights in case of failure to comply with the first and second requirements under Third Amendment within the stipulated deadline while continuously using its best efforts to fulfill such obligations.

&#160;

On January 17, 2014, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a change in our fiscal year end from June 30 to December 31.

The premium amount (after deduction of certain charges) is invested into different funds. The performance of the fund will depend on the market.

Every investment-oriented insurance policy has market risk exposure depending on the fund invested and such investment risk is solely borne by the policyholder. Depending on the death benefit, Investment-oriented insurance policies are categorized into two broad categories: (1) The death benefit is equal to the higher of insured amount or fund value.

The life insurance products Law Broker distributed in the fiscal year ending December 31, 2015 were primarily underwritten by Farglory Life Insurance Co., Ltd., CTBC Life Insurance Co., Ltd., Fubon Life Insurance Co., Ltd., Shin Kong Life Insurance Co., Ltd. and AIA International Limited, Taiwan Branch.

&#160;

The life insurance products Anhou distributes can be broadly classified into the categories set forth below.

&#160;

Total net revenues from life insurance products distributed by Anhou accounted for approximately 10.2% of CUIS&#8217; total net revenues of life insurance products in the fiscal year ending December 31, 2015.

&#160;

&#160; &#183; Individual Whole Life Insurance. The individual whole life insurance products Anhou distributes provide insurance for the insured person&#8217;s entire life in exchange for the periodic payment of fixed premiums over a pre-determined period, generally ranging from five to 20 years, or until the insured reaches a certain age. The face amount of the policy or, for some policies, the face amount plus accumulated interest is paid upon the death of the insured. &#160;

&#160; &#183; Individual Term Life Insurance. The individual term life insurance products Anhou distributes provide insurance for the insured for a specified time period or until the attainment of a certain age, in return for the periodic payment of fixed premiums over a pre-determined period, generally ranging from five to 20 years. Term life insurance policies generally expire without value if the insured survives the coverage period. &#160;

&#160; &#183; Individual Endowment Life Insurance. The individual endowment products Anhou distributes generally provide maturity benefits if the insured reaches a specified age, and provide to a beneficiary designated by the insured guaranteed benefits upon the death of the insured within the coverage period. In return, the insured makes periodic payment of premiums over a pre-determined period, generally ranging from five to 25 years. &#160;

&#160; &#183; Individual Education Annuity. The individual annuity products Anhou distributes are primarily education related products. They provide annual benefit payments after the insured attains a certain age, e.g., 18, for a fixed time period, or e.g., four years, and a lump payment at the end of the coverage period. In addition, the beneficiary designated in the annuity contract will receive guaranteed benefits upon the death of the insured during the coverage period. In return, the purchaser of the annuity products makes periodic payment of premiums during a pre-determined accumulation period. &#160;

14&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#183; Individual Health Insurance. The individual health insurance products Anhou distributes primarily consist of dreaded disease insurance products, which provide guaranteed benefits for specified dreaded diseases during the coverage period.

The life insurance products Anhou distributed in the fiscal year ending December 31, 2015 were primarily underwritten by Taikang Life Insurance Company, Huaxia Insurance Co., Ltd., Funde Sino Life Insurance Co., Ltd., AVIVA Life Insurance Co., Ltd. and Aegon THTF Life Insurance Co., Ltd.

&#160;

In addition to the periodic premium payment schedules described above, most of the individual life insurance products we distribute also allow the insured to choose to make a single, lump-sum premium payment at the beginning of the policy term. If a periodic payment schedule is adopted by the insured, a life insurance policy can generate periodic payment of fixed premiums to the insurance company for a specified period of time. This means that once Anhou or Law Broker sells a life insurance policy with a periodic premium payment schedule, they will be able to derive commission and fee income from that policy for an extended period of time, sometimes up to 25 years. Because of this feature and the expected sustained growth of life insurance sales in China and Taiwan, we have focused significant resources ever since the incorporation of Anhou and Law Broker on developing our capability to distribute individual life insurance products with periodic payment schedules. We expect that sales of life insurance products will continuously be our primary source of revenue in the next several years.

Unified Operating Platform 

&#160;

Law Broker has its own self-developed Unified Operating Platform. Since Law Broker&#8217;s establishment in 1992, it has successfully implemented the following components of its operating platform across its branch offices in Taiwan through a hub center located in Taipei:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; A centralized clients and insurance policy management and analysis system, which encompasses our life insurance unit and property and casualty insurance unit, that will better support business operations and facilitate risk control; &#160;

&#160; &#183; An integrated administrative and information system, that increases the management efficiency among the subsidiaries, branches and sales departments; &#160;

&#160; &#183; A centralized and computerized accounting and financial management system, that increases the commission distribution and enforcement; &#160;

&#160; &#183; A human resources management and analysis system; and &#160;

&#160; &#183; An e-learning system to provide online training to sales professionals. &#160;

Through years of operation, the Unified Operating Platform has proved to be an efficient and streamlined operating system which contributes to the successful expansion and growth of Law Broker into one of the leading companies in Taiwan, with 26 sales and service outlets (including the headquarter) across Taiwan and 2,329 employees and insurance sales professionals as of December 31, 2015.

&#160;

In accordance with our growth strategy in China, Anhou has made significant effort to adapt the Unified Operating Platform utilized by Law Broker to better meet the operational need in China. Since September 2010, Anhou has successfully implemented the tailored operating platform across the PRC subsidiaries through a hub center located in Nantong, Jiangsu province. We expect that this tailored operating platform will make selling easier for sales agents in China, facilitate standardized business and financial management, enhance risk control and increase operational efficiency for the PRC subsidiaries.

&#160;

18&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Anhou has tailored and refined the platform on the basis of Law Broker&#8217;s well-developed operating platform in Taiwan and believes that it is difficult for our competitors in China, particularly new market entrants, to reproduce a similar platform without substantial financial resources, time and operating experience.

&#160;

Because the various systems, policies and procedures under both of operating platforms utilized by Law Broker and Anhou can be rolled out quickly as we enter new regions or make acquisitions, we believe we can expand our distribution network rapidly and efficiently while maintaining the quality of our services. 

&#160;

Distribution and Service Network and Marketing 

&#160;

Since Law Broker&#8217;s establishment in 1991, it has devoted substantial resources in building up its distribution and service network. Law Broker currently has 26 sales and service outlets spread across Taiwan (including the headquarters), among which, 6 are located in the northern region, 14 are located in the central region, 3 are located in the southern region and 2 are located in the eastern region.

&#160;

Since Anhou&#8217;s establishment in 2003, it has devoted substantial resources in building up its distribution and service network. Anhou has targeted its distribution and service network in provinces with most population in China, such as Henan, Jiangsu and Sichuan . As of December 31, 2015, Anhou has two insurance agencies and one insurance brokerage firm, with 4,711 sales professionals and 140 administrative staff members operating across 36 cities within these three provinces.

Anhou markets and sells life insurance products, property and casualty insurance products directly to the targeted customers through the sales agents, who are not its employees.

&#160;

Customers 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, Law Broker had approximately 451,422 customers, among which approximately 83% purchased life insurance products and approximately 17% purchased property and casualty insurance products from Law Broker. 

&#160;

Due to its extensive line of insurance products underwritten by the insurance companies in Taiwan, Law Broker managed to offer a variety of insurance products to customers of different ages or professions. However, as an aging population in Taiwan has gradually become a more recognized social issue, despite relatively healthy government-sponsored retirement and medical programs, more and more Taiwanese, especially those with stable financial means and aiming for high-end retirement and medical treatment, have been focusing on endowment and medical type of commercial insurance products, while the investment type of insurance products have been playing a less significant role since the economic downturn.

&#160;

In addition, from time to time, Law Broker has been, either voluntarily or upon request of insurance companies, advising insurance companies or providing feedback on particular types of insurance products before they are put on the market. This interaction with insurance companies has not only enhanced the close cooperation between Law Broker and the insurance companies, but also gives it an edge in understanding the in-depth features of such insurance products for marketing and distribution purposes.

&#160;

Law Broker sells automobile insurance and casualty insurance primarily to individual customers. Law Broker sells liability insurance to institutional customers.

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, Anhou had 31,207 customers, among which 30,997 purchased life insurance products and 210 purchased property and casualty insurance products from Anhou.

&#160;

Anhou sells automobile insurance and individual accident insurance primarily to individual customers. Anhou sells commercial property insurance to institutional customers.

&#160;

Anhou targeted middle class individuals and family members under 50 years age to be its priority clients, which represents 86.3% of its client base. The revenues of Anhou are primarily generated from the sale of life insurance products and we expect the continuous growth in this regard, as more and more customers in China realized the insufficiency of the mandatory social insurance coverage and the necessity to supplement it with commercial insurance. With the implementation of the national one-child policy through the past decades in China, approximately 35% of the insurance policies distributed by Anhou have designated children under 14 years age as the beneficiary of such policies, Anhou expects the continuous growth of insurance market of these factors in the near future.

&#160;

20&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, no single customer accounted for more than 3% of the net revenues of CUIS, Law Broker or Anhou.

&#160;

Insurance Company Partners 

&#160;

We are selective in terms of choosing insurance companies as our partners. We take into consideration a variety of factors, such as the reputation and integrity of the insurance company, the quality and competitiveness of insurance products offered, the prudence and health of the financial standing of the insurance company as well as the complexity and efficiency of claim adjustment and settlement. During years of operation, both Law Broker and Anhou have formed strategic relationships with numerous insurance companies in Taiwan and China, respectively, as of December 31, 2015, Law Broker had established business relationships with 19 insurance companies in Taiwan and Anhou had established business relationships with 34insurance companies in China. 

&#160;

On June 10, 2013, AHFL entered into an Alliance Agreement with AIATW. The purpose of the Alliance Agreement is to promote life insurance products provided by AIATW within the territory of Taiwan by insurance agency companies or insurance brokerage companies affiliated with AHFL or CUIS. The term of the Alliance Agreement is from April 15, 2013 to August 31, 2018. Pursuant to the terms of the Alliance Agreement, AIATW shall pay AHFL an execution fee of $8,367,947(NT$ 250,000,000).

Pursuant to the Alliance Agreement, AHFL is entitled to the payment of the execution fee, subject to certain terms and conditions therein, including the satisfaction of the performance targets and the threshold 13-month persistency ratio. The execution fee may be required to be recalculated if certain performance targets are not met by AHFL.

&#160;

On September 30, 2014, AHFL entered into an Amendment to Strategic Alliance Agreement (the &#8220;Amendment&#8221;) with AIATW. Pursuant to the Amendment, the expiration date of the Strategic Alliance Agreement has been extended from May 31, 2018 to December 31, 2020. In addition, both AHFL and AIATW agree to adjust certain terms and conditions set forth in the Strategic Alliance Agreement, including the downward adjustment of the performance targets as well as the mechanism and formula calculating the execution fee to be refunded, if any.

&#160;

On January 6, 2016, AHFL entered into an Amendment 2 to Strategic Alliance Agreement (the &#8220;Amendment No. 2&#8221;) with AIATW to further revise certain provisions in the Strategic Alliance Agreement and the previous amendment entered into by and between AHFL and AIATW.

&#160;

21&#160;

On March 15, 2016, AHFL unilaterally issued a confirmation letter to AIATW, where it emphasized its commitment to achieve certain sales targets within a specific time frame and covenanted to refund a certain portion of Execution Fees calculated based on the formula therein upon failure to achieve such sales target, as applicable.

&#160;

In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, Law Broker&#8217;s top five insurance company partners, after aggregating the business conducted between Law Broker and the various local branches of the insurance companies were Farglory Life Insurance Co., Ltd., CTBC Life Insurance Co., Ltd., Fubon Life Insurance Co., Ltd., TransGlobal Life Insurance Co., Ltd. and AIA International Limited, Taiwan Branch. Among them, Farglory Life Insurance Co., Ltd. accounted for 81.79% of Law Broker&#8217;s total net revenues from commissions and fees in the fiscal year ending December 31, 2015.

&#160;

In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, Anhou&#8217;s top five insurance company partners, after aggregating the business conducted between Anhou and the various local branches of the insurance companies were Taikang Life Insurance Co., Ltd., Huaxia Insurance Co., Ltd., Funde Sino Life Insurance Co., Ltd., AVIVA Life Insurance Co., Ltd. and Aegon THTF Life Insurance Co., Ltd.. Among them, Taikang Life Insurance Co., Ltd. accounted for 13.91% of Anhou&#8217;s total net revenues from commissions and fees in the fiscal year ending December 31, 2015.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

A number of industry players are involved in the distribution of insurance products in Taiwan and PRC. We compete for customers on the basis of product offerings, customer services and reputation. Because we primarily distribute individual insurance products, our principal competitors include:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; Professional insurance intermediaries. Life insurance is our core business and has a strong regional feature. Through years of business development, we believe that we can compete effectively with other insurance intermediary companies as we have a longer operational history and over the years have assembled a strong and stable team of managers and sales professionals. With the implementation of our unified operating platform, we believe that we could strengthen our lead in our developed local regions and expand our operation to our newly selected areas. However, with increasing consolidation expected in the insurance intermediary sector in the coming years, we expect competition within this sector to intensify. &#160;

&#160; &#183; Insurance companies. The distribution of individual life insurance products in Taiwan and China historically has been dominated by insurance companies, which usually use both in-house sales force and exclusive sales agents to distribute their own products. We believe that we can compete effectively with insurance companies because we focus only on distribution and offer our customers a broad range of insurance products underwritten by multiple insurance companies. &#160;

22&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#183; Other business entities. In recent years, business entities that distribute insurance products as an ancillary business, primarily commercial banks and postal offices have been playing an increasingly important role in the distribution of insurance products, especially life insurance products. However, the insurance products distributed by these entities are usually confined to those related to their main lines of business, such as investment-related life insurance products. We believe that we can compete effectively with these business entities because we offer our customers a broader variety of products. &#160;

Law Broker is one of the leading insurance brokerage firms in Taiwan. During the past two decades, Law Broker has expanded its business across Taiwan, with 26 sales and service outlets (including the headquarters) and 2,169 sales professionals and 160 administrative staff members spread over the four regions of Taiwan as of December 31, 2015. Other than insurance companies and commercial banks, Law Broker&#8217;s primary competitors are Taiwan insurance brokerage companies of relatively large size, such as Everpro Insurance Brokers Co., Ltd. Through years of operation, Law Broker has won numerous awards from various Taiwan government authorities for its excellence in the insurance brokerage industry. Among which, from year 2005 to year 2008, Law Broker has won the &#8220;Taiwan Insurance Excellence Award - Talent Training&#8221; for four consecutive years, the &#8220;Taiwan Insurance Excellence Award - E-commerce&#8221; in 2009, the &#34;Taiwan Insurance Excellence Award - Customer Service and Personal Training&#8221; in 2011, the &#8220;Taiwan Insurance Excellence Award - Golden Medal for Information Application, Silver Medal for Personnel Training and Silver Medal for Customer Service&#8221; in 2013, the &#8220;Insurance Dragon and Phoenix Award&#8221; in 2012 and 2013 as well as the Most Desirable Insurance Brokerage Company of Finance Insurance Graduates in 2013. In 2015, Law Broker won the &#8220;Insurance Dragon and Phoenix Award&#8221; and the &#8220;Taiwan Insurance Excellence Award - Silver Medal for Personnel Training and Silver Medal for Customer Service&#8221;. The &#8220;Taiwan Insurance Excellence Award&#34; is one of most prestigious as well as well-participated insurance events in Taiwan, co-sponsored by the Taiwan Insurance Institute, Taiwan Financial Supervisory Committee and Taiwan Consumer Protection Committee, to encourage the insurance industry participants to actively enhance insurance service quality as well as to improve customer services.

&#160;

During the past 12 years, Anhou has expanded its business across 36 cities within Henan, Sichuan and Jiangsu provinces with 4,711 sales professionals and 140 administrative staff members. Based on the insurance products Anhou is offering and the geographic areas of its branch offices, Anhou&#8217;s primary competitors are small-sized and middle-sized insurance agency companies. Anhou is relatively larger in terms of the number of salesmen as well as the sales revenue comparing to those competing insurance agency companies. On April 20, 2012, Anhou obtained the nationwide license from CIRC, pursuant to which Anhou may set up its branch office across the PRC, to carry out the insurance agency business, with no further approval requirement from CIRC other than filing with the local CIRC at the provincial level.

&#160;

23&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

On March 26, 2012, CIRC issued the Notice on Suspension of Market Entry Approval of Regional Insurance Agencies and Certain Part-time Insurance Agencies (&#8220;2012 Notice&#8221;). Pursuant to the 2012 Notice, CIRC and its local counterparts will suspend granting any new license to full-time insurance agencies operating on a regional basis (&#8220;Regional Insurance Agencies&#8221;) as well as to branch offices of existing Regional Insurance Agencies. In addition, no new license for part-time insurance agency businesses will be granted unless such applicant is a financial institution or a China Post office. However, CIRC emphasized in the 2012 Notice that its local counterparts shall continue to support the establishment of insurance intermediary groups and full-time insurance agencies operating on a nationwide basis, as well as continue to support their respective branch offices.

&#160;

As indicated in the 2012 Notice, it appears that CIRC is aiming to increase the entry thresholds of Regional Insurance Agencies and part-time insurance agencies with a view to reducing the number, as well as, enhancing the quality of insurance agencies in the market. CIRC has also indicated in the 2012 Notice that it intends to further amend related rules and regulations to improve the market entry and exit mechanism for insurance agencies, and promote the professionalism as well as enhance the quality of insurance agencies in the market. 

&#160;

On April 27, 2013, CIRC issued the Decision on Revising the Provisions of the Supervision and Administration of Specialized Insurance Agencies (the &#8220;Decision on Revising the Agency Provisions&#8221;), pursuant to which, CIRC has mandated any insurance agency established subsequent to the Decision on Revising the Agency Provisions to meet a minimum registered capital requirement of RMB50 million ($8.1 million).

&#160;

On May 16, 2013, CIRC issued Notice for Further Clarification on Related Issues of Access to Professional Insurance Intermediary Market (the &#8220;2013 Notice&#8221;), pursuant to which, professional insurance agencies established prior to the issuance of the Decision on Revising the Agency Provisions, with registered capital less than RMB50 million ($8.1 million), can continuously operate their existing business within the provinces where they have the registered office or branch office, but shall not set up any new branches in any province where they do not have the registered office or any branch office.

&#160;

With the promulgation and implementation of the above-mentioned regulations, we expect a better regulated insurance agency market in China with orderly competition and pursuit for professional excellence, which will accentuate our competitive advantage due to our continuous commitment to quality service. On October 24, 2013, Anhou has increased its registered capital to RMB50 million ($8,165,890). As of the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Anhou is one of the approximately 100 insurance agencies with a PRC nationwide license. We believe that we will be in a better position to obtain the full support expressly provided in the 2012 Notice from the local CIRC on our expansion strategy nationwide.

To protect our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of trademark, copyright and trade secret laws as well as confidentiality agreements with our employees, sales agents, contractors and others.

The Insurance Law distinguishes insurance between fire disaster, marine, land and air, liability, surety, and other casualty and property insurance businesses on the one hand, and life insurance, health insurance, casualty insurance and annuity businesses on the other. Unless permitted by the FSC, insurance companies are not allowed to engage in both types of insurance businesses.

PRC Regulations of the Insurance Industry 

&#160;

The insurance industry in the PRC is highly regulated. CIRC is the regulatory authority responsible for the supervision of the Chinese insurance industry. Insurance activities undertaken within the PRC are primarily governed by the Insurance Law and the related rules and regulations.

&#160;

Initial Development of Regulatory Framework 

&#160;

The Chinese Insurance Law was enacted in 1995. This original insurance law, which we refer to as the 1995 Insurance Law, provided the initial framework for regulating the domestic insurance industry. Among the steps taken under the 1995 Insurance Law were the following:

&#160;

(a) Licensing of insurance companies and insurance intermediaries, such as agencies and brokerages. The 1995 Insurance Law established requirements for minimum registered capital levels, form of organization, qualification of senior management and adequacy of the information systems for insurance companies, insurance agencies and brokerages. &#160;

37&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; (b) Separation of property and casualty insurance and life insurance businesses. The 1995 Insurance Law distinguished insurance between property, casualty, liability and credit insurance businesses, on the one hand, and life, accident and health insurance businesses on the other, and prohibited insurance companies from engaging in both types of businesses. &#160; (c) Regulation of market conduct by participants. The 1995 Insurance Law prohibited fraudulent and other unlawful conduct by insurance companies, agencies and brokerages. &#160; (d) Substantive regulation of insurance products. The 1995 Insurance Law gave insurance regulators the authority to approve the policy terms and premium rates for certain insurance products. &#160; (e) Financial condition and performance of insurance companies. The 1995 Insurance Law established reserve and solvency standards for insurance companies, imposed restrictions on investment powers and established mandatory reinsurance requirements, and put in place a reporting regime to facilitate monitoring by insurance regulators. &#160; (f) Supervisory and enforcement powers of the principal regulatory authority. The principal regulatory authority, then the People&#8217;s Bank of China, was given broad powers under the 1995 Insurance Law to regulate the insurance industry. &#160;

Establishment of the CIRC and 2002 Amendments to the Insurance Law 

&#160;

China&#8217;s insurance regulatory regime was further strengthened with the establishment of the CIRC in 1998. The CIRC was given the mandate to implement reform in the insurance industry, minimize insolvency risk for Chinese insurers and promote the development of the insurance market.

&#160;

The 1995 Insurance Law was amended in 2002 and the amended insurance law, which we refer to as the 2002 Insurance Law, became effective on January 1, 2003. The major amendments to the 1995 Insurance Law include:

&#160;

&#160; (a) Authorizing the CIRC to be the insurance supervisory and regulatory body nationwide. The 2002 Insurance Law expressly grants the CIRC the authority to supervise and administer the insurance industry nationwide. &#160; (b) Expanding the permitted scope of business of property and casualty insurers. Under the 2002 Insurance Law, property and casualty insurance companies may engage in the short-term health insurance and accident insurance businesses upon the CIRC&#8217;s approval. &#160; (c) Providing additional guidelines for the relationship between insurance companies and insurance agents. The 2002 Insurance Law requires an insurance company to enter into an agent agreement with each insurance agent that will act as an agent for such insurance company. The agent agreement sets forth the rights and obligations of the parties to the agreement as well as other matters pursuant to law. An insurance company is responsible for the acts of its agents when the acts are within the scope authorized by the insurance company. 

&#160; (d) Relaxing restrictions on the use of funds by insurance companies. Under the 2002 Insurance Law, an insurance company may use its funds to make equity investments in insurance-related enterprises, such as asset management companies. &#160; (e) Allowing greater freedom for insurance companies to develop insurance products. The 2002 Insurance Law allowed insurance companies to set their own policy terms and premium rates, subject to the approval of, or a filing with, the CIRC. &#160;

38&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

2009 Amendments to the Insurance Law 

&#160;

The 2002 Insurance Law was amended again in 2009 and the amended insurance law, which we refer to as the 2009 Insurance Law, became effective on October 1, 2009. The major amendments to the 2002Insurance Law include:

&#160;

(b) Strengthening supervision on the qualification of the shareholders of the insurance companies and setting forth specific qualification requirements for the major shareholders, directors, supervisors and senior managers of insurance companies. (c) Expanding the business scope of insurers and further relaxing restriction on the use of fund by insurers. (d) Strengthening supervision on solvency of insurers with stricter measures.

The registered capital or the capital contribution of insurance agencies or insurance brokerages must be paid-up capital in cash. The 2009 Insurance Law also sets forth some specific qualification requirements for insurance agency and brokerage practitioners. The senior managers of insurance agencies or insurance brokerages must meet specific qualification requirements, and their appointments are subject to approval of the CIRC. Personnel of an insurance agency or insurance brokerage engaging in the sales of insurance products must meet the qualification requirements set by the CIRC and obtain a qualification certificate issued by the CIRC. Under the 2009 Insurance Law, the parties to an insurance transaction may engage insurance adjusting firms or other independent appraisal firms that are established in accordance with applicable laws, or persons who possess the requisite professional expertise, to conduct assessment and adjustment of the insured subject matters. Additionally, the 2009 Insurance Law specifies additional legal obligations for insurance agencies and brokerages.

Under the Exchange Rules, the RMB is convertible for current account items, including the distribution of dividends, interest payments, trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions. Conversion of RMB for capital account items, such as direct investment, loan, security investment and repatriation of investment, however, is still subject to the approval of the SAFE or relevant authorities.

&#160;

Under the Administration Rules, foreign-invested enterprises may only buy, sell or remit foreign currencies at those banks authorized to conduct foreign exchange business after providing valid commercial documents and, in the case of capital account item transactions, obtaining approval from the SAFE. Capital investments by foreign-invested enterprises outside of China are also subject to limitations, which include approvals by the Ministry of Commerce, the SAFE and the State Development and Reform Commission.

PRC Regulations on Dividend Distribution 

&#160;

The principal regulations governing dividend distributions of wholly foreign-owned companies include:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprise Law (1986), as amended or revised; and &#160;

&#160; &#183; Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprise Law Implementing Rules (2001 Revision), as amended or revised. &#160;

45&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Under these regulations, wholly foreign-owned companies in the PRC may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards. In addition, these wholly foreign-owned companies are required to set aside at least 10% of their respective accumulated profits each year, if any, to fund certain reserve funds, until the accumulative amount of such fund reaches 50% of its registered capital. These reserve funds are not distributable as cash dividends. On January 19, 2015, the Ministry of Commerce of China (&#8220;MOFCOM&#8221;) published a draft version of a proposed Foreign Investment Law (the &#8220;Draft Foreign Investment Law&#8221;) with an explanatory note. MOFCOM has requested comments from the public on the Draft Foreign Investment Law by February 17, 2015, which, once promulgated, will replace and integrate the three existing laws over foreign investment, including the Foreign-Invested Enterprise Law.

PRC Regulations on Tax 

&#160;

PRC Enterprise Income Tax 

&#160;

The PRC EIT is calculated based on the taxable income determined under the PRC accounting standards and regulations, as well as the EIT law. On March 16, 2007, the National People&#8217;s Congress of China enacted the EIT Law, a new EIT law which became effective on January 1, 2008. On December 6, 2007, the State Council promulgated the Implementation Rules which also became effective on January 1, 2008. On December 26, 2007, the State Council issued the Notice on Implementation of Enterprise Income Tax Transition Preferential Policy under the EIT Law, or the Transition Preferential Policy Circular, which became effective simultaneously with the EIT Law. The EIT Law imposes a uniform EIT rate of 25% on all domestic enterprises and foreign-invested enterprises unless they qualify under certain exceptions. Under the EIT Law, as further clarified by the Implementation Rules, the Transition Preferential Policy Circular and other related regulations, enterprises that were established and already enjoyed preferential tax treatments before March 16, 2007 will continue to enjoy them in the following manners: (i) in the case of preferential tax rates, for a five-year period starting from January 1, 2008, during which the tax rate will gradually increase to 25%; or (ii) in the case of preferential tax exemption or reduction for a specified term, until the expiration of such term. However, if such an enterprise has not enjoyed the preferential treatments yet because of its failure to make a profit, its term for preferential treatment will be deemed to start from 2008.

&#160;

PRC Business Tax 

&#160;

Taxpayers providing taxable services in China are required to pay a business tax at a normal tax rate of 5% of their revenues, unless otherwise provided. According to the Announcement on the VAT Reform Pilot Program of the Transportation and Selected Modern Service Sectors issued by the State Tax Bureau in July 2012, the transportation and some selected modern service sectors, including research and development and technical services, information technology services, cultural creative services, logistics support services, tangible personal property leasing services, and assurance and consulting service sectors, should pay value-added tax instead of business tax based on a predetermined timetable (hereinafter referred to as the &#8220;VAT Reform&#8221;), effective September 1, 2012 for entities in Beijing and October 1, 2012 for entities in Jiangsu. As of December 31, 2015, none of our Consolidated Affiliated Entities has been requested to convert into the VAT system.

&#160;

Dividend Withholding Tax

&#160;

Under the PRC tax laws effective prior to January 1, 2008, dividends paid to foreign investors by foreign-invested enterprises are exempt from PRC withholding tax. Pursuant to the EIT Law and the Implementation Rules, dividends generated after January 1, 2008 and distributed to us by our PRC subsidiaries are under a 5% withholding tax subject to PRC laws and regulations, provided that we are determined by the relevant PRC tax authorities to be a &#8220;non-resident enterprise&#8221; under the EIT Law.

&#160;

PRC regulations relating to the establishment of offshore SPVs by PRC residents 

&#160;

SAFE has promulgated several regulations, including the Notice on Issues Relating to the Administration of Foreign Exchange in Fund-Raising and Round-trip Investment Activities of Domestic Residents Conducted via Offshore Special Purpose Companies, or SAFE Circular No. 75, effective on November 1, 2005. On July 4, 2014, SAFE promulgated the Notice on Issues Relating to Administration of Foreign Exchange in Offshore Investment &#38; Fund-Raising and Round-trip Investment by Domestic Residents Utilizing Special Purpose Vehicles, or SAFE Circular No. 37, effective on July 14, 2014, which replaced Circular 75. On February 13, 2015, SAFE promulgated the Notice on Further Simplifying and Improving Management Policies of Foreign Exchange in Direct Investment, or SAFE Circular No. 13, which will be effective on June 1, 2015. According to SAFE Circular No. 13, foreign exchange registrations for both domestic and foreign direct investment shall be undertaken by banks, while SAFE and its branches execute indirect supervision on foreign exchange registration of direct investment via banks. The regulation requires PRC residents and PRC corporate entities to register with local banks or local branches (for the supplementary registration) of SAFE in connection with their direct or indirect offshore investment activities. These regulations apply to our shareholders who are PRC residents and may apply to any offshore acquisitions that we make in the future. 

&#160;

Under these foreign exchange regulations, PRC residents who will make investments in Special Purpose Vehicles or SPVs are required to register those investments with the bank where the domestic company incorporated, and the PRC residents who have previously made, prior to the implementation of the SAFE Circular No. 37, direct or indirect investments in SPVs are required to register those investments with local SAFE for the supplementary registration. In addition, any PRC resident who is a direct or indirect shareholder of a SPV, is required to update the previously filed registration with the local banks, with respect to that SPV, to reflect any material change. If any PRC shareholder fails to make the required registration or update the previously filed registration, the PRC subsidiaries of that SPV may be prohibited from distributing their profits and the proceeds from any reduction in capital, share transfer or liquidation to their SPV parent, and the SPV may also be prohibited from injecting additional capital into its PRC subsidiaries. Moreover, failure to comply with the various foreign exchange registration requirements described above could result in liabilities for such PRC subsidiaries under PRC laws for evasion of applicable foreign exchange restrictions. Furthermore, the persons-in-charge and other persons at such PRC subsidiaries who are held directly liable for the violations may be subject to administrative sanctions.

&#160;

These foreign exchange regulations provide that PRC residents include both PRC citizens, meaning any individual who holds a PRC passport or resident identification card, and individuals who are non-PRC citizens but primarily reside in the PRC due to their economic ties to China.
