 Item 1. Business. 

We are a specialty finance company that provides funding to nonprofit community associations primarily located in the state of Florida and, to a lesser extent, nonprofit community associations in the states of Washington and Colorado. As of February 2016, we also began operations in Illinois, which is the fourth-largest assessment market in the United States for community associations. We offer incorporated nonprofit community associations, which we refer to as &#8220;Associations,&#8221; a variety of financial products customized to each Association&#8217;s financial needs. Our original product offering consists of providing funding to Associations by purchasing their rights under delinquent accounts that are selected by the Associations arising from unpaid Association assessments. Historically, we provided funding against such delinquent accounts, which we refer to as &#8220;Accounts,&#8221; in exchange for a portion of the proceeds collected by the Associations from the account debtors on the Accounts. More recently, we have started purchasing Accounts on varying terms tailored to suit each Association&#8217;s financial needs, including under our New Neighbor Guaranty&#8482; program. We believe that revenues from the New Neighbor Guaranty program, as well as other similar products we may develop in the future, will comprise an increasingly larger piece of our business during the next few years, and we intend to seek to leverage these products to expand our business activities and growth in the states in which we operate.

Under our original business, we purchase Associations&#8217; right to receive a portion of the Association&#8217;s collected proceeds from owners that are not paying their assessments. After taking assignment of an Association&#8217;s right to receive a portion of the Association&#8217;s proceeds from the collection of delinquent assessments, we engage law firms to perform collection work on a deferred billing basis wherein the law firms receive payment upon collection from the account debtors or a predetermined contracted amount if payment from account debtors is less than legal fees and costs owed. Under this business model, we typically fund an amount equal to or less than the statutory minimum an Association could recover on a delinquent account for each Account, which we refer to as the &#8220;Super Lien Amount&#8221;. Upon collection of an Account, the law firm working on the Account, on behalf of the Association, generally distributes to us the funded amount, interest, and administrative late fees, with the law firm retaining legal fees and costs collected, and the Association retaining the balance of the collection. In connection with this business, we have developed proprietary software for servicing Accounts, which we believe enables law firms to service Accounts efficiently and profitably.

Under the New Neighbor Guaranty program, an Association will generally assign substantially all of its outstanding indebtedness and accruals on its delinquent units to us in exchange for payment by us of monthly dues on each delinquent unit. This simultaneously eliminates a substantial portion of the Association&#8217;s balance sheet bad debts and assists the Association to meet its budget by receiving guaranteed monthly payments on its delinquent units and relieving the Association from paying legal fees and costs to collect its bad debts. We believe that the combined features of the program enhance the value of the underlying real estate in an Association and the value of an Association&#8217;s delinquent receivables. We intend to leverage our proprietary software platform, as well as our industry experience and knowledge gained from our original business, to expand the New Neighbor Guaranty program and to potentially develop other new products in the future.

Because we acquire and collect on the delinquent receivables of Associations, the Account debtors are third parties that we have little or no information about. Therefore, we cannot predict when any given Account will be paid off or how much it will yield. In assessing the risk of purchasing Accounts, we review the property values of the underlying units, the governing documents of the relevant Association, and the total number of delinquent receivables held by the Association.

As of December 31, 2015, we have since our inception, purchased an aggregate of approximately $285 million in Association receivables by funding a total of $12 million with respect to approximately 12,000 units across over 500 Associations in Florida, Washington and Colorado. Through December 31, 2015, we have, since our inception, received just under $110 million from approximately $216 million in purchased Accounts. From these purchased Accounts, we have recovered almost all of our principal investment of almost $12 million and earned about $32 million in revenues. Per our contracts, we have paid or recovered $11 million in legal fees and returned $57 million to our funded Associations.

Our Products

Original Product

Our original product relies upon Florida statutory provisions that effectively protect the principal amount invested by us in each Account. In particular, Section 718.116(1), Florida Statutes, makes purchasers and sellers of a unit in an Association jointly and severally liable for all past due assessments, interest, late fees, legal fees, and costs payable to the Association. In addition, the statute grants to Associations a so-called &#8220;super lien&#8221;, which is a category of lien that is given a statutorily higher priority than all other types of liens other than property tax liens. Under the Florida statute, a Florida Association&#8217;s super lien has higher priority than all other lien holders, except that in the case of property tax liens. The amount of the Association&#8217;s priority over a first mortgage holder that takes title to a property through foreclosure (or deed in lieu), referred to as the Super Lien Amount, is limited to twelve months&#8217; past due assessments or, if less, one percent (1.0%) of the original mortgage amount. Under our contracts with Associations for our original 

product, we pay Associations an amount up to the Super Lien Amount for the right to receive all collected interest and late fees on Accounts purchased from the Associations. In the past, to protect any amount invested by us in excess of the Super Lien Amount, we purchase d insurance from an affiliate of AmTrust North America, or AmTrust, covering all assessments lost during the term of coverage due to a first mortgage foreclosure. As of January 28 th , 2016 AmTrust has advised us t hat they will not continue to offer the insurance coverage we have purchased from them in the past. They represented to us that the nonrenewal is due solely to the fact that they have not generated the premium volume they anticipated. 

In other states in which we offer our original product, which are currently only Washington, Colorado and as of February 2016, Illinois, we rely on statutes that we believe are similar to the above-described Florida statutes in relevant respects. A total of approximately 22 U.S. states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia have super lien statutes that give Association assessments super lien status under some circumstances, and of these states, we believe that all of these jurisdictions other than Alaska have a regulatory and business environment that would enable us to offer our original product to Associations in those states on materially the same basis. With respect to our original product, for the year ended December 31, 2015, we acquired 234 Accounts for $173,607 compared with 496 Accounts for $359,200 for the year ended December 31, 2014. We believe the decline in purchased Accounts acquired in 2015 as compared with 2014 was a result of a decline of our available capital in 2015, our focus on financing activities including our initial public offering, and general market conditions resulting in a greater dispersion of available units.

New Neighbor Guaranty

In 2012, we began development of a new product, the New Neighbor Guaranty, wherein an Association assigns substantially all of its outstanding indebtedness and accruals on its delinquent units to us in exchange for payments in an amount equal to the regular ongoing monthly or quarterly assessments for delinquent units when those amounts would be due to the Association. We assume both the payment and collection obligations for these assigned Accounts under this product. This simultaneously eliminates an Association&#8217;s balance sheet bad debts and assists the Association to meet its budget by receiving guaranteed assessment payments on its delinquent units and relieving the Association from paying legal fees and costs to collect its bad debts. We believe that the combined features of the product enhance the value of the underlying real estate in an Association and the value of an Association&#8217;s delinquent receivables.

Before we implement the New Neighbor Guaranty program, an Association typically asks us to conduct a review of its accounts receivable. After we have conducted the review, we inform the Association of which Accounts we are willing to purchase and the terms of such purchase. Once we implement the New Neighbor Guaranty program, we begin making scheduled payments to the Association on the Accounts as if the Association had non-delinquent residents occupying the units underlying the Accounts. Our New Neighbor Guaranty contracts typically allow us to retain all collection proceeds on each Account other than special assessments and accelerated assessment balances. Thus, the Association foregoes the potential benefit of a larger future collection in exchange for the certainty of a steady stream of immediate payments on the Account.

In the past, to protect any amount invested by us in excess of the Super Lien Amount, we purchased insurance from an affiliate of AmTrust North America, or AmTrust, covering all assessments lost during the term of coverage due to a first mortgage foreclosure. As of January 28 th , 2016 AmTrust has advised us that they will not continue to offer the insurance coverage we have purchased from them in the past. They represented to us that the nonrenewal is due solely to the fact that they have not generated the premium volume they anticipated. 

The New Neighbor Guaranty program represented approximately five percent (5%) of our overall revenue in 2015 in comparison to our original product, which accounted for approximately ninety-three percent (93%) of our overall revenue in the same period. The balance of our revenue from the period was from Accounts that are hybrids of the original product with varying splits and from income on real estate owned, or REO, units. As we continue to develop our New Neighbor Guaranty product, we expect it to make up continually larger portions of our total revenue.

As of December 31, 2015, our average investment per unit for currently active Accounts under our original product was approximately $983 and $462 for condo owners associations (COA) and home owners associations (HOA), respectively. We expect that this average investment size will not materially change for the foreseeable future. Current investment for active New Neighbor Guaranty Accounts as of December 31, 2015 averaged approximately $4,900 and $1,800 per unit for COAs and HOAs, respectively. This average will vary in the future depending on how quickly we add new Accounts and how quickly we are able to resolve those Accounts. The average continued payment to Associations that have the New Neighbor Guaranty program in place is $250 per month for each active Account as of December 31, 2015.

As of December 31, 2015, we have historically recovered approximately $3,800 for COAs and $1,300 for HOAs per Account in interest and late fee revenue for Accounts collected under our original product. Accounts under our New Neighbor Guaranty program are producing revenue to us o f, on average, approximately $4,792 for COAs and $1,220 for HOAs, per Account as December 31, 2015 after the recovery of our purchase price or investment basis. The average total recovery under our New Neighbor Guaranty program at final settlement is appro ximately $ 9,500 for COAs and $ 4,400 for HOAs, per Account, and is expected to continue to increase. 

With respect to our New Neighbor Guaranty product, for the year ended December 31, 2015 we acquired 97 Accounts for $105,000 compared with 67 Accounts for $19,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014.

Future Products

We are also developing other variations of our contracts with Associations in various states that we may introduce to the market in the future. For example, under one product under development, at the request of an Association lender we may contract with an Association to provide that the Association will have revenues equal to or more than 90% of budget or any other percentage the lender requests. If an Association is at 80% of budget and a lender requires it to maintain revenues of 90% of budget, this product would provide upfront capital to bring the Association to the 90% threshold and then make continuing payments to keep it there through the term of the loan. This minimizes the lender&#8217;s risk of delinquencies adversely affecting the loan&#8217;s repayment. Also, this would enable lenders to do business with more Associations than their previous underwriting guidelines would permit if Associations contract with us as part of the loan package. This product, along with other variations on our contracts with Associations in various states, remains under development, however, and there is no assurance that we will ultimately launch this product or any other variation on our contracts with Associations in any state.

Industry Overview

According to the Community Association Institute (&#8220;CAI&#8221;), as of January 2014, 65 million people lived in 328,500 Associations in the United States. As a percentage, homeowners associations account for between 51-55% of the total and condominium associations make up between 42-45% of the total, with cooperatives comprising the balance. Florida has nearly eight million residents living in more than 47,000 community associations. Assuming the national distribution of property types exists in Florida, Florida has approximately 24,000 homeowners associations and 20,000 condominium associations. For fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, we have contracted with approximately 450 community associations. We believe opportunity remains abundant in our other geographic markets. As of December 31, 2014, the state of Washington had more than 10,000 community associations and the state of Colorado had more than 9,000.

Associations typically address delinquencies by paying lawyers or collection agencies to recover amounts owed. While Associations seek recovery of delinquent amounts, budgets go underfunded causing the need to cut services or raise assessments further. The real estate downturn in 2008 made delinquency issues an acute problem for a large number of Associations. We were organized in 2008 to immediately address the financial problems faced by Associations as a result of delinquent unit owners.

According to the CAI, in Florida, where we have primarily operated, Associations annually assess their residents $9 billion and nationwide, annual assessments by Associations are $65 billion. We believe we are the largest purchaser of delinquent Accounts in Florida, with total purchases of approximately $250 million over a seven-year period. The balance of delinquent Accounts are serviced by lawyers, collection companies, or a handful of small competitors of us, or not serviced at all. We believe we offer Associations a better financial solution to Account delinquencies and that Associations will increasingly turn to us and our products as a solution to handle Account delinquencies.

Our Strategy 

Our primary objective is to utilize our competitive strengths, including our proprietary technology and our management&#8217;s experience and expertise in buying and collecting Association Accounts, to grow our business in Florida and in other states by identifying, evaluating, pricing, and acquiring Association Accounts and maximizing collections of such Accounts in a cost efficient manner. The principal elements of our strategy are comprised of the following:

&#160;

&#183; 

Capitalizing on our brand and existing strategic relationships to identify and acquire Association Accounts. We market our &#8220;We Buy Problems&#8221; and &#8220;You Are Always Better off with LM Funding&#8221; brands primarily through trade shows throughout Florida and, to a lesser extent, at national events. Participation in these shows and events has enabled us to form strategic relationships throughout the Association services industry and has served to provide a positive reputation in the industry. We leverage our brand and strategic relationships with law firms and Associations to identify and purchase Accounts. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Partnering with Associations&#8217; advisors such as law firms, management companies, accountants, Association lenders, and others to efficiently identify and acquire Accounts on a national basis. The point of purchase for Accounts is at the individual Association board of directors level; therefore, establishing and maintaining relationships with the advisors of those boards is important to our business strategy. Our strategic relationships with Association boards&#8217; advisors provide us with opportunities to meet with Association boards on favorable terms and help us to gain their trust and confidence. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Providing our proprietary software to our partner law firms in order to cost effectively track, control, and collect purchased Accounts and maintain low fixed overhead. Our proprietary software enables law firms&#8217; lawyers to efficiently handle approximately 1,000 accounts at a time with a high degree of uniformity and accuracy based upon historical caseload per lawyer of Business Law Group, P.A., one of our partner law firms. This enables our law firms to operate more efficiently and profitably, while simultaneously enabling us to cost effectively track and control our Accounts on a real-time basis. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Utilizing increased access to capital and lines of credit to expand our product offerings nationally. As a specialty finance company, capital is our inventory. Access to capital has always determined the speed of our growth and the amount of upfront funding we can provide with our products. We believe that increased access to capital will enable us to pursue more opportunities to buy Accounts and to develop a wider array of specialty finance products. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Extending secured commercial loans as a means to acquiring large blocks of Accounts. We intend to pursue the extension of secured loans to commercial partners who, as a condition of such loans, would be required to drive large blocks of accounts to us. Banks, management companies, law firms, and large Associations control large blocks of Accounts that we may be able to acquire if we help meet their capital needs. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Pursuing acquisitions of providers in the Association Account servicing industry. A number of smaller collection companies continue to operate in the community association market. Some have funded Accounts that we can acquire. Others have customer relationships which can serve as a valuable platform for selling our products. We will continue to explore opportunities to expand our footprint in both the states in which we operate and by looking to make strategic acquisitions in states we wish to expand to. 

&#160;
