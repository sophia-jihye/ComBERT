 Item 1. Business 

&#160; 

Our Company 

&#160; 

We were incorporated in Maryland on June 28, 2004. We are a real estate investment trust, or REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#8220;Code&#8221;). As of December 31, 201 5 , we had interests in 29 hotels (the &#8220; 29 hotels&#8221;). The 29 hotels are comprised of 1 3 , 845 rooms, located in 1 3 states and in Washington, DC. 

&#160; 

Our primary business is to acquire, own, asset manage and renovate full-service hotel and select focus-service hotel properties in the United States. As part of our ongoing portfolio management strategy, we may also sell hotel properties from time to time. All but one (the Boston Park Plaza) of the 29 hotels are operated under nationally recognized brands such as Marriott, Hilton, Hyatt, Fairmont and Sheraton , which are among the most respected and widely recognized brands in the lodging industry. While independent hotels may do well in strong market locations, we believe the largest and most stable segment of travelers prefer the consistent service and quality associated with nationally recognized brands and well-known independent hotels . Our portfolio primarily consists of urban, upper upscale hotels in the United States. As of December &#160; 31, 2015 , our 29 hotels include two luxury hotels and 2 7 &#160; hotels classified as either upscale or upper upscale. The classifications luxury , upper upscale and upscale are defined by Smith Travel Research, an independent provider of lodging industry statistical data. Smith Travel Research classifies hotel chains into the following segments: luxury; upper upscale; upscale; upper midscale; midscale; economy; and independent. 

&#160; 

Our hotels are operated by third-party managers pursuant to long-term management agreements with our TRS Lessee or its subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2015 , our third-party managers included: subsidiaries of Marriott International, Inc. or Marriott Hotel Services, Inc. (collectively &#8220;Marriott&#8221;), managers of 1 1 of the Company&#8217;s 29 hotels; Interstate Hotels &#38; Resorts, Inc. (&#8220;IHR&#8221;), manager of six of the Company&#8217;s 29 hotels; Highgate Hotels L.P. and an affiliate (&#8220;Highgate&#8221;), manager of three of the Company&#8217;s 29 hotels; Crestline Hotels &#160; &#38; Resorts (&#8220;Crestline&#8221;), Hilton Worldwide (&#8220;Hilton&#8221;) and Hyatt Corporation (&#8220;Hyatt&#8221;), each a manager of two of the Company&#8217;s 29 hotels; and Davidson Hotels &#160; &#38; Resorts (&#8220;Davidson&#8221;), Fairmont Hotels &#38; Resorts (U.S.) (&#8220;Fairmont&#8221;) and HEI Hotels &#38; Resorts (&#8220;HEI&#8221;) , each a manager of one of the Company&#8217;s 29 hotels. 

&#160; 

Competitive Strengths 

&#160; 

We believe the following competitive strengths distinguish us from other owners of lodging properties: 

&#183; 

Significant Cash Position . As of December 31, 2015 , we had total cash of $ 575.2 million, including $ 76.2 million of restricted cash. A djusting for payment of our common and preferred dividend s in January 2016, our 

&#160;

total pro forma cash including restricted cash as of December 31, 2015 would be $3 88.9 million. By minimizing our need to access external capital by maintaining higher than typical cash balances, our financial security and flexibility are meaningfully enhanced because we are able to fund our business needs, debt maturities, specifically those occurring in 2016, and possibly acquisitions partially with cash on hand. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Flexible Capital Structure . We believe our capital structure provides us with appropriate financial flexibility to execute our strategy. As of December 31, 2015 , the weighted average term to maturity of our debt is approximately 4 years, and 79.5 % &#160; of our debt is fixed rate with a weighted average interest rate of 4.95 % , including the effects of our interest rate swap agreements . Including our variable-rate debt obligation based on variable rates at December 31, 2015 , the weighted average interest rate on our debt is 4.45 %. O ur mortgage debt is in the form of single asset non-recourse loans rather than in cross-collateralized multi- property pools. In addition to our mortgage debt , as of December 31, 2015, we have an unsecured corporate-level term loan , which matures in September 2022 and has an interest rate of 3.391%, including the effects of an interest rate swap agreement. &#160; We currently believe this structure is appropriate for the operating characteristics of our business as it isolates risk and provides flexibility for various portfolio management initiatives, including the sale of individual hotels subject to existing debt. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Low Leverage . Over the past four years, we have been committed to thoughtfully and methodically reducing our leverage while maintaining a focus on creating and protecting stockholder value. We believe that by achieving low leverage and high financial flexibility by the time the current cycle peaks, we will position the Company to create value during the next successive cyclical trough by acquiring distressed assets or securities. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Strong A ccess to Low Cost Capital. As a publicly traded REIT, over the long-term, we may benefit from greater access to a variety of forms of capital as compared to non-public investment vehicles. In addition, over the long-term, we may benefit from a lower cost of capital as compared to non-public investment vehicles as a result of our liquidity, professional management and portfolio diversification. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

High Quality Portfolio. 

&#160; 

Presence in Key Markets . We believe that our hotels are located in desirable markets with major demand generators and significant barriers to entry for new supply. In 2015, approximately 87% of the revenues generated by the 29 hotels were earned by hotels located in key gateway markets such as Boston, New York, Washington, DC/Baltimore, Chicago, Orlando, New Orleans, San Fran cisco, Los Angeles, Orange County and San Diego. Over time, we expect the revenues of hotels located in key gateway markets to grow more quickly than the average for U.S. hotels as a result of stronger and more diverse economic drivers as well as higher levels of international travel. 

&#160; 

Upper Upscale and Upscale Concentration . The upper upscale and upscale segments, which represented approximately 94% of the hotel revenue generated by the 29 hotels during 2015 , tend to outperform the lodging industry, particularly in the recovery phase of the lodging cycle. As of December &#160; 31, 2015 , the hotels comprising our 29 hotel portfolio averaged 47 7 rooms in size . &#160; O ur total 29 hotel Comparable Portfolio RevPAR was $ 162.42 for the year ended December &#160; 31, 2015 . 

&#160; 

Nationally Recognized Brands . All but one (the Boston Park Plaza) of the 29 hotels are operated under nationally recognized brands, including Marriott, Hilton, Hyatt, Fairmont and Sheraton. We believe that affiliations with strong brands improve the appeal of our hotels to a broad set of travelers and help to drive business to our hotels. 

&#160; 

Recently Renovated Hotels . From January 1, 20 1 1 through December 31, 2015 , we invested $ 556.9 million in capital renovations throughout the 29 hotels. We believe that these capital renovations have improved the competitiveness of our hotels and have helped to position our portfolio for future growth. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Seasoned Management Team. Each of our core disciplines, asset management, acquisitions and finance, are overseen by industry leaders with demonstrated track records. &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Asset Management . Our asset management team is responsible for maximizing the long-term value of our real estate investments by achieving above average revenue and profit performance through proactive oversight of hotel operations. Our asset management team leads property-level innovation, benchmarks best practices and aggressively oversees hotel management teams and property plans. We work with our operators to develop hotel-level &#8220;master plans,&#8221; which include positioning and capital renovation plans. We believe that a proactive asset management program can help grow the revenues of our hotel portfolio and maximize operational efficiency by leveraging best practices and innovations across our various hotels, and by initiating well-timed and focused capital improvements aimed at improving the appeal of our hotels. 

&#160; 

Acquisitions . Our acquisitions team is responsible for enhancing our portfolio quality and scale by executing well-timed acquisitions and dispositions that maximize our risk-adjusted return on our investment dollars . We believe that our significant acquisition and disposition experience will allow us to continue to execute our cycle-appropriate strategy to redeploy capital from slower growth to higher growth hotels. From the date of our initial public offering through December 31, 2015 , we acquired interests in 2 6 hotel properties and sold 4 3 hotel properties. We plan to capitalize on acquisition opportunities that may arise in 201 6 , as we believe our industry relationships may create opportunities for us to acquire individual hotel assets , or hotel portfolio s , &#160; provided these opportunities are at attractive values relative to our cost of capital . W e will also focus on capital recycling, and may selectively sell hotels that we believe have lower growth prospects , have significant ongoing capital needs , or that we can sell at a substantial premium to our internal valuation of the asset , as evidenced by the sale of our interests in the Doubletree Guest Suites Times Square in December 2015 . 

&#160; 

Finance . We have a highly experienced finance team focused on minimizing our cost of capital and maximizing our financial flexibility by proactively managing our capital structure and opportunistically sourcing appropriate capital for growth, while maintaining a best in class disclosure and investor relations program. Accordingly, our financial objectives include the maintenance of appropriate levels of liquidity through the cyclical recovery phase, with liquidity levels maximized in advance of anticipated cyclical declines. During 2015 , we reduced our total mortgage debt by $ 22.1 million through amortization , and by an additional $ 304.8 million through repayments of s ix separate mortgages. We also refinanced one mortgage loan with an $85.0 million unsecured term loan , extending our term to maturity and reducing our average interest rate . In addition, we entered into a $400.0 million senior unsecured credit facility, which replaced our prior $150.0 million senior unsecured credit facility . The credit facility&#8217;s interest rate is based on a pricing grid with a range of 155 to 230 basis points over LIBOR, depending on our leverage ratios, and represents a decline in pricing from the prior credit facility of approximately 30 to 60 basis points. 

&#160; 

Business Strategy 

&#160; 

Our mission is to create meaningful value for our stockholders by producing superior long-term returns . Our values include transparency, trust, ethical conduct, communication and discipline. As demand for lodging generally fluctuates with the overall economy, we seek to employ a balanced, cycle-appropriate corporate strategy. Our strategy over the next several years, during what we believe will be the mature phase of the lodging cycle, is to maximize stockholder value through disciplined capital recycling, which is likely to include selective acquisitions and dispositions, while maintaining balance sheet flexibility and strength . Our goal is to maintain low leverage and high financial flexibility through the current cycle peak. We believe if we are successful in executing on this strategy, we will position the Company to create value during the next cyclical trough. Our strateg ic plan encompasses several elements, including proactive portfolio management, focused asset management, disciplined external growth and continued balance sheet strength . 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The hotel industry is highly competitive. Our hotels compete with other hotels for guests in each of their markets. Competitive advantage is based on a number of factors, including location, quality of accommodations, convenience, brand affiliation, room rates, service levels and amenities, and level of customer service. Competition is often specific to the individual markets in which our hotels are located and includes competition from existing and new hotels operated under 

&#160;

brands in the luxury, upper upscale and upscale segments. Increased competition could harm our occupancy or revenues or may lead our operators to increase service or amenity levels, which may reduce the profitability of our hotels. 

&#160; 

We believe that competition for the acquisition of hotels is fragmented. We face competition from institutional pension funds, private equity investors, other REITs and numerous local, regional , national and international owners, including franchisors, in each of our markets. Some of these entities may have substantially greater financial resources than we do and may be able and willing to accept more risk than we believe we can prudently manage. During the recovery phase of the lodging cycle, when we seek to acquire hotels, competition among potential buyers may increase the bargaining power of potential sellers, which may reduce the number of suitable investment opportunities available to us or increase pricing. Similarly, during times when we seek to sell hotels, competition from other sellers may increase the bargaining power of the potential property buyers. 

&#160; 

Management Agreements 

&#160; 

All of our 29 hotels are managed by third parties pursuant to management agreements with our TRS Lessee or its subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2015 , Marriott managed 1 1 of our hotels, &#160; IHR managed six of our hotels, Highgate managed three of our hotels, &#160; Crestline, Hilton and Hyatt each managed two of our hotels, and the remaining three hotels were individually managed by Davidson, Fairmont and HEI . The following is a general description of our third-party management agreements as of December &#160; 31, 2015 . 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

With the exception of the IHR management agreement at the Sheraton Cerritos (which agreement is subject to automatic two-year renewal terms, the first of which commenced in 2012), the IHR management agreements expire in 2024 and provide us the right to renew each management agreement for up to two additional terms of five years each, absent a prior termination by either party. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Our Hyatt Regency San Francisco hotel is operated by Hyatt under an operating lease with economics that follow a typical management fee structure. The lease expires in 2050, and provides no renewal options. Pursuant to the lease, Hyatt retains 3.0% of total revenue as a base management fee. The lease also provides Hyatt the opportunity to earn an incentive fee if gross operating profit exceeds certain thresholds. 

&#160; 

Davidson. Our Hyatt Chicago Magnificent Mile hotel is operated under a management agreement with Davidson. The management agreement at the Hyatt Chicago Magnificent Mile expires in 2019, and provides us with the right to renew for up to two additional terms of five years each, absent a prior termination by either party.

&#160; 

The existing management agreements with Marriott, Hilton, Hyatt and Fairmont require the manager to furnish chain services that are generally made available to other hotels managed by that operator. Costs for these chain services are reimbursed by us. Such services include: (1) the development and operation of computer systems and reservation services; (2) management and administrative services; (3) marketing and sales services; (4) human resources training services; and (5) such additional services as may from time to time be more efficiently performed on a national, regional or group level. 

&#160; 

Franchise Agreements 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015 , 1 4 of the 29 hotels were operated subject to franchise agreements. Franchisors provide a variety of benefits to franchisees, including nationally recognized brands, centralized reservation systems, national advertising, marketing programs and publicity designed to increase brand awareness, training of personnel and maintenance of operational quality at hotels across the brand system. 

&#160; 

The franchise agreements generally specify management, operational, record-keeping, accounting, reporting and marketing standards and procedures with which our subsidiary, as the franchisee, must comply. The franchise agreements obligate the subsidiary to comply with the franchisors&#8217; standards and requirements with respect to training of operational personnel, safety, maintaining specified insurance, the types of services and products ancillary to guest room services that may be provided by the subsidiary, display of signage and the type, quality and age of furniture, fixtures and equipment included in guest rooms, lobbies and other common areas. The franchise agreements for our hotels require that we reserve up to 5.0% of the gross revenues of the hotels into a reserve fund for capital expenditures. 

&#160; 

The franchise agreements also provide for termination at the franchisor&#8217;s option upon the occurrence of certain events, including failure to pay royalties and fees or to perform other obligations under the franchise license, bankruptcy and abandonment of the franchise or a change in control. The subsidiary that is the franchisee is responsible for making all payments under the franchise agreements to the franchisors; however , the Company guaranties certain obligations under a majority of the franchise agreements. 

&#160; 

Tax Status 

&#160; 

We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 859 of the Code, commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2004. Under current federal income tax laws, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our net taxable income to our stockholders in order to satisfy the REIT distribution requirement . While REITs enjoy certain tax benefits relative to C corporations, as a REIT we may, however, be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. We may also be subject to federal income and excise tax on our undistributed income. 

&#160; 

Taxable REIT Subsidiary 

&#160; 

Subject to certain limitations, a REIT is permitted to own, directly or indirectly, up to 100% of the stock of a taxable REIT subsidiary, or TRS. The TRS may engage in businesses and earn income that are prohibited to a REIT. In particular, a hotel REIT is permitted to own a TRS that leases hotels from the REIT, rather than requiring the lessee to be an unaffiliated third party. However, a hotel leased to a TRS still must be managed by an unaffiliated third party in the business of managing hotels. The TRS provisions are complex and impose certain conditions on the use of TRSs. This is to assure that TRSs are subject to an appropriate level of federal corporate taxation. 

&#160; 

A TRS is a fully taxable corporation that may earn income that would not be qualifying income if earned directly by us. A TRS may perform activities such as development, and other independent business activities. However, a TRS may not directly or indirectly operate or manage any hotels or provide rights to any brand name under which any hotel is operated. 

&#160; 

&#160;

We and the TRS Lessee must make a joint election with the IRS for the TRS Lessee to be treated as a TRS. A corporation of which a qualifying TRS owns, directly or indirectly, more than 35% of the voting power or value of the corporation&#8217;s stock will automatically be treated as a TRS. Overall, no more than 25% (20% beginning after 2017) of the value of our assets may consist of securities of one or more TRS, and no more than 25% of the value of our assets may consist of the securities of TRSs and other assets that are not qualifying assets for purposes of the 75% asset test. The 75% asset test generally requires that at least 75% of the value of our total assets be represented by real estate assets, cash, or government securities. 

&#160; 

The rent that we receive from a TRS qualifies as &#8220;rents from real property&#8221; as long as the property is operated on behalf of the TRS by a person who qualifies as an &#8220;independent contractor&#8221; and who is, or is related to a person who is, actively engaged in the trade or business of operating &#8220;qualified lodging facilities&#8221; for any person unrelated to us and the TRS (an &#8220;eligible independent contractor&#8221;). A &#8220;qualified lodging facility&#8221; is a hotel, motel or other establishment in which more than one-half of the dwelling units are used on a transient basis. A &#8220;qualified lodging facility&#8221; does not include any facility where wagering activities are conducted. A &#8220;qualified lodging facility&#8221; includes customary amenities and facilities operated as part of, or associated with, the lodging facility as long as such amenities and facilities are customary for other properties of a comparable size and class owned by other unrelated owners. 

&#160; 

We have formed the TRS Lessee as a wholly owned TRS. We lease each of our hotels to the TRS Lessee or one of its subsidiaries. These leases provide for a base rent plus variable rent based on occupied rooms and departmental revenues. These leases must contain economic terms which are similar to a lease between unrelated parties. If they do not, the IRS could impose a 100% excise tax on certain transactions between our TRS and us or our tenants that are not conducted on an arm&#8217;s-length basis. We believe that all transactions between us and the TRS Lessee are conducted on an arm&#8217;s-length basis. Further, the TRS rules limit the deductibility of interest paid or accrued by a TRS to us to assure that the TRS is subject to an appropriate level of corporate taxation. 

&#160; 

The TRS Lessee has engaged eligible independent contractors to manage the hotels it leases from Sunstone Hotel Partnership, LLC. 

&#160; 

Ground, Building and Air Lease Agreements 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015 , eight of the 29 hotels are subject to ground, building and/or air leases with unaffiliated parties that cover either all or portions of their respective properties. As of December 31, 2015 , the remaining terms of these ground, building and air leases (including renewal options) range from approximately 2 8 to 82 years. These leases generally require us to make rental payments and payments for all or portions of costs and expenses, including real and personal property taxes, insurance and utilities associated with the leased property. 

&#160; 

Any proposed sale of a property that is subject to a ground, building or air lease or any proposed assignment of our leasehold interest as lessee under the ground, building or air lease may require the consent of the applicable lessor. As a result, we may not be able to sell, assign, transfer or convey our interest in any such property in the future absent the consent of the ground, building or air lessor, even if such transaction may be in the best interests of our stockholders. T wo of the eight leases prohibit the sale or conveyance of the hotel and assignment of the lease by us to another party without first offering the lessor the opportunity to acquire our interest in the associated hotel and property upon the same terms and conditions as offered by us to the third party. 

&#160; 

T wo of the eight leases allow us the option to acquire the ground or building lessor&#8217;s interest in the ground or building lease subject to certain exercisability provisions. From time to time, we evaluate our options to purchase the lessors&#8217; interests in the leases. 

&#160; 

Offices 

&#160; 

We lease our headquarters located at 120 Vantis, Suite 350, Aliso Viejo, California 92656 from an unaffiliated third party. We occupy our headquarters under a lease that terminates on August 30, 2018. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

At February 1, 201 6 , we had 50 employees. We believe that our relations with our employees are positive. All persons employed in the day-to-day operations of the hotels are employees of the management companies engaged by the TRS Lessee or its subsidiaries to operate such hotels. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Environmental 

&#160; 

Environmental reviews have been conducted on all of our hotels. Environmental consultants retained by our lenders have conducted Phase I environmental site assessments on many of our properties. In certain instances, these Phase I assessments relied on older environmental assessments prepared in connection with prior financings. Phase I assessments are designed to evaluate the potential for environmental contamination of properties based generally upon site inspections, facility personnel interviews, historical information and certain publicly available databases. Phase I assessments will not necessarily reveal the existence or extent of all environmental conditions, liabilities or compliance concerns at the properties. In addition, material environmental conditions, liabilities or compliance concerns may arise after the Phase I assessments are completed, or may arise in the future, and future laws, ordinances or regulations may impose material additional environmental liabilities.

Under various federal, state and local laws and regulations, an owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on the property. These laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. Furthermore, a person that arranges for the disposal or transports for disposal or treatment of a hazardous substance at another property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous substances released into the environment at that property. The costs of remediation or removal of such substances may be substantial, and the presence of such substances, or the failure to promptly remediate such substances, may adversely affect the owner&#8217;s ability to sell such real estate or to borrow using such real estate as collateral. In connection with the ownership and operation of our properties, we or the TRS Lessee, as the case may be, may be potentially liable for such costs. &#160; Although we have tried to mitigate environmental risk through insurance, this insurance may not cover all or any of the environmental risks we encounter. 

&#160; 

As an owner of real estate, we are not directly involved in the operation of our properties or other activities that could produce meaningful levels of greenhouse gas emissions. As a result, we have not implemented a formal program to measure or manage emissions associated with our corporate office or hotels. Although we do not believe that climate change represents a direct material risk to our business, we could be indirectly affected by climate change and other environmental issues to the extent these issues negatively affect the broader economy, result in increased regulation or costs, or have a negative impact on travel. 

&#160; 

We have provided unsecured environmental indemnities to certain lenders and buyers of our properties . We have performed due diligence on the potential environmental risks including obtaining an independent environmental review from outside environmental consultants. These &#160; indemnities obligate us to reimburse the guaranteed parties for damages related to environmental matters. There is generally no term or damage limitation on these indemnities; however, if an environmental matter arises, we could have recourse against other previous owners. 

&#160; 

ADA Regulation 

&#160; 

Our properties must comply with various laws and regulations, including Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (&#8220;ADA&#8221;) to the extent that such properties are &#8220;public accommodations&#8221; as defined by the ADA. The ADA may require removal of structural barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable. We believe that our properties are in substantial compliance with the ADA; however, noncompliance with the ADA could result in capital expenditures, the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. The obligation to make readily achievable accommodations is an ongoing one, and we will continue to assess our properties and to make alterations as appropriate in this respect. 

&#160; 

Inflation 

&#160; 

Inflation may affect our expenses, including, without limitation, by increasing costs such as labor, food, taxes, property and casualty insurance , borrowing costs and utilities.
