 ITEM 1. BUSINESS Introduction 

On October 24, 2014, DB Commodity Services LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (&#147;DBCS&#148;), DB U.S. Financial Markets Holding Corporation (&#147;DBUSH&#148;) and Invesco PowerShares Capital Management LLC (&#147;Invesco&#148;) entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the &#147;Agreement&#148;). DBCS is a wholly-owned subsidiary of DBUSH. DBCS agreed to transfer and sell to Invesco all of DBCS&#146; interest in the PowerShares DB G10 Currency Harvest Fund (the &#147;Fund&#148;), including the sole and exclusive power to direct the business and affairs of the Fund, as well as certain other assets of DBCS pertaining to the management of the Fund, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Agreement (the &#147;Transaction&#148;). 

The Transaction was consummated on February 23, 2015 (the &#147;Closing Date&#148;). Invesco now serves as the managing owner (the &#147;Managing Owner&#148;), commodity pool operator and commodity trading advisor of the Fund, in replacement of DBCS (the &#147;Predecessor Managing Owner&#148;). 

Organization 

The Fund was formed as a Delaware statutory trust on April 12, 2006. The Predecessor Managing Owner seeded the Fund with a capital contribution of $1,000 in exchange for 40 General Shares of the Fund. The General Shares were sold to the Managing Owner by the Predecessor Managing Owner pursuant to the terms of the Agreement. The fiscal year end of the Fund is December 31st. The term of the Fund is perpetual (unless terminated earlier in certain circumstances) as provided for in the Fifth Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust and Trust Agreement of the Fund (the &#147;Trust Agreement&#148;). The Fund has an unlimited number of Shares authorized for issuance. 

The Fund offers common units of beneficial interest (the &#147;Shares&#148;) only to certain eligible financial institutions (the &#147;Authorized Participants&#148;) in one or more blocks of 200,000 Shares, called a Basket. The proceeds from the offering of Shares are invested in the Fund. The Fund commenced investment operations on September 15, 2006. The Fund commenced trading on the American Stock Exchange (which became the NYSE Alternext US LLC (the &#147;NYSE Alternext&#148;)) on September 18, 2006 and is now listed on the NYSE Arca, Inc. (the &#147;NYSE Arca&#148;) as of November 25, 2008. 

As of the date of this Annual Report (the &#147;Report&#148;), each of Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp., Virtu Financial Capital Markets LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Virtu Financial BD LLC, Knight Capital Americas LLC, Timber Hill LLC, Morgan Stanley &#38; Co. LLC, Jefferies &#38; Company Inc., Nomura Securities International Inc., RBC Capital Markets, LLC, UBS Securities LLC, Cantor Fitzgerald &#38; Co., BNP Paribas Securities Corp., Goldman, Sachs &#38; Co., Goldman Sachs Execution &#38; Clearing, L.P. and Citadel Securities LLC has executed a Participant Agreement. 

Fund Investment Overview 

The Fund invests the proceeds from the offering of Shares in exchange-traded currency futures comprising the Deutsche Bank G10 Currency Future Harvest Index&#151;Excess Return&#153;, (the &#147;Index&#148;), with a view to tracking changes, whether positive or negative, in the level of the Index calculated on an excess return basis, over time, plus the excess, if any, of the Fund&#146;s income from its holdings of United States Treasury Obligations over the expenses of the Fund. The Fund holds United States Treasury Obligations on deposit with the Custodian (as defined below) and with the Commodity Broker (as defined below) as margin. 

The Index is designed to reflect the performance of certain currencies. The currencies comprising the Index, at any time (each an &#147;Index Currency&#148;, and collectively, the &#147;Index Currencies&#148;) are six of the following Group of Ten currencies: United States Dollars, Euros, Japanese Yen, Canadian Dollars, Swiss Francs, British Pounds, Australian Dollars, New Zealand Dollars, Norwegian Krone and Swedish Krona, or, collectively, the Eligible Index Currencies. At any time, the Index will consist of long futures contracts on the three Eligible Index Currencies associated with the highest interest rates and short futures contracts on the three Eligible Index Currencies associated with the lowest interest rates. The ratio of the notional value of futures contracts in the Index to collateral used to margin those contracts is generally 2:1 when the Index re-balances quarterly. However, if the United States Dollar is one of the Eligible Index Currencies associated with either the three highest or three lowest interest rates, the Index will not establish a futures position, and the ratio of the notional value of futures contracts to collateral used to margin those contracts will be 1.66:1 when the Index re-balances. The Fund has in the past invested at the quarterly re-balance in excess of the targeted 2:1 ratio of aggregate notional value of futures to collateral used to margin those contracts. 

&#160; 

The Managing Owner pays the Index Sponsor (as defined below) a licensing fee and an index services fee for performing its duties. These fees constitute a portion of the routine operational, administrative and other ordinary expenses which are paid out of the Management Fee and are not charged to or reimbursed by the Fund. 

Neither the Managing Owner nor any affiliate of the Managing Owner has any rights to influence the selection of the futures contracts underlying the Index. After the Closing Date, the Index Sponsor is not affiliated with the Fund or the Managing Owner. The Managing Owner has entered into a license agreement with the Index Sponsor to use the Index. 

The Fund is not sponsored or endorsed by Deutsche Bank AG, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. or any subsidiary or affiliate of Deutsche Bank AG or Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. (collectively, &#147;Deutsche Bank&#148;). The Deutsche Bank G10 Currency Future Harvest Index &#174; &#150; Excess Return (the &#147;DB Index&#148;) is the exclusive property of Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. &#147;DBIQ&#148; is a service mark of Deutsche Bank AG and has been licensed for use for certain purposes by Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.

Index Composition 

The currencies that are eligible for inclusion in the Index are the currencies of The Group of Ten (the &#147;G10&#148;) countries (the &#147;Eligible Index Currencies&#148;), which include the following currencies: 

&#160;

Eligible Index Currency 

&#160; Symbol &#160; United States Dollar 

&#160; &#160; USD &#160; Euro 

&#160; &#160; EUR &#160; Japanese Yen 

&#160; &#160; JPY &#160; Canadian Dollar 

&#160; &#160; CAD &#160; Swiss Franc 

&#160; &#160; CHF &#160; British Pound 

&#160; &#160; GBP &#160; Australian Dollar 

&#160; &#160; AUD &#160; New Zealand Dollar 

&#160; &#160; NZD &#160; Norwegian Krone 

&#160; &#160; NOK &#160; Swedish Krona 

&#160; &#160; SEK &#160; The futures contracts referencing each of the Eligible Index Currencies (except USD) in which the Fund invests are currently traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (the &#147;CME&#148;), although currency futures contracts on the Eligible Index Currencies also trade on other exchanges in the United States and the Fund may invest in such contracts. 

&#160; 

At any time, the Index is comprised of long futures positions in the three Eligible Index Currencies associated with the highest interest rates and short futures positions in the three Eligible Index Currencies associated with the lowest interest rates. The Index&#146;s six component currencies from time-to-time, comprised of the three long and three short futures positions (each an &#147;Index Currency&#148;, and collectively, the &#147;Index Currencies&#148;), are used to calculate the value of the Index. The composition of the Index may be adjusted in the event that the Index Sponsor is not able to calculate the closing prices of the Index Currencies. 

The following table reflects the Fund and Index weights of each Index Currency as of December 31, 2015: 

&#160;

Eligible Index Currency 

&#160; Fund Weight (%) &#160; &#160; Index Weight &#160; United States Dollar 

&#160; &#160; * &#160; &#160; &#160; * &#160; Euro 

&#160; &#160; (31.78 )% &#160; &#160; (33.18 )% Japanese Yen 

&#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; Canadian Dollar 

&#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; Swiss Franc 

&#160; &#160; (31.48 )% &#160; &#160; (32.79 )% British Pound 

&#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; Australian Dollar 

&#160; &#160; 31.46 % &#160; &#160; 32.78 % New Zealand Dollar 

&#160; &#160; 31.29 % &#160; &#160; 32.57 % Norwegian Krone 

&#160; &#160; 31.80 % &#160; &#160; 33.16 % Swedish Krona 

&#160; &#160; (32.18 )% &#160; &#160; (33.38 )% &#160;

* The United States Dollar was one of the Eligible Index Currencies (as hereinafter defined) associated with the three lowest interest rates. As a result, the Fund did not establish a futures position, and the ratio of the notional value of futures contracts to collateral used to margin those contracts will be 1.66:1 when the Fund re-balances. The Fund is an index tracking fund and does not utilize any trading system, whether discretionary, systematic or otherwise. The Index is a mathematical construct that is comprised of the Index Currencies, each of which is assigned an initial weight. As the value of the underlying Index Currencies changes, the relative weights of each of the Index Currencies will vary. The Index will be re-balanced at a pre-determined frequency in order to restore the target weights. As the Fund will invest in futures contracts tied to the underlying Index Currencies (and their corresponding target base weights) with a view to tracking the changes, whether positive or negative, in the changes in the levels of the Index, the Managing Owner serves in an administrative role in order to ensure that the Fund invests in a manner that seeks to track the Index. 

As discussed above, the Fund employs leverage on an approximate 2:1 basis. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the Fund had $7,415,075 (or 8.37% of its total assets) and $86,606,279 (or 100.00% of its total assets), respectively, of its holdings of cash, United States Treasury Obligations and unrealized appreciation/depreciation of futures contracts on deposit with its Commodity Broker or the Custodian. Of this, $6,999,620 (or 7.90% of its total assets) and $2,949,678 (or 3.41% of its total assets) was required to be deposited to satisfy maintenance margin required by the Commodity Broker for the Fund&#146;s open futures positions as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. All remaining cash and United States Treasury Obligations are on deposit with the Custodian (see Note 4). For additional information, please see the Schedules of Investments as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 for details of the Fund&#146;s portfolio holdings. 

The Index Sponsor calculates the Index on both an excess return basis and a total return basis. The excess return basis calculation reflects the change in market value of the applicable underlying currency futures only. The total return basis calculation reflects the sum of the change in market value of the applicable underlying currency futures plus the return on 3-month U.S. Treasury bills. The Fund seeks to track changes, whether positive or negative, in the level of the Index calculated on an excess return basis, over time, plus the excess, if any, of the Fund&#146;s income from its holdings of United States Treasury and, if applicable, other high credit quality short-term fixed income securities over the expenses of the Fund. 

The Fund will make distributions at the discretion of the Managing Owner. To the extent that the Fund&#146;s actual and projected interest income from its holdings of United States Treasury securities exceeds the actual and projected fees and expenses of the Fund, the Managing Owner expects periodically to make distributions of the amount of such excess. The Fund currently does not expect to make distributions with respect to its capital gains. Depending on the Fund&#146;s performance for the taxable year and an investor&#146;s own tax situation for such year, an investor&#146;s income tax liability for the taxable year and allocable share of the Fund&#146;s net ordinary income or loss and capital gain or loss may exceed any distributions an investor may receive with respect to such year. 

In order to determine which Eligible Index Currencies to include in the Index from time-to-time, the Index Sponsor will review the composition of the Index on a quarterly basis five business days prior to the IMM Date. &#147;IMM Date&#148; means the third Wednesday of March, June, September and December, a traditional settlement date in the International Money Market. 

&#160; 

The Index Sponsor will review the three month Libor rate for each Eligible Index Currency other than the SEK and NOK and will review the three month Stibor rate and the three month Nibor rate for the SEK and NOK, respectively. The Libor, Stibor and Nibor rates for the Eligible Index Currencies, as applicable, mean the London, Stockholm and Norway interbank offered rates for overnight deposits, respectively, each of which is published by Reuters. The Eligible Index Currencies are then ranked according to yield. The three highest yielding and three lowest yielding are selected as Index Currencies for inclusion in calculating the Index. If two Index Currencies have the same yield, then the previous quarter&#146;s ranking will be used. Please see http://www.invescopowershares.com with respect to the most recently available weighted composition of the Fund and the composition of the Index. 

The Index is re-weighted quarterly. Upon re-weighting, the high yielding Index Currencies are allocated a base weight of 33 1/3% and the low yielding Index Currencies are allocated a base weight of -33 1/3%. These new weights are applied during the Index re weighting period, which takes place between the fourth and third Index Business Days prior to the applicable IMM Date (the &#147;Index Re-Weighting Period&#148;). 

The CME traded futures contract of each applicable Index Currency that is closest to expiration is used in the Index calculation. The futures contracts on the Index Currencies are rolled during the Index Re-Weighting Period. The new futures contract on an Index Currency that has the next closest expiration date is selected. The calculation of the Index on an excess return basis is the weighted return on the change in price of the futures contracts on the Index Currencies. 

A 3-month U.S. Treasury bill return is then calculated and included to calculate the total return index. Please refer to Exhibit B of the Trust Agreement for the mathematical formula of the Index. 

The Index has been calculated using historical data since March 12, 1993. The Index is composed of notional amounts of each Index Currency. The notional amounts of the Index Currencies included in the Index are based on the Index Closing Level as of the Index Re-Weighting Period. The Index Closing Level reflects an arithmetic weighted return of the change in the Index Currencies exchange rates against the USD since March 12, 1993. March 1993 was chosen as a starting period because it represents the earliest date on which reliable data for all the Eligible Index Currencies exists. On March 12, 1993, the closing Index level was USD 100. Between March 12, 1993 to December 31, 2015, the Index level as calculated on an excess return basis has ranged from as high as USD 315.27 (July 25, 2007) to as low as USD 94.03 (July 30, 1993). Past Index results are not necessarily indicative of future changes, positive or negative, in the Index. 

To track the Index, the Fund generally will establish long futures positions in the three Eligible Index Currencies associated with the highest interest rates and short futures positions in the three Eligible Index Currencies associated with the lowest interest rates and will adjust its holdings quarterly as the Index is adjusted. However, if the United States Dollar (&#147;USD&#148;) is among the Index Currencies from time-to-time, the Fund will not establish a long or short futures position (as the case may be) in USD, because USD is the Fund&#146;s home currency and, as a consequence, the Fund can never enjoy profit or suffer loss from long or short futures positions in USD. When the USD is not associated with the highest or lowest interest rates among the Eligible Index Currencies, the aggregate notional value of the Fund&#146;s futures contracts at the time they are established will be double the value of the Fund&#146;s holdings of United States Treasury, which means the Fund will have a leverage ratio at such time of 2:1. If the USD is associated with the highest or lowest interest rates among the Eligible Index Currencies, the aggregate notional value of the Fund&#146;s futures contracts at the time they are established will be approximately 1.66 times the value of the Fund&#146;s holdings of United States Treasury, which means the Fund will have a leverage ratio at such time of approximately 1.66:1. Holding futures positions with a notional amount in excess of the Fund&#146;s net asset value constitutes a form of leverage. The use of leverage will increase the potential for both trading profits and losses, depending on the changes, positive and negative, in the Index. The Fund&#146;s ability to track the Index will not be affected by the presence or absence of the USD among the Index Currencies. Because the notional value of the Fund&#146;s futures positions can rise or fall over time, the leverage ratio could be higher or lower between quarterly adjustments of the Index Currencies. 

The use of long and short positions in the construction of the Index causes the Index to rise as a result of any upward price movement of Index Currencies expected to gain relative to the USD and to rise as a result of any downward price movement of Index Currencies expected to lose relative to the USD. The inclusion of both long and short positions is also expected to reduce the country specific foreign exchange risk of the Index (and, therefore, risk in connection with an investment in the Fund) relative to a directional (outright long or short) exposure to any or all of the Index Currencies. 

There can be no assurance that the use of both long and short positions will reduce the volatility of the Index during any or all market cycles or performance periods, or that the Fund will achieve its objectives. It is possible that, prior to an Index rebalancing, that Index Currencies expected to lose relative to the USD may rise and/or Index Currencies expected to gain relative to the USD may fall. In such cases, the Fund may experience losses in both its long and short positions at the same time. Such losses will be greater as a result of the Fund&#146;s use of leverage, reflected in its long futures exposure to Index Currencies with a notional value of up to 100% of the Fund&#146;s net asset value and its short futures exposure to Index Currencies with a notional value of up to 100% of the Fund&#146;s net asset value. Under such circumstances, the Fund&#146;s losses would be greater as a result of its leverage than would be the case were it to limit its overall exposure to Index Currencies with a notional value of 100% of the Fund&#146;s net asset value. 

&#160; 

As a result of its use of leverage, the Fund will be required to deposit a greater proportion of its net assets as margin, not expected to exceed 10% of net assets. This represents margin deposit requirements approximately twice as great as would be required if the Fund did not use leverage. Similarly, as a result of its use of leverage, the Fund will trade more futures contracts and incur more brokerage commission expense than it would if it did not use leverage. The additional amount of brokerage commission expense generally will be proportional to the Fund&#146;s leverage ratio. 

The Fund&#146;s portfolio also will include United States Treasury securities and, if applicable, other high credit quality short term fixed income securities for deposit with the Custodian and with the Fund&#146;s Commodity Broker as margin. 

The Trustee 

Under the Fifth Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust and Trust Agreement of the Fund (the &#147;Trust Agreement&#148;), Wilmington Trust Company, the trustee of the Fund (the &#147;Trustee&#148;), has delegated to the Managing Owner the exclusive management and control of all aspects of the business of the Fund. The Trustee will have no duty or liability to supervise or monitor the performance of the Managing Owner, nor will the Trustee have any liability for the acts or omissions of the Managing Owner. The Trustee is compensated by the Managing Owner. Under the Trust Agreement, the Managing Owner, from the assets of the Fund, will indemnify the Trustee for any liability or expense relating to the ongoing operations and termination of the Fund incurred without gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Trustee. 

The Managing Owner 

The Managing Owner was formed on February 7, 2003. The Managing Owner is an affiliate of Invesco Ltd. The Managing Owner was formed to be the managing owner of investment vehicles such as exchange-traded funds and has been managing non-commodity futures based exchange-traded funds since 2003 and a commodity futures based exchange-traded fund since 2014. The Managing Owner serves as the commodity pool operator, commodity trading advisor and swap firm of the Fund. The Managing Owner is registered as a commodity pool operator and commodity trading advisor with the CFTC and is a member of the National Futures Association (the &#147;NFA&#148;). As a registered commodity pool operator and commodity trading advisor, with respect to the Fund, the Managing Owner must comply with various regulatory requirements under the Commodity Exchange Act (the &#147;CEAct&#148;) and the rules and regulations of the CFTC and the NFA, including investor protection requirements, antifraud prohibitions, disclosure requirements, and reporting and recordkeeping requirements. The Managing Owner also is subject to periodic inspections and audits by the CFTC and NFA. 

The Managing Owner has served as the managing owner of the Fund since the Closing Date on February 23, 2015. The Predecessor Managing Owner served as the managing owner of the Fund prior to the Closing Date. 

The Fund pays the Managing Owner a management fee, monthly in arrears, in an amount equal to 0.75% per annum of the daily net asset value of the Fund (the &#147;Management Fee&#148;). The Management Fee is paid in consideration of the Managing Owner&#146;s currency futures trading advisory services. The Managing Owner&#146;s main business offices are located at 3500 Lacey Road, Suite 700, Downers Grove, IL 60515, and its telephone number is (800) 983-0903. For the avoidance of doubt, from inception up to and excluding the Closing Date, all Management Fees were payable to the Predecessor Managing Owner. Since the Closing Date, the Managing Owner has served as managing owner of the Fund and all Management Fee accruals since the Closing Date have been paid to the Managing Owner. 

Pursuant to the Trust Agreement, the Fund will indemnify the Managing Owner against any losses, judgments, liabilities, expenses and amounts paid in settlement of any claims sustained by it in connection with its activities on behalf of the Fund incurred without gross negligence or willful misconduct. 

The Commodity Broker 

Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., a Delaware corporation, serves as the Fund&#146;s clearing broker (the &#147;Commodity Broker&#148;). The Commodity Broker is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Deutsche Bank AG and is an affiliate of the Predecessor Managing Owner. In its capacity as clearing broker, the Commodity Broker may execute or receive transactions executed by others and clears all the Fund&#146;s futures transactions and performs certain administrative and custodial services for the Fund. The Commodity Broker is responsible, among other things, for providing periodic accountings of all dealings and actions taken by the Fund during the reporting period, together with an accounting of all securities, cash or other indebtedness or obligations held by it or its nominees for or on behalf of the Fund. 

A variety of executing brokers execute futures transactions on behalf of the Fund. Such executing brokers &#147;give-up&#148;, or transfer for clearing, all such transactions to the Commodity Broker. The Commodity Broker is registered with the CFTC as a futures commission merchant and is a member of the NFA in such capacity. 

The Fund pays to the Commodity Broker all brokerage commissions, including applicable exchange fees, NFA fees, give-up fees, pit brokerage fees and other transaction related fees and expenses charged in connection with trading activities. The Commodity Broker&#146;s brokerage commissions and trading fees are determined on a contract-by-contract basis. Brokerage commissions and fees in any future fiscal year or any part of any future fiscal year may be greater. On average, total charges paid to the Commodity Broker were less than $6.00, $10.00 and $10.00 per round-turn trade 1 for the Years Ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 

&#160;

1 A round-turn trade is a completed transaction involving both a purchase and a liquidating sale, or a sale followed by a covering purchase. &#160; 

The Administrator, Custodian and Transfer Agent 

The Bank of New York Mellon is the administrator (the &#147;Administrator&#148;) of the Fund and has entered into an Administration Agreement in connection therewith. The Bank of New York Mellon serves as custodian (the &#147;Custodian&#148;) of the Fund and has entered into a Global Custody Agreement (the &#147;Custody Agreement&#148;) in connection therewith. The Bank of New York Mellon serves as the transfer agent (the &#147;Transfer Agent&#148;) of the Fund and has entered into a Transfer Agency and Service Agreement in connection therewith. 

The Bank of New York Mellon, a banking corporation organized under the laws of the State of New York with trust powers, has an office at 101 Barclay Street, New York, New York 10286. The Bank of New York Mellon is subject to supervision by the New York State Banking Department and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 

Pursuant to the Administration Agreement, the Administrator performs or supervises the performance of services necessary for the operation and administration of the Fund (other than making investment decisions), including receiving and processing orders from Authorized Participants to create and redeem Baskets, net asset value calculations, accounting and other fund administrative services. The Administrator retains certain financial books and records, including: Basket creation and redemption books and records, fund accounting records, ledgers with respect to assets, liabilities, capital, income and expenses, the registrar, transfer journals and related details, and trading and related documents received from futures commission merchants. 

The Administration Agreement is continuously in effect unless terminated on at least 90 days&#146; prior written notice by either party to the other party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrator may terminate the Administration Agreement upon 30 days&#146; prior written notice if the Fund has materially failed to perform its obligations under the Administration Agreement. 

The Administration Agreement provides for the exculpation and indemnification of the Administrator from and against any costs, expenses, damages, liabilities or claims (other than those resulting from the Administrator&#146;s own bad faith, negligence or willful misconduct) which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Administrator in performing its obligations or duties under the Administration Agreement. 

The Managing Owner pays the Administrator administrative services fees out of the Management Fee. 

The Administrator and any of its affiliates may from time-to-time purchase or sell Shares for their own account, as agent for their customers and for accounts over which they exercise investment discretion. 

The Administrator receives a transaction processing fee in connection with orders from Authorized Participants to create or redeem Baskets in the amount of $500 per order. These transaction processing fees are paid directly by the Authorized Participants and not by the Fund. 

The Distributor 

ALPS Distributors, Inc. (the &#147;Distributor&#148;) provides certain distribution services to the Fund. Pursuant to the Distribution Services Agreement, the Distributor assists the Managing Owner and the Administrator with certain functions and duties relating to distribution and marketing services to the Fund including reviewing and approving marketing materials. 

The Distribution Services Agreement is terminable without penalty on sixty days&#146; written notice by the Managing Owner or by the Distributor. The Distribution Services Agreement will automatically terminate in the event of its assignment. 

Pursuant to the Distribution Services Agreement, the Fund will indemnify and hold harmless the Distributor and each of its directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls the Distributor within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act, against any loss, liability, claim, damages or expenses (including the reasonable cost of investigating or defending any alleged loss, liability, claim, damages or expense and reasonable counsel fees incurred in connection therewith) arising by reason of any person acquiring any Shares, based upon the ground that the registration statement, prospectus, statement of additional information, shareholder reports or other information filed or made public by the Fund (as from time-to-time amended) included an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated or necessary in order to make the statements not misleading under the 1933 Act or any other statute or the common law. 

The Managing Owner pays the Distributor a distribution fee out of the Management Fee. 

&#160; 

Index Sponsor 

Effective as of the Closing Date, the Managing Owner, on behalf of the Fund, has appointed Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. to serve as the index sponsor (the &#147;Index Sponsor&#148;).

Regulation 

Futures exchanges in the United States are subject to regulation under the CEAct by the CFTC, the governmental agency having responsibility for regulation of futures exchanges and trading on those exchanges. No U.S. governmental agency regulates the over-the-counter (the &#147;OTC&#148;) foreign exchange markets. 

The CEAct and the CFTC also regulate the activities of &#147;commodity trading advisors&#148; and &#147;commodity pool operators&#148; and the CFTC has adopted regulations with respect to certain of such persons&#146; activities. Pursuant to its authority, the CFTC requires a commodity pool operator (such as the Managing Owner) to keep accurate, current and orderly records with respect to each pool it operates. The CFTC may suspend the registration of a commodity pool operator if the CFTC finds that the operator has violated the CEAct or regulations thereunder and in certain other circumstances. Suspension, restriction or termination of the Managing Owner&#146;s registration as a commodity pool operator would prevent it, until such time (if any) as such registration were to be reinstated, from managing, and might result in the termination of, the Fund. The CEAct gives the CFTC similar authority with respect to the activities of commodity trading advisors, such as the Managing Owner. If the registration of a managing owner as a commodity trading advisor were to be terminated, restricted or suspended, the managing owner would be unable, until such time (if any) as such registration were to be reinstated, to render trading advice to the Fund. The Fund is not registered with the CFTC in any capacity. 

The CEAct requires all &#147;futures commission merchants,&#148; such as the Commodity Broker, to meet and maintain specified fitness and financial requirements, segregate customer funds from proprietary funds and account separately for all customers&#146; funds and positions, and to maintain specified books and records open to inspection by the staff of the CFTC. 

The CEAct also gives the states certain powers to enforce its provisions and the regulations of the CFTC. 

Shareholders are afforded certain rights for reparations under the CEAct. Shareholders may also be able to maintain a private right of action for certain violations of the CEAct. The CFTC has adopted rules implementing the reparation provisions of the CEAct which provide that any person may file a complaint for a reparations award with the CFTC for violation of the CEAct against a floor broker, futures commission merchant, introducing broker, commodity trading advisor, commodity pool operator, and their respective associated persons. 

Pursuant to authority in the CEAct, the NFA was formed and registered with the CFTC as a &#147;registered futures association.&#148; At the present time, the NFA is the only non-exchange self-regulatory organization for commodities professionals. NFA members are subject to NFA standards relating to fair trade practices, financial condition, and consumer protection. As the self-regulatory body of the commodities industry, the NFA promulgates rules governing the conduct of commodity professionals and disciplines those professionals who do not comply with such standards. The CFTC has delegated to the NFA responsibility for the registration of commodity trading advisors, commodity pool operators, futures commission merchants, introducing brokers and their respective associated persons and floor brokers. The Commodity Broker and the Managing Owner are members of the NFA (the Fund is not required to become a member of the NFA). 

&#160; 

The CFTC has no authority to regulate trading on foreign commodity exchanges and markets. 

Employees 

The Fund has no employees.
