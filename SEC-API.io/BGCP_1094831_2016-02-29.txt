Our integrated platform is designed to provide flexibility to customers with regard to price discovery, execution and processing of transactions, and enables them to use voice, hybrid, or in many markets, fully electronic brokerage services in connection with transactions executed either over-the-counter (&#147;OTC&#148;) or through an exchange.

&#160;

Our History 

The voice brokerage business within our Financial Services segment originates from one of the oldest and most established inter-dealer franchises in the financial intermediary industry. Cantor started our wholesale intermediary brokerage operations in 1972. In 1996, Cantor launched its eSpeed system, which revolutionized the way government bonds are traded in the inter-dealer market by providing a fully electronic trading marketplace. eSpeed, Inc. (&#147;eSpeed&#148;) completed an initial public offering in 1999 and began trading on NASDAQ, yet it remained one of Cantor&#146;s controlled subsidiaries. Following eSpeed&#146;s initial public offering, Cantor continued to operate its inter-dealer voice brokerage business separately from eSpeed. In August 2004, Cantor announced the reorganization and separation of its inter-dealer voice brokerage business into a subsidiary called &#147;BGC,&#148; in honor of B. Gerald Cantor, the pioneer in screen brokerage services and fixed income market data products. In April 2008, BGC and certain other Cantor assets merged with and into eSpeed, and the combined company began operating under the name &#147;BGC Partners, Inc.&#148; In June 2013, BGC sold certain assets relating to its U.S. Treasury benchmark business and the name &#147;eSpeed&#148; to NASDAQ, Inc. (&#147;NASDAQ,&#148; formerly The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc.) (see &#147;NASDAQ Transaction&#148;). 

Prior to the events of September11, 2001, our financial brokerage business was widely recognized as one of the leading full-service wholesale inter-dealer brokers in the world, with a rich history of developing innovative technological and financial solutions. After September 11, 2001 and the loss of the majority of our U.S.-based employees, our voice financial brokerage business operated primarily in Europe. 

Since the formation of BGC in 2004, we have substantially rebuilt our U.S. presence and have continued to expand our global footprint through the acquisition and integration of established brokerage companies and the hiring of experienced brokers. Through these actions, we have been able to expand our presence in key markets and position our Financial Services business for sustained growth. Recent acquisitions include:

Acquisition of GFI Group Inc. 

On February 26, 2015, we successfully completed our tender offer to acquire shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of GFI for $6.10 per share in cash and accepted for purchase 54.3 million shares tendered to us pursuant to the offer. The Tendered Shares, together with the 17.1 million Shares already owned by us, represented approximately 56% of the then outstanding shares of GFI. We issued payment for the Tendered Shares on March 4, 2015 in the aggregate amount of $331.1 million. 

In connection with the tender offer, on February 19, 2015, we and one of our subsidiaries entered into a Tender Offer Agreement with GFI (the &#147;TO Agreement&#148;). Pursuant to the TO Agreement, the board of directors of GFI unanimously agreed to support our tender offer and to expand GFI&#146;s board and our designation of certain members. The TO Agreement also contained provisions with respect to the terms and timing of the back-end mergers of Jersey Partners Inc. (&#147;JPI&#148;), a stockholder of GFI, and with us. 

Pursuant to the TO Agreement, GFI&#146;s then Executive Chairman, Michael Gooch, and its then Chief Executive Officer, Colin Heffron, remained as directors of GFI. Mr. Heffron entered into an amended and restated GFI employment agreement that continues to provide him with certain annual cash and equity compensation and severance arrangements. Mr. Gooch entered into a fixed-term employment agreement that provides him with certain cash and equity compensation. Pursuant to the TO Agreement, BGC has established a Distributable Earnings Bonus Pool (the &#147;Pool&#148;) program in an amount equal to one times the average annual distributable earnings (as defined) of the GFI inter-dealer brokerage business for the three successive 12-month periods beginning on July 1, 2015. The Pool is in the form of awards of restricted equity units and preferred restricted equity units of BGC Holdings, L.P and will be allocated 35% to Mr. Gooch, 35% to Mr. Heffron and 30% to other GFI employees as mutually agreed by Messrs. Gooch and Heffron and BGC. As a condition to participation in the Pool, each participant (including Messrs. Gooch and Heffron) has entered into a non-competition and award agreement containing the terms and conditions of his or her participation, which terms include the participant&#146;s continued employment through July 1, 2018 and certain other conditions, obligations and covenants (including non-competition, non-solicitation, non-hire non-disclosure provisions). 

On April 28, 2015, one of our subsidiaries purchased from GFI approximately 43.0 million new shares at that date&#146;s closing price of $5.81 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $250 million. The purchase price was paid to GFI in the form of a note due on June 19, 2018 that bears an interest rate of LIBOR plus 200 basis points (the &#147;GFI Note&#148;). Following the issuance of such new shares, we owned approximately 67% of GFI&#146;s then-outstanding common stock. 

On August 24, 2015, GFI, Messrs. Gooch and Heffron; JPI; CME Group, Inc. (&#147;CME&#148;), the former members of the GFI Special Committee, BGC; and certain other former officers and affiliates of GFI entered into a memorandum of understanding (the &#147;MOU&#148;) with regard to a preliminary settlement (the &#147;Settlement&#148;) of the consolidated class action case pending against GFI in the State of Delaware (the &#147;Consolidated Delaware Action&#148;). Neither GFI nor BGC contributed any funds to the Settlement, which will be paid from a combination of insurance proceeds and payments by JPI and Messrs. Gooch and Heffron. The Settlement provides for a settlement fund of $10.75 million for the class of GFI stockholders in the Consolidated Delaware Action and payment of attorneys&#146; fees and costs to plaintiffs&#146; counsel in an amount to be established by negotiation, mediation or a fee application to the Court. The final Settlement will also require approval of the Court. In connection with the Settlement, on October 6, 2015, we advanced $10.75 million to JPI in return for a promissory note (the &#147;JPI Note&#148;). The JPI Note bore interest at the rate of 5.375% per annum and was secured by two million shares of GFI common stock owned by JPI. The JPI Note was repaid on the date of the Back-End Mergers. In the MOU, the CME agreed to terminate the restriction prohibiting former executive officers of GFI, JPI and certain other stockholders and affiliates of GFI from supporting the Back-End Mergers. In connection with the Settlement, Messrs. Gooch and Heffron, JPI, BGC and GFI entered into a separate agreement providing for certain matters relating to the merger of BGC and GFI and allocating certain responsibilities and advancing certain payments (the &#147;Settlement Letter&#148;).The Settlement Letter also included the following agreements: (i) payment of the plaintiffs&#146; attorneys&#146; fees and costs in the Consolidated Delaware Action first from insurance proceeds, with any excess to be paid by Messrs. Gooch and Heffron; (ii) indemnification by Messrs. Gooch and Heffron with respect to liabilities and expenses in the Consolidated Delaware Action and other cases related to breach of fiduciary duty or other causes of action, the CME Merger Agreement, insurance claims and the tender offer to the extent not covered by insurance; and (iii) indemnification by Mr. Gooch with respect to liabilities and expenses in connection with the remaining New York class action case that are not otherwise covered by insurance. 

On December 22, 2015, BGC, JPI, New JP Inc. (&#147;New JPI&#148;), Mr. Gooch, Mr. Heffron, and certain subsidiaries of JPI and BGC entered into a merger agreement providing for the acquisition of JPI by BGC (the &#147;Merger Agreement&#148;). 

On January 12, 2016, the JPI merger (the &#147;JPI Merger&#148;) was closed. Shortly following the completion of the JPI Merger, a subsidiary of BGC merged with and into GFI pursuant to a short-form merger under Delaware law, with GFI continuing as the surviving entity (the &#147;GFI Merger&#148; and, together with the JPI Merger, the &#147;Back-End Mergers&#148;). The Back-End Mergers allowed BGC to acquire the remaining approximately 33 percent of the outstanding shares of GFI common stock that BGC did not already own. Following the closing of the Back-End Mergers, BGC and its affiliates now own 100 percent of the outstanding shares of GFI&#146;s common stock. 

&#160;

Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, certain subsidiaries of BGC merged with and into a subsidiary of New JPI, resulting in BGC owning all of the shares of GFI common stock previously owned by JPI. In the JPI Merger, each holder of JPI common stock, other than Messrs. Gooch and Heffron, received per JPI share held an amount equal to (a) $6.10 multiplied by the number of GFI shares held by JPI, less the principal plus accrued interest on the $10.75 million note issued by JPI to BGC on October 6, 2015, divided by (b) the number of outstanding shares of New JPI common stock. This amount was paid 30 percent in cash and 70 percent in shares of BGC Class A common stock, valued at a price of $9.46 per share of BGC Class A common stock, which was the closing price of BGC Class A common stock on the day prior to the date of the TO Agreement. Messrs. Gooch and Heffron received the same amount per JPI share held, subject to certain adjustments, but were paid 100 percent in shares of BGC Class A common stock. 

In the GFI Merger, each of the remaining outstanding shares of GFI common stock, other than those held by BGC and its subsidiaries, were converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $6.10 per GFI share. Following the closing of the Back-End Mergers, we now own 100% of the shares. 

In total, approximately 23.5 million shares of BGC Class A common stock and $111.3 million in cash are expected to have been issued or paid with respect to the closing of the Back-End Mergers, inclusive of adjustments. The total purchase consideration for all shares of GFI purchased by BGC is expected to be $750.5 million, net of the $250.0 million GFI Note, which is eliminated in consolidation. This figure excludes the $29.0 million gain recorded in the first quarter of 2015 with respect to the appreciation of the 17.1 million shares of GFI held by BGC prior to the successful completion of the tender offer. Including this gain, the calculation of purchase consideration and noncontrolling interest totaled $779.5 million. 

As a condition to closing, Messrs. Gooch and Heffron resigned as directors of the board of directors of GFI. Mr. Gooch retains the titles of Vice Chairman of BGC Partners, L.P. and Chairman of the GFI Division, while Mr. Heffron continues to be the CEO of the GFI Division. 

Trayport Transaction 

On December 11, 2015, certain of our indirect subsidiaries (the &#147;Sellers&#148;) completed the sale (the &#147;Trayport Transaction&#148;) of all of the equity interests in the entities that made up the Trayport business (the &#147;Trayport Business&#148;) to Intercontinental Stock Exchange, Inc. (&#147;ICE&#148;). The Trayport Business was GFI&#146;s European electronic energy software business. The Trayport Transaction occurred pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of November 15, 2015, by and among the Sellers, ICE, and for certain purposes, us and GFI (the &#147;Trayport Purchase Agreement&#148;). At the closing, the Sellers received 2,527,658 shares of ICE common stock. 

Concurrent with the closing, the parties executed certain ancillary agreements, including a transition services agreement, a registration rights agreement with respect to the ICE common stock issued to the Sellers, and an amendment and restatement of the existing Framework Agreement dated September 10, 2015 by and among us, Trayport Limited, and certain affiliates. The amended Framework Agreement has a 10 year term, provides us and our affiliates with a license to use Trayport&#146;s patents, the right to receive contractual terms that are no less favorable than the ones provided by the Trayport Business to another party, provides a framework for the commercial arrangements between us and the Trayport Business and contains certain restrictions on the assignment of such agreement by GFI, us and each of our affiliates to certain enumerated exchanges and competitors of ICE. The Sellers further agreed in the Trayport Purchase Agreement that they will not, subject to certain exceptions, compete with the Trayport Business for two years after closing. 

NASDAQ Transaction 

On June 28, 2013, we completed the sale (the &#147;NASDAQ Transaction&#148;) of certain assets to NASDAQ. At the closing, NASDAQ purchased certain assets and assumed certain liabilities from us and our affiliates, including the eSpeed brand name and various assets comprising the fully electronic portion of our benchmark on-the-run U.S. Treasury brokerage, market data and co-location service businesses (the &#147;Purchased Assets&#148;), for cash consideration of $750 million paid at closing, plus an earn-out of up to 14,883,705 shares of NASDAQ common stock to be paid ratably in each of the fifteen years following the closing. The $750 million in cash paid at closing was subject to adjustment for certain pre-paid amounts and accrued costs and expenses, and the 14,883,705 shares of NASDAQ common stock will be paid ratably in each of the fifteen years following the closing in which the consolidated gross revenue of NASDAQ, as a whole, is equal to or greater than $25 million. On each of November 12, 2013, November 10, 2014 and November 9, 2015, we received 992,247 shares of NASDAQ common stock in accordance with the agreement. The contingent future issuances of NASDAQ common stock are also subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of certain events, including the acquisition by any person of 50% or more of NASDAQ&#146;s stock (including by merger), NASDAQ ceasing to hold Purchased Assets representing 50% or more of the aggregate revenue attributable to the Purchased Assets as of the closing, and the sale of all or substantially all of NASDAQ&#146;s assets, as well as to certain anti-dilution provisions. 

As a result of the NASDAQ Transaction, we only sold our on-the-run, benchmark 2-, 3-, 5-, 7-, 10-, and 30-year fully electronic trading platform for U.S. Treasury notes and bonds. Over time, we had built these six instruments into some of the deepest and most liquid markets in the world. This platform, together with the directly related market data and co-location businesses, generated approximately $99 million 

&#160;

in revenues in 2012 and $48.6 million in revenues in the first six months of 2013. We retained all of our other voice, hybrid, and fully electronic trading, market data, and software businesses, including voice, hybrid and electronic brokerage of off-the-run U.S. Treasuries, as well as Treasury Bills, Treasury Swaps, Treasury Repos, Treasury Spreads, and Treasury Rolls. We also continue to offer voice brokerage for on-the-run U.S. Treasuries. 

Overview of Our Products and Services 

Financial Services 

Financial Brokerage 

We are focused on serving three principal financial brokerage markets: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; traditional, liquid brokerage markets, such as government bonds; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; illiquid markets, such as emerging market bonds and single name credit derivatives; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; targeted local markets throughout the world, such as rates products in Brazil. We provide electronic marketplaces in several financial markets through various products and services, including FENICS, BGC Trader, and several multi-asset hybrid offerings for voice and electronic execution, including BGC&#146;s Volume Match and GFI&#146;s CreditMatch. These electronic marketplaces include government bond markets, interest rate derivatives, spot foreign exchange, foreign exchange derivatives, corporate bonds, and credit derivatives. We believe that we offer a comprehensive application providing volume, access, speed of execution and ease of use. Our trading platform establishes a direct link between our brokers and customers and occupies valuable real estate on traders&#146; desktop, which is difficult to replicate. We believe that we can leverage our platform to offer fully electronic trading as additional products transition from voice and hybrid trading to fully electronic execution. 

We have leveraged our hybrid platform to provide real-time product and pricing information through applications such as BGC Trader. We also provide straight-through processing to our customers for an increasing number of products. Our end-to-end solution includes real-time and auction-based transaction processing, credit and risk management tools and back-end processing and billing systems.

The SEC has granted approval for Aqua to operate an Alternative Trading System in compliance with Regulation ATS. 

Real Estate Services 

Throughout this Form 10-K, we refer to our Real Estate Services business and to NGKF interchangeably. NGKF was formed through the acquisition of Newmark &#38; Company Real Estate, Inc. and certain of its affiliates in October 2011 and the purchase of substantially all of the assets of Grubb &#38; Ellis Company in April 2012. NGKF is a full-service commercial real estate platform that comprises our Real Estate Services segment, offering commercial real estate tenants, owners, investors and developers a wide range of services, including leasing and corporate advisory, investment sales and financial services, consulting, project management, and property and facilities management. 

As of December 31, 2015, we owned and operated over 90 offices in the U.S. We generate revenues from commissions on real estate transactions, management fees on a contractual and per project basis and consulting fees. 

We also have agreements in place to operate on a collaborative and cross-referral basis with certain independently owned offices in the United States and elsewhere in the Americas in return for contractual and referral fees paid to us and/or certain mutually beneficial co-branding and other business arrangements. These independently owned offices generally use some variation of Newmark&#146;s branding in their names and marketing materials. These agreements are normally multi-year contracts, and generally provide for mutual referrals in their respective markets, generating additional contract and brokerage fees. Through these independently-owned offices, our clients have access to additional brokers with local market research capabilities as well as other commercial real estate services in locations where our Real Estate Services business does not have a physical presence. 

Outside of the Americas, we are associated with London-based Knight Frank LLP (&#147;Knight Frank&#148;), which operates on a similar collaborative and cross-referral basis. Knight Frank is a leading independent, global real estate consultancy firm providing integrated prime and commercial real estate services, operating in over 250 key office hubs across Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Australia and Africa. 

NGKF operates under its own brand name as well as variations, such as Newmark Cornish &#38; Carey and ARA, a Newmark Company, in select markets and service lines. NGKF has consistently won a number of U.S. industry awards and accolades in recognition of its performance and achievements. These include:

Customers using our branded products and services also include professional trading firms, futures commission merchants and other professional market participants and financial institutions. Our market data products and services are available through many platforms and are available to a wide variety of capital market participants, including banks, investment banks, brokerage firms, asset managers, hedge funds, investment analysts and financial advisors. We also license our intellectual property portfolio and Software Solutions to various financial markets participants.

Sales and Marketing 

Financial Services 

In our Financial Services segment, our brokers and salespeople are the primary marketing and sales resources to our customers. Thus, our sales and marketing program is aimed at enhancing the ability of our brokers to cross-sell effectively in addition to informing our customers about our product and service offerings. We also employ product teams and business development professionals. We leverage our customer relationships through a variety of direct marketing and sales initiatives and build and enhance our brand image through marketing and communications campaigns targeted at a diverse audience, including traders, potential partners and the investor and media communities. We may also market to our existing and prospective customers through a variety of co-marketing/co-branding initiatives with our partners. 

Our brokerage product team is composed of product managers who are each responsible for a specific part of our brokerage business. The product managers seek to ensure that our brokers, across all regions, have access to technical expertise, support and multiple execution methods in order to grow and market their business. This approach of combining marketing with our product and service strategy has enabled us to turn innovative ideas into both deliverable fully electronic and hybrid solutions, such as BGC Trader, our multi-asset hybrid offering to our customers for voice and electronic execution. 

Our team of business development professionals is responsible for growing our global footprint through raising awareness of our products and services. The business development team markets our products and services to new and existing customers. As part of this process, they analyze existing levels of business with these entities in order to identify potential areas of growth and also to cross-sell our multiple offerings. 

Our market data, software solutions, and post-trade products and services are promoted to our existing and prospective customers through a combination of sales, marketing and co-marketing campaigns. 

Real Estate Services 

Sales and marketing efforts for our Real Estate Services business occur on several interrelated levels. Our Real Estate Services marketing team seeks to develop the NGKF brand and to highlight its expansive platform while reinforcing NGKF&#146;s position as a leading commercial real estate services firm in the U.S. This is accomplished through media relations, industry sponsorships, and sales collateral and targeted advertising in trade and business publications. We believe that an emphasis on our Real Estate Services businesses&#146; unique capabilities and specialty groups, such as Capital Markets, Office, Retail, Industrial, Healthcare, Hospitality and Global Corporate Services, enables us to demonstrate our strengths and differentiate ourselves from our competitors. These multi-market business groups provide customized collateral, website and technology solutions that address specific client needs. On a local level, NGKF offices (including those owned by us and independently-owned offices) have access to tools and templates that arm NGKF sales professionals with the market knowledge we believe is necessary to educate and advise clients, and also to bring properties to market quickly and effectively. This includes proprietary research and analyses, web-based marketing systems, and ongoing communications and training about the firm&#146;s depth and breadth of services. Our Real Estate Services business provides marketing services and materials to certain independently owned offices as part of their overall agreement allowing them to use NGKF&#146;s branding. We also benefit from shared referrals and materials from local offices. 

&#160;

Technology 

Financial Services Technology 

Pre-Trade Technology. Our financial brokers use a suite of pricing and analytical tools that have been developed both in-house and in cooperation with specialist software suppliers. The pre-trade software suite combines proprietary market data, pricing and calculation libraries, together with those outsourced from what we believe to be the best-of-breed providers in the sector. The tools in turn publish to a normalized, global market data distribution platform, allowing prices and rates to be distributed to our proprietary network, data vendor pages, secure websites and trading applications as indicative pricing. 

Inter-Dealer and Wholesale Trading Technology. We utilize a sophisticated proprietary electronic trading platform to provide execution and market data services to our customers. The services are available through our proprietary API, FIX and a multi-asset proprietary trading platform, operating under names including BGC Trader, CreditMatch and FENICS. This platform presently supports a wide and constantly expanding range of products and services, which includes FX Options, European corporate bonds, European CDS, interest rate swaps in multiple currencies, US REPO, TIPS, MBS, and other products. Every product on the platform is supported in either view-only, hybrid/managed or fully electronic mode, and can be transitioned from one mode to the next in response to market demands. The flexible BGC technology stack is designed to support feature-rich workflows required by the hybrid mode as well as delivering high throughput and low transaction latency required by the fully-electronic mode. Trades executed by our customers in any mode are eligible for immediate electronic confirmation through direct straight-through processing (&#147;STP&#148;) links as well as STP hubs. The BGC trading platform services are operated out of several globally distributed data centers and delivered to customers over BGC&#146;s global private network, third-party connectivity providers as well as the Internet. BGC&#146;s proprietary graphical user interfaces and the API/FIX connectivity are deployed at hundreds of major banks and institutions and service thousands of users. 

Post-Trade Technology. Our platform automates previously paper and telephone-based transaction processing, confirmation and other functions, substantially improving and reducing the cost of many of our customers&#146; back offices and enabling STP. In addition to our own system, confirmation and trade processing is also available through third-party hubs, including Swapswire, T-Zero, Reuters RTNS, Logicscope and STP in FIX for various banks. 

We have electronic connections to most mainstream clearinghouses, including The Depository Trust &#38; Clearing Corporation (&#147;DTCC&#148;), CLS Group, Euroclear, Clearstream, Monte Titoli, LCH.Clearnet, Eurex Clearing, CME Clearing and the Options Clearing Corporation (&#147;OCC&#148;). As more products become centrally cleared, and as our customers request that we use a particular venue, we expect to expand the number of clearinghouses to which we connect in the future. 

Systems Architecture. Our systems consist of layered components, which provide matching, credit management, market data distribution, position reporting, customer display and customer integration. The private network currently operates from three concurrent core data centers (two of which are in London and one of which is in Trumbull, Connecticut) and six hub cities throughout the world acting as distribution points for all private network customers. After June 2015, we transferred the Rochelle Park data center to a co-location center in Weehawken, New Jersey. Our network hubs beyond the core data centers are in Chicago, Hong Kong, S&#259;o Paolo, Singapore, Tokyo and Toronto. The redundant structure of our system provides multiple backup paths and re-routing of data transmission in the event of failure. 

In addition to our own network system, we also receive and distribute secure trading information from customers using the services of multiple, major Internet service providers throughout the world. These connections enable us to offer our products and services via the Internet to our global customers. 

Software Development 

We devote substantial efforts to the development and improvement of our hybrid and electronic marketplaces and licensed software products and services. We work with our customers to identify their specific requirements and make modifications to our software, network distribution systems and technologies that are responsive to those needs. Our efforts focus on internal development, strategic partnering, acquisitions and licensing. As of December 31, 2015, we employed over 400 technology professionals. 

Our Intellectual Property 

We have adopted a comprehensive intellectual property program to protect our proprietary technology. We currently have licenses covering various Cantor patents in the United States, including patents relating to (i) a system and method for auction-based trading of specialized items such as fixed income instruments and (ii) a fixed income portfolio index processor. Foreign counterpart applications for some of these U.S. patents have been filed. 

We also have agreements to license technology that may be covered by several pending and/or issued U.S. patent applications relating to various aspects of our electronic trading systems, including both functional and design aspects. We have filed a number of patent applications to further protect our proprietary technology and innovations, and have received patents for some of those applications. 

Our patent portfolio is growing and consists of numerous patents and patent applications relating to our core businesses and to other businesses. We continue to look for opportunities to license and/or otherwise monetize these and other patents in our portfolio. 

&#160;

Credit Risk 

Credit risk arises from potential non-performance by counterparties and customers. We have established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to credit risk. We maintain a thorough credit approval process to limit exposure to counterparty risk and employ stringent monitoring to control the counterparty risk from our matched principal and agency businesses. Our account opening and counterparty approval process includes verification of key customer identification, anti-money laundering verification checks and a credit review of financial and operating data. The credit review process includes establishing an internal credit rating and any other information deemed necessary to make an informed credit decision, which may include correspondence, due diligence calls and a visit to the entity&#146;s premises, as necessary. 

Credit approval is granted subject to certain trading limits and may be subject to additional conditions, such as the receipt of collateral or other credit support. Ongoing credit monitoring procedures include reviewing periodic financial statements and publicly available information on the client and collecting data from credit rating agencies, where available, to assess the ongoing financial condition of the client. 

Principal Transaction Risk 

Through our subsidiaries, we execute matched principal transactions in which we act as a &#147;middleman&#148; by serving as counterparty to both a buyer and a seller in matching back-to-back trades. These transactions are then settled through a recognized settlement system or third-party clearing organization. Settlement typically occurs within one to three business days after the trade date. Cash settlement of the transaction occurs upon receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was traded. We generally avoid settlement of principal transactions on a free-of-payment basis or by physical delivery of the underlying instrument. However, free-of-payment transactions may occur on a very limited basis. 

The number of matched principal trades we execute has continued to grow as compared to prior years. Receivables from broker-dealers and clearing organizations and payables to broker-dealers and clearing organizations on our consolidated statements of financial condition primarily represent the simultaneous purchase and sale of the securities associated with those matched principal transactions that have not settled as of their stated settlement dates. Our experience has been that substantially all of these transactions ultimately settle at the contracted amounts. 

Market Risk 

Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices or other factors will result in losses for a specified position. In our Financial Services business, we may allow certain of our desks to enter into unmatched principal transactions in the ordinary course of business and hold long and short inventory positions. These transactions are primarily for the purpose of managing proprietary positions, facilitating clients&#146; execution needs, adding liquidity to a market or attracting additional order flow. As a result, we may have market risk exposure on these transactions. Our exposure varies based on the size of our overall positions, the risk characteristics of the instruments held and the amount of time the positions are held before they are disposed of. We have limited ability to track our exposure to market risk and unmatched positions on an intra-day basis; however, we attempt to mitigate market risk on these positions by strict risk limits, extremely limited holding periods and hedging our exposure. These positions are intended to be held short term to facilitate customer transactions. However, due to a number of factors, including the nature of the position and access to the market on which it trades, we may not be able to unwind the position and we may be forced to hold the position for a longer period than anticipated. All positions held longer than intra-day are marked to market. 

We also have investments in marketable equity securities, which are publicly traded, and which had a fair value of $650.4 million as of December 31, 2015. These include the shares of common stock of NASDAQ that we received in exchange for a portion of our electronic benchmark Treasury platform and the shares of the common stock of ICE that we received in exchange for Trayport. Investments in marketable securities carry a degree of risk, as there can be no assurance that the marketable securities will not lose value and, in general, securities markets can be volatile and unpredictable. As a result of these different market risks, our holdings of marketable securities could be materially and adversely affected. We seek to minimize the effect of price changes on a portion of our investments in marketable securities through the use of derivative contracts. However, there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will be adequate to protect us against price risks associated with our investments in marketable securities. See Note 10&#151;&#147;Marketable Securities&#148; and Note 12&#151;&#147;Derivatives&#148; to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding these investments and related hedging activities. 

Our risk management procedures and strict limits are designed to monitor and limit the risk of unintended loss and have been effective in the past. However, there is no assurance that these procedures and limits will be effective at limiting unanticipated losses in the future. Adverse movements in the securities positions or a downturn or disruption in the markets for these positions could result in a substantial loss. In addition, principal gains and losses resulting from these positions could on occasion have a disproportionate effect, positive or negative, on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for any particular reporting period. 

&#160;

Operational Risk 

Our Financial Services businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process a large number of transactions across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies on a daily basis. If any of our data processing systems does not operate properly or is disabled or if there are other shortcomings or failures in our internal processes, people or systems, we could suffer impairment to our liquidity, financial loss, a disruption of our businesses, liability to clients, regulatory intervention or reputational damage. These systems may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, including a disruption of electrical or communications services or our inability to occupy one or more of our buildings. The inability of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions could also constrain our ability to expand our businesses. 

In addition, despite our contingency plans, our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which they are located. This may include a disruption involving electrical, communications, transportation or other services used by us or third parties with whom we conduct business. 

Further, our operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information on our computer systems and networks. Although we take protective measures such as software programs, firewalls and similar technology to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our and our clients&#146; information, the nature of the threats continue to evolve. As a result, our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, loss or destruction of data (including confidential client information), account takeovers, unavailability or disruption of service, computer viruses, acts of vandalism, or other malicious code, cyber-attacks and other events that could have an adverse security impact. There have also been an increasing number of malicious cyber incidents in recent years in various industries, including ours. Any such cyber incidents involving our computer systems and networks, or those of third parties important to our businesses, could present risks to our operations. 

Foreign Currency Risk 

We are exposed to risks associated with changes in foreign exchange rates. Changes in foreign currency rates create volatility in the U.S. dollar equivalent of our revenues and expenses in particular with regard to British Pounds and Euros. In addition, changes in the remeasurement of our foreign currency denominated net assets are recorded as part of our results of operations and fluctuate with changes in foreign currency rates. We monitor the net exposure in foreign currencies on a daily basis and may hedge our exposure as deemed appropriate with highly rated major financial institutions. 

Interest Rate Risk 

We had $840.9 million in fixed-rate debt outstanding as of December 31, 2015. These debt obligations are not currently subject to fluctuations in interest rates, although in the event of refinancing or issuance of new debt, such debt could be subject to changes in interest rates. 

Disaster Recovery 

Our processes address disaster recovery concerns. We operate most of our technology from dual-primary data centers at our two different London locations. Either site alone is capable of running all of our essential systems. In addition, we maintain technology operations from data centers in New Jersey and Connecticut. Replicated instances of this technology are maintained in our London data centers. All data centers are built and equipped to best-practice standards of physical security with appropriate environmental monitoring and safeguards. Failover for the majority of our systems is automated. 

Competition 

Financial Services 

We encounter competition in all aspects of our businesses. In our Financial Services businesses, we compete primarily with other inter-dealer or wholesale brokers, including for brokers, salespeople, and suitable acquisition candidates. Our existing and potential competitors are numerous and include other inter-dealer brokerage firms, multi-dealer trading companies, financial technology companies and market data and information vendors, securities and futures exchanges, electronic communications networks, crossing systems, software companies, consortia, business-to-business marketplace infrastructure companies and niche market energy and other commodity Internet-based trading systems. 

Inter-Dealer or Wholesale Financial Brokers 

Our Financial Services segment primarily competes with three major, diversified inter-dealer and/or wholesale financial brokers. These include ICAP plc (&#147;ICAP&#148;), Tullett Prebon plc (&#147;Tullett&#148;) and Compagnie Financi&#232;re Tradition (which is majority owned by Viel &#38; Cie) (&#147;Tradition&#148;), all of which are currently publicly traded companies. Other such competitors include a number of smaller, private firms that tend to specialize in specific product areas or geographies. In November 2015, ICAP and Tullett announced an agreement whereby Tullett will purchase ICAP&#146;s global hybrid voice brokering and information business. On January 12, 2016, we completed the merger with GFI by acquiring 100% of GFI&#146;s outstanding shares. See &#147;Item 1-Acquisition of GFI Group Inc.&#148; On January 15, 2015 we entered into a settlement agreement with Tullett that resolved all 10 outstanding lawsuits between the two companies. In exchange for our settlement payment, we agreed with Tullett for a period of one year not to hire senior employees, including desk heads, of the other party and its subsidiaries. This agreement expired in January 2016. 

&#160;

Demand for services of brokers is directly affected by national and international economic and political conditions, broad trends in business and finance, the level and volatility of interest rates, changes in and uncertainty regarding tax laws and substantial fluctuations in the volume and price levels of securities transactions. Other significant factors affecting competition in the brokerage industry are the quality and ability of professional personnel, the depth and pricing efficiency of the markets in which the brokers transact, the strength of the technology used to service and execute on those markets and the relative prices of products and services offered by the brokers and by competing markets and trading processes. 

Market Data and Financial Software Vendors 

The majority of our large inter-dealer and wholesale financial broker competitors also sell proprietary market data and information, which competes with our market data offerings. In addition to direct sales, we resell market data through large market data and information providers. These companies have established significant presences on the vast majority of trading desks in our industry. Some of these market data and information providers, such as Bloomberg L.P. and Thomson Reuters Corporation, include in their product mix electronic trading and execution of both OTC and listed products in addition to their traditional market data offerings. 

Exchanges and Other Trading Platforms 

Although our businesses will often use exchanges to execute transactions brokered in both listed and OTC markets, we believe that exchanges have sought and will seek to migrate products traditionally traded in OTC markets by inter-dealer and/or wholesale financial brokers to exchanges. However, we believe that when a product goes from OTC to exchange-traded, the underlying or related OTC market often continues to experience growth in line with the growth of the exchange-traded contract. In addition, ICE operates both regulated exchanges and OTC execution services, and in the latter it competes directly with inter-dealer and/or wholesale financial brokers in energy, commodities, and credit products. ICE entered these OTC markets primarily by acquiring independent OTC brokers, and we believe that it is likely ICE or other exchange operators may seek to compete with us in the future by acquiring other such brokers, by creating futures products designed to mimic OTC products, or through other means. Further, ICE also operates a swap execution facility (&#147;SEF&#148;), as does Tradeweb Markets LLC (&#147;Tradeweb&#148;) and we expect that other exchanges may also seek to do so. 

In addition to exchanges, other electronic trading platforms which currently operate in the dealer-to-client markets, including those run by MarketAxess Holdings Inc., have stated an intention to compete with us in the inter-dealer markets. At the same time, we have begun to offer an increasing number of our services to the customers of firms like MarketAxess. 

In connection with the NASDAQ Transaction, we agreed that, for three years after the closing, we and Cantor will not engage in the business of fully electronic brokerage of benchmark on-the-run U.S. Treasuries and certain transactions in first off-the-run U.S. Treasuries, subject to certain exceptions. See &#147;NASDAQ Transaction.&#148; Certain subsidiaries of GFI agreed that, for two years after the closing of the Trayport Transaction, they will not provide software to operate a trading network for certain energy commodities in Europe, substantially as conducted by the Trayport Business at closing, subject to certain exceptions. 

Banks and Broker-Dealers 

Banks and broker-dealers have in the past created and/or funded consortia to compete with exchanges and inter-dealer brokers. For example, ICAP plc&#146;s inter-dealer businesses for fully electronic trading of U.S. Treasuries and spot foreign exchange both began as dealer-owned consortia before being acquired by ICAP plc. An example of a current and similar consortium is Tradeweb. Currently, several large banks hold stakes in Tradeweb, an Internet-based market intermediary. Thomson Reuters Corporation is Tradeweb&#146;s single largest shareholder. Although Tradeweb operates primarily as a dealer to customer platform, some of its offerings include a voice and electronic inter-dealer platform and a SEF. In addition, Tradeweb&#146;s management has said that it would like to expand into other inter-dealer markets, and as such may compete with us in other areas over time. 

In addition, certain investment management firms that traditionally deal with banks and broker-dealers have expressed a desire to have direct access to certain parts of the wholesale financial markets via firms such as ours. We believe that over time, interdealer-brokers will therefore gain a small percentage of the sales and trading market currently dominated by banks and broker-dealers. Since their collective revenues are many times those of the global inter-dealer market, we believe that our gaining a small share of banks and broker-dealers&#146; revenues would lead to a meaningful increase in our Financial Services revenues. 

Overall, we believe that we may also face future competition from market data and technology companies and some securities brokerage firms, some of which are currently our customers, as well as from any future strategic alliances, joint ventures or other partnerships created by one or more of our potential or existing competitors. 

&#160;

Real Estate Services 

In our Real Estate Services segment, we compete across a variety of business disciplines within the commercial real estate industry, including commercial property and corporate facilities management, occupier and property/agency leasing, property sales, valuation, capital markets (equity and debt) solutions, development services and proprietary research. Each business discipline is highly competitive on a national, regional and local level. Depending on the geography, property type or service, we face competition from other commercial real estate service providers, including outsourcing companies that traditionally competed in limited portions of our real estate management services business and have recently expanded their offerings. These include companies such as Aramark, ISS A/S, and ABM Industries. We also compete with in-house corporate real estate departments; developers; institutional lenders; insurance companies; investment banking firms; investment managers; and accounting and consulting firms in various parts of our business. Despite recent consolidation, the commercial real estate services industry remains highly fragmented and competitive. Although many of our competitors are local or regional firms and are smaller than us, some of these competitors are more entrenched on a local or regional basis. We are also subject to competition from other large multi-national firms that have similar service competencies to ours, including CBRE Group, Inc., Jones Lang LaSalle Inc., Cushman &#38; Wakefield (majority-owned by TPG Capital), and Colliers International. In addition, more specialized firms like HFF, Inc. and Eastdil Secured LLC (part of Wells Fargo &#38; Company) compete with us in certain areas. 

Partnership Overview 

We believe that our partnership structure is one of the unique strengths of our business. Many of our key brokers, salespeople and other front office professionals have their own capital invested in our business, aligning their interests with our stockholders. Limited partnership interests in BGC Holdings consist of: (i) &#147;founding/working partner units&#148; held by limited partners who are employees; (ii) &#147;limited partnership units,&#148; which consist of a variety of units that are generally held by employees such as REUs, RPUs, PSUs, PSIs, PSEs, LPUs, APSUs, APSIs, APSEs, AREUs, ARPUs and NPSUs; (iii) &#147;Cantor units&#148; which are the exchangeable limited partnership interests held by Cantor entities; and (iv) preferred partnership units (&#147;Preferred Units&#148;), which are working partner units that may be awarded to holders of, or contemporaneous with, the grant of REUs, RPUs, PSUs, PSIs, PSEs, LPUs, APSUs, APSIs, APSEs, AREUs, ARPUs and NPSUs. For further details, see &#147;Our Organizational Structure.&#148; We also have NPSUs, which are partnership units that are not entitled to participate in partnership distributions, not allocated any items of profit or loss and may not be exchangeable into shares of our common stock. Subject to the approval of the Compensation Committee or its designee, NPSUs are expected to be converted into the underlying unit type and will then participate in Partnership distributions, subject to terms and conditions determined by the General Partner of the Partnership in its sole discretion, including that the recipient continue to provide substantial services to the Company and comply with his or her partnership obligations. In addition, we have NREUs, NPREUs, NLPUs, NPLPUs and NPPSUs (collectively, the &#147;N Units&#148;) which are non-distributing partnership units that may not be allocated any item of profit or loss and may not be made exchangeable into shares of our Class A common stock. Subject to the approval of the Compensation Committee or its designee, the N Units are expected to be converted into the underlying unit type (i.e., an NREU will be converted into an REU) and then participate in Partnership distributions, subject to terms and conditions determined by the General Partner of the Partnership in its sole discretion, including that the recipient continue to provide substantial services to us and comply with his or her partnership obligations. 

We believe that our partnership structure is an effective tool in recruiting, motivating and retaining key employees. Many brokers are attracted by the opportunity to become partners because the partnership agreement generally entitles partners to quarterly distributions of income from the partnership. While BGC Holdings limited partnership interests generally entitle our partners to participate in distributions of income from the operations of our business, upon leaving BGC Holdings (or upon any other redemption or purchase of such limited partnership interests as described below), any such partners are only entitled to receive over time, and provided he or she does not violate certain partner obligations, an amount for his or her BGC Holdings limited partnership interests that reflects such partner&#146;s capital account or compensatory grant awards, excluding any goodwill or going concern value of our business unless Cantor, in the case of the founding partners, and we, as the general partner of BGC Holdings, otherwise determine. Our partners can receive the right to exchange their BGC Holdings limited partnership interests for shares of our Class A common stock (if, in the case of founding partners, Cantor so determines and, in the case of working partners and limited partnership unit holders, the BGC Holdings general partner, with Cantor&#146;s consent, determines otherwise) and thereby realize any higher value associated with our Class A common stock. We believe that, having invested in us, partners feel a sense of responsibility for the health and performance of our business and have a strong incentive to maximize our revenues and profitability.

Regulation 

Financial Services 

U.S. Regulation 

The financial services industry in the United States is subject to extensive regulation under both federal and state laws. As registered broker-dealers and a Futures Commissions Merchant, certain of our subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations which cover all aspects of financial services, including sales methods, trade practices, use and safekeeping of customers&#146; funds and securities, minimum capital requirements, recordkeeping, business practices, securities lending and financing of securities purchases and the conduct of associated persons. We and our subsidiaries also are subject to the various anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Commodity Exchange Act, certain state securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. We also may be subject to vicarious and controlling person liability for the activities of our subsidiaries and our officers, employees and affiliated persons. 

&#160;

The SEC is the federal agency primarily responsible for the administration of federal securities laws, including adopting rules and regulations applicable to broker-dealers (other than government securities broker-dealers) and enforcing both its rules regarding broker-dealers and the Treasury&#146;s rules regarding government securities broker-dealers. In addition, we operate a number of platforms that are governed pursuant to SEC Regulation ATS. Broker-dealers are also subject to regulation by state securities administrators in those states in which they conduct business or have registered to do business. In addition, Treasury rules relating to trading government securities apply to such activities when engaged in by broker-dealers. The Commodities Futures Trading Commission (the &#147;CFTC&#148;) is the federal agency primarily responsible for the administration of federal commodities future laws and other acts, including the adoption of rules applicable to Futures Commissions Merchants, Designated Contract Markets (&#147;DCM&#148;) such as ELX, and Swap Execution Facilities (&#147;SEF&#148;) such as BGC Derivative Markets, L.P. and GFI Swaps Exchange LLC. 

Much of the regulation of broker-dealers&#146; operations in the United States has been delegated to self-regulatory organizations. These self-regulatory organizations adopt rules (which are subject to approval by the SEC) that govern the operations of broker-dealers and government securities broker-dealers and conduct periodic inspections and examinations of their operations. In the case of our U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries, the principal self-regulatory organization is FINRA. FINRA was formed from the consolidation of the NASD&#146;s member regulation operations and the regulatory arm of the NYSE Group to act as the self-regulatory organization for all broker-dealers doing business within the United States. Accordingly, our U.S. subsidiaries are subject to both scheduled and unscheduled examinations by the SEC and FINRA. In our futures-related activities, our subsidiaries are also subject to the rules of the CFTC, futures exchanges of which they are members and the National Futures Association (&#147;NFA&#148;), a futures self-regulatory organization. 

The changing regulatory environment, new laws that may be passed by Congress, and rules that may be promulgated by the SEC, the Treasury, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the CFTC, the NFA, FINRA and other self-regulatory organizations, or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules, if adopted, may directly affect our operations and profitability and those of our competitors and customers and of the securities markets in which we participate in a way that could adversely affect our businesses. 

The SEC, self-regulatory organizations and state securities administrators conduct informal and formal investigations of possible improprieties or illegal action by broker-dealers and their &#147;associated persons,&#148; which could be followed by the institution of administrative, civil and/or criminal proceedings against broker-dealers and/or &#147;associated persons.&#148; Among the sanctions that may result if administrative, civil or criminal proceedings were ever instituted against us or our &#147;associated persons&#148; are injunctions, censure, fines, penalties, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders or suspension or expulsion from the industry and, in rare instances, even imprisonment. The principal purpose of regulating and disciplining broker-dealers is to protect customers and the securities markets, rather than to protect broker-dealers or their creditors or equity holders. From time to time, our &#147;associated persons&#148; have been and are subject to routine investigations, none of which to date have had a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. 

In light of recent events in the U.S. and global financial markets, regulators and legislators in the U.S. and European Union (&#147;EU&#148;) continue to craft new laws and regulations for the global OTC derivatives markets, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#147;Dodd-Frank Act&#148;), which became law in July 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act mandates or encourages several reforms regarding derivatives, including new regulations for swaps markets creating impartiality considerations, additional pre- and post-trade transparency requirements, and heightened collateral or capital standards, as well as recommendations for the obligatory use of central clearing for most standardized derivatives. The law also requires that standardized OTC derivatives be traded in an open and non-exclusionary manner on a DCM or a SEF. The SEC is still in the process of finalizing rules for the implementation of these requirements and it is anticipated that the SEC will release their rule set surrounding SEFs in the first half of 2016. The actual implementation of such rules may be phased in over a longer period. 

Similarly, while the recently adopted Volcker Rule will not apply directly to us, the Volcker Rule may have a material impact on many of the banking and other institutions with which we do business or compete. There may be continued uncertainty regarding the Volcker Rule, its impact on various affected businesses, how those businesses will respond to it, and the effect that it will have on the markets in which we do business. 

BGC Derivative Markets, L.P. (&#147;BGC Derivative Markets&#148;), and GFI Swaps Exchange LLC, our subsidiaries, began operating as SEFs on October 2, 2013. Both BGC Derivative Markets and GFI Swaps Exchange received permanent registration approval from the CFTC as SEFs on January 22, 2016. Mandatory Dodd-Frank Act compliant execution on SEFs by eligible U.S. persons commenced in February 2014 for &#147;made available to trade&#148; products, and a wide range of other rules relating to the execution and clearing of derivative products have been finalized with implementation periods in 2016 and beyond. BGC also maintains its ownership stake in ELX, a CFTC-approved DCM. We believe that our relative competitive position is strong in this new environment, and that we will gain market share in the U.S. This is because the new rules not only require OTC market execution venues to maintain robust front-end and back-office IT capabilities and to make large and ongoing technology investments, but also because recent revisions to the execution methodology rules will allow elements of voice brokerage to flourish. We are a leader in both the breadth and scale of our hybrid and fully electronic trading capability, and we expect to outperform our competitors in such an environment. 

&#160;

U.K. and European Regulation 

The Financial Conduct Authority (&#147;FCA&#148;) is the relevant statutory regulator for the United Kingdom financial services industry. The FCA was established in 2013, and superseded the former regulatory agency, the Financial Services Authority (&#147;FSA&#148;). The FCA&#146;s objectives are to protect customers, maintain the stability of the financial services industry and promote competition between financial services providers. It has broad rule-making, investigative and enforcement powers derived from the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and subsequent and derivative legislation and regulations. 

The FCA has continued to implement the far-reaching reform rules initiated by the FSA, that are designed to enhance firms&#146; liquidity risk management practices, based on the lessons learned since the start of the credit crisis in 2007, as well as a regulatory model with a clear internal separation of conduct of business and prudential regulation. Implications of these rules include better liquidity risk management capability (including the use of stress testing and contingency funding plans (&#147;CFP&#148;), less reliance on short-term wholesale funding, and a heightened reliance on higher amounts and quality of liquid asset securities (such as government securities), leading to an increased likelihood of surviving a severe liquidity stress event with the overarching principles being self-sufficiency and adequacy of liquid resources. Currently, we have subsidiaries and branches regulated by the FCA (BGC Brokers L.P., the U.K. branch of Aurel BGC, GFI Securities Ltd. and GFI Brokers Limited). 

From time to time, we have been and are subject to periodic examinations, inspections and investigations, including periodic risk assessment and related reviews of our U.K. group. As a result of such reviews, we may be required to include or enhance certain regulatory structures and frameworks in our operating procedures, systems and controls. We are also required to obtain approval from the FCA to acquire control of U.K. regulated firms. See &#147;Acquisition of GFI Group Inc.&#148; 

On November 19, 2014, we announced that we had resolved matters with the FCA regarding our acquisition of a stake in GFI Group exceeding 10% without first informing and seeking the approval of the FCA in breach of certain U.K. controller requirements. This was a breach of U.K. regulatory law. The FCA had taken the view that it was not appropriate in this specific case for it to take any formal action. On November 19, 2014, we also announced that we had received approval from the FCA to acquire control of GFI and thereby take control of the U.K. regulated firms within GFI. We have also received similar approvals in Hong Kong and Singapore. Additional approvals were granted in connection with the Back-End Mergers in December 2015. See &#147;Acquisition of GFI Group Inc.&#148; 

Increasingly, the FCA has developed a practice of requiring senior officers of regulated firms to provide individual attestations or undertakings as to the status of the firm&#146;s control environment, compliance with specific rules and regulations, or the completion of required tasks. Officers of BGC Brokers L.P. and GFI Brokers Limited have given such attestations or undertakings in the past and may do so again in the future. Similarly, the FCA can seek a voluntary requirement notice (&#147;VREQ&#148;), which is a voluntary undertaking on behalf of a firm that is made publicly available on the FCA&#146;s website. In 2014, the FCA issued industry-wide interpretive guidance on the management of potential conflicts pursuant to the VREQ process. 

Recent European Regulatory Developments 

The European Market Infrastructure Regulation on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories (&#147;EMIR&#148;) was adopted in July 2012. EMIR fulfills several of the EU&#146;s G20 commitments to reform OTC derivatives markets. The reforms are designed to reduce systemic risk and bring more transparency to both OTC and listed derivatives markets. EMIR derivatives rules will apply initially to financial and non-financial firms that are counterparties to derivatives contracts in the EU and later to those trading outside the EU under certain circumstances. 

The first compliance obligations for EMIR came into force in mid-March 2013 with the adoption of certain regulatory technical standards and implementing technical standards which included timely confirmations. Risk mitigation techniques for uncleared OTC derivatives became effective September 15, 2013 and comprised ISDA portfolio reconciliation, dispute resolution and disclosure protocol. The trade reporting for OTC derivative contracts to be reported to a Trade Repository (&#147;TR&#148;) came into effect in phases during February to August 2014. By February 2017, all OTC derivative contracts entered into before or after August 16, 2012 and no longer outstanding as of February 12, 2014 are to be reported to a TR. In October 2014, the European Commission adopted its first &#147;equivalence&#148; decisions for the regulatory regimes of central counterparties in Australia, Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore. The central counterparties in these third country jurisdictions will be able to obtain recognition in the EU and can therefore be used by market participants to clear standardized OTC derivatives as required by EU legislation, while remaining subject solely to the regulation and supervision of their home jurisdiction. In July 2013, the European Commission and the CFTC announced the &#147;Path Forward&#148; on the alignment of OTC derivatives regulations between the two jurisdictions. For the EU, this involves the implementation of EMIR and proposed amendments to the European Commission&#146;s Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (&#147;MiFID&#148;). 

Along with the implementation of EMIR reporting requirements, the Regulation on Wholesale Energy Markets Integrity and Transparency (&#147;REMIT&#148;) Implementation Acts became effective on January 7, 2015. The REMIT Implementing Acts developed by the European Commission define the details of reporting under REMIT, drawing up the list of reportable contracts and derivatives; defining details, timing and form of reporting, and establishing harmonized rules to report that information to the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (&#147;ACER&#148;). They enable ACER to collect information in relation to wholesale energy market transactions and 

&#160;

fundamentals through the Agency&#146;s REMIT Information System (ARIS), to analyze this data to detect market abuse and to report suspicious events to the National Competent Authorities, which are responsible for investigating these matters further, and if required, imposing sanctions. Market participants and third parties reporting on their behalf have had to: (i) by October 7, 2015, report transactions executed at organized market places and fundamental data from the central information transparency platforms; and (ii) by April 7, 2016, report transactions in the remaining wholesale energy contracts (OTC standard and non-standard supply contracts, transportation contracts) and additional fundamental data. 

To achieve a high level of harmonization and convergence in regular supervisory reporting requirements, the Committee of European Banking Supervisors (&#147;CEBS&#148;) issued guidelines on prudential reporting with the aim of developing a supervisory reporting framework based on common formats, known as COREP. COREP has become part of European Banking Authorities&#146; implementing technical standards on reporting. In addition, guidelines on Financial Reporting covering consolidated and sub-consolidated financial reporting for supervisory purposes based on International Financial Reporting Standards are being developed, known as FINREP. These initiatives will impact the nature, timing and extent of regulatory reporting for our European regulated group. 

Basel III (or the Third Basel Accord) is a global regulatory standard on bank capital adequacy, stress testing and market liquidity risk scheduled to be introduced by bank regulators in most, if not all, of the world&#146;s major economies by 2019. Basel III is designed to strengthen bank capital requirements and introduces new regulatory requirements on bank liquidity and bank leverage. The adoption of these proposed rules could restrict the ability of our large bank and broker-dealer customers to operate proprietary trading businesses and to maintain current capital market exposures under the present structure of their balance sheets, and will cause these entities to need to raise additional capital in order to stay active in our marketplaces. 

Much of our global derivatives volumes continue to be executed by non-U.S.-based clients outside the U.S. and subject to local prudential regulations. As such, we also continue to operate our Multilateral Trading Facility (&#147;MTF&#148;) in accordance with EU directives as licensed by the FCA. The final draft of the European Commission&#146;s Markets in Financial Instruments Directive Level 2 Regulatory Technical Standards (&#147;MiFID II&#148;) was published by the European Securities and Markets Authority (&#147;ESMA&#148;) in September 2015 where implementation is now expected to commence in January 2018. MiFID II will have a particularly significant impact in a number of key areas, including corporate governance, transaction reporting, pre- and post-trade transparency, technology synchronization, best execution and investor protection. MiFID II will also introduce a new regulated execution venue category known as the Organized Trading Facility (&#147;OTF&#148;) and there is currently expected to be a joint equivalence assessment by EU and non-EU jurisdictions for granting mutual access to their respective domestic marketplaces. 

We are unable to predict how any of these new laws and proposed rules and regulations will be implemented or in what form, or whether any additional or similar changes to statutes or rules and regulations, including the interpretation or implementation thereof, will occur in the future. Any such action could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways, subject us to the risk of fines, sanctions, enhanced oversight, increased financial and capital requirements and additional restrictions or limitations on our ability to conduct or grow our businesses, and could otherwise have an adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We believe that uncertainty and potential delays around the final form of such new rules and regulations might take may negatively impact our customers and trading volumes in certain markets in which we transact. Increased capital requirements may also diminish transaction velocity. While the broad framework of proposed rules and regulations is known, we believe that it remains premature to know conclusively the specific aspects of the U.S. and E.U. proposals that may directly affect our businesses, as some proposals have not yet been finalized and others which have been proposed remain subject to supervisory debate. While we generally believe the net impact of the rules and regulations may be positive for our businesses, unintended consequences of the rules and regulations may materially adversely affect us in ways yet to be determined. 

Other Financial Services Regulation 

Our subsidiaries that have foreign operations are subject to regulation by the relevant regulatory authorities and self-regulatory organizations in the countries in which they do business. The following table sets forth certain jurisdictions, other than the United States, in which we do business and the applicable regulatory authority or authorities of each such jurisdiction:

The brokerage of real estate sales and leasing transactions, property and facilities management, conducting real estate valuation, and securing debt for clients, among other business lines, also require that we comply with regulations affecting the real estate industry and maintain licenses in various jurisdictions in which we operate. As the size and scope of real estate sales transactions have increased significantly over the past several years, market participants face corresponding greater complexity in ensuring they comply with numerous regulatory regimes. 

We could be required to pay fines, return commissions, have a license suspended or revoked, or be subject to criminal action should we conduct regulated activities without a license, or without maintaining the necessary license or if we violate applicable rules and regulations. Licensing requirements could also impact our ability to engage in certain types of transactions, change the way in which we conduct business or affect the cost of conducting business. We and our licensed associates may be subject to various due diligence, disclosure, standard-of-care, anti-money laundering and other obligations. We could become subject to claims by participants in real estate sales or other services claiming that we did not fulfill our obligations as a service provider or broker. This could include claims with respect to alleged conflicts of interest where we act, or are perceived to be acting, for two or more clients. While management has overseen highly regulated businesses before and expects us to comply with all applicable regulations in a satisfactory manner, no assurance can be given that it will always be the case. 

In addition, federal, state and local laws and regulations impose various environmental zoning restrictions, use controls, and disclosure obligations that impact the management, development, use and/or sale of real estate. Such laws and regulations tend to 

&#160;

discourage sales and leasing activities, as well as mortgage lending availability, with respect to such properties. In our role as property or facilities manager, we could incur liability under environmental laws for the investigation or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes at properties we currently or formerly managed, or at off-site locations where wastes from such properties were disposed. Such liability can be imposed without regard for the lawfulness of the original disposal activity, or our knowledge of, or fault for, the release or contamination. Further, liability under some of these may be joint and several, meaning that one liable party could be responsible for all costs related to a contaminated site. We could also be subject to property damage or personal injury claims alleged to result from environmental contamination, or from asbestos-containing materials or lead-based paint present at the properties or facilities we manage. Certain requirements governing the removal or encapsulation of asbestos-containing materials, as well as recently enacted local ordinances obligating property or facilities managers to inspect for and remove lead-based paint in certain buildings, could increase our costs of regulatory compliance and potentially subject us to violations or claims. 

Capital Requirements 

U.S. 

Every U.S.-registered broker-dealer is subject to the Uniform Net Capital Requirements. FCMs, such as our subsidiaries, BGC Financial L.P. (&#147;BGCF&#148;) and Mint Brokers (&#147;Mint&#148;), are also subject to CFTC capital requirements. These requirements are designed to ensure financial soundness and liquidity by prohibiting a broker or dealer from engaging in business at a time when it does not satisfy minimum net capital requirements. 

In the United States, net capital is essentially defined as net worth (assets minus liabilities), plus qualifying subordinated borrowings and less certain mandatory deductions that result from excluding assets that are not readily convertible into cash and from conservatively valuing certain other assets, such as a firm&#146;s positions in securities. Among these deductions are adjustments, commonly referred to as &#147;haircuts,&#148; to the market value of securities positions to reflect the market risk of such positions prior to their liquidation or disposition. The Uniform Net Capital Requirements also impose a minimum ratio of debt to equity, which may include qualified subordinated borrowings. 

Regulations have been adopted by the SEC that prohibit the withdrawal of equity capital of a broker-dealer, restrict the ability of a broker-dealer to distribute or engage in any transaction with a parent company or an affiliate that results in a reduction of equity capital or to provide an unsecured loan or advance against equity capital for the direct or indirect benefit of certain persons related to the broker-dealer (including partners and affiliates) if the broker-dealer&#146;s net capital is, or would be as a result of such withdrawal, distribution, reductions, loan or advance, below specified thresholds of excess net capital. In addition, the SEC&#146;s regulations require certain notifications to be provided in advance of such withdrawals, distributions, reductions, loans and advances that exceed, in the aggregate, 30% of excess net capital within any 30-day period. The SEC has the authority to restrict, for up to 20 business days, such withdrawal, distribution or reduction of capital if the SEC concludes that it may be detrimental to the financial integrity of the broker-dealer or may expose its customers or creditors to loss. Notice is required following any such withdrawal, distribution, reduction, loan or advance that exceeds, in the aggregate, 20% of excess net capital within any 30 day period. The SEC&#146;s regulations limiting withdrawals of excess net capital do not preclude the payment to employees of &#147;reasonable compensation.&#148; 

Four of our subsidiaries, BGCF, GFI Securities LLC, Kyte Securities LLC and Mint, are registered with the SEC and are subject to the Uniform Net Capital Requirements. As FCMs, BGCF and Mint are also subject to CFTC minimum capital requirements. BGCF is also a member of the FICC, which imposes capital requirements on its members. We also hold a 49% limited partnership interest in Aqua, a U.S. registered broker-dealer and ATS. In addition, our SEFs, BGC Derivative Markets and GFI Swaps Exchange, are required to maintain financial resources to cover operating costs for at least one year, keeping at least enough cash or highly liquid securities to cover six months&#146; operating costs. 

Compliance with the Uniform Net Capital Requirements may limit the extent and nature of our operations requiring the use of our registered broker-dealer subsidiaries&#146; capital, and could also restrict or preclude our ability to withdraw capital from our broker-dealer subsidiaries or SEFs. 

Non-U.S. 

Our international operations are also subject to capital requirements in their local jurisdictions. BGC Brokers L.P., BGC European Holdings, L.P., GFI Brokers Limited and GFI Securities Limited, which are based in the United Kingdom, are subject to capital requirements established by the FCA. The FCA applies stringent provisions with respect to capital applicable to the operation of these brokerage firms, which vary depending upon the nature and extent of their activities. The provisions relating to capital and liquidity requirements enforced by the FCA have undergone significant changes in response to the current regulatory landscape, and our U.K. businesses are now required to maintain significantly higher regulatory capital than they have in the past. 

In addition, the majority of our other foreign subsidiaries are subject to similar regulation by the relevant authorities in the countries in which they do business. Additionally, certain other of our foreign subsidiaries are required to maintain non-U.S. net capital requirements. In Hong Kong, BGC Securities (Hong Kong), LLC and GFI (HK) Securities LLC are regulated by the Securities and Futures 

&#160;

Commission. BGC Capital Markets (Hong Kong), Limited and GFI (HK) Brokers Ltd, are regulated by The Hong Kong Monetary Authority. All are subject to Hong Kong net capital requirements. In France, Aurel BGC and BGC France Holdings; in Australia, BGC Partners (Australia) Pty Limited, BGC (Securities) and GFI Australia Pty Ltd.; in Japan, BGC Shoken Kaisha Limited&#146;s Japanese branch; in Singapore, BGC Partners (Singapore) Limited, BGC Securities (Singapore) Ltd and GFI Group PTE Ltd; in Korea, BGC Capital Markets &#38; Foreign Exchange Broker (Korea) Limited and GFI Korea Money Brokerage Limited; and in Turkey, BGC Partners Menkul Degerler AS, all have net capital requirements imposed upon them by local regulators. In addition, the LCH (LIFFE/LME) clearing organization, of which BGC LP is a member, also imposes minimum capital requirements. In Latin America, BGC Liquidez Distribuidora De Titulos E Valores Mobiliarios Ltda. (Brazil) has net capital requirements imposed upon it by local regulators. 

We had net assets in our regulated subsidiaries of $510.1 million and $336.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 7,841 total employees, of which approximately 51% were primarily focused on our Financial Services segment and approximately 49% on our Real Estate Services segment. 

As of the same date, we had 3,855 brokers, salespeople, managers and other front-office personnel, of which 2,454 worked in our Financial Services segment and 1,401 in our Real Estate Services segment. Approximately 56% of our brokers, salespeople, managers and other front-office personnel were based in the Americas, and approximately 32% were based in Europe, the Middle East and Africa with the remaining approximately 12% based in the Asia-Pacific region. 

Generally, our employees are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements, except for certain reimbursable employees within our Real Estate Services segment, and certain of our employees based in our European offices that are covered by the national, industry-wide collective bargaining agreements relevant to the countries in which they work. 

Legal Proceedings

OUR ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE 

Stock Ownership 

As of January 31, 2016, there were 242,372,625 shares of our Class A common stock outstanding, of which 22,994,872 shares were held by Cantor and CFGM, Cantor&#146;s managing general partner. Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote on matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. 

In addition, as of January 31, 2016, Cantor and CFGM held 34,848,107 shares of our Class B common stock (which represents all of the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock), representing, together with our Class A common stock held by Cantor and CFGM, approximately 62.9% of our voting power on such date. Each share of Class B common stock is generally entitled to the same rights as a share of Class A common stock, except that, on matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, each share of Class B common stock is entitled to ten votes. The Class B common stock generally votes together with the Class A common stock on all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. 

Through January 31, 2016, Cantor has distributed to its current and former partners an aggregate of 20,747,738 shares of Class A common stock, consisting of (i) 19,307,009 shares to satisfy certain of Cantor&#146;s deferred stock distribution obligations provided to such partners on April 1, 2008 (the &#147;April 2008 distribution rights shares&#148;), and (ii) 1,440,729 shares to satisfy certain of Cantor&#146;s deferred stock distribution obligations provided to such partners on February 14, 2012 in connection with Cantor&#146;s payment of previous quarterly partnership distributions (the &#147;February 2012 distribution rights shares&#148;). As of January 31, 2016, Cantor is still obligated to distribute to its current and former partners an aggregate of 15,859,233 shares of Class A common stock, consisting of 14,064,735 April 2008 distribution rights shares and 1,794,498 February 2012 distribution rights shares. 

From time to time, we may actively continue to repurchase shares of our Class A common stock, including from Cantor, our executive officers, other employees, partners and others.

Partnership Structure 

We are a holding company, and our business is operated through two operating partnerships, BGC U.S., which holds our U.S. businesses, and BGC Global, which holds our non-U.S. businesses. The limited partnership interests of the two operating partnerships are held by us and BGC Holdings, and the limited partnership interests of BGC Holdings are currently held by limited partnership unit holders, founding partners, and Cantor. We hold the BGC Holdings general partnership interest and the BGC Holdings special voting limited partnership interest, which entitle us to remove and appoint the general partner of BGC Holdings, and serve as the general partner of BGC Holdings, which entitles us to control BGC Holdings. BGC Holdings, in turn, holds the BGC U.S. general partnership interest and the BGC U.S. special voting limited partnership interest, which entitle the holder thereof to remove and appoint the general partner of BGC U.S., and the BGC Global general partnership interest and the BGC Global special voting limited partnership interest, which entitle the holder thereof to remove and appoint the general partner of BGC Global, and serves as the general partner of BGC U.S. and BGC Global, all of which entitle BGC Holdings (and thereby us) to control each of BGC U.S. and BGC Global. BGC Holdings holds its BGC Global general partnership interest through a company incorporated in the Cayman Islands, BGC Global Holdings GP Limited. 

As of January 31, 2016, we held directly and indirectly, through wholly owned subsidiaries, BGC U.S. limited partnership interests and BGC Global limited partnership interests consisting of 277,220,732 units and 277,220,732 units, representing approximately 67.1% and 67.1% of the outstanding BGC U.S. limited partnership interests and BGC Global limited partnership interests, respectively. As of that date, BGC Holdings held BGC U.S. limited partnership interests and BGC Global limited partnership interests consisting of 135,884,464 units and 135,884,464 units, representing approximately 32.9% and 32.9% of the outstanding BGC U.S. limited partnership interests and BGC Global limited partnership interests, respectively. 

Limited partnership unit holders, founding partners, and Cantor directly hold BGC Holdings limited partnership interests. Since BGC Holdings in turn holds BGC U.S. limited partnership interests and BGC Global limited partnership interests, limited partnership unit holders, founding partners, and Cantor indirectly have interests in BGC U.S. limited partnership interests and BGC Global limited partnership interests. 

As of January 31, 2016, excluding Preferred Units and NPSUs described below, outstanding BGC Holdings partnership interests included 70,413,386 limited partnership units, 14,912,664 founding partner units and 50,558,414 Cantor units. 

We may in the future effect additional redemptions of BGC Holdings limited partnership units and founding partner units for shares of our Class A common stock. We may also continue our earlier partnership restructuring programs, whereby we redeemed or repurchased certain limited partnership units and founding partner units in exchange for new units, grants of exchangeability for Class A common stock or cash and, in many cases, obtained modifications or extensions of partners&#146; employment arrangements. We also generally expect to continue to grant exchange rights with respect to outstanding non-exchangeable limited partnership units and founding partner units, and to repurchase BGC Holdings partnership interests from time to time, including from Cantor, our executive officers, and other employees and partners, unrelated to our partnership restructuring programs. 

Cantor units are generally exchangeable with us for our Class B common stock (or, at Cantor&#146;s option or if there are no additional authorized but unissued shares of our Class B common stock, our Class A common stock) on a one-for-one basis (subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments). Upon certain circumstances, Cantor may have the right to acquire additional Cantor units in connection with the redemption of or grant of exchangeability to certain non-exchangeable founding partner units owned by persons who were previously Cantor partners prior to the separation, none of which was redeemed/exchanged in the Global Partnership Restructuring Program. On November 4, 2015, the Company issued exchange rights with respect to, and Cantor purchased, in transactions exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, an aggregate of 1,775,481 exchangeable limited partnership units in BGC Holdings, as follows: In connection with the redemption by BGC Holdings of an aggregate of 588,356 non-exchangeable founding partner units from founding partners of BGC Holdings for an aggregate consideration of $2,114,885, Cantor purchased 554,196 exchangeable limited partnership units from BGC Holdings for an aggregate of $1,933,390 (after offset of a founding partner&#146;s $46,289 debt due to Cantor). In addition, pursuant to the Sixth Amendment to the BGC Holdings Limited Partnership Agreement, on November 4, 2015, Cantor purchased 1,221,285 exchangeable limited partnership units from BGC Holdings for an aggregate consideration of $4,639,352 in connection with the grant of exchangeability and exchange of 1,221,285 founding partner units. Exchangeable limited partnership units held by Cantor are exchangeable by Cantor at any time on a one-for-one basis (subject to adjustment) for shares of Class A common stock of the Company. 

As of January 31, 2016, there were 219,270 non-exchangeable founding partner units with respect to which Cantor had the right to acquire an equivalent number of Cantor units. 

On November 6, 2013, BGC GP, LLC, a subsidiary of the Company and the General Partner of the Company&#146;s majority-owned subsidiary, BGC Holdings, and Cantor, the Majority in Interest Exchangeable Limited Partner of the Partnership, entered into the Ninth Amendment to the Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Partnership (the &#147;Ninth Amendment&#148;) effective as of July 1, 2013. 

In order to facilitate partner compensation and for other corporate purposes, the Ninth Amendment creates new preferred partnership units (&#147;Preferred Units&#148;), which are working partner units that may be awarded to holders of, or contemporaneous with the grant of, PSUs, PSIs, PSEs, LPUs, APSUs, APSIs, APSEs, REUs, RPUs, AREUs, and ARPUs. These new Preferred Units carry the same name as the underlying unit, with the insertion of an additional &#147;P&#148; to designate them as Preferred Units. 

&#160;

Such Preferred Units may not be made exchangeable into our Class A common stock and accordingly will not be included in the fully diluted share count. Each quarter, the net profits of BGC Holdings will be allocated to such Units at a rate of either 0.6875% (which is 2.75% per calendar year) of the allocation amount assigned to them based on their award price, or such other amount as set forth in the award documentation (the &#147;Preferred Distribution&#148;), before calculation and distribution of the quarterly Partnership distribution for the remaining Partnership units. The Preferred Units will not be entitled to participate in Partnership distributions other than with respect to the Preferred Distribution. As of January 31, 2016, there were 14,980,662 such units granted and outstanding. The Ninth Amendment was approved by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and by the full Board. 

On May 9, 2014, partners of BGC Holdings approved the Tenth Amendment to the Agreement of Limited Partnership of BGC Holdings effective as of May 9, 2014. In order to facilitate partner compensation and for other corporate purposes the Tenth Amendment created a new class of partnership units (NPSUs), which are working partner units. For more information, see Note 14&#151;&#147;Related Party Transactions&#148; to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

On June 5, 2015, we entered into an agreement with Cantor providing Cantor, CFGM and other Cantor affiliates entitled to hold Class B common stock the right to exchange from time to time, on a one-to-one basis, subject to adjustment, up to an aggregate of 34,649,693 shares of Class A common stock now owned or subsequently acquired by such Cantor entities for up to an aggregate of 34,649,693 shares of Class B common stock. These shares of Class B common stock represent the remaining 34,649,693 authorized but unissued shares of Class B common stock available under our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. The exchange agreement will enable the Cantor entities to acquire the same number of shares of Class B common stock that they are already entitled to acquire without having to exchange their exchangeable limited partnership units in BGC Holdings. Our Audit Committee and full Board of Directors determined that it was in the best interests of us and our stockholders to approve the exchange agreement because it will help ensure that Cantor retains its exchangeable limited partnership units in BGC Holdings, which is the same partnership in which our partner employees participate, thus continuing to align the interests of Cantor with those of the partner employees. We and Cantor have agreed that any shares of Class B common stock issued in connection with the exchange agreement would be deducted from the aggregate number of shares of Class B common stock that may be issued to the Cantor entities upon exchange of exchangeable limited partnership units in BGC Holdings. Accordingly, the Cantor entities will not be entitled to receive any more shares of Class B common stock under this agreement than they were previously eligible to receive upon exchange of exchangeable limited partnership units. 

On November 4, 2015, partners of BGC Holdings approved the Eleventh Amendment to the Agreement of Limited Partnership of BGC Holdings (the &#147;Eleventh Amendment&#148;) effective as of October 1, 2015. In order to facilitate partner compensation and for other corporate purposes the Eleventh Amendment created five new classes of non-distributing partnership units (&#147;N Units&#148;), which are Working Partner Units. These new N Units carry the same name as the underlying unit with the insertion of an additional &#147;N&#148; to designate them as the N Unit type and are designated as NREUs, NPREUs, NLPUs, NPLPUs and NPPSUs. The N Units are not entitled to participate in Partnership distributions, will not be allocated any items of profit or loss and may not be made exchangeable into shares of the Company&#146;s Class A common stock. Subject to the approval of the Compensation Committee or its designee, the N Units are expected to be converted into the underlying unit type (i.e. an NREU will be converted into an REU) and will then participate in Partnership distributions, subject to terms and conditions determined by the General Partner of the Partnership in its sole discretion, including that the recipient continue to provide substantial services to the Company and comply with his or her partnership obligations. The Eleventh Amendment was approved by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and by the full Board of Directors.

The following diagram illustrates our organizational structure as of January 31, 2016. The diagram does not reflect the various subsidiaries of BGC, BGC U.S., BGC Global, BGC Holdings or Cantor, or the noncontrolling interests in our consolidated subsidiaries other than Cantor&#146;s units in BGC Holdings.*

&#160;

&#160;

* Shares of our Class B common stock are convertible into shares of our Class A common stock at any time in the discretion of the holder on a one-for-one basis. Accordingly, if Cantor converted all of its Class B common stock into Class A common stock, Cantor would hold 20.9% of the voting power, and the public stockholders would hold 79.1% of the voting power (and Cantor&#146;s indirect economic interests in BGC U.S. and BGC Global would remain unchanged). For purposes of the diagram, Cantor&#146;s percentage ownership also includes CFGM&#146;s percentage ownership. The diagram does not reflect certain Class A common stock and BGC Holdings partnership units as follows: (a) 16,260,160 shares of Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of our 4.50% convertibles notes; (b) any shares of Class A common stock that may become issuable upon the conversion or exchange of any convertible or exchangeable debt securities that may in the future be sold under our shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-180331); (c) 14,980,662 Preferred Units granted and outstanding to BGC Holdings partners (see &#147;Partnership Structure&#148; herein); (d) 13,676,503 N Units granted and outstanding to BGC Holdings partners; (e) 5,000,000 shares of Class A common stock that we repurchased from Cantor on February 23, 2016; and (f) 970,639 shares of Class A common stock that Cantor donated to The Cantor Fitzgerald Relief Fund on February 23, 2016, and that we repurchased from The Cantor Fitzgerald Relief Fund on February 23, 2016. The diagram reflects Class A common stock and BGC Holdings partnership unit activity from January 1, 2015 through January 31, 2016 as follows: (a) 24,042,599 shares of Class A common stock acquired by Cantor upon conversion of the 8.75% convertible notes into shares of Class A common stock, all of which shares have been registered for resale pursuant to our Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-204980), none of which shares have been sold under such Registration Statement, and 11,000,000 of which shares have been pledged by Cantor to a bank under such Registration Statement as a security for a loan; (b) 23,481,192 shares of Class A common stock issued on January 12, 2016 to the stockholders of JPI in the Back-End Mergers, which shares have been registered for resale pursuant to our shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-208967); (c) 1,702,836 shares of Class A common stock repurchased by us; (d) 270,422 forfeited shares of Restricted Class A common stock; (e) 418,615 shares of Class A common stock sold by us under the December 2012 sales agreement pursuant to our shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-185110); (f) 6,556,023 shares of Class A common stock sold by us under the November 2014 sales agreement pursuant to our Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-200415), but not the 13,443,977 shares remaining for sale by us under such sales agreement; (g) 1,145,643 shares issued by us under our acquisition shelf Registration Statement on Form S-4 (Registration No. 333-169232), but not the 12,305,353 shares remaining available for issuance by us under such Registration Statement; (h) 44,902 shares issued by us under our Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-173109), but not the 9,767,531 shares remaining available for issuance by us under shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-196999); (i) 176,045 shares sold by selling stockholders under our resale shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-167953), but not the 171,268 shares remaining available for sale by selling stockholders under such Registration Statement; (j) 422,488 shares sold by selling stockholders under our resale shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-175034), but not the 1,274,549 shares remaining available for sale by selling stockholders under such Registration Statement; (k) 708,136 limited partnership, founding partner and Cantor units redeemed or repurchased by us for cash; and (l) an aggregate of 26,301,065 limited partnership units granted by BGC Holdings.
