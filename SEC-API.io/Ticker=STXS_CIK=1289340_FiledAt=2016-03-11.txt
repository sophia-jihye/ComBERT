&#160; 

OVERVIEW 

We design, manufacture and market robotic systems and instruments for use primarily by electrophysiologists for the treatment of abnormal heart rhythms known as cardiac arrhythmias. We offer our proprietary Epoch Solution, an advanced remote robotic navigation system, for use in a hospital&#146;s interventional surgical suite, or &#147;interventional lab&#148;. We believe the Epoch Solution revolutionizes the treatment of arrhythmias and coronary artery disease by enabling enhanced safety, efficiency and efficacy for catheter-based, or interventional procedures. 

The Epoch Solution is comprised of the Niobe ES Remote Magnetic Navigation System (&#147; Niobe ES system&#148;), Odyssey Information Management Solution (&#147; Odyssey Solution&#148;), and the Vdrive Robotic Navigation System (&#147; Vdrive system&#148;), and related devices. We consider our technology an important advancement in the ongoing trend toward fully digitized, integrated and automated interventional labs. We believe our technology provides substantial, clinically important improvements over manual interventional methods, which often result in long and unpredictable procedure times with suboptimal therapeutic outcomes. We believe our products also support efficient and effective information management and physician collaboration. The core elements of our technology, especially the Niobe ES system, are protected by an extensive patent portfolio, as well as substantial expertise and trade secrets. 

We promote the full Epoch Solution in a typical hospital implementation, subject to regulatory approvals or clearances. The full Epoch Solution implementation requires a hospital to agree to an upfront capital payment and recurring payments. The upfront capital payment typically includes equipment and installation charges. The recurring payments typically include disposable costs for each procedure, equipment service costs beyond warranty period, and software licenses. In hospitals where the full Epoch Solution has not been implemented, equipment upgrade or expansion can be implemented upon purchasing of the necessary upgrade or expansion. 

Not all products have and/or require regulatory clearance in all of the markets we serve. Please refer to &#147;Regulatory Approval&#148; in Item 1 for a description of our regulatory clearance, licensing, and/or approvals we currently have or are pursuing. 

As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $6.0 million of backlog, consisting of outstanding purchase orders and other commitments for these systems. We had backlog of approximately $5.7 million and $6.8 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Of the December 31, 2015 backlog, we expect approximately 79% to be recognized as revenue over the course of 2016. There can be no assurance that we will recognize such revenue in any particular period or at all because some of our purchase orders and other commitments are subject to contingencies that are outside our control. These orders and commitments may be revised, modified or canceled, either by their express terms, as a result of negotiations or by project changes or delays. In addition, the sales cycle for the Epoch Solution is lengthy and generally involves construction or renovation activities at customer sites. Consequently, revenues and/or orders resulting from sales of our Epoch Solution can vary significantly from one reporting period to the next. 

We have alliances with Siemens AG Medical Healthcare, Philips Healthcare and Biosense Webster, a subsidiary of Johnson &#38; Johnson. Through these alliances, we integrate our Niobe system with Siemens&#146; and Philips&#146; market-leading cath lab imaging systems and Biosense Webster&#146;s 3D catheter location sensing technology. The Biosense alliance also provides development and distribution of disposable interventional devices, coordination of marketing and sales efforts in order to continue to introduce new enhancements around the Niobe system, and non-exclusive commercialization of the Odyssey Solution to Biosense customers in the electrophysiology field in certain countries such as the United States. The Siemens and Philips alliances provide for coordination of our sales and marketing efforts with those of our alliance partners to facilitate co-marketing of integrated systems. 

&#160; 

THE STEREOTAXIS VALUE PROPOSITION 

Although great strides have been made in manual device technology and in related manual interventional techniques, significant challenges remain that reduce interventional productivity and limit both the number of complex procedures and the types of diseases that can be treated manually. These challenges primarily involve the inherent mechanical limitations of manual instrument control and the lack of integration of the information systems used by physicians in the interventional lab as well as a significant amount of training and experience required to ensure proficiency. As a result, many complex cases in electrophysiology are treated with palliative drug therapy, and many complex procedures in interventional cardiology are still referred to highly invasive bypass surgery. 

The Epoch Solution addresses the current challenges in the interventional lab by providing precise computerized control of the working tip of the interventional instrument and by integrating this control with the visualization technology and information systems used during electrophysiology and interventional cardiology procedures, on a cost-justified basis. 

We believe that our systems will: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Improve patient outcomes by optimizing therapy . Difficulty in controlling the working tip of disposable interventional devices can lead to sub-optimal results in many procedures. Conversely, the precise control of multiple complex diagnostic and therapeutic devices by a single physician can lead to better outcomes for the patient. Precise instrument control is necessary for treating a number of cardiac conditions. To treat arrhythmias, precise placement of an ablation catheter against a beating inner heart wall is necessary. Maintaining this precision and contact can be very challenging, especially in the most complex procedures, such as those for the treatment of ventricular tachycardia. For coronary artery disease, precise and correct navigation and placement of expensive stents also have a significant impact on procedure costs and outcomes. We believe our robotic technology can enhance procedure results by improving navigation of disposable interventional devices to treatment sites, and by affecting more precise, safe, treatments once these sites are reached. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Expand the market by enhancing the treatment of more complex cases. Treatment of a number of major diseases, including ventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, congenital heart diseases, and critical limb ischemia due to chronic total occlusions of peripheral arteries, is highly problematic using conventional wire and/or catheter-based techniques. Additionally, many patients with multi-vessel disease and certain complex arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation are often referred to other more invasive or less curative therapies because of the difficulty in precisely and safely controlling the working tip of disposable interventional devices used to treat these complex cases interventionally. Because our robotic technology provides precise, computerized control of the working tip of disposable interventional devices, we believe that it will potentially enable difficult ventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and congenital heart diseases to be treated interventionally on a much broader scale than today. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Enhance patient and physician safety. The Niobe system has been used in more than 85,000 procedures and the incidence of reported major adverse cardiac events associated with the use of the system for all procedures is approximately 0.3%. This represents what we believe to be a clinically significant improvement in major complication rates over conventional procedures, which can range as high as 2-6% for complex ablations, and significantly higher for new physicians and fellows. Additionally, during conventional catheter-based procedures, each of the physicians who stand by the patient table to manually control the catheter, the nursing staff assisting with the procedure, and the patient are exposed to the potentially harmful x-ray radiation from the fluoroscopy field. This exposure can be minimized through reduced usage of fluoroscopy during procedures with the Niobe system due to enhanced and more fully integrated mapping capabilities of the Niobe software. Our robotic technology can further improve physician safety and reduce physician fatigue by enabling them to conduct 

&#160; 

&#160; procedures remotely from an adjacent control room, which reduces their exposure to harmful radiation, and the orthopedic burden of wearing lead. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Improve clinical workflow and information management. Complex ablation procedures involve several sources of information, which conventionally require a physician to mentally integrate and process large quantities of information from different sources in real time, often from separate user interfaces. Sources of information include real time x-ray and/or ultrasound images, real time location sensing systems providing the 3-D location of a catheter tip, pre-operative map of the electrical activity of the heart, real time recording of electrical activity of the heart, and temperature feedback from an ablation catheter. The Odyssey Solution improves clinical workflow and information management efficiency by integrating and synchronizing the multiple sources of diagnostic and imaging information found in the interventional labs into a large-screen user interface with single mouse and keyboard control. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Enhance hospital efficiency by reducing and standardizing procedure times, disposables utilization and staffing needs. Conventional interventional procedure times currently range from several minutes to many hours as physicians often engage in repetitive, &#147;trial and error&#148; maneuvers due to difficulties with manually controlling the working tip of disposable interventional devices. By reducing both navigation time and the time needed to carry out therapy at the target site, we believe that our robotic technology can reduce procedure times compared to manual procedures, especially in the most complex procedures such as the treatment of ventricular tachycardia. We believe the Niobe system can also reduce the variability in procedure times compared to manual methods. Greater standardization of procedure times allows for more efficient scheduling of interventional cases including staff requirements. We also believe that additional cost savings from robotics can result from decreased use of multiple catheters, high-end deflectable sheaths, guidewires and contrast media in procedures compared with manual methods further enhancing the rate of return to hospitals. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Improve physician skill levels in order to improve the efficacy of complex cardiology procedures. Training required for physicians to safely and effectively carry out manual interventional procedures typically takes years, over and above the training required to become a specialist in cardiology. This has led to a shortage of physicians who are skilled in performing more complex procedures. We believe that our robotic technology can allow procedures that previously required the highest levels of manual dexterity and skill to be performed effectively by a broader range of interventional physicians, with more standardized outcomes. In addition, interventional physicians can learn to use robotic systems in a relatively short period of time. The Niobe system can also be programmed to carry out sequences of complex navigation automatically further enhancing ease of use. We believe the Odyssey Solution can allow advanced training online thereby accelerating learning. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Help hospitals recruit physicians and attract patients. Due to the clinical benefits of the Epoch Solution, we believe hospitals will realize significant operational benefits when recruiting physicians to work in a more safe procedure environment, while attracting patients who desire to have safer procedures that lead to better long term outcomes. 

OUR PRODUCTS 

Niobe &#174; ES Remote Magnetic Navigation System 

Our proprietary Niobe ES system is the latest generation of the Niobe system, which provides the physician with precise remote digital instrument control through user friendly &#147;point and click&#148; computer mouse control, in combination with sophisticated image integration and 3D reconstruction. It can be operated either from an adjacent room and outside the x-ray fluoroscopy field or beside the patient table, as in traditional interventional procedures. The Niobe system allows the operator to navigate disposable interventional devices to the treatment site through complex paths in the blood vessels and chambers of the heart to deliver treatment by using computer controlled, externally applied magnetic fields to directly govern the motion of the working tip of these devices, each of which has a magnetically sensitive tip that predictably responds to magnetic fields generated by our 

&#160; 

system. Because the working tip of the disposable interventional device is directly controlled by these external magnetic fields, the physician has the same degree of control regardless of the number or type of turns, or the distance traveled by the working tip to arrive at its position in the blood vessels or chambers of the heart. This results in highly precise digital control of the working tip of the disposable interventional device while still giving the physician the option to manually advance the device. 

Through our alliances with Siemens, Philips and Biosense Webster, this precise digital instrument control has been integrated with the visualization and information systems used during electrophysiology procedures in order to provide the physician with a fully-integrated and automated information and instrument control system. We have integrated our Niobe system with Siemens&#146; and with Philips&#146; digital x-ray fluoroscopy systems. In addition, we have integrated the Niobe system with Biosense Webster&#146;s 3D catheter location sensing technology to provide accurate real-time information as to the 3D location of the working tip of the instrument, and with Biosense Webster&#146;s ablation tip technology. The combination of these technologies was initially launched in 2005 and continues to develop significantly as the various systems advance. 

The components of the Niobe system are identified and described below: 

Niobe &#174; Remote Magnetic Navigation System. Our Niobe system utilizes two permanent magnets mounted on articulating and pivoting arms that are enclosed within a stationary housing, with one magnet on either side of the patient table. These magnets generate magnetic navigation fields that are less than 10% of the strength of fields typically generated by MRI equipment and therefore require significantly less shielding, and cause significantly less interference, than MRI equipment. The Niobe system is indicated for use in cardiac, peripheral and neurovascular applications. 

Cardiodrive &#174; Automated Catheter Advancement System . As the physician conducts the procedure from the adjacent control room, the Cardiodrive Automated Catheter Advancement System (&#147;Cardiodrive&#148;) in conjunction with the QuikCAS automated catheter advancement system is used to remotely advance and retract the electrophysiology catheter in the patient&#146;s heart while the Niobe magnets precisely steer the working tip of the device. 

Niobe system revenue represented 19% and 12% of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 

Odyssey &#174; Solution 

The Odyssey Solution offers a fully integrated, real-time information solution to manage, control, record and share procedures across networks or around the world. We believe that the Odyssey Solution enhances the physician workflow in interventional labs through a consolidated user interface of multiple systems on a single display to enable greater focus on the case and improve the efficiency of the lab. Through the use of a single mouse and keyboard, the Odyssey Solution allows the user to command multiple systems in the lab from a single point of control. In addition, the Odyssey Solution acquires a real-time, remote view of the lab capturing synchronized procedure data for review of important events during cases. The Odyssey Solution enables physicians to access recorded cases and create snapshots following procedures for enhanced clinical reporting, auditing and presentation. The Odyssey Solution enables physicians to establish a comprehensive master archive of procedures performed in the lab providing an excellent tool for training new staff on the standard practices. The Odyssey Solution further enables procedures to be observed remotely around the world with high speed Internet access over a hospital VPN even wirelessly using a standard laptop or Windows tablet computer. The Odyssey Solution may be acquired either as part of the Epoch Solution or on a stand-alone basis for installation in interventional labs and other locations where clinicians desire improved clinical workflows and related efficiencies. 

&#160; 

Vdrive &#153; Robotic Navigation System 

The Vdrive system provides navigation and stability for diagnostic and ablation devices designed with key features to assist in the delivery of better ablations. Important features include complementing the Niobe ES control of catheters with fully remote, single operator workflow; and providing robotic control of diagnostic devices independent of magnetic navigation. The Vdrive Duo system is an optional expansion of the Vdrive hardware that allows control of any two of the three available disposable options ( V-Loop , V-Sono and , V-CAS ). 

Disposables and Other Accessories 

Our Niobe system is designed to use a toolkit of proprietary disposable interventional devices. The toolkit currently consists of: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Our QuikCAS automated catheter advancement disposables designed to provide precise remote advancement of proprietary electrophysiology catheters; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Biosense Webster&#146;s CARTO &#174; RMT navigation and ablation system, CELSIUS &#174; RMT, NAVISTAR &#174; RMT, NAVISTAR &#174; RMT DS, NAVISTAR &#174; RMT THERMOCOOL &#174; and CELSIUS &#174; RMT THERMOCOOL &#174; Irrigated Tip Diagnostic/Ablation Steerable Tip Catheters co-developed by Biosense Webster and Stereotaxis, as described below, with sales of such magnetically-enabled catheters generating royalty payable from Biosense Webster to Stereotaxis; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The Pegasus coronary guidewire designed for use in interventional cardiology procedures for the introduction and placement of over-the-wire therapeutic devices, such as stents and angioplasty balloons. 

We believe that we can adapt many of the applicable disposable interventional devices for use with our system by using our proprietary technology to add an inexpensive micro-magnet at their working tip. This micro-magnet is activated by an external magnetic field, which allows interventional devices with tip dimensions as small as 14 thousandths (0.014) of an inch to be oriented and positioned in a predictable and controllable fashion. We believe this approach to bringing digital control to disposable interventional devices using embedded magnets can simplify the overall design of these devices because mechanical controls are no longer required. 

In addition to the Vdrive and Vdrive Duo systems, we also manufacture and market various disposable components which can be manipulated by these systems. These include: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; our V-CAS catheter advancement system (&#147; V-CAS system&#148;) that controls both the magnetic catheter body and a standard fixed-curve sheath; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; our V-Loop circular catheter manipulator (&#147;V-Loop device&#148;), which allows the user to control certain circular mapping catheters, such as Biosense Webster&#146;s LASSO &#174; 2515 or LASSO &#174; 2515 NAV Circular Mapping Catheter, advance, retract, rotate, deflect and adjust loop radius, and hold the catheter position against the tissue to optimize electrograms; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; our V-Sono ICE catheter manipulator (&#147; V-Sono device&#148;) that allows a single physician to manipulate BWI SoundStar&#153; and AcuNav&#153; catheters from the control room, store and recall previous positions and automatically sweep over an area of interest with adjustable speed and angle, and automatically track a 3.5mm NAVISTAR &#174; RMT THERMOCOOL &#174; Irrigated Tip Catheter&#151;all without leaving the control room. 

Disposable revenue including royalties represented 34% and 39% of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 

Other Recurring Revenue 

Other recurring revenue includes revenue from software licenses, product maintenance plans, and other post warranty maintenance. Revenue from services and license fees is deferred and amortized over the service or 

&#160; 

license fee period, which is typically one year. Other recurring revenue represented 37% and 38% of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 

Regulatory Approval 

We have received regulatory clearance, licensing and/or CE Mark approvals necessary for us to market the Niobe system, Cardiodrive , and various disposable interventional devices in the U.S., Canada, Europe, China, Japan, and various other countries.

Our alliance with Biosense Webster provides for co-development of catheters that can be navigated with our system, both with and without Biosense Webster&#146;s 3D catheter location sensing technology. In addition, we can utilize technology which allows our system to recognize specific disposable interventional devices in order to prevent unauthorized use of our system. See &#147;Strategic Alliances&#151;Disposable Devices Alliance&#148; below for a description of our arrangements with Biosense Webster.

CLINICAL APPLICATIONS 

We have focused our clinical and commercial efforts on applications of the Epoch Solution primarily in electrophysiology procedures for the treatment of arrhythmias and secondarily in complex interventional cardiology procedures for the treatment of coronary artery disease. Our system potentially has broad applicability in other areas, such as structural heart repair, interventional neurosurgery, interventional neuroradiology, peripheral vascular, renal denervation, pulmonology, urology, gynecology and gastrointestinal medicine, and some of our patents may be applicable in these areas as well. 

&#160; 

Electrophysiology 

The rhythmic beating of the heart results from the transmission of electrical impulses. When these electrical impulses are mistimed or uncoordinated, the heart fails to function properly, resulting in symptoms that can range from fatigue to stroke or death. Over 5.0 million people in the U.S. currently suffer from the resulting abnormal heart rhythms, which are known as arrhythmias. The prevalence of arrhythmias is expected to continue to rise as the population ages and life expectancy continues to increase. These conditions are a major physical and economic burden and are associated with stroke, heart failure, and adverse symptoms causing patients to be very motivated to seek treatment. The combination of symptoms, prevalence and co-morbidities make arrhythmias a major economic factor in healthcare. We believe payors are very interested in therapies that may reduce the financial impact of these diseases. 

Drug therapies for arrhythmias often fail to adequately control the arrhythmia and may have significant side effects. Consequently, physicians have increasingly sought more permanent, non-pharmacological, solutions for arrhythmias. The most common interventional treatment for arrhythmias, and in particular tachyarrhythmias, where the patient&#146;s heart rate is too high or irregular, is an ablation procedure in which the diseased tissue giving rise to the arrhythmia is isolated or destroyed. Prior to performing an electrophysiology ablation, a physician typically performs a diagnostic procedure in which the electrical signal patterns of the heart wall are &#147;mapped&#148; to identify the heart tissue generating the aberrant electrical signals. Following the mapping procedure, the physician may then use an ablation catheter to eliminate the aberrant signal or signal path, restoring the heart to its normal rhythm. In cases where an ablation is anticipated, physicians will choose an ablation catheter and perform both the mapping and ablation with the same catheter. In February 2009 the FDA approved the Biosense Webster NAVISTAR &#174; THERMOCOOL &#174; irrigated catheter to be labeled for the treatment of atrial fibrillation. This is the first device approved by the FDA to be labeled for the interventional treatment of this arrhythmia. We believe this important milestone will accelerate acceptance of ablations for the treatment of atrial fibrillation. 

We believe more than 3,000 interventional labs around the world are currently capable of conducting electrophysiology procedures. Nearly one million electrophysiology procedures are performed annually worldwide, and procedure growth rate is over 10% annually. 

We believe the Epoch Solution is particularly well-suited for those electrophysiology procedures which are time consuming or which can only be performed by highly experienced physicians. These procedures include: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Ventricular Tachycardia . Ventricular tachycardia is a malignant, potentially lethal arrhythmia that is extremely difficult and time consuming to treat. The magnetic catheter has been characterized as the ideal tool for this application. These arrhythmias can often be modified or interrupted by the pressure of a conventional catheter making it very difficult to identify the appropriate location for the ablation, whereas magnetic catheters produce fewer extra beats and provide for easier and more efficient mapping of the diseased tissue. Successful ablation of ventricular tachycardia can extend the useful life of an implantable defibrillator, reduce shocks to the patient, reduce the need for antiarrhythmic drugs or, in some cases, obviate the need for an expensive implantable device and its associated follow-up. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Atrial Fibrillation . The most commonly diagnosed abnormal heart rhythm, atrial fibrillation, is a particular type of arrhythmia characterized by rapid, disorganized contractions of the heart&#146;s upper chambers, the atria, which lead to ineffective heart pumping and blood flow and can be a major risk factor for stroke. This chaotic electrical activity of the top chambers of the heart is estimated to be present in three million people in the United States and over seven million people worldwide. The number of potential patients for manual catheter-based procedures for atrial fibrillation has been limited because the procedures are extremely complex and are performed by only the most highly skilled electrophysiologists. They also typically have much longer procedure times than general ablation cases and the success rates have been lower and more variable. We believe that our system can allow these procedures to be performed by a broader range of electrophysiologists and, by automating some of the more complex catheter maneuvers, can standardize and reduce procedure times and significantly improve outcomes. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; General Mapping and Ablations . For the more routine mapping and ablation procedures, our system offers the unique benefit of precise catheter movement and consistent heart wall contact. Additionally, the system can control the procedure and direct catheter movement from the control room, saving the physician time and helping to avoid unnecessary exposure to high doses of radiation. 

We believe that our system can address the current challenges in electrophysiology by permitting the physician to remotely navigate disposable interventional devices from a control room outside the x-ray field. Additionally, we believe that our system allows for more predictable and efficient navigation of these devices to the treatment site, and enables catheter contact to be consistently maintained to efficiently apply energy on the wall of the beating heart. We also believe that our system will significantly lower the skill barriers required for physicians to perform complex electrophysiology procedures and, additionally, improve interventional lab efficiency and reduce disposable interventional device utilization. 

Interventional Cardiology 

More than half a million people die annually from coronary artery disease, a condition in which the formation of plaque in the coronary arteries obstructs the supply of blood to the heart, making this the leading cause of death in the U.S. Despite various attempts to reduce risk factors, each year over one million patients undergo interventional procedures in an attempt to open blocked vessels and another one half million patients undergo open heart surgery to bypass blocked coronary arteries. 

Blockages within a coronary artery, often called lesions, are categorized by degree of obstruction as partial occlusions, non-chronic total occlusions and chronic total occlusions. Lesions are also categorized by the degree of difficulty with which they can be opened as simple or complex. Complex lesions, such as chronic total occlusions, longer lesions, and lesions located within smaller diameter vessels, are often very difficult or time consuming to open with manual interventional techniques. 

We believe approximately 11,000 interventional labs worldwide are currently capable of conducting interventional cardiology. Approximately 4 million interventional cardiology procedures are performed annually in the U.S. alone. We estimate that approximately 10-15% of these interventional cardiology procedures currently being performed are complex and therefore require longer procedure times and may have sub-optimal outcomes. We believe that our system can substantially benefit this subset of complex interventional cardiology procedures. 

Interventional Neuroradiology, Neurosurgery and Other Interventional Applications 

Physicians used a predecessor to our Niobe system to conduct a number of procedures for the treatment of brain aneurysms, a condition in which a portion of a blood vessel wall balloons and which can result in debilitating or fatal bleeding and strokes. We believe the Niobe system also has a range of potential applications in minimally invasive neurosurgery, including biopsies and the treatment of tumors, treatment of vascular malformations and fetal interventions. 

STRATEGIC ALLIANCES 

We have entered into strategic alliances with technology leaders in the global interventional market, including Siemens, Philips, and Biosense Webster, that we believe aid us in commercializing our Niobe system. We believe our two imaging partners, Siemens and Philips, have a significant percentage of the installed base of imaging systems worldwide. 

We believe that these strategic alliance arrangements are favorable to Stereotaxis because they: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; provide for the integration of our system with market leading digital imaging and 3D catheter location sensing technology, as well as disposable interventional devices; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; allow us to leverage the sales, distribution, service and maintenance expertise of our strategic alliances; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; enable operational flexibility by not requiring us to provide any of the parties in our strategic alliances with a right of first refusal in the event that another party wants to acquire us or with board representation where a strategic alliance has made a debt or equity investment in us. 

Imaging Alliances 

Siemens and Philips Alliances . We have successfully integrated our Niobe system with both Siemens&#146; and Philips&#146; digital fluoroscopy systems to provide advanced interventional lab visualization and instrument control through user-friendly computerized interfaces. We also coordinate our sales efforts with Siemens and Philips to co-market integrated systems at leading hospital sites in the U.S., Europe and in Asia. We have also entered into a software distribution agreement with Siemens under which we have the right to sublicense Siemens&#146; 3D pre-operative image navigation software as part of our advanced user interface for the Niobe ES system. 

Disposables Devices Alliance 

Biosense Webster Alliance. Through our alliance with Biosense Webster, we have successfully integrated Biosense Webster&#146;s advanced 3D catheter location sensing technology, which we believe has the leading market position in this important field of visualization for electrophysiology procedures, with the Niobe system. We have jointly developed associated location and non-location sensing electrophysiology mapping and ablation catheters that are navigable with the Niobe system. We believe that these integrated products provide physicians with the elements required for effective complex electrophysiology procedures: highly accurate information as to the exact location of the catheter in the body and highly precise control over the working tip of the catheter. We also coordinate our sales force efforts with Biosense Webster in order to place Biosense CARTO &#174; RMT systems and our Niobe systems that, together with the co-developed catheters, comprise the full integration of our instrument control and 3D location sensing technologies in the interventional lab. Additionally, Biosense Webster has non-exclusive rights until May 2016 to resell Stereotaxis&#146; Odyssey products, including Odyssey Vision and Odyssey Cinema systems in most countries. 

The co-developed catheters are manufactured and distributed by Biosense Webster, and both of the parties agreed to contribute to the resources required for their development. We are entitled to royalty payments from Biosense Webster, payable quarterly based on net revenues from sales of the co-developed catheters. Royalty revenue from the co-developed catheters represented 8% and 9% of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. These royalties are used to make payments under the debt agreement with Healthcare Royalty Partners II, L.P. (formerly &#147;Cowen Healthcare Royalty Partners II, L.P.&#148;) as discussed in Item 7. 

Biosense Webster&#146;s distribution rights for co-developed catheters were exclusive through December 31, 2015 and currently are nonexclusive until December 31, 2018. Biosense Webster&#146;s right to distribute such products in Japan is exclusive until March 22, 2018 and nonexclusive until March 22, 2021. The agreement provides an opportunity to expand the product offering covered by the agreement to include a next generation irrigated magnetic catheter, subject to mutually agreeable terms including exclusive distribution rights. 

Under the alliance with Biosense Webster, we agreed to certain restrictions on our ability to co-develop and distribute catheters competitive with those we are developing with Biosense Webster. These restrictions are no longer applicable after December 31, 2015. Additionally, we granted Biosense Webster certain notice and discussion rights for product development activities we undertake relating to localization of magnetically enabled interventional disposable devices in fields outside of electrophysiology and mapping. 

Either party may terminate this alliance in certain specified &#147;change of control&#148; situations, although the termination would not be effective until one year after the change of control and then would be subject to a 

&#160; 

wind-down period during which Biosense Webster would continue to supply co-developed catheters to us or to our customers for three years (or, for non-location sensing mapping and ablation catheters, until our first sale of a competitive product after a change of control, if earlier than three years). If either party terminates the agreement under this provision, we must pay a termination fee to Biosense Webster equal to 5% of our total equity value in the change of control transaction, up to a maximum of $10 million. If a change of control of Stereotaxis occurs after Biosense Webster has received approval from the U.S. FDA for atrial fibrillation indication for the NAVISTAR &#174; RMT THERMOCOOL &#174; catheter, we would be required to pay an additional $10 million fee to Biosense Webster, and termination of the agreement by either party would not be effective until two years after the change of control. We also agreed to notify Biosense Webster if we reasonably believe that we are engaged in substantive discussions with respect to the sale of the Company or substantially all of our assets. 

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 

We have assembled an experienced group of engineers and physicists with recognized expertise in magnetics, software, control algorithms, systems integration and disposable interventional device modeling and design. 

Our research and development efforts are focused in the following areas: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; continuing to enhance our existing Niobe system, Odyssey Solution, and Vdrive system through ongoing product and software development; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; designing new proprietary disposable interventional devices for use with our system. 

Our research and development team collaborates with our strategic partners, Siemens, Philips, and Biosense Webster, to integrate our Niobe system&#146;s open architecture platform with key imaging, location sensing and information systems in the interventional lab. We have also collaborated with a number of highly regarded interventional physicians in key clinical areas and have entered into agreements with a number of universities and teaching hospitals, which serve to increase our access to world class physicians and to expand our name recognition in the medical community. Our research and development expenses for the years ending December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, were $6.3 million, $5.2 million, and $5.7 million, respectively. 

CUSTOMER SERVICE AND SUPPORT 

We provide worldwide maintenance and support services to our customers for our integrated products directly or with the assistance of outsourced product and service representatives. By utilizing these relationships, we provide direct, on-site technical support activities, including call center, customer support engineers and service parts logistics and delivery. In certain situations, we use these third parties as a single point of contact for the customer, which allows us to focus on providing installation, training, and back-up technical support. 

Our back-up technical support includes a combination of on-line, telephone and on-site technical assistance services 24 hours a day, seven days a week. We have also hired service and support engineers with networking and medical equipment expertise, and have outsourced a portion of our installation and support services. We offer different levels of support to our customers, including basic hardware and software maintenance, extended product maintenance, and rapid response capability for both parts and service. 

We have established a call center in our St. Louis facilities, which provides real-time clinical and technical support to our customers worldwide. 

MANUFACTURING 

Niobe , Odysse y, and Vdrive Systems 

Our manufacturing strategy for our Niobe system and Odyssey Solution is to sub-contract the manufacture of major subassemblies of our system to maximize manufacturing flexibility and lower fixed costs. Our current 

&#160; 

manufacturing strategy for Vdrive system is to build all subassemblies in-house using sub-contract manufactured components. We maintain quality control for all of our systems by completing final system assembly and inspection in-house. 

We purchase both custom and off-the-shelf components from a large number of suppliers and subject them to quality specifications and processes. Some of the components necessary for the assembly of our products are currently provided to us by sole-sourced suppliers (the only recognized supply source available to us) or single-sourced suppliers (the only approved supply source for us among other sources). We purchase the majority of our components and major assemblies through purchase orders rather than long-term supply agreements and generally do not maintain large volumes of finished goods. 

Disposable Interventional Devices 

Our manufacturing strategy for disposable interventional devices is to outsource their manufacture through subcontracting and through our alliance with Biosense Webster and to expand partnerships for other interventional devices. We work closely with our contract manufacturers and have strong relationships with component suppliers. We have entered into manufacturing agreements to provide high volume capability for devices other than catheters. 

Software 

The software components of the Niobe system, the Vdrive system and Odyssey Solution, including control and application software, are developed both internally and with integrated modules we purchase or license. We perform final testing of software products in-house prior to their commercial release. 

General 

Our manufacturing facility operates under processes that meet the FDA&#146;s requirements under the Quality System Regulation (QSR). Our ISO registrar and European notified British Standard Institution (BSI) has audited our facility annually since 2001 and found the facility to be in compliance with relevant requirements. The initial ISO 9001 certification was issued in January 2002 and the most recent ISO 13485 certificate was issued in 2013. 

SALES AND MARKETING 

We market our products in the U.S and internationally through a direct sales force of senior sales specialists, distributors and sales agents, supported by account managers and clinical specialists who provide training, clinical support, and other services to our customers. In addition, our strategic alliances form an important part of our sales and marketing strategy. We leverage the sales forces of our imaging partners to co-market integrated systems on a worldwide basis. This approach allows us to maximize our leads and knowledge of the market opportunities while using our resources to sell directly to the customer. Under the terms of our agreement, Biosense Webster distributes magnetically enabled electrophysiology mapping and ablation catheters, co-developed pursuant to our alliance with them. 

Our sales and marketing efforts include two important elements: (1) selling Niobe system, Odyssey Solution , and Vdrive system directly and through distributors; and (2) leveraging our installed base of systems to drive recurring sales of disposable interventional devices, software and service. 

REIMBURSEMENT 

We believe that substantially all of the procedures, whether commercial or in clinical trials, conducted in the U.S. with the Niobe system or Vdrive system have been reimbursed to date. We expect that third-party payors will reimburse, under existing billing codes, procedures in which our line of ablation catheters and those on 

&#160; 

which we are collaborating with Biosense Webster, as well as our line of guidewires, are used. We expect healthcare facilities in the U.S. to bill various third-party payors, such as Medicare, Medicaid, other government programs and private insurers, for services performed with our products. We believe that procedures performed using our products, or targeted for use by products that do not yet have regulatory clearance or approval, are generally already reimbursable under government programs and most private plans. Accordingly, we believe providers in the U.S. will generally not be required to obtain new billing authorizations or codes in order to be compensated for performing medically necessary procedures using our products on insured patients. We cannot guarantee that reimbursement policies of third-party payors will not change in the future with respect to some or all of the procedures using the Niobe system. 

In countries outside the United States, reimbursement is obtained from various sources, including governmental authorities, private health insurance plans, and labor unions. In most foreign countries, private insurance systems may also offer payments for some therapies. Additionally, health maintenance organizations are emerging in certain European countries. In the European Union, we believe that substantially all of the procedures, whether commercial or in clinical trials, conducted with the Niobe system or Vdrive system have been reimbursed to date. In Japan, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) has classified the Niobe system as a C2 medical device (the highest reimbursement category), and has established a &#147;technical fee&#148; of Japanese Yen 50,000. In other foreign countries, we may need to seek international reimbursement approvals, and we do not know if these required approvals will be obtained in a timely manner or at all. 

See &#147;Item 1A&#151;Risk Factors&#148; for a discussion of various risks associated with reimbursement from third-party payors. 

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 

The proprietary nature of, and protection for, our products, processes and know-how are important to our business. We seek patent protection in the United States and internationally for our systems and other technology where available and when appropriate. 

We have an extensive patent portfolio that we believe protects the fundamental scope of our technology, including our magnet technology, navigational methods, procedures, systems, disposable interventional devices and our 3D integration technology. As of December 31, 2015, we had 89 issued U.S. patents, 1 co-owned U.S. patent and no licensed-in U.S. patents. In addition, we had 13 pending U.S. patent applications and 1 co-owned U.S. patent application. As of December 31, 2015 we had 44 issued foreign patents and nine owned foreign patent applications. The key patents that protect our Niobe system extend until 2022 and beyond. We also have a number of invention disclosures under consideration and several applications that are being prepared for filing. We cannot be certain that any patents will be issued from any of our pending patent applications, nor can we be certain that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted in the future will provide us with protection. 

It would be technically difficult and costly to reverse engineer our Niobe system, which contains numerous complex algorithms that control our disposable devices inside the magnetic fields generated by the Niobe system. We further believe that our patent portfolio is broad enough in scope to enable us to obtain legal relief if any entity not licensed by us attempted to market disposable devices in the U.S. that can be navigated by the Niobe system. We can also utilize security keys, such as embedded smart chips or associated software that could allow our system to recognize specific disposable interventional devices in order to prevent unauthorized use of our system. 

We have also developed substantial expertise in magnet design, magnet physics and magnetic instrument control that was developed in connection with the development of the Niobe system, which we maintain as trade secrets. This expertise centers around our proprietary magnet design, which is a critical aspect of our ability to design, manufacture and install a cost-effective magnetic navigation system that is small enough to be installed in 

&#160; 

a standard interventional lab. Our Odyssey Solution contains numerous complex algorithms and proprietary software and hardware configurations, and requires substantial knowledge to design and assemble, which we maintain as trade secrets. These proprietary software and hardware, some of which is owned by Stereotaxis, and some of which is licensed to Stereotaxis, is a material aspect of the ability to design, manufacture and install a cost-effective and efficient information integration, storage, and delivery platform. 

In addition, we seek to protect our proprietary information by entering into confidentiality, assignment of invention or license agreements with our employees, consultants, contractors, advisers and other third parties. However, we believe that these measures afford only limited protection. 

COMPETITION 

The markets for medical devices are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological advances, frequent new product introductions, evolving industry standards and price erosion. 

In electrophysiology we consider the primary competition to our Epoch Solution to be traditional catheter-based electrophysiology ablation approaches including RF (radiofrequency) ablation and non-RF therapies. To our knowledge, we are the only company that has commercialized remote, digital and direct control of the working tip of catheters for use in RF ablation procedures. Our success depends in part on convincing hospitals and physicians to convert traditional interventional procedures to procedures using our Epoch Solution . 

We face competition from companies that are developing and marketing new products for use in electrophysiology. These products include next generation mapping systems and RF ablation devices with which our Epoch Solution is not currently compatible, as well as new products for use in other interventional therapies. Some of these products are marketed by companies that may have an established presence in the field of electrophysiology, including major imaging, capital equipment and disposables companies that are currently selling products in the interventional lab. In addition, we face competition from companies that currently market or are developing drugs, gene or cellular therapies to treat the conditions for which our products are intended. 

We also face competition from companies that are developing remote interventional techniques. We are aware of one public company and two private companies that have commercialized electrophysiology catheter navigation systems which have been cleared by the FDA for mapping procedures only. In addition, we are aware of two private companies with an electromagnetic catheter navigation system that have received CE Mark approval in Europe. 

We face direct competition to certain products in our Odyssey Solution, such as the Odyssey Vision system. These competitors include established imaging companies as well as dedicated solution providers. We expect to continue to face competitive pressure in this market in the future, based on the rapid pace of advancements with this technology. 

We believe that the primary competitive factors in the market we address are capability, safety, efficacy, ease of use, price, quality, reliability and effective sales, support, training and service. The length of time required for products to be developed and to receive regulatory and reimbursement approval is also an important competitive factor. See &#147;Item 1A&#151;Risk Factors&#148; for a discussion of other competitive risks facing our business. 

GOVERNMENT REGULATION 

Our products are medical devices that are subject to extensive regulation in the U.S. and in foreign countries where we do business. The U.S. FDA regulates the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, promotion, marketing, distribution and service of medical devices in the U.S. to ensure that medical products distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses. In addition, the FDA regulates the export of medical devices manufactured in the U.S. to international markets and the importation of medical devices manufactured abroad. 

&#160; 

In many foreign countries in which we market our products, we are subject to regulations affecting, among other things, product standards, packaging requirements, labeling requirements, import restrictions, tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements. Many of these regulations are similar to those of the FDA or other U.S. regulations. In addition, our products must meet the requirements of a large and growing body of international standards which govern the design, manufacture, materials content and sourcing, testing, certification, packaging, installation, use and disposal of our products. Failure to meet these standards could limit the ability to market our products in those regions which require compliance to such standards. Examples of groups of such standards are electrical safety standards such as those of the International Electrotechnical Commission and composition standards such as the Reduction of Hazardous Substances (&#147;RoHS&#148;) and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (&#147;WEEE&#148;) Directives. 

U.S. Food and Drug Administration 

Unless an exemption applies, each medical device we wish to commercially market in the United States will require 510(k) clearance, de novo approval, or pre-market approval from the FDA. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes. Devices deemed to pose lower risks are placed in either Class I or II, which requires the manufacturer to submit to the FDA a pre-market notification requesting permission to commercially distribute the device, known as 510(k) clearance. Some low risk devices are exempted from this requirement. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, such as life-sustaining, or life-supporting, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device, are placed in Class III, requiring pre-market approval, or PMA. All of our current products are Class II devices requiring 510(k) clearances. Biosense Webster&#146;s compatible catheters used with our Niobe system are Class III therapeutic devices and are subject to the PMA process. 

If U.S. clinical data are needed to support clearance, approval or a marketing application for our devices, generally, an investigational device exemption, or IDE, is assembled and submitted to the FDA. The FDA reviews and must approve the IDE before the study can begin. In addition, the study must be approved by an Institutional Review Board covering each clinical site involved in the study. When all approvals are obtained, we initiate a clinical study to evaluate the device. Following completion of the study, we collect, analyze and present the data in an appropriate submission to the FDA (i.e. in support of a 510(k), de novo, or PMA). 

When a 510(k) clearance is required, we must submit a pre-market notification demonstrating that our proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared and legally marketed 510(k) device, de novo approved device, or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of pre-market approval applications. To establish substantial equivalence, the applicant must show that the new device has the same intended use as the predicate device, and it either has the same technological characteristics or has been shown to be equally safe and effective and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness as compared to the predicate device. The FDA may require further information, including clinical trial results or product test data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. The FDA&#146;s 510(k) clearance process usually takes from four to 12 months, but can take longer. 

If a device is not eligible for the 510(k) clearance process, but the product is low or moderate risk, we may be able to obtain de novo review. The de novo process allows FDA to classify a low- to moderate-risk device not previously classified into Class I or II. If the device is not eligible for either the 510(k) or de novo processes, a PMA must be submitted to the FDA. A PMA must be supported by extensive data, including but not limited to, technical, preclinical, clinical trials, manufacturing and labeling to demonstrate reasonable evidence of the device&#146;s safety and efficacy to the FDA&#146;s satisfaction. The PMA process is much more costly, lengthy and uncertain than the 510(k) clearance process, and it generally takes from one to three years, but can take longer. We cannot be sure that the FDA will ever grant 510(k) clearance, de novo approval or pre-market approval for any product we propose to market in the United States. 

After a device receives 510(k) clearance or de novo approval, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a significant change in its intended use, will require a 

&#160; 

new clearance. Modification to a PMA approved device or its labeling may require either a new PMA or PMA supplement approval, which could be a costly and lengthy process. 

After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include for example: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during product design and throughout the manufacturing process; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Labeling requirements and the FDA prohibitions against promoting products for uncleared, unapproved or &#147;off-label&#148; uses; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Medical device reporting regulations, which requires that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Reports of Corrections and Removals regulation, which requires manufacturers to report recalls and field actions to the FDA if initiated to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FD&#38;C Act. 

The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory enforcement powers. We are subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA to determine our compliance with the QSR and other regulations. If we fail to comply with the QSR or other regulatory requirements, we may receive a warning or untitled letter from the FDA or be subject to other enforcement actions, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, seizures, operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production, refusing requests for 510(k) clearance, de novo petitions, or PMA approval of new products, withdrawing 510(k) clearance, de novo approvals, or PMA approvals already granted, and criminal prosecution. The FDA also has the authority to require us to repair, replace or refund the cost of any medical device that we have manufactured or distributed, if there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious, adverse health consequences or death. 

International Regulation 

In order for us to market our products in other countries, we must obtain regulatory approvals and comply with extensive safety and quality regulations in other countries. These regulations, including the requirements for approvals or clearance and the time required for regulatory review, vary from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries may differ from that required to obtain FDA clearance or approval. 

The primary regulatory environment in Europe is that of the European Union, which encompasses most of the major countries in Europe. The European Union, along with other member countries of the European Economic Area, or EEA, requires that manufacturers of medical products obtain the right to affix the CE Mark to their products before selling them in member countries of the EEA. The CE Mark is an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards and compliance with applicable directives. In order to obtain the right to affix the CE Mark to products, a manufacturer must obtain certification that its processes meet certain quality standards. Compliance with the Medical Device Directive, as certified by a recognized European Notified Body, permits the medical device manufacturer to affix the CE Mark on its products and commercially distribute those products throughout the EEA. We are subject to annual surveillance audits and periodic re-certification audits in order to maintain our CE Mark permissions. 

To be sold in Japan, most medical devices must undergo thorough safety examinations and demonstrate medical efficacy before they receive regulatory (&#147;Shonin&#148;) approval. We are subject to additional regulations in other foreign countries, including, but not limited to, Canada, Taiwan, China, Korea, and Russia, in order to sell our products. We intend that either we or our distributors will receive any necessary approvals or clearance prior to marketing our products in these international markets. 

&#160; 

Please refer to &#147;Regulatory Approval&#148; in Item 1 of this annual report for a description of the regulatory clearance, licensing and/or approvals we currently have or are pursuing. 

Anti-Kickback and False Claims Laws 

We are subject to various federal and state laws relating to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback and false claims laws. The U.S. federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The definition of &#147;remuneration&#148; has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash and waivers of payments, and providing anything of value at less than fair market value. Penalties for violations include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines, imprisonment and possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. Federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. Recently, several healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws 

Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Statute and the federal false claims laws. Some of these state prohibitions apply to healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 

Transparency Laws 

Under the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, or the Sunshine Act, which was enacted by Congress as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, we are required to track and report to the federal government on an annual basis, subject to certain exceptions, all payments and other transfers of value to U.S. physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership interests held by physicians. Such data are made available by the government on a publicly searchable website. In addition, we are subject to similar state laws related to the tracking and reporting of certain payments and other transfers of value to healthcare professionals. 

HIPAA and Other Privacy Laws 

We are subject to laws and regulations protecting the privacy and integrity of patient medical information, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information, and the applicable Privacy and Security Standards of HITECH, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act. HIPAA also prohibits executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters. In addition to federal regulations issued under HIPAA, some states and foreign countries have enacted privacy and security statutes or regulations that, in some cases, are more stringent than those issued under HIPAA. In those cases, it may be necessary to modify our operations and procedures to comply with the more stringent state and foreign laws, which may entail significant and costly changes for us. 

Certificate of Need Laws 

In a number of states in the U.S., a certificate of need or similar regulatory approval is required prior to the acquisition of high-cost capital items or various types of advanced medical equipment, such as our Niobe system. Many of the states in which we sell Niobe systems have laws that require institutions located in those states to 

&#160; 

obtain a certificate of need in connection with the purchase of our system, and some of our purchase orders are conditioned upon our customer&#146;s receipt of necessary certificate of need approval. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 126 employees, 22 of whom were engaged directly in research and development, 57 in sales and marketing activities, 19 in manufacturing and service, 6 in regulatory, clinical affairs and quality activities, 5 in training activities and 17 in general administrative and accounting activities. A significant majority of our employees is not covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
