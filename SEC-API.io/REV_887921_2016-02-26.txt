Today, the Company continues Revson's legacy by producing and marketing innovative products that address consumers' wants and needs for beauty and personal care products. 

The Company currently operates in three segments: the consumer division (&#8220;Consumer&#8221;); the professional division (&#8220;Professional&#8221;); and Other.

Recent Transactions 

2015 Efficiency Program 

In September 2015, the Company initiated restructuring actions to drive certain organizational efficiencies across the Company's Consumer and Professional segments (the "2015 Efficiency Program"). These actions are designed to reduce general and administrative expenses within the Consumer and Professional segments, and are expected to be completed by 2017. The Company recognized $9.5 million of restructuring and related charges during 2015 for the 2015 Efficiency Program and expects to recognize total restructuring and related charges of $10.1 million &#32;by the end of 2017. By implementing the 2015 Efficiency Program, the Company expects to achieve annualized cost reductions of approximately $10.0 million to $15.0 million by the end of 2018, of which approximately $3.0 million benefited the Company's 2015 results. For further discussion of the 2015 Efficiency Program, see Note 3, "Restructuring Charges - 2015 Efficiency Program" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. 

Acquisition of CBBeauty Group 

On April 21, 2015 &#32;(the "CBB Acquisition Date"), the Company completed the CBB Acquisition for total cash consideration of $48.6 million . CBB develops, manufactures, markets and distributes fragrances and other beauty products under various celebrity, lifestyle and fashion brands licensed from third parties, principally through department stores and selective distribution in international territories. CBB is expected to provide the Company with a platform to develop the Company's presence in the fragrance category. On the CBB Acquisition Date, the Company used cash on hand to pay 70% &#32;of the total cash consideration, or $34.6 million . The remaining $14.0 million &#32;of the total cash consideration is payable in equal installments over 4 years &#32;from the CBB Acquisition Date, subject to the selling shareholders' compliance with certain service conditions. These remaining installments are being recorded as a component of SG&#38;A expenses ratably over the 4-year installment period. The results of operations of the CBB business were included in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements commencing on the CBB Acquisition Date. See Note 2, "Business Combinations," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further details on the CBB Acquisition. 

Debt Transactions 

In March 2015, Products Corporation prepaid $24.6 million &#32;of term loan indebtedness, representing 50% of its 2014 &#8220;excess cash flow" in accordance with the terms of its amended term loan agreement, which facility is comprised of: (i) the term loan due November 19, 2017, in the original aggregate principal amount of $675.0 million , which had $660.6 million &#32;in aggregate principal balance outstanding as of December 31, 2015 (the "2011 Term Loan"); and (ii) the term loan due October 8, 2019 in the original aggregate principal amount of $700 million , which had $672.5 million &#32;in aggregate principal balance outstanding as of December 31, 2015 (the "Acquisition Term Loan") (together, the "Amended Term Loan Agreement"). The prepayment was applied on a ratable basis between the principal amounts outstanding under the 2011 Term Loan and the Acquisition Term Loan. The amount of the prepayment that was applied to the 2011 Term Loan reduced the principal amount outstanding by $12.1 million &#32;to $662.9 million &#32;(as all amortization payments under the 2011 Term Loan had been paid). The $12.5 million &#32;applied to the Acquisition Term Loan reduced Products Corporation's future regularly scheduled quarterly amortization payments under the Acquisition Term Loan on a ratable basis from $1.8 million &#32;prior to the prepayment to $1.7 million &#32;after giving effect to the prepayment and through its maturity on October 8, 2019.
