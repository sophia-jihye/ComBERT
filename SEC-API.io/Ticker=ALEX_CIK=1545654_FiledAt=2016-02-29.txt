 ITEMS 1 &#38; 2. BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES 

Overview 

Alexander &#38; Baldwin, Inc. (&#8220;A&#38;B&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;), whose history in Hawaii dates back to 1870, is a premier Hawaii company with interests in real estate development, real estate leasing, materials and construction, and agribusiness. A&#38;B&#8217;s assets include over 87,700 acres in Hawaii, 4.9 million &#32;square feet of high-quality retail, office and industrial properties in Hawaii and on the Mainland, and a real estate development portfolio encompassing residential and commercial projects across Hawaii. A&#38;B's real estate holdings make it the state's fourth largest private landowner (by acreage) and largest owner of grocery-anchored retail properties (by gross leasable area "GLA"). In October 2013, A&#38;B acquired Grace Pacific LLC (&#8220;Grace&#8221;)&#8213;the largest materials and paving company in Hawaii. 

A&#38;B is headquartered in Honolulu and operates in four segments&#8213;Real Estate Development and Sales, Real Estate Leasing, Materials and Construction, and Agribusiness. A&#38;B's business segments are generally as follows: 

A. 

Real Estate: The Company's two real estate segments engage in real estate development and ownership activities, including planning, zoning, financing, constructing, purchasing, managing, leasing, selling, exchanging and investing in real property. Real estate activities are conducted through A&#38;B Properties, Inc. and other wholly owned subsidiaries of A&#38;B. 

&#8226; 

Real Estate Development and Sales &#32;- generates its revenues and creates value through an active and comprehensive program of land stewardship, planning, entitlement, development, real estate investment and sale of land and commercial and residential properties, principally in Hawaii. 

&#8226; 

Real Estate Leasing - owns, operates, and manages a portfolio of 58 &#32;high-quality retail, office and industrial properties in Hawaii and on the Mainland totaling 4.9 million &#32;square feet of GLA, including 42 &#32;acres on Oahu (improved with 660,000 &#32;square feet of commercial space owned by the ground lessees) and 64 acres on the neighbor islands ground leased to tenants. The significant recurring cash flow generated by this portfolio and ground leases serves as an important source of funding for A&#38;B&#8217;s Real Estate Development and Sales segment activities. 

B. 

Materials and Construction: performs asphalt paving as prime contractor and subcontractor; imports and sells liquid asphalt; mines, processes and sells basalt aggregate; produces and sells concrete; provides and sells various construction- and traffic-control-related products; and manufactures and sells precast concrete products. 

C. 

Agribusiness: produces and sells bulk raw sugar, specialty food grade sugars and molasses; provides general trucking services, mobile equipment maintenance and repair services; leases agricultural land to third parties; and generates and sells electricity to the extent not used in segment operations. In January 2016, the Company announced that it would be transitioning out of farming sugar and instead pursue a diversified agricultural model. The final sugar harvest is expected to be completed by the end of 2016, and the transition to a new model will occur over a multi-year period. 

The following table contains key information regarding each of the Company&#8217;s segments. Since the purchase and sale of real estate is generally considered an ongoing and recurring activity of its real estate businesses, Real Estate Development and Sales segment revenue includes amounts related to sales of commercial property.

Competitive Strengths 

The Company has significant competitive strengths in Hawaii that it can leverage to create shareholder value. 

Premier Hawaii Assets: 

&#8226; 

Extensive, premium landholdings: A&#38;B is the fourth largest private landowner in Hawaii, with over 87,700 acres, primarily on Maui and Kauai, including 837 acres fully entitled for urban use, which includes 190 acres under commercial improved properties. 

&#8226; 

High-quality commercial real estate portfolio and ground leases producing strong free cash flow: A&#38;B owns and manages a high-quality commercial portfolio of 58 properties in Hawaii and five Mainland states, totaling 4.9 million square feet, and has 106 acres of urban land in Hawaii leased to third parties, both of which provide significant, stable recurring cash flows that support A&#38;B&#8217;s real estate investment activities. A&#38;B's retail holdings make it the largest owner of grocery-anchored retail properties in Hawaii (by GLA). 

&#8226; 

Diverse pipeline of development projects: A&#38;B&#8217;s development pipeline encompasses over a dozen resort residential, primary residential and commercial projects comprising more than 3,000 units throughout the State of Hawaii, which provides for substantial embedded growth opportunities. 

&#8226; 

Prime agricultural real estate in Hawaii: A&#38;B farms approximately 36,000 acres of mostly contiguous lands in Maui&#8217;s central valley with extensive infrastructure to meet the water, power and transportation needs of large-scale agronomic activity. Additionally, A&#38;B owns approximately 7,000 acres of high-quality agricultural land on Kauai&#8217;s sunny south shore, of which over 4,000 acres are leased to other parties for a variety of agricultural uses, principally for the cultivation of coffee. 

&#8226; 

Infrastructure-related assets: A&#38;B &#32;owns over 800 acres in the state related to its quarrying operations, including 541 acres on Oahu's growing west side. A&#38;B's Makakilo, Oahu quarry facility completed a multi-year capital improvement program in September 2015, including three new asphaltic concrete plants, which is expected to result in greater operational efficiencies and lower costs going forward. Due to the high cost of transporting aggregate, A&#38;B's quarry is ideally situated on Oahu's west side, which is expected to see significant growth over the next two decades. In addition to three Oahu plants, A&#38;B also owns strategically placed asphaltic concrete plants located throughout the state in Maui (one location), Kauai (one location), Hawaii Island (one location) and Molokai (two locations). 

Leading Hawaii Real Estate Capabilities: 

&#8226; 

Experienced management team with deep local knowledge and expertise: A&#38;B has been in the development business in Hawaii since 1949 when it established Kahului Development Co., Ltd. to develop and market &#8220;Dream City,&#8221; which today is Kahului, Maui&#8217;s principal population center and commercial hub. In the ensuing decades, A&#38;B has expanded and diversified its pipeline of development projects and broadened its development capabilities and expertise. For instance, A&#38;B developed the world famous Wailea master-planned resort community on Maui&#8217;s south shore in the 1970s and 1980s and has continued to broaden its development activities since. The Company&#8217;s knowledge, expertise and relationships forged through over six decades of Hawaii development activity, combined with disciplined underwriting, enable it to profitably pursue a wide range of long-term commercial and residential developments in a manner that is both responsive to market needs and sensitive to local concerns. This local knowledge and expertise, combined with the Company&#8217;s strong financial position, also serves to make A&#38;B an ideal partner for landowners, developers and others seeking to participate in the Hawaii real estate sector. 

&#8226; 

Track record of success: A&#38;B has an extensive track record of investing in Hawaii real estate. Since 2000, A&#38;B has invested approximately $700 million in Hawaii real estate development projects outside of its legacy holdings&#8213;including seven high-rise condominiums in urban Honolulu&#8213;and over $1.5 billion in the acquisition of Hawaii and Mainland commercial properties, mainly through tax-deferred property exchanges. 

Leading Materials and Construction Capabilities: 

&#8226; 

Leading market position: A&#38;B holds a leading market position in asphalt paving and in the production of asphaltic concrete, and also is the largest producer of aggregate in Hawaii. Due to the relatively high capital requirements needed to compete in the market, A&#38;B&#8217;s scale provides a cost advantage relative to other competitors in the state. A&#38;B is positioned to benefit from continued strength in the Hawaii economy and the impact that is expected to have on infrastructure spending and private development activity. For example, the condition of Hawaii&#8217;s roads, in general, and Oahu&#8217;s roads, in particular, is consistently ranked near the bottom as compared to other states and metropolitan areas and, as a result, the City and County of Honolulu administration (the "City") has maintained its annual road maintenance budget in excess of $100 million for the past several years, with $120 million budgeted for the City's fiscal year 2016 (July 1, 2015 to June 30, 2016). 

&#8226; 

Experienced management team: In addition to its unique tangible assets, the segment's management team has extensive expertise in quarry management and operations, asphaltic concrete production, asphalt paving, and precast concrete production. 

&#8226; 

Vertically integrated business model: A&#38;B&#8217;s vertically integrated business model, which includes the mining of basalt aggregate and the importation and distribution of liquid asphalt, provides it with cost benefits at higher throughput rates, while also increasing cost certainty due to the ability to manage costs throughout the supply chain. This cost certainty allows A&#38;B to compete effectively as an efficient, high-quality, low-cost provider. In addition, A&#38;B provides and markets various construction- and traffic-control-related products and services. 

Strategy 

A&#38;B strives to create value by leveraging its extensive asset base, knowledge of and experience in the Hawaii market to make superior investments in real estate in Hawaii. A&#38;B has a long track record of successfully investing in Hawaii real estate and believes that Hawaii has attractive opportunities for growth. Management is focused on strategically positioning the Company to capitalize on this growth. 

Additional details regarding A&#38;B&#8217;s key strategies follow: 

Land: 

&#8226; 

Employ lands at their highest and best use: A&#38;B strives to maximize value in its legacy landholdings by employing land at its highest and best use to the benefit of shareholders, employees, its communities and other key stakeholder groups. For a significant portion of A&#38;B&#8217;s substantial Hawaii landholdings, this implies a wide spectrum of non-development uses, ranging from conservation/watershed to pasture to active farming. While a material portion of A&#38;B&#8217;s landholdings has limited or no long-term urban development potential, these landholdings remain valuable for farming and other uses, such as providing access to natural resources or hydro-electric generation capability. 

&#8226; 

Entitle and develop core Hawaii lands: A&#38;B continually focuses on entitling and developing a portion of its core landholdings in Hawaii to respond to market demand while meeting community needs. 

Commercial Properties: 

&#8226; 

Optimize returns of A&#38;B&#8217;s commercial portfolio: A&#38;B seeks to organically grow its commercial portfolio through active management, including repositioning and redevelopment activities, in order to increase occupancy, secure quality tenants and reduce costs, with the ultimate goal of maximizing the financial performance of these properties. 

&#8226; 

Migrate the commercial portfolio to Hawaii from the Mainland: A&#38;B is focused on opportunistically migrating its Mainland portfolio to Hawaii over time, where it believes it can leverage its market knowledge and proximity to generate greater incremental shareholder value over the long run. 

Real Estate Investment: 

&#8226; 

Invest in high-returning real estate opportunities in Hawaii: A&#38;B is focused on pursuing and investing in attractive real estate opportunities in Hawaii where it can leverage its market knowledge, experience and financial strength to create significant value and, at the same time, expand and diversify its existing portfolio and pipeline. 

&#8226; 

Build a pipeline of development projects scaled to market opportunities and designed to optimize risk-adjusted returns: A&#38;B owns a valuable pipeline of development projects encompassing a wide-range of product types, from resort residential real estate, to commercial and industrial, to primary residential housing. A&#38;B employs a disciplined approach to its investments and prudently invests capital to position select projects to meet anticipated market demand. A&#38;B pursues joint ventures, where appropriate, to supplement its in-house capabilities, access third-party capital, gain access to new opportunities in the Hawaii market, diversify its pipeline and optimize risk-adjusted returns. 

Materials and Construction: 

&#8226; 

Leverage vertically integrated business model to lower costs: A&#38;B maintains cost benefits through a vertically integrated business model that encompasses the production of aggregate and the importation of liquid asphalt and sand. These activities help ensure that A&#38;B has adequate access to raw materials needed to produce asphaltic concrete and, therefore, also provides for a level of cost certainty that allows A&#38;B to compete effectively on sealed-bid contracts. In addition, A&#38;B and its consolidated and non-consolidated affiliated companies provide and market various construction- and traffic-control-related products and services. 

&#8226; 

Capitalize on strategically located quarry adjacent to growing area on Oahu: A&#38;B owns one of two operating quarries on the island of Oahu that has suitable grade A material required for the production of hot mix asphalt. A&#38;B's quarry is also the only quarry located adjacent to the growing region on the west side of Oahu. It is proximate to the first two phases of the Honolulu Rail Project and to more than 15,000 residential units and various commercial projects, which are projected in the future. Due to the high cost of transporting aggregate and the limited shelf life of asphaltic concrete once it is produced, A&#38;B&#8217;s quarry and hot mix plant locations in west Oahu are ideally located to service the growth in the area for the foreseeable future. 

Agriculture: 

&#8226; 

Grow renewable energy operations: A&#38;B is a leading provider of renewable energy on Kauai, and in recent years, has added high-returning renewable solar generation to its portfolio. A&#38;B continues to evaluate and further capitalize on new renewable energy opportunities in Hawaii to expand its portfolio and support the State of Hawaii's Clean Energy Initiative.

(2) Planning and Zoning 

The entitlement process for development of property in Hawaii is complex, lengthy (spanning multiple years) and costly (involving numerous state and county regulatory approvals). For example, conversion of an agriculturally-zoned parcel usually requires the following approvals: 

&#8226; 

County amendment of the County General Plan to reflect residential use; 

&#8226; 

State Land Use Commission approval to reclassify the parcel from the Agricultural district to the Urban district; 

&#8226; 

County amendment of the County Community Plan to reflect land use; and 

&#8226; 

County approval to rezone the property to the precise land use desired. 

The entitlement process is complicated by the conditions, restrictions and exactions that are placed on these approvals, including, among others, the requirement to construct infrastructure improvements, payment of impact fees, restrictions on the permitted uses of the land, requirement to provide affordable housing and required phased development of projects. 

A&#38;B actively works with regulatory agencies, commissions and legislative bodies at various levels of government to obtain zoning reclassification of land to its highest and best use for both investment and development. A&#38;B designates a parcel as &#8220;fully entitled&#8221; or &#8220;fully zoned&#8221; when all of the above-mentioned land use approvals have been obtained.

A&#38;B&#8217;s major active projects include: 

Maui: 

(a) &#160; Maui Business Park II. &#32;Maui Business Park II (&#8220;MBP II&#8221;), 154 acres ( 136 acres &#32;salable; 106 acres remain salable at December 31, 2015) in Kahului zoned for light industrial, retail and office use, represents the second phase of the Company&#8217;s Maui Business Park project. A 4-acre parcel was sold in 2012 for a Costco gas station. In 2013, a 24-acre parcel adjacent to Maui Business Park was sold for the development of Maui&#8217;s first Target-anchored center, which opened in March 2015 and has contributed to strong sales activity at MBP II. In 2014, 7.2 acres were sold to the County of Maui, American Savings Bank, and Shelton Holdings (BMW) for $14.4 million. In 2015, 18.4 acres were sold to Lowe's, Servco Pacific, Pacific Pipe, and Kihei Auto for $33.5 million. 

(b) &#160; Wailea. In October 2003, A&#38;B reacquired 270 acres of fully-zoned, undeveloped residential and commercial land at the Wailea Resort on Maui for $67.1 million. A&#38;B was the original developer of the Wailea Resort, beginning in the 1970s and continuing until A&#38;B sold the resort to the Shinwa Golf Group in 1989. 

Since reacquisition, A&#38;B has sold approximately 110 acres, and currently owns about 160 acres, which are planned for up to 700 units. A&#38;B is in various stages of development or sale for various parcels within Wailea, which include the following projects: 

&#8226; 

At the 7.4-acre MF-11 (Keala o Wailea) project, A&#38;B&#8217;s 70 unit multi-family joint venture development with Armstrong Builders, construction commenced in December 2015. Of the 50 units released for pre-sale, 30 units are under binding contracts. Closings are projected to commence in 2017. 

&#8226; 

The 6-acre MF-19 parcel (Ridge at Wailea) was developed into nine residential lots. Eight lots remain available for sale. 

&#8226; 

At the 11-acre B-1 parcel, A&#38;B continues to evaluate bulk sale or development options. 

(c) &#160; Kamalani. A&#38;B&#8217;s Kamalani project is a 630-unit residential project on 95 acres in Kihei, Maui. During 2015, significant progress was made in design work, securing requisite government approvals and marketing of the project. Preliminary subdivision approval was secured in April 2015. Pre-sales and construction are expected to commence in in March 2016. 

Kauai: 

(d) &#160; Kukui`ula. &#32;In April 2002, A&#38;B entered into a joint venture with DMB Communities II (&#8220;DMBC&#8221;), an affiliate of DMB Associates, Inc. ("DMB"), an Arizona-based developer of master-planned communities, for the development of Kukui&#8217;ula, a 1,000-acre master planned resort residential community located in Poipu, Kauai, planned for up to 1,500 resort residential units. As of December 31, 2015, total capital contributed to the joint venture by A&#38;B was approximately $280 million, which included $30 million representing the value of land initially contributed by the Company. As of December 31, 2015, DMB has contributed approximately $190 million. 

Offsite infrastructure is complete for 500 to 800 units and all resort core amenities were completed and opened for business in 2011, including the Tom Weiskopf-designed championship golf course, an owners' clubhouse, pool and spa facilities, and a golf clubhouse. Increased vertical home construction activity at Kukui&#8217;ula continues to generate positive sales momentum, with 22 closings in 2015 and eight additional units under binding contracts as of December 31, 2015. The various vertical construction programs are being pursued in joint ventures with five third-party developers. As of December 31, 2015, a total of 134 units had closed, and 72 lots and 8 houses were available for purchase. 

Oahu: 

(e) &#160; Kahala Avenue Portfolio. In September and December 2013, A&#38;B acquired a total of 30 properties for approximately $128 million in the prestigious Kahala neighborhood of East Honolulu. These properties were in various stages of disrepair and A&#38;B immediately commenced clearing, landscape maintenance, and sales and marketing. Through December 31, 2015, revenue from sales totaled $123 million. As of December 31, 2015, nine lots were available for purchase totaling approximately 245,000 square feet. The nine available properties include four higher-value oceanfront properties totaling approximately 174,000 square feet or 71% of the total square footage available for purchase. 

(f) &#160; The Collection. &#32;In 2012, A&#38;B secured an option agreement with Kamehameha Schools for the development of a 3.3-acre city block near downtown Honolulu. The project includes a 396-unit high-rise condominium tower, 14 three-bedroom townhomes and a 54-unit mid-rise building. In August 2014, a joint venture was formed for the project development. The land was acquired from Kamehameha Schools and construction commenced in October 2014, with completion projected by year-end 2016. As of December 31, 2015, all 396 tower units and 54 mid-rise units and four townhomes were under binding contracts. Construction of all phases is projected to be completed in late 2016. 

(g) &#160; Waihonua at Kewalo . In 2010, A&#38;B acquired a fully-entitled high-rise condominium development site near the Ala Moana Center in Honolulu. Sales and marketing commenced in December 2011 for a 340 saleable-unit project. In September 2012, the Company formed a joint venture for the development of the project. By July 2013, all 340 units were sold under binding contracts. Construction was completed in November 2014, and 12 units closed in December 2014. The remaining 328 units closed in January 2015. 

(h) &#160; Keauhou Place. &#32;In October 2015, A&#38;B closed its $35 million &#8220;B-note&#8221; investment in the 423-unit Keauhou Place residential condominium in Kaka&#8217;ako. Although construction commenced in October 2015, A&#38;B does not expect to fund its investment until mid-2016. As of December 31, 2015, 349 of the project's 422 units have been sold, with 345 units under binding contracts.

C. &#160; Materials and Construction 

(1) &#160; Business 

Major activities of the Materials and Construction segment include asphalt paving as prime contractor and subcontractor; importing and selling liquid asphalt; mining, processing and selling rock and sand aggregate; producing and selling asphaltic and ready-mix concrete; providing and selling various construction- and traffic-control-related products and manufacturing and selling precast concrete products. Segment activities are conducted through Grace and its consolidated and non-consolidated affiliates. 

The market for Grace&#8217;s business can be generally divided into the public sector market and the private sector market. The public sector construction market includes spending by federal, state and county governments for road and highway paving, aggregate materials, and highway-related maintenance and management services. In general, public sector spending is less cyclical than private sector construction projects. Approximately 90 percent of Grace&#8217;s paving revenue in 2015 was directly or indirectly attributable to public sector contracts. The private sector construction market includes spending for commercial and residential asphalt paving and material sales. Private sector spending is generally more cyclical than public sector spending and is primarily driven by economic conditions in Hawaii. 

Aggregate: Aggregate production involves drilling and blasting rock from quarries, crushing the rock to appropriate sizes and screening materials after extraction to separate aggregate into two grades with more than 20 gradations with varying specifications. Basalt aggregate is used in the construction industry for residential and commercial developments, highways, roads, asphaltic concrete and ready-mix concrete products. Based on production in 2015, Grace was the largest producer of basalt aggregate in the state. Grace also has a recycling plant that accepts demolition concrete and reclaimed aggregate material from job sites for a fee and recycles them into salable aggregate products. Aggregate can also be imported into Hawaii from abroad to meet the state&#8217;s needs. Due to the high cost of handling and transporting aggregate, location is an important driver in determining a customer&#8217;s preferred source. 

Asphaltic Concrete (hot mix asphalt): Grace imports liquid asphalt through its 70 percent-owned consolidated subsidiary, GLP Asphalt, LLC (GLP), for use in the manufacture of asphaltic concrete. Asphaltic concrete is produced by heating asphalt to a liquid consistency, drying the aggregate to remove moisture, and mixing the liquid asphalt with the aggregate in "hot mix plants." Asphaltic concrete consists of approximately 94 percent aggregate and 6 percent asphalt. Due to the high cost of transporting rock, Grace will generally utilize aggregate sources nearest to its hot mix asphalt plant and/or locate its hot mix plant next to the aggregate resource. Grace sources liquid asphalt through GLP, which purchases asphalt from Venezuela, Canada, and other foreign locations, typically several times a year, depending on demand and the size of the available shipments. GLP is currently the only local distributor of liquid asphalt in the state, and approximately 65 percent of GLP asphalt sales are to Grace and a non-consolidated affiliate. Liquid asphalt can also be imported in 20-ton transit tankers 

from refineries on the U.S. West Coast. Approximately 20 percent of asphaltic concrete produced by Grace is sold to third parties and the remainder is used on construction jobs by Grace's asphalt paving division or a non-consolidated affiliate. 

Asphalt Paving: The asphalt paving market is predominately composed of paving projects contracted by federal, state and county agencies. The contracts are based on competitive sealed bids, with the bid awarded to a qualified contractor with the lowest bid. Approximately 90 percent of all asphalt paving work performed by Grace in 2015 was for federal, state and county governmental entities. The remainder of the work consists of private contracts, such as residential and commercial developments. 

Grace&#8217;s primary paving competitors include Jas A. Glover, Ltd.; Roads and Highways, LLC (a division of Sterling Construction-NASDAQ: STRL); Road Builders Corp.; and Maui Kupono Builders, LLC/Maui Master Builders, Inc. 

Construction- and Traffic-Control-Related Products: Through various consolidated subsidiaries, Grace provides a range of construction-related products. Grace&#8217;s wholly owned subsidiary, GP Roadway Solutions, Inc. (&#8220;GPRS&#8221;) operates as a subcontractor and prime contractor and provides guardrail, fencing and sign installation, and maintenance; rents and sells safety and traffic control equipment and supplies; provides traffic control services; provides road and parking lot striping, seal coating and crack sealing, and security services; and performs application of maintenance-related encapsulation product. Grace&#8217;s 51 percent-owned GP/RM Prestress, LLC (&#8220;GP/RM&#8221;) is a manufacturer and supplier in the prestressed and precast concrete industry. GP/RM fabricates architectural concrete products such as exterior columns, walls and spandrels in a variety of colors with varying finishes and features used in the construction of parking structures, buildings and high rises. GP/RM is also a major supplier of structural concrete products such as rectangular, hexagonal and octagonal columns; various types of beams, double tees, walls, spandrels, stairs, flat slabs, bridge girders, planks; and stadium bleachers used to support various types of structures. In addition, other construction materials and products are sold by non-consolidated affiliates. 

As of December 31, 2015, total backlog, which consists of signed contracts and awarded contracts not yet executed, including the backlog of Grace, GPRS, GP/RM and Maui Paving, LLC, a 50-percent-owned non-consolidated affiliate, totaled approximately $226.5 million , compared to $219.4 million &#32;at December 31, 2014. For purposes of calculating backlog, the entire estimated revenue attributable to Grace's consolidated subsidiaries and all of the backlog of Maui Paving, which was approximately $13.9 million and $38.1 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, was included. Backlog represents the amount of revenue that Grace and Maui Paving expect to realize on contracts awarded primarily related to asphalt paving and, to a lesser extent, Grace&#8217;s consolidated revenue from GPRS and GP/RM. 

&#32;The length of time that projects remain in backlog can span from a few days for a small volume of work to approximately 36 months for large paving contracts and contracts performed in phases. Backlog includes estimated revenue from the remaining portion of contracts not yet completed, as well as revenue from approved change orders. 

(2) &#160; Assets 

Quarries: &#32;&#32;Grace owns 541 acres in Makakilo, Oahu, approximately 200 acres of which are used for its quarrying operations. Approximately 800,000 tons of rock were mined and processed by Grace in 2015. The operation of the quarry is governed by special and conditional use permits, which allow Grace to extract aggregate through 2032. Grace also owns approximately 265 acres on Molokai, which are licensed to a third-party operator for quarrying operations. 

Grace began the infrastructure work for new crushing plants, which are used to reduce large rocks down to salable grade aggregate, at the Makakilo quarry in April 2012. Primary and secondary crushing plants are used to reduce quarried rock to a 4&#8221; to 5&#8221; &#8220;surge&#8221; material. The surge is then processed at the finish plants, where the rock is further reduced and screened to exact product specifications. The erection of the new &#8220;A&#8221; grade finish plant began in January 2013, and was online at the end of September 2013. The existing &#8220;B&#8221; grade finish plant upgrade was completed in December 2014. The new primary and secondary crushing plants were completed in 2015. The new facilities are expected to increase the productivity and efficiency of the operations, resulting in lower production costs. Through December 31, 2015, approximately $43.0 million has been incurred related to the quarry improvements ($33.8 million was incurred by Grace prior to its acquisition by A&#38;B in 2013). 

Equipment: &#32;&#32;Grace owns approximately 530 pieces of on- and off-highway rolling stock, which consists of heavy duty trucks, passenger vehicles and various road paving, quarrying and operations equipment. Additionally, Grace owns approximately 550 pieces of non-rolling stock items used in its operations, such as generators, transit tankers, light towers, message boards and nuclear gauges. The Materials and Construction segment has six rock crushing plants and eight asphaltic concrete plants (three on Oahu, one on Maui, one on Kauai, one on Hawaii island, and two on Molokai). 

D. Agribusiness 

(1) &#160; Agribusiness Operations 

A&#38;B&#8217;s current Agribusiness and related operations consist of: (1) a sugar plantation on the island of Maui, operated by its Hawaiian Commercial &#38; Sugar Company (&#8220;HC&#38;S&#8221;) division, (2) renewable energy operations on the island of Kauai, operated by McBryde Resources, Inc. (&#8220;McBryde&#8221;), (3) Kahului Trucking &#38; Storage, Inc. (&#8220;KT&#38;S&#8221;), which provides several types of trucking services, including sugar and molasses hauling on Maui, mobile equipment maintenance and repair services on Maui, Kauai, and the Big Island, and self-service storage facilities on Maui and Kauai, and (4) Hawaiian Sugar &#38; Transportation Cooperative (&#8220;HS&#38;TC&#8221;), an agricultural cooperative that provides raw sugar marketing and transportation services solely to HC&#38;S. HS&#38;TC owns the MV Moku Pahu, a Jones Act-qualified integrated tug barge bulk dry carrier, which is used to transport raw sugar and molasses from Hawaii to the U.S. West Coast and coal from the U.S. West Coast to Hawaii. 

On December 31, 2015, the Company determined that it would cease its sugar operations at HC&#38;S (the "Cessation"), which will result in the eventual layoff of over 650 employees. The sugar operation is expected to be phased out by the end of 2016, and the transition to a new diversified agriculture model will occur over a multi-year period. 

The Company currently projects recording total pre-tax book charges related to the Cessation in the range of $112 million to $133 million ($68 million to $81 million, net of taxes), which consists of $23 million to $28 million of employee severance and related benefit charges, $69 million to $76 million of accelerated depreciation and asset write-offs, and $20 million to $29 million of property removal, restoration and other exit-related costs. Of the $112 million to $133 million of total pre-tax book charges mentioned above, approximately $69 million to $76 million will be non-cash charges and approximately $43 million to $57 million will be cash outlays, primarily related to employee severance and compensation benefits and property removal, restoration and other exit-related costs. Net of tax benefits, the cash outlays related to the Cessation will range from approximately $11 million to $21 million. However, the total net cash outlays related to the Cessation are projected to be offset by cash proceeds generated from the final harvest, based on current production estimates and sugar prices. 

(2) &#160; Marketing of Sugar 

Approximately 92 percent of the sugar produced by HC&#38;S in 2015 was bulk raw sugar purchased by C&#38;H Sugar Company, Inc. (&#8220;C&#38;H&#8221;), based in Crockett, California. C&#38;H processes the raw cane sugar at its refinery at Crockett, California and markets the refined products primarily in the western and central United States. Pursuant to a supply contract with HS&#38;TC, the raw sugar is sold to C&#38;H at forward price contracts equal to the New York No. 16 Contract settlement price at the time of executed market trades, or mutually agreed upon pricing also based on current New York No. 16 Contract prices. 

The remaining sugar produced by HC&#38;S was specialty food-grade sugars, which are sold by HC&#38;S to food and beverage producers and to retail stores under its Maui Brand &#174; &#32;label, and to distributors that license our trademarks or repackage the sugars under their own labels. HC&#38;S&#8217;s largest food-grade sugar customers are Cumberland Packing Corp., which repackages HC&#38;S&#8217;s turbinado sugar for its &#8220;Sugar in the Raw&#8221; product line, and Sugar Foods Corporation, which licenses HC&#38;S&#8217;s Maui Brand &#174; &#32;label for exclusive use outside of Hawaii. 

(3) &#160; Land Designations and Water 

The HC&#38;S sugar plantation consists of 43,300 acres, with approximately 36,000 acres under active sugar cane cultivation. 

On Kauai, approximately 3,000 acres are cultivated in coffee by Massimo Zanetti Beverage USA, Inc., which leases the land from A&#38;B. Additional acreage is cultivated in seed corn and used for pasture purposes. 

The Hawaii Legislature, in 2005, passed Important Agricultural Lands (&#8220;IAL&#8221;) legislation to fulfill the state constitutional mandate to protect agricultural lands, promote diversified agriculture, increase the state&#8217;s agricultural self-sufficiency, and assure the long-term availability of agriculturally suitable lands. In 2008, the Legislature passed a package of incentives, which is necessary to trigger the IAL system of land designation. In 2009, A&#38;B received approval from the State Land Use Commission for the designation of over 27,000 acres on Maui and over 3,700 acres on Kauai as IAL. These designations were the result of voluntary petitions filed by A&#38;B. 

A&#38;B holds rights to an irrigation system in West Maui, which provided approximately 13 percent of the irrigation water used by HC&#38;S over the last ten years. A&#38;B also owns 16,000 acres of watershed lands in East Maui, which supply a portion of the irrigation water used by HC&#38;S. A&#38;B also held four water licenses to another 30,000 acres owned by the State of Hawaii in East Maui, which over the last ten years have supplied approximately 56 percent of the irrigation water used by HC&#38;S. The last of these water license agreements expired in 1986, and all four agreements were then extended as revocable 

permits that were renewed annually. In 2001, a request was made to the State Board of Land and Natural Resources (the &#8220;BLNR&#8221;) to replace these revocable permits with a long-term water lease. Pending the conclusion by the BLNR of this contested case hearing on the request for the long-term lease, the BLNR has renewed the existing permits on a holdover basis, which has been the subject of litigation. In January 2016, the state court ruled that the BLNR lacked legal authority to keep the revocable permits in holdover status beyond one year. The court has allowed for an immediate appeal of this ruling. For information regarding legal proceedings involving A&#38;B&#8217;s irrigation systems, see &#8220;Legal Proceedings&#8221; below. 

(4) &#160; Energy 

HC&#38;S uses bagasse, the residual fiber of the sugar cane plant, as a fuel to generate steam for the production of most of the electrical power for sugar milling and irrigation pumping operations. In addition to bagasse, HC&#38;S uses coal, diesel, fuel oil and recycled motor oil to generate power during factory shutdown periods when bagasse is not being produced or during periods when bagasse is not produced in sufficient quantities. HC&#38;S also generates a limited amount of hydroelectric power. To the extent it is not used in A&#38;B&#8217;s factory and farming operations, HC&#38;S sells electricity under a power purchase agreement ("PPA") with Maui Electric. Beginning on January 1, 2015, Maui Electric and HC&#38;S mutually agreed to reduce the maximum amount of firm generation capacity to be supplied by HC&#38;S during peak hours from 12 megawatts to 8 megawatts. In the fourth quarter of 2015, the PPA was further amended and significantly reduced the firm power provided by HC&#38;S, but HC&#38;S will continue to provide emergency backup power. In 2015, HC&#38;S produced and sold, respectively, approximately 150,300 megawatt hours (MWH) and 51,100 MWH of electric power (compared with 181,300 MWH produced and 67,900 MWH sold in 2014). The decrease in power sold was due to the amendment to the PPA that eliminated regularly scheduled dispatched power. Hydroelectric generation increased to 25,200 MWH in 2015 (compared with 18,800 MWH in 2014) from an increase in rainfall during the year. Coal used for power generation was 51,100 short tons, about 6,000 tons less than that used in 2014. Less coal was required because of the lower power commitment to Maui Electric. 

In 2015, McBryde produced approximately 27,600 MWH of hydroelectric power (compared with approximately 27,900 MWH in 2014) and approximately 11,400 MWH of solar power from its Port Allen Solar Facility (compared with approximately 11,700 MWH in 2014). To the extent it is not used in A&#38;B-related operations, McBryde sells electricity to Kauai Island Utility Cooperative (&#8220;KIUC&#8221;). Power sales in 2015 amounted to approximately 30,800 MWH (compared with 32,800 MWH in 2014). The decrease in power sold was primarily due to higher internal power consumption.
