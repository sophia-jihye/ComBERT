 Item 1. Description of Business 

&#160;

We are a global clean energy company that develops, builds and owns clean energy projects and we own proprietary gasification technology which we utilize to provide technology licenses and proprietary equipment to customers in the energy and chemical industries. Our Synthesis Energy Systems Gasification Technology (&#8220;SGT&#8221;) is a flexible, efficient and economic technology for the production of synthesis gas, or syngas, a mixture of primarily hydrogen, carbon monoxide and methane. Syngas is a versatile source of clean energy that can be used to create a variety of valuable products. Through our unique SGT, we offer an attractive economic alternative to expensive natural gas, imported LNG and crude oil for manufacturing many of the world&#8217;s energy and chemical products. We can do this because our technology is uniquely capable of manufacturing clean syngas from a wide variety of energy resources including most all existing forms of coal, biomass, municipal wastes and refuse derived fuels and petroleum coke. Our syngas can be efficiently converted into a wide variety of energy and chemical products such as industrial fuel gas, substitute natural gas, electricity, hydrogen, ammonia and methanol. Therefore, using our clean syngas enables a valuable alternative in many parts of the world where natural gas, LNG and crude oil are expensive or unavailable. Our SGT is built on decades of research, development, demonstration and we have deployed SGT in several commercial operating plants in China. At the present time, our technology is, or has been, operating commercially on eight gasification systems in four plant facilities. In addition, there are four SGT gasification systems in the commissioning phase at this time.

&#160;

Our business strategy is focused upon generating growth and financial results from: i) our existing Chinese technology and gasification facilities joint ventures, ii) licensing our gasification technology and selling our proprietary equipment and services and iii) forming value accretive partnerships with low cost equity and debt financing capabilities which we use to build joint market segment and regional business platforms for developing, investing into, owning and monetizing clean energy projects. With these strategy components, we focus on leveraging our technology&#8217;s capability to create value. In implementing our strategy, we intend to diversify our geographic concentration from China by growing markets outside China where our unique technology capabilities can create value.

&#160;

Our technology license and equipment package is a very low-capital intensive offering and we believe it has potential to generate attractive margins on license fees, equipment sales and services. We rely on a variety of regional, market segment and adjacent technology partners to extend our global sales reach for commercializing our technology and equipment. We believe the largest contributor to future earnings from our business strategy will be through our project investment partnerships and platforms. While this element of our strategy is more capital intensive, we intend to manage and minimize our equity requirements, achieve project financing debt support and minimize risk through the formation of joint business enterprises with partners which we call platforms. These project investment platforms are intended to develop multiple projects, raise low cost capital and debt, and build projects using SGT. We typically work with partners who have aligned business interest with SES related to value creation and who bring financial capabilities, such as debt guarantees and equity financing as well as local project implementation and operating expertise. In addition we anticipate that this element of our strategy will also grow our related technology license and equipment business as these platform projects would utilize our SGT licensing, engineering and equipment systems.

&#160;

Our business relies on the unique capability of our SGT technology, which can convert the most challenging, and therefore lower cost, coal feedstocks, such as high ash coal and coal wastes, into syngas. We believe our feedstock flexibility exceeds all other commercially available gasification technologies. To demonstrate our technology capabilities, our initial joint venture operating projects were focused on the demonstration of our technology&#8217;s robustness via a modest scale plant at our ZZ joint venture, then later on a larger scale at our Yima Joint Ventures. Our three projects with the Aluminum Corporation of China (&#8220;CHALCO&#8221;), in connection with our Tianwo-SES Joint Venture, have further enhanced the commercial validation of our technologies&#8217; capabilities and strengths. We believe these projects provide evidence of our technology&#8217;s capability to operate using coals with characteristics that would not be offered by our competitors. We continue to pursue a variety of additional global projects under development internally and by our customers who wish to use our proprietary gasification technology platform to convert low-cost, locally available feedstocks to high value products.

&#160;

Our technology economically extracts carbon and hydrogen from all types of coal, coal wastes, renewable forms of biomass and municipal wastes in an environmentally friendly manner. The carbon and hydrogen are extracted by reacting the coal with oxygen, steam and utilize these energy building blocks to form syngas. Syngas can be used as a substitute for natural gas in many industries such as energy, steel, aluminum, ceramics, glass and others that combust natural gas to produce heat. In addition, syngas can be readily converted into a wide range of energy and chemical products. These products include, but are not limited to, the following:

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; industrial fuel gas, &#160; &#8226; hydrogen and its derivatives, &#160; &#8226; electricity, &#160; &#8226; substitute natural gas (SNG), &#160; &#8226; transportation fuels such as gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, &#160; &#8226; chemicals such as methanol, olefins, and glycols, &#160; &#8226; fertilizers like ammonia and urea, and &#160; &#8226; steel and direct reduction of iron (&#8220;DRI&#8221;), &#160;

Our technology is one of several which have been used successfully in these industrial applications for many years. However, our technology is meaningfully differentiated over other forms of gasification primarily through its feedstock flexibility, its ability to economically convert the lowest quality brown coals and lignites, high ash sub-bituminous coals, bituminous and anthracite coals as well as biomass and other renewable waste materials.

&#160;

Our most recent product is the XL3000 gasification system introduced in October 2014. It is specifically targeted to provide high syngas capacity and delivery pressure with low capital costs, while maintaining high syngas generation efficiencies on all types of coal feedstock. The XL3000 is targeted to deliver the efficiency and economy required to meet the needs of the world's syngas projects: electricity, steelmaking, industrial chemicals, fertilizers, SNG, and transportation fuels. The XL3000 gasification system delivers approximately 250% syngas capacity (3,000 metric tons per day of coal feedstock) than our previous designs with syngas delivery pressures up to 55 bar.

&#160;

Overview of Our Gasification Process 

&#160;

Our gasification technology uses oxygen, steam and heat to extract carbon and hydrogen from a wide variety of feedstocks. The gasifier utilizes a partial oxidation process where the carbon and hydrogen atoms are converted to a gaseous form that includes compounds such as hydrogen (&#8220;H 2 &#8221;), carbon monoxide (&#8220;CO&#8221;) and methane (&#8220;CH 4 &#8221;). Other components of syngas include water vapor, carbon dioxide (&#8220;CO 2 &#8221;), inert compounds such as nitrogen, and trace compounds derived from other materials in the feedstock.

&#160;

Syngas is a valuable and extremely versatile intermediary product which can provide production costs that are lower than using traditional crude oil or natural gas, especially in areas where these resources are costly or not readily available. Syngas can be readily converted into a wide range of fundamental energy and chemical products. These products include but are not limited to electricity, natural gas (methane), transportation fuels such as gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, chemicals such as methanol, olefins, glycols, ammonia and urea for agricultural fertilizers and feedstocks for steel making.

&#160; 

&#160;

SES Gasification Technology 

Generates Syngas Used for the Production of a Variety of Energy and Chemical Products 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

The origination of our technology is the U-GAS &#174; gasification technology, developed in the mid-1970&#8217;s. In 1975, the Gas Technology Institute (&#8220;GTI&#8221;), a leading non-profit energy technology research and development organization serving the gas industry headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, developed a fluidized bed gasification technology trademarked as U-GAS &#174; . In 2004, we obtained our first license for the U-GAS &#174; gasification technology from GTI. That license has evolved and expanded over the years. Our current U-GAS &#174; license grants us the exclusive worldwide right to manufacture, make, use and sell both U-GAS &#174; coal gasification systems and coal and biomass mixture (with coal content exceeding 60% by weight) gasification systems, and a non-exclusive right to manufacture 100% biomass gasification systems and coal and biomass mixtures (with biomass content exceeding 40% by weight) gasification systems. We also have rights to sublicense U-GAS &#174; systems to third parties for coal, coal and biomass mixtures, and for 100% biomass projects (subject to the approval of GTI, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), with GTI and us to share the revenue from such third party licensing fees based on an agreed percentage split. Our license had an initial term which expired in August 2016, with two additional 10-year extensions exercisable at our option. In May 2016, we exercised the first of our 10-year extensions and are the exclusive licensee for the above processes through August 2026. For more information, see &#8220;-GTI Agreement&#8221; below.

&#160;

&#160;

Since we first obtained the U-GAS &#174; license, we have created new intellectual property and know-how of our own based on our developments and experience from our initial ZZ Joint Venture plant and later through our work in the development of Yima Joint Ventures&#8217; plant and the CHALCO projects. Our current SGT is based on the basic technology developed by GTI which we have improved and advanced through our own know how and experiences. Today, we commercially offer our SGT and proprietary equipment based on our technology improvements and through our numerous innovations developed over nine years of plant operating experience. We continue to refine, improve and expand our gasification process to further differentiate it from other processes in its ability to reliably, cleanly and efficiently produce valuable products from feedstocks that are of low cost and quality.

&#160;

We believe we have several advantages that differentiate our technology from other commercially available gasification technologies, such as entrained flow, fixed bed, and moving bed gasification technologies. These advantages include:

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; our ability to economically utilize a wide range of feedstocks to make clean syngas. Our feedstock advantage opens up global opportunities for gasification project in areas where the coal quality would not be suitable for other gasification technologies; &#160; &#8226; our technology&#8217;s advanced fluidized bed design is extremely tolerant to a wide variation in feedstock during operation, which allows for flexible fuel purchasing for our customers over the life of their projects and &#160; &#8226; our technology uses less water and has a simpler design that yields more favorable fabrication costs, lower operating costs and lower capital cost than other gasification technologies. &#160;

We believe that the critical factors of lower feedstock cost, feedstock flexibility and lower water consumption position our technology for future worldwide deployment because our technology enables projects to become lower cost and environmentally friendly alternative energy sources.

&#160;

In our gasification process, the feedstock is prepared as needed and conveyed into the gasifier reactor. Inside the fluidized bed region of the gasifier, the feedstock has a reaction with air or oxygen plus steam at relatively high temperatures. The gasifier temperature is monitored and controlled to maintain high conversion of the carbon and also non-slagging conditions for the ash. Our gasification process accomplishes four important functions in a single-stage, fluidized-bed gasifier: it decakes, devolatilizes and gasifies the feedstock, and, if necessary, agglomerates and separates ash from the reacting coal. The optimal gasifier operating pressure depends on the end use for the syngas and can be designed to range from 0 to 55 barg pressure (14.7 psia to 880 psia) or higher. After the gasification reaction, the syngas is cleaned of impurities and then can be converted into higher value end products or energy forms such as electricity, SNG, chemicals such as methanol, DME and glycol, ammonia for fertilizer production, hydrogen, fuels for industrial processes, reducing gas for DRI processing, and transportation fuels, such as gasoline and diesels.

&#160;

During gasifier operation, the feedstock is gasified rapidly within the fluidized bed and produces syngas. Reactant gases, including steam and either air, enriched air or oxygen are introduced into the gasifier to both facilitate the chemical reactions and fluidize the feedstock inside the reactor. Ash is removed by gravity from the gasifier through a proprietary system for cooling, metering and depressurization. Typically, the ash is sold as a raw material for construction and concrete products. The gasifier maintains a low level of carbon in the bottom ash discharge stream. A small amount of fine ash is carried overhead in the syngas. This fine ash is removed, and through our Fines Management System ("FMS"), can be returned to the gasifier. Our FMS which, along with other gasifier improvements, increases conversion of the feedstock which lowers feedstock costs. Gasifier efficiency is evaluated using a factor called cold gas efficiency (&#8220;CGE&#8221;). CGE is a measure of the amount of energy in the feed coal that is converted to syngas and is an important driver of gasification economics. CGEs of up to 83% on high ash coals and carbon conversions of over 99% have been repeatedly demonstrated at commercial scale in the ZZ Joint Venture plant using the improved SES design.

&#160;

With FMS, we believe that we can maximize the utilization of low rank coal in our gasifiers, and as a result, improve the cost advantages derived from using our technology. Our Ash Management System ("AMS"), recovers thermal energy from the hot ash generated during gasification and converts it to steam used in the gasification process for export or for generating power. Both our FMS and AMS increase overall efficiency. Syngas generated from coal is free of tars and oils due to the SGT temperature profile and residence time of the gases in the fluidized bed, which simplifies the downstream design of heat recovery systems and gas cleaning operations.

&#160;

&#160;

We believe that our gasification process has certain environmental advantages over our competitors as it minimizes environmental wastewater and solid discharge as compared to other gasification technologies. The combination of dry processes for separation of fine solids from syngas, novel proprietary methods for ash cooling, and high cold gas efficiencies all reduce the water ultimately discharged as wastewater. Process water generated from our gasification units is readily treatable to enable recovery and recycling, such that ultimate wastewater discharge is minimized. We also have an advantage from a solid discharge prospective. Because SGT does not run in a slagging mode (melting and re-solidifying the solids), SGT does not require contact with water to remove the solids, and has an extremely high carbon conversion ratio. In addition, the solid byproduct our process produces is highly marketable. The most common use of this material is as an aggregate in cement production. Gasification technologies with low conversion and/or water based solids removal are often challenged to avoid landfilling of their solid discharge material.

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160;

Our technology offers an economical and cleaner approach for conversion of coal into energy and chemicals through our ability to economically gasify a wide range of solid-form natural resources including biomass, low quality coals, high quality coals, and coal wastes. We are not aware of commercially available gasifiers with such a wide range of feedstock flexibility. Our gasification technology operates efficiently with high ash and high moisture coals without coal rejection due to particle size and without the formation of tars and oils present in the technology of our competitors.

&#160;

While our technology has been proven to be commercially viable, we are continually seeking to advance and improve our gasification technology, such as through our new XL3000 gasification system. We are continuing to work with our prospective customers to determine the suitability of their low rank coals for our technology through proprietary coal characterization testing and bench scale gasification tests. We are advancing our higher pressure 40 bar to 55 bar gasification system designs which can further enhance our capital and operating expenses effectiveness and allow our system to achieve much higher syngas output from a smaller sized gasifier. Additionally, we are growing our technology base through: (i) continued development of know-how with our engineering and technical staff, (ii) growing and protecting our trade secrets as a result of patenting improvements tested at our ZZ and Yima Joint Venture plants, (iii) developing improvements resulting from integration of our technology with downstream processes, and (iv) developing improvements resulting from scaling up the design of our technology in pressure and capacity. Examples of our technology development include our high pressure gasifier, FMS and AMS which increase overall efficiency. During the current year we received an additional patent for processes which were a result of our continued development of SGT. We have several additional patent applications pending relating to these technology improvements in addition to a number of other improvements to increase the gasifier availability and to lower the costs of the gasifier installation and subsequent operations.

&#160;

The most predominant commercially deployed gasification technology providers are: GE, Shell, Siemens, CB&#38;I and Lurgi. With the exception of Lurgi, these competitors utilized entrained flow slagging gasification technologies. The entrained flow technologies operate on more expensive high grade bituminous and some sub-bituminous coals as feedstocks, but lack capability with the more difficult low heating value, high ash and high moisture coals and with biomass or other renewable waste materials. We have seen what we believe are significant changes in the competitive landscape for gasification over the past 24 months. Primarily this has been reflected in the inability of these long standing traditional entrained flow technologies to meet the needs of the many of the new projects now in development because many of these projects owners are faced with the need to use much lower quality coals or renewable feedstocks. We believe this change in the competitive landscape is pushing SGT and other fluidized bed and moving/fixed bed technologies into the forefront for consideration for future projects.

&#160;

The Lurgi gasification technology, a moving bed gasification technology, is capable of gasifying the lower grade coals, but has more restrictive requirements on feedstock particle size. The Lurgi gasification technology also generates tars and oils in the syngas that have to be removed prior to downstream processing.

&#160;

Several types of simple fluid bed technologies are available. ThyssenKrupp (Uhde division) offers the High Temperature Winkler (&#8220;HTW&#8221;) technology and there are several versions of very simple, low pressure fluid bed gasifiers offered in Asia. While a number of HTW plants were built and operated, we are not aware of any in current commercial operation. All of these simple fluid bed technologies have more operating temperature limits than SGT, and none have managed to achieve the high conversions which SGT has demonstrated in commercial plants.

&#160;

Additionally, several companies, including KBR, are developing gasification technologies targeted for lignite coals which have progressed past the research and development phase but as of yet have no commercially operating gasifiers. The technology provided by KBR began its first commercial operation at the Kemper Country IGCC facility in Mississippi in July 2016. We believe that significant development and commercial demonstration remains for this to be an acceptable mainstream technology.

&#160;

The following chart details our view of the current competitive landscape and details the current technologies available on the marketplace, along with their competitive advantages and disadvantages.

Barriers to New Competition 

&#160;

Historically gasification technologies have required many years and development costs on the order of hundreds of millions of dollars to reach credible commercial deployment. Because of the costs surrounding such development, projects related to gasification technology was generally funded by users with strategic interests and significant economic resources such as major international oil companies or governmental entities looking at alternative clean energy solutions.

&#160;

Most, if not all, gasification technologies have received significant government subsidies in the early research and development stages. Our technology has been highly developed by both GTI and us over the past 40+ years where the technology has been enhanced and commercially deployed. We believe that the current range of available technologies leaves little incentive for development of new technologies, and emerging competition for everyone in the industry will focus on imitation and adaptation.

&#160;

&#160;

While many of our competitors may have greater access to capital than we do, we believe that we are well positioned as compared to our current and potential competitors as a result of our current operating platform which allows rapid development resulting in a lower capital commitment.

&#160; 

Syngas as an Alternative Fuel Source 

&#160;

Syngas itself is a competitive alternative to oil, natural gas and conventional coal. Syngas generation technologies such as our technology compete with oil, natural gas and conventional coal combustion technologies. Such competing technologies include reforming of natural gas for chemicals and hydrogen production, oil refining for fuels production, petroleum byproducts for plastics precursors such as olefins (derived from methanol) and conventional natural gas, fuel oil and coal combustion in power generation equipment and other industrial applications. The opportunity for all gasification technologies is primarily driven by the price and availability of natural gas and oil. Low natural gas and oil prices can significantly reduce the amount of new syngas capacity additions while high pricing for oil and natural gas or liquefied natural gas (&#8220;LNG&#8221;) can increase demand for syngas additions.

&#160;

We believe that gasification can provide a cleaner option for the generation of power from coal as it minimizes environmental emissions in both air, and solid in addition to utilizing less water.

&#160;

To generate coal based power with gasification, the coal is first converted to syngas. The syngas can then be treated to remove pollutants such as sulfur, mercury, and CO 2 from the syngas prior to the combustion of the syngas to generate power. With traditional coal fired power generation technology, these pollutants are removed after the combustion process from the exhaust gas of the boiler. Because the pollutants are removed pre-combustion and at elevated pressures with gasification, the gas stream that is being handled for pollutant removal is more than 100 times lower in volume than the exhaust gas stream from the coal boiler. Combining this significantly lower volume with the fact that the technologies that are used for sulfur and CO 2 removal work much better (much lower quantities of chemicals required to remove one unit of sulfur or CO 2 ), the cost to remove sulfur and CO 2 for gasification is significantly lower than the cost to remove these constituents from boiler exhaust gas. In addition, when using pre-combustion removal, the removal technologies have the ability to achieve deeper removal levels resulting in lower emissions. When the CO 2 is removed at elevated pressures and pre-combustion, the CO 2 is much better suited for economically viable utilization, such as enhanced oil recovery and the production of Urea.

&#160;

As for nitrous oxide (&#8220;NOx&#8221;) and particulate matter (&#8220;PM&#8221;) emissions, with coal gasification derived power, a gas stream is being combusted to generate power, this type of gas combustion will produce significantly lower amounts of NOx and PM (amounts similar to those that can be achieved with natural gas combustion). Coal boiler technology is burning the coal directly and there are larger amounts of NOx and particulate matter being generated. This requires expensive post combustion removal technologies on the high volume exhaust gas stream to lower the NOx and PM emissions. Even when using these post combustion technologies, coal boiler technologies are highly challenged (and potentially incapable, depending upon the coal qualities) of achieving the low emissions of sulfur oxides (&#8220;SOx&#8221;), NOx, mercury, and PM that are easily achievable with coal gasification derived power.

&#160;

If legislation restricting the emissions SOx NOx, or other PM emissions become more stringent, as is occurring in certain developing nations, coal gasification derived power will have a significant cost advantage over traditional coal fired boilers. Additionally, if legislation on CO 2 becomes more prevalent in developing countries in the future coal gasification derived power will be advantaged as it will be less costly to retrofit a gasification derived power facility to comply with increased regulation. However, the absence of regulation on conventional coal based technology may delay adoption of coal gasification technologies, especially in the power generation market.

&#160;

In terms of water consumption, we believe a plant designed to convert coal to power using SGT will use about 1/3 less water than a similar sized plant that burns coal directly. The amount of water consumed is directly related to the size of the steam turbine. In traditional coal, the steam turbine is used to generate 100% of the electricity. With an SGT facility, the steam turbine only generates about 30% of the electricity, the balance coming from the gas combustion turbines.

&#160;

GTI Agreement 

&#160;

In November 2009, we entered into an Amended and Restated License Agreement, or the GTI Agreement, with GTI, replacing the Amended and Restated License Agreement between us and GTI dated August 31, 2006, as amended. Under the GTI Agreement, we maintain our exclusive worldwide right to license the U-GAS &#174; technology for all types of coals and coal/biomass mixtures with coal content exceeding 60%, as well as the non-exclusive right to license the U-GAS &#174; technology for 100% biomass and coal/biomass blends exceeding 40% biomass.

&#160;

&#160;

In order to sublicense any U-GAS &#174; system, we are required to comply with certain requirements set forth in the GTI Agreement. In the preliminary stage of developing a potential sublicense, we are required to provide notice and certain information regarding the potential sublicense to GTI and GTI is required to provide notice of approval or non-approval within ten business days of the date of the notice from us, provided that GTI is required to not unreasonably withhold their approval. If GTI does not respond within that ten business day period, they are deemed to have approved the sublicense. We are required to provide updates on any potential sublicenses once every three months during the term of the GTI Agreement. We are also restricted from offering a competing gasification technology during the term of the GTI Agreement.

&#160;

For each U-GAS &#174; unit which we license, design, build or operate for ourselves or for a party other than a sub-licensee and which uses coal or a coal and biomass mixture or biomass as the feedstock, we must pay a royalty based upon a calculation using the MMBtu per hour of dry syngas production of a rated design capacity, payable in installments at the beginning and at the completion of the construction of a project, or the Standard Royalty. If we invest, or have the option to invest, in a specified percentage of the equity of a third party, and the royalty payable by such third party for their sublicense exceeds the Standard Royalty, we are required to pay to GTI an agreed percentage split of third party licensing fees, or the Agreed Percentage, of such royalty payable by such third party. However, if the royalty payable by such third party for their sublicense is less than the Standard Royalty, we are required to pay to GTI, in addition to the Agreed Percentage of such royalty payable by such third party, the Agreed Percentage of our dividends and liquidation proceeds from our equity investment in the third party. In addition, if we receive a carried interest in a third party, and the carried interest is less than a specified percentage of the equity of such third party, we are required to pay to GTI, in our sole discretion, either (i) the Standard Royalty or (ii) the Agreed Percentage of the royalty payable to such third party for their sublicense, as well as the Agreed Percentage of the carried interest. We will be required to pay the Standard Royalty to GTI if the percentage of the equity of a third party that we (a) invest in, (b) have an option to invest in, or (c) receive a carried interest in, exceeds the percentage of the third party specified in the preceding sentence.

&#160;

We are required to make an annual payment to GTI for each year of the term, with such annual payment due by the last day of January of the following year; provided, however, that we are entitled to deduct all royalties paid to GTI in a given year under the GTI Agreement from this amount, and if such royalties exceed the annual payment amount in a given year, we are not required to make the annual payment. We must also provide GTI with a copy of each contract that we enter into relating to a U-GAS &#174; system and report to GTI with our progress on development of the technology every six months.

&#160;

For a period of ten years, we and GTI are restricted from disclosing any confidential information (as defined in the GTI Agreement) to any person other than employees of affiliates or contractors who are required to deal with such information, and such persons will be bound by the confidentiality provisions of the GTI Agreement. We have further indemnified GTI and its affiliates from any liability or loss resulting from unauthorized disclosure or use of any confidential information that we receive.

&#160;

While the core of our technology is the U-GAS &#174; system, we have continued to innovate and modify the process to a point where we maintain certain intellectual property rights over SGT. Since the original licensing in 2004, we have maintained a strong relationship with GTI and continue to benefit from the resources and collaborative work environment that GTI provides us. In May 2016, we exercised the first of our 10-year extensions and now maintain the exclusive license described above through 2026.

&#160; 

Business Strategy 

&#160;

Our business strategy is focused upon generating growth and financial results from: i) our existing Chinese technology and gasification facilities joint ventures, ii) licensing our gasification technology and selling our proprietary equipment and services and iii) forming value accretive partnerships with low cost equity and debt financing capabilities which we use to build joint market segment and regional business platforms for developing, investing into, owning and monetizing clean energy projects. With these strategy components we focus on leveraging our technology&#8217;s capability to create value. In implementing our strategy, we intend to diversify our geographic concentration from China by growing markets outside China where our unique technology capabilities can create value.

The Yima Joint Venture plant generated its first methanol production in December 2012. The Yima Joint Venture plant&#8217;s refined methanol section was fully commissioned in December 2013, and has operated at limited capacity since that date. Methanol production was approximately 50% of its targeted annual capacity of 330,000 tons during the year ended June 30, 2016. The plant has a capacity to produce 377,000 metric tons per year of methanol and a targeted expected production capacity of 330,000 metric tons based on normal expected availability from operating two of its three available gasifiers and has achieved 100% of targeted peak syngas production levels and 100% targeted peak methanol production levels. This plant issued its technical acceptance of our technology in March 2016 which has provided a commercial demonstration of our technology on a much larger scale than the ZZ Joint Venture plant. We own 25% of the Yima Joint Ventures and Yima Coal Industry (Group) Co., Ltd. (&#8220;Yima&#8221;) owns 75%. Yima controls the construction, startup and operation of the plant. More detail is available under &#8220;&#8211; Current Operations and Projects &#8211; Yima Joint Ventures&#8221;.

&#160;

The Yima Joint Venture plant took longer than expected to complete its construction and startup and has taken on debt, a significant portion of which is in the form of shareholder loans. We have received operating data from the Yima Joint Ventures which shows the plant is technically capable of operating at production levels necessary to generate earnings. Although there has been a setback this summer (as outlined in &#8220;-Current Operations and Projects&#8221;), The Yima Joint Ventures are focused on resolving open issues with permits and approvals which will further remove operating risk. We plan to examine alternative strategies for Yima which may include monetizing our investment via an exit or similar arrangement.

&#160;

ZZ Joint Venture 

&#160;

We recently announced a definitive agreement to restructure our ZZ Joint Venture such that Xuecheng Energy will assume all outstanding financial liabilities of the ZZ Joint Venture in exchange for an additional interest in the ZZ Joint Venture. After the restructuring, we will retain an approximately 9% ownership in the joint venture. The agreement will take effect formally when the registration with government is completed, which is expected to occur prior to the end of our second fiscal quarter. The ZZ Joint Venture is currently evaluating a new and improved syngas facility at the Zouwu Industrial Park, a new industrial zone in the Xuecheng District, where our partner has already built and is operating a new and larger coke oven as well as an LNG manufacturing facility. Xuecheng Energy is currently looking at more valuable end products to make from syngas, including LNG, refined hydrocarbons, fuels, and acetic anhydride. We also have the option to reinvest in the new ZZ project if we believe that it is the right thing to do for the Company, and our gasification technology will continue to be used for syngas production at the new site. 

&#160;

Grow our technology licensing and proprietary equipment supply and services business . 

&#160;

Our technology license and equipment package business approach is a low capital investment business which we believe can generate attractive margins on licenses, technology differentiated equipment and services. We rely on a variety of regional, market segment and adjacent technology partners to extend our global sales reach for commercializing our technology and equipment as further described below under &#8220;-Relationships with Strategic Partners and Business Verticals&#8221;.

&#160;

We are focused on growing our technology license and equipment business in China and globally. Our Tianwo-SES Joint Venture is responsible for growing in China and the Joint Venture territory. Outside of China and the Joint Venture territory, we maintain a robust customer project pipeline. Currently our prospects are mainly in the countries of India, South America and Europe for projects that would produce SNG, power and chemicals.

&#160;

In emerging regions such as India, we have an existing marketing and engineering relationship with Simon Engineering in New Delhi. We are also working with an Indian advisor to identify potential candidates for technology and project investment and implementation partner(s) for the country.

&#160; 

Tianwo-SES Joint Venture 

&#160; 

As part of our licensing and equipment business we formed Tianwo-SES Joint Venture, the purpose of the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture is to establish our gasification technology as the leading gasification technology in the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture territory (which is China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Mongolia and Malaysia) by becoming a leading provider of proprietary equipment for the technology. The scope of the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture is to market and license our gasification technology via project sublicenses; procurement and sale of proprietary equipment and services; coal testing; and engineering, procurement and research and development related to the technology. In addition, we believe our Tianwo-SES Joint Venture will also help build new partnerships within market segments such as DRI steel, power, transportation fuels and for longer term value creation, larger scale SNG projects utilizing low rank coal resources and biomass, and accelerate the commercialization of our technology on a global basis enabling us to reduce the capital requirements to achieve this acceleration. We own a 35% interest in the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture. More detail is available under &#8220;- Current Operations and Projects &#8211; Tianwo-SES Joint Venture&#8221; . Key elements of our business strategy for the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture are:

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; a) Achieve orders for new project license and equipment supply. &#160;

&#160; b) Secure first customers for our XL3000, our higher pressure 40 bar gasification platform, with a focus on brown field projects which could move quickly to install and operate the 40 bar system. &#160;

&#160; c) Expand the scope of supply of the Tianwo-SES joint venture to grow from licenses and proprietary equipment supply into supply of non-proprietary process equipment into Tianwo-SES projects. &#160;

&#160; d) Build implementation capability with Tianwo-SES to supply high quality, low cost equipment into our global projects outside the territory. &#160;

Project investment platforms and equity investment relationships . 

&#160; 

We believe the largest contributor to future earnings from our business strategy will be through our project investment partnerships and platforms. While this element of our strategy is more capital intensive, we intend to manage and minimize our equity requirements, achieve project financing debt support and minimize risk through the formation of joint business enterprises with partners which we call platforms. These project investment platforms are intended to develop multiple projects, raise low cost capital and debt, and build projects using SGT. We typically work with partners who have aligned business interest with us related to value creation and who bring financial capabilities, such as debt guarantees and equity financing as well as local project implementation and operating expertise. In addition, we anticipate that this element of our strategy will also grow our related technology license and equipment business as these platform projects would utilize our SGT licensing, engineering and equipment systems.

&#160;

We believe that compatible and strategic partners will help us grow our business and leverage the technology, engineering, equipment and services which we have developed. As a result, we intend to continue seeking strategic joint venture relationships and equity investment opportunities. Some of the characteristics that we look for in potential partners include:

&#160; 

&#8226; companies with existing businesses and vested interests in the growth of clean energy and chemicals projects;

&#8226; companies that demonstrate financial strength and an ability to secure or guarantee debt; and

&#8226; companies which show a strong local capabilities for project implementation and operations.

&#160;

We believe that partnering to enable in the development of clean energy projects, which can benefit from our technology&#8217;s capability regarding low cost feedstock flexibility, lower capital cost and reduce water usage footprint, can provide value to both parties through creating a channel for us to secure new orders and the ability to share in project development fees and/or achieve carried interests in projects.

&#160;

Potential returns for projects will vary widely depending on the structure of the individual equity investment, the business environment where the equity investment is located and other factors which impact the nature of the investment.

&#160;

Dongying Projects 

&#160;

In March 2016, we entered a strategic Joint Project Development and Investment Agreement with China Environment State Investment Co., Ltd. (&#8220;CESI&#8221;). CESI is a state-owned enterprise established in Beijing under the China Ministry of Environmental Protection that is charged with, and funded to, develop and invest in the energy conservation and environmental protection industry. We intend to form a project investment platform to develop, jointly invest, and build 20 or more projects over the next five years using our SGT gasification technology.

&#160;

In May 2016, we announced the first of our projects related to the platform discussed above. The project will use SGT to produce lower-cost hydrogen in the Lijin County Binhai New District industrial park in Dongying, Shandong Province. The build-out consists of three projects, to be completed in phases, with an estimated preliminary total investment by SES-CESI to be approximately 2 billion yuan ($301.6 million). In June 2016, we announced the second of our projects in this platform with Shandong Dongying Hekou District Government. The project will also use SGT to produce lower-cost hydrogen needed for clean fuels production by refineries at the Hekou Blue Economy Industrial Park Project in Dongying City, Shandong Province. The build-out consists of multiple phases with an estimated preliminary total investment to be approximately 550 million yuan ($83.0 million). Together we refer to these two combined opportunities as the Dongying Projects.

&#160;

&#160;

In July 2016, CESI&#8217;s upper management changed related to a restructuring agreement and the entrance of a new shareholders. We have been in contact with the new management team and we have been told that CESI will evaluate their involvement in the project investment platform and in the Dongying Projects. We can provide no assurances as to the level of involvement which CESI will ultimately have in the projects and we may choose to or be required to bring a replacement partner into this platform. We are currently leading and managing all aspects of work related to the Dongying Projects to ensure these projects stay on schedule.

&#160;

Relationships with Strategic Partners and Business Verticals 

&#160;

As part of our overall strategy, we intend to continue to form new strategic market-based partnerships or business verticals and grow our existing partner relationships where our technology offers advantages and through cooperating with these partners grow an installed base of projects. Through collaborative partnering arrangements, we believe we will gain industry acceptance and market share much faster than entering these markets alone. In addition to regional business units, we are continuing to evaluate and develop our business in markets such as power, steel, fuels, substitute natural gas, chemicals and renewables which can benefit from deploying our technology offering to create these products from low cost coal and renewable feedstocks. We are developing these market-based business vertical opportunities together with strategic partners which have established businesses or interests in these markets with the goal of growing and expanding these businesses by partnering with us and deployment of our technology offering. We understand the need to partner in certain markets, and plan to do so with companies that we believe can help us accelerate our business. Our partnering approach in some cases is country specific and in other cases is industry or market segment specific. Additionally, where strategic relationships and capital and/or financing is available, we may acquire operating assets with potential to generate near term earnings and provide us with advantages in deploying our technology.

&#160;

Our collaboration with GE Packaged Power, Inc., a subsidiary of GE, which began in early 2013 to jointly evaluate and market a small scale power generation unit combining our gasification technology with GE&#8217;s aeroderivative gas turbines, is an ongoing example of our market-based business vertical developments underway. We believe the distributed power segment offers opportunity over time to provide meaningful sales opportunities for our gasification technology and equipment systems, and we intend to focus on the continued development of this business vertical. In addition to our collaboration with GE we will continue to evaluate other gas turbine technologies and may form additional collaboration agreements in the future related to this technology.

&#160;

In July 2015 we announced the signing of a Project Alliance Agreement that expands our exclusive relationship with Midrex Technologies for integration and optimization of DRI technology using coal gasification. Midrex will take the lead in marketing, sales, proposal development, and project execution for coal gasification DRI projects as part of the new project alliance. Midrex may also lead the construction of the fully integrated solution for customers who desire such an execution strategy. We will provide the DRI gasification technology for each project including engineering, key equipment, and technical services. The agreement includes finalization of an engineering package for the optimized coal gasification DRI solution. Prior to the Project Alliance Agreement, we also entered into an exclusive agreement with Tianwo-SES and Midrex for the joint marketing of coal gasification-based DRI facilities in China. These facilities will combine our gasification technology with the Direct Reduction Process of Midrex to create syngas from low quality coals in order to convert iron ore into high-purity DRI. Tianwo-SES will aid in the marketing of these DRI facilities in China and will supply the gasification equipment and licensing of the technology.

&#160;

In November 2015 we announced the signing of a Global Business and Market Development Alliance with China Coal Research Institute (&#8220;CCRI&#8221;), a subsidiary of China Coal Technology &#38; Engineering Group Corporation (&#8220;CCTEG&#8221;). The agreement is intended to deliver global clean energy technology projects that dovetail with the Chinese government's One Belt, One Road "Going Out" strategy and use our gasification technology. CCRI is the group designated to provide technical expertise for CCTEG to evaluate and prepare global project opportunities for coal gasification and related downstream technologies. We and CCRI have aligned the goals and competitive capabilities of each company to focus on clean energy and chemical projects exclusively based on our technology.

&#160;

We are also advancing developments via technology integration studies with potential partners for business verticals in DRI steel and &#8220;green&#8221; chemicals derived from municipal wastes. In June 2016, we extended our exclusive marketing and engineering agreement with Simon India Limited (&#8220;SIL&#8221;), originally signed in March 2013, to market our technology for coal and biomass gasification projects in India, which we believe is an important growth region for which our technology is uniquely well suited. SIL, an engineering, procurement and construction company, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Zuari Global Limited. Zuari and SIL are member companies of the Adventz Group, which is a large Indian conglomerate comprising 23 companies in various industries, including high-quality complex fertilizers.

&#160;

&#160;

During the past couple of years, our technology has been well received by the Indian market. With the advent of new government leadership slowly breaking the log jam on coal allocations for projects, and expensive gas and imported LNG options for clean energy products to support the country&#8217;s growing GDP, we believe that the Indian market could potentially be a viable market for us in the future. SIL is now offering to build gasification islands using our technology on a fixed price turnkey basis which offers an additional cost advantage to customers which we believe will increase our ability to compete in this market in the future.

&#160;

Target Markets 

&#160;

The clean energy and chemicals landscape has evolved rapidly over the past five to ten years with upward pressure on demand and increasing pressure to deliver outstanding environmental performance while simultaneously delivering economics that will attract investment capital. World energy consumption is expected to increase significantly over the next two decades. Demand is heavily driven by non-Organization for Economic and Development (&#8220;OCED&#8221;) nations where those developing economies require ever increasing access to more energy products to establish healthy economies that improve the living conditions of those populations. Energy and chemical products are needed for basic health, food and agricultural products, housing needs and infrastructure for safety and mobility. A 2016 EIA report projects that total worldwide energy consumption will exceed 815 quadrillion British thermal units (&#8220;BTUS&#8221;), by 2040 with non-OECD nations making up more than half of that consumption.

&#160;

Growth in energy in non-OECD nations is expected to be led by growth in Asia. The same EIA report projects Asia to make up close to 66% of that projected 2040 consumption. We believe we are well positioned in Asia where we have two operating projects using five of our gasification systems. In addition, the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture provides us with a strong Chinese partner already specialized in the manufacturing and design of processing industry equipment and projects. The Tianwo-SES Joint Venture territory initially covers China, Vietnam, Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia and Mongolia.

&#160;

Coal is required as a major source of energy for decades to come. Growth in coal usage is also expected to be led by the Non-OECD nations. Coal based energy in combination with other energy producing technologies is required to help alleviate energy poverty around the world. According to the International Energy Agency, approximately 1.2 billion people lived without access to electricity and significant investment is required to alleviate this energy poverty by 2030. This need for energy access is in addition to continued energy demand required by GDP growth in both OECD and Non-OECD nations. All combined coal is expected to continue to be a large scale source of affordable energy.

&#160;

&#160; &#160; &#160; 

&#160;

Against the backdrop of significant growth in global energy needs and the requirement for coal to supply a large portion of this energy emerges the need to transform coal into energy products in a clean and sustainable manner. Commercially proven gasification technologies such as our technology are able to cleanly extract the important carbon and hydrogen components from coal in the form of a clean syngas product.

&#160;

This syngas product is then readily converted into a variety of energy and chemical products. Transforming coal into clean energy and chemical products is a growing opportunity, and we believe that global syngas growth could accelerate rapidly. The versatility and capability of syngas to make a variety of products has just begun to be considered.

&#160;

&#160;

We believe that our technology is well positioned to be an important solution that addresses the market needs of the changing global energy landscape. Our gasification technology is unique in its ability to provide an economic, efficient and environmentally responsible alternative to many energy and chemical products normally derived from natural gas, LNG, crude oil, and oil derivatives.

&#160;

Our target markets focus primarily on lower quality coals, biomass and municipal waste where our gasification technology allows energy in the widest range of feedstocks to be unlocked and converted into flexible and valuable syngas. We offer a compelling advantage because of our ability to use such wide range of solid fuel natural resources. Without our technology, regions where lignite coal, high moisture coal, high ash coal and/or high fines coals exist may face technology barriers which will prevent those resources to be used in energy production. Our technology can transform most of these natural resources into a valuable and flexible syngas product. This clean syngas product can then be used in place of natural gas and oil for making most energy and chemical products.

&#160;

Because of these market dynamics, we believe our gasification technology has broad strategic importance to:

&#160;

&#160; 1) Countries and regions with developing economies which have their own low cost domestic coal resources or easy access to imported low cost coal. Such countries and regions need access to low cost clean energy and chemical products to grow and in some cases to provide basic necessities that improve the health and well-being of their populations. These regions have limited access to affordable alternate energy sources like natural gas and oil, and can benefit from economic growth by using the lowest cost energy resources such as low cost domestic or imported coal for the production of vital products. Many Asian countries expect to see a surge in imported coal in addition to increased use of domestic coal to meet their energy product demand increase. &#160;

&#160; 2) Countries which possess significant low cost coal resources such as Australia and those in South America and Eastern Europe which also have a strategic need and desire to produce clean and affordable energy and chemicals from their own domestic resources. &#160;

&#160; 3) Existing operating companies which deploy their own technologies for energy and/or chemicals production or who rely upon oil and natural gas for their industrial applications. These technologies have been well established for use with oil and natural gas resources but are constrained from growing in parts of the world where the oil and natural gas feedstocks are either not readily available due to missing infrastructure and/or very expensive such as LNG in much of Asia. Integrating those establish technologies with our technology opens these technologies to a new low cost natural resource in low quality coals thereby transforming the economic opportunity. Such is the case for example in producing power, methanol, DRI steel product, ammonia and urea for fertilizers and many transportation fuels such as gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. &#160;

&#160; 4) Developed countries such as the United States and Western Europe who are searching for a viable solution for growing biomass and municipal solid waste disposal issues and could also benefit from additional renewable resources. &#160; 

While we are actively pursuing a global strategy, our historical geographical operational focus has been on the China market where we believe our competitive advantage is the greatest and where we can produce the most value to both our customers and joint venture partners and our shareholders.

&#160;

The development of the modern coal chemical industry in China depended mainly on the country&#8217;s resource possession status: coal-rich, oil-lean and gas-lacking, and has also been driven by the vast and increasing demand for clean energy and chemical products. Coal has been and is predicted to continue to be the most vastly used natural resource for energy production in China.

&#160;

Other contributors to the growth of China&#8217;s industrial sector include the government&#8217;s ambition for economic development, unlimited access to coal resources including low cost coal, better profitability for utilizing these lowest cost and highly available resources, abundant capital flow, demand for the development of clean energy products to mitigate the severe air pollution problem, as well as China&#8217;s historic experience and application of coal chemical processes.

&#160;

The Chinese government puts particular emphasis on the &#8220;Introduction, Digestion &#38; Absorption&#8221; of imported advanced technologies. The Chinese equipment industry and locally developed coal chemical processes have matured in recent years.

&#160;

Gasification is the leading technology for coal chemical processes development in China. The development and improvement of gasification technology over the past decade in China is expected to contribute to the growth of the Chinese coal chemical industry. In comparison to fixed bed gasification processes, which have already been widely deployed in China, fluidized bed gasification is capable of using finer coal (with smaller coal particles), which greatly broadens the raw coal supply availability for projects based on our technology.

&#160;

&#160;

As China&#8217;s energy demand is expected to nearly double over the next 25 years, the production of electricity, steel, chemicals and transportation fuels from Chinese coal and other imported coals will continue to grow and we believe will require the widespread use of coal gasification. The pressure that the Chinese government is under to improve the environmental quality, especially around the large metropolis areas, has put conventional coal utilization technologies under significant pressure.

&#160;

In the power generation market, many provinces are not permitting new plants to utilize coal-fired boilers for small scale power generation due to the poor environmental performance of these boilers. For transportation fuels development, the National Development and Reform Commission of China has begun work on providing guidance to industrial companies for the generation of diesel and gasoline with stricter emissions regulations. The government is requiring industrial companies to become more conscious of water consumption and pollution, coal utilization with regards to using more efficient technologies, and tighter emissions controls in order to improve the current air quality situation.

&#160;

While the Chinese government is encouraging improvement in environmental performance industry wide, the demand for energy products is continuing to increase at a remarkable pace. The intersection of these two driving forces, need for improved environment and need for more energy products based on China&#8217;s most abundant natural resource, drives all major industry sectors in China towards the only clean use of coal &#8211; gasification.

&#160;

Current Operations and Projects 

&#160;

Synthesis Energy Systems (Zao Zhuang) New Gas Company Ltd. (&#8220;ZZ Joint Venture&#8221;) 

&#160;

In July 2006, we entered into a cooperative joint venture contract with Shandong Hai Hua Xuecheng Energy Co., Ltd. (&#8220;Xuecheng Energy&#8221;) which established the ZZ Joint Venture, a joint venture company that has the primary purposes of:

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; developing, constructing and operating a syngas production plant utilizing SGT in Zao Zhuang City, Shandong Province, China and &#160; &#8226; producing and selling syngas and the various byproducts of the plant. &#160;

We initially owned 97.6% of the ZZ Joint Venture and Xuecheng Energy owned the remaining 2.4%. In June 2015, we entered into a Share Purchase and Investment Agreement (the &#8220;SPA&#8221;) with Rui Feng Enterprises Limited (&#8220;Rui Feng&#8221;), whereby Rui Feng will acquire a controlling interest in Synthesis Energy Systems Investments Inc. (&#8220;SESI&#8221;), a wholly owned subsidiary, which owns our interest in the ZZ Joint Venture. Under the terms of the SPA, SESI will sell an approximately 61% equity interest to Rui Feng in exchange for $10 million. This amount was to be paid in four installments through December 2016, with the first installment of approximately $1.6 million paid on June 26, 2015.

&#160;

Rui Feng&#8217;s second installment payment was due in December 2015 and the third installment was due on May 1, 2016, and neither of these installment payments has been made. With the restructuring of the ZZ Joint Venture discussed below, we do not anticipate that Rui Feng will make any additional installment payments under the SPA. If Rui Feng does not make the required installment payments, we are entitled to terminate the agreement and Rui Feng would lose future rights to acquire additional interest in SESI and additional positions on the board of SESI. Given our agreement with Xuecheng Energy discussed below, we do not anticipate any additional installment payments from Rui Feng.

&#160;

Because Rui Feng has not made additional installment payments, as of June 30, 2016, we owned approximately 88.1% of the ZZ Joint Venture as of June 30, 2016.

&#160; 

ZZ Joint Venture Debt Agreements 

&#160;

In October 2014, the ZZ Joint Venture entered into a working capital loan agreement (the &#8220;ZZ Working Capital Loan&#8221;) with Zaozhuang Bank Co., Ltd. (&#8220;ZZ Bank&#8221;), and received approximately $3.3 million of loan proceeds, with a maturity of September 23, 2015. In September 2015, the Company refinanced the ZZ Working Capital Loan through August 2016 for approximately $3.1 million.

&#160;

In October 2014, the ZZ Joint Venture entered two lines of credit with the ZZ Bank for a total of $3.3 million (collectively, the &#8220;ZZ Line of Credit Agreement&#8221;). In April 2015, the Company repaid the ZZ Line of Credit Agreement and renewed the agreement for $3.3 million under the same terms for an additional six months. In November 2015, the Company repaid $3.3 million of the ZZ Line of Credit Agreement, and refinanced the ZZ Line of Credit Agreement with the ZZ Bank for $3.9 million.

&#160; 

&#160;

Agreement with Xuecheng Energy 

&#160;

In August 2016, we announced that we and Xuecheng Energy have entered into a Definitive Agreement to restructure the ZZ Joint Venture. Additionally, to dovetail with the Chinese government&#8217;s widespread initiative to move industry into larger scale, commercial and environmentally beneficial industrial parks, the partners intend to evaluate a new ZZ syngas facility in the Zouwu Industrial Park in Shandong Province. We will retain an approximate nine percent ownership in the ZZ Joint Venture asset, and Xuecheng Energy has agreed to assume all outstanding liabilities of the ZZ Joint Venture, including payables related to the Cooperation Agreement with Xuecheng Energy signed in 2013. The current agreement will be finalized and will take full effect when the registration with the government is completed, which is expected to occur in September or October 2016. Once registration is finalized, we will deconsolidate the ZZ Joint Venture and will account for our investment under the cost method.

&#160;

With the Chinese government&#8217;s widespread initiative to move the chemical manufacturing industry into larger scale industrial parks outside the city, the coke ovens owned by Xuecheng Energy which had produced coke oven gas for the ZZ Joint Venture, ceased operation in October 2015. After evaluating numerous options to repurpose the ZZ facility, we determined that due to the same industrial park initiative, repurposing at the current site would not be an option. Xuecheng Energy has since constructed and is currently operating new and larger coke ovens, as well as an LNG manufacturing facility, at the Zouwu Industrial Park.

&#160;

To further improve the effectiveness of its new facility, Xuecheng Energy intends to build a project to upgrade the operation&#8217;s coal tar by-product to produce more valuable products including fuels, and has received the local government approval for the project. Additional syngas will be required for this operation, which is intended to be produced in the new industrial park via the restructured ZZ Joint Venture. Further, Rui Feng Enterprises is also making plans to proceed with its acetic anhydride facility at the new site. SES has retained a right to invest in the new ZZ project and Xuecheng Energy has agreed to utilize SGT for the syngas production there.

&#160;

Yima Joint Ventures 

&#160;

In August 2009, we entered into amended joint venture contracts with Yima, replacing the prior joint venture contracts entered into in October 2008 and April 2009. The joint ventures were formed for each of the gasification, methanol/methanol protein production, and utility island components of the plant (collectively the &#8220;Yima Joint Ventures&#8221;). The amended joint venture contracts provide that:

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; we and Yima contribute equity of 25% and 75%, respectively, to the Yima Joint Ventures; &#160;

&#160; &#8226; Yima will guarantee the repayment of loans from third party lenders for 50% of the project&#8217;s cost and, if debt financing is not available, Yima is obligated to provide debt financing via shareholder loans to the project until the project is able to secure third-party debt financing; and &#160;

&#160; &#8226; Yima will supply coal to the project from a mine located in close proximity to the project at a preferential price. &#160;

We own a 25% interest in each joint venture and Yima owns a 75% interest. Notwithstanding this, in connection with an expansion of the project, we have the option to contribute a greater percentage of capital for the expansion, such that as a result, we could expand through contributions, at our election, up to a 49% ownership interest in the Yima Joint Ventures.

&#160;

The remaining capital for the project has been funded with project debt obtained by the Yima Joint Ventures. Yima agreed to guarantee the project debt in order to secure debt financing from domestic Chinese banking sources. We have agreed to pledge to Yima our ownership interests in the joint ventures as security for our obligations under any project guarantee. In the event that the necessary additional debt financing is not obtained, Yima has agreed to provide a loan to the joint ventures to satisfy the remaining capital needs of the project with terms comparable to current market rates at the time of the loan.

&#160;

Under the terms of the joint venture agreements, the Yima Joint Ventures are to be governed by a board of directors consisting of eight directors, two of whom were appointed by us and six of whom were appointed by Yima. The term of the joint venture shall commence upon each joint venture company obtaining its business operating license and shall end 30 years after commercial operation of the plant.

&#160;

&#160;

We believe there is a consistent pattern of the Yima Joint Venture management not demonstrating an understanding of the methanol facility operations and not sourcing available expertise in China to improve the overall operations. We have witnessed operation of the gasifier systems at Yima with design and operating parameter deviations from our existing technology recommendations. We continue to experience a limited ability to influence the Yima Joint Ventures&#8217; operating performance.

&#160;

As a result of the issues noted above, Yima restructured the management of the Yima Joint Ventures under the direction of the Henan Coal Gasification Company (&#8220;Henan&#8221;), which is an affiliated company reporting directly to Henan Coal and Energy Group Companies. By virtue of this acquisition, Henan placed the Yima Joint Ventures under one of its subsidiaries Henan Energy which currently supervises the operations and personnel decisions of the Yima Joint Ventures. The ownership of the Yima Joint Ventures remains unchanged.

&#160;

Since 2014, we have accounted for this joint venture under the cost method of accounting. Our conclusion to account for this joint venture under this methodology is based upon our lack of significant influence in the Yima Joint Venture. The lack of significant influence is determined based upon our interactions with the Yima Joint Ventures related to our limited participation in operating and financial policymaking processes coupled with our limited ability to influence decisions which contribute to the financial success of the Yima Joint Ventures.

&#160;

Current Yima Operating Description 

&#160;

Despite initiating methanol production in December 2012, the Yima Joint Ventures&#8217; plant continued its construction through the beginning of 2016. In March 2016, the Yima Joint Ventures completed the required performance testing of the SGT systems and successfully issued its Performance Test Certificate. Because of the extended construction period, the plant recently faced increasing regulatory scrutiny from the environmental and safety bureaus.

&#160;

In June 2016, the local environmental bureau requested that the plant temporarily halt operations to address certain issues identified by the environmental bureau. After the plant shut down operations, the Yima plant experienced an accident during maintenance activities that were unrelated to the gasification units. The Yima Joint Ventures have been working with both the environmental and safety bureaus and anticipate returning to operations during the second quarter of our fiscal year 2017.

&#160;

In 2009, the project was approved as three separate joint ventures. The approval for the original joint ventures was for the production of methanol protein, and methanol by-product. This has impacted the ability of the plant to sell pure methanol on the open market and has been an impediment to receive the permanent safety operating permit.

&#160;

To resolve these issues, during the quarter ended June 30, 2016, the Yima Joint Ventures commenced an organizational restructuring to better streamline the operations of the Joint Ventures. This restructuring effort was a multi-step process, including first obtaining the operating license to sell methanol by combining the three joint ventures into a single operating entity, and finally obtaining the permanent safety and environmental permits. The Yima Joint Ventures received the operating permit on July 28, 2016, and have made continued progress in completing the remaining items.

&#160;

The Yima Joint Ventures also are experiencing certain liquidity concerns with a series of third party bank notes due prior to the end of December 2016. Yima, the 75% shareholder of the Yima Joint Ventures, has been routinely providing liquidity to the Yima Joint Ventures in the form of shareholder loans. Also, the Yima Joint Ventures are currently in discussion with the impacted third party lenders to seek extensions, refinancing or other alternative arrangements to avoid a default by the Yima Joint Ventures. While we believe Yima will continue to provide additional liquidity to the Yima Joint Ventures until the project is operating and producing income, we can make no assurances that Yima will continue to do this or on the outcome of the above mentioned negotiations.

&#160;

Because of the situations detailed above, our management evaluated the current conditions of the Yima Joint Ventures to determine whether an other than temporary decrease in value had occurred for the year ended June 30, 2016. Management determined that the decrease in value due to the shutdown and liquidity situation are other than temporary in nature and therefore management conducted an impairment analysis utilizing a discounted cash flow fair market valuation with the assistance of a third party valuation expert. In this valuation, significant unobservable inputs were used to calculate the fair value of the investment. The valuation led to the conclusion that the investment in the Yima Joint Ventures was impaired as of June 30, 2016, and accordingly, we recorded an $8.6 million impairment for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. The carrying value of our Yima investment was approximately $26.2 million as of June 30, 2016 as compared to $34.8 million as of June 30, 2015. We continue to monitor the Yima Joint Ventures and could take an additional impairment in the future if operating conditions do not meet our current expectations, or if the liquidity situation worsens.

Tianwo-SES Clean Energy Technologies Limited (the &#8220;Tianwo-SES Joint Venture&#8221;) 

&#160; 

Joint Venture Contract 

&#160;

In February 2014, SES Asia Technologies Limited, one of our wholly owned subsidiaries, entered into a Joint Venture Contract (the &#8220;JV Contract&#8221;) with Zhangjiagang Chemical Machinery Co., Ltd., which subsequently changed its legal name to Suzhou Thvow Technology Co. Ltd. (&#8220;STT&#8221;), to form the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture. The purpose of the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture is to establish the Company&#8217;s gasification technology as the leading gasification technology in the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture territory (which is China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Mongolia and Malaysia) by becoming a leading provider of proprietary equipment and engineering services for the technology. The scope of the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture is to market and license our gasification technology via project sublicenses; procurement and sale of proprietary equipment and services; coal testing; and engineering, procurement and research and development related to the technology. STT contributed 53.8 million yuan in April 2014 and was required to contribute an additional 46.2 million yuan within two years of such date for a total contribution of 100 million yuan (approximately $15.1 million) in cash to the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture, and owns 65% of the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture.

&#160;

We have contributed an exclusive license to use of its technology in the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture territory pursuant to the terms of a Technology Usage and Contribution Agreement (the &#8220;TUCA&#8221;) entered into among the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture, STT and us on the same date and further described in more detail below. We own 35% of the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture. Under the JV Contract, neither party may transfer their interests in the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture without first offering such interests to the other party.

&#160;

The JV Contract also includes a non-competition provision which requires that the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture be the exclusive legal entity within the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture territory for the marketing and sale of any gasification technology or related equipment that utilizes low quality coal feedstock. Notwithstanding this, STT has the right to manufacture and sell gasification equipment outside the scope of the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture within the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture territory. In addition, we have the right to develop and invest equity in projects outside of the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture within the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture territory. After the termination of the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture, STT must obtain written consent from us to market development of any gasification technology that utilizes low quality coal feedstock in the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture territory.

&#160;

The JV Contract may be terminated upon, among other things: (i) a material breach of the JV Contract which is not cured, (ii) a violation of the TUCA, (iii) the failure to obtain positive net income within 24 months of establishing the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture or (iv) mutual agreement of the parties.

&#160;

TUCA 

&#160;

Pursuant to the TUCA, we have contributed to the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture the exclusive right to our gasification technology in the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture territory, including the right to: (i) grant site specific project sub-licenses to third parties; (ii) use our marks for proprietary equipment and services; (iii) engineer and/or design processes that utilize our technology or our other intellectual property; (iv) provide engineering and design services for joint venture projects and (v) take over the development of projects in the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture territory that have previously been developed by us and our affiliates.

&#160;

The Tianwo-SES Joint Venture will be the exclusive operational entity for business relating to our technology in the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture territory. If the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture loses exclusivity due to a breach by us, STT is to be compensated for direct losses and all lost project profits. We will also provide training for technical personnel of the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture through the second anniversary of the establishment of the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture. We will also provide a review of engineering works for the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture. If modifications are suggested by us and not made, the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture bears the liability resulting from such failure. If we suggest modifications and there is still liability resulting from the engineering work, it is our liability.

&#160;

Any party making, whether patentable or not, improvements relating to our technology after the establishment of the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture, grants to the other party an irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty free right to use or license such improvements and agrees to make such improvements available to us free of charge. All such improvements shall become part of our technology and both parties shall have the same rights, licenses and obligations with respect to the improvement as contemplated by the TUCA.

&#160;

The Tianwo-SES Joint Venture is required to establish an Intellectual Property Committee, with two representatives from the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture and two from SES. This Committee shall review all improvements and protection measures and recommend actions to be taken by the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture in furtherance thereof. Notwithstanding this, each party is entitled to take actions on its own to protect intellectual property rights. As of June 30, 2016 that committee was yet to be formed.

&#160;

&#160;

Any breach of or default under the TUCA which is not cured on notice entitles the non-breaching party to terminate. The Tianwo-SES Joint Venture indemnifies us for misuse of our technology or infringement of our technology upon rights of any third party.

&#160;

Current relationship with STT 

&#160; 

The second capital contribution from STT of 46.2 million yuan (approximately $7.0 million) was not paid in April 2016 as required by our initial JV Contract and currently remains outstanding. We notified STT in writing to determine the status of the payment, and other contractual breaches related to the TUCA, and the JV Contract, and have continued to follow up on this issue. Should the payment or the other breaches of the TUCA not be cured, we will consider any and all legal actions to resolve these issues.

&#160;

CESI-SES Investment Platform 

&#160;

In March 2016, we entered a strategic Joint Project Development and Investment Agreement with China Environment State Investment Co., Ltd. (&#8220;CESI&#8221;). CESI is a state-owned enterprise established in Beijing under the China Ministry of Environmental Protection that is charged with, and funded to, develop and invest in the energy conservation and environmental protection industry. We and CESI have agreed to develop, jointly invest, and build a total of no less than 20 projects using our gasification technology over the next five years. Further, we and CESI are targeting to bring a minimum of two projects through development within 12 months. Equity in the projects for investment by us and CESI is expected to be owned 51% by CESI, and 49% by us through our wholly owned Hong Kong subsidiary, SES Clean Energy Investment Holdings Limited. We and CESI have initially identified a pipeline of potential projects.

&#160;

In July 2016, CESI&#8217;s upper management changed related to a restructuring agreement and the entrance of a new shareholders. This restructuring agreement resulted in a change in CESI&#8217;s upper management. We have been in contact with the new management team and we have been told that CESI will evaluate the economics of the projects discussed above and will make its decision to continue in the projects based upon their views of the projects&#8217; economics. If CESI were to not continue to participate in these projects, it could cause delays as we seek replacement partners and alternative funding sources. We can provide no assurances as to the level of involvement which CESI will have in the projects in the future but we believe that we will be able to find a replacement partner should CESI decide to not participate.

&#160;

Dongying Projects 

&#160;

In May 2016, we announced the first of our projects on the platform discussed above. The project will use SGT to produce lower-cost hydrogen in the Lijin County Binhai New District industrial park in Dongying, Shandong Province. The build-out consists of three projects completed in phases with an estimated preliminary total investment to be approximately 2 billion yuan ($301.6 million). In June 2016, we signed an investment and cooperation agreement with Shandong Dongying Hekou District Government. The project will use SGT to produce lower-cost hydrogen needed for clean fuels production by refineries at the Hekou Blue Economy Industrial Park Project in Dongying City, Shandong Province. The build-out consists of multiple phases with an estimated preliminary total investment to be approximately 550 million yuan ($83.0 million).

&#160;

Business Development, Engineering and Project Management 

&#160;

Management and Business Development Staff 

&#160; 

We currently employ a staff of experienced management and business development professionals in both the U.S. and China that are focused on opportunities in our target markets. The management and business development team is focused on the disciplined development of new business for gasification projects, licensing opportunities and other technology products and services which maximize the advantages of our gasification technology. Members of the team have either led or participated in the development of multiple coal and natural gas power projects, coal gasification projects, chemical and gasification licensing transactions globally over the past three decades. In addition, we utilize consultants and our relationships with our strategic partners to further supplement our staff in developing relationships with potential customers.

&#160;

&#160;

Technology, Engineering and Project Management Staff 

&#160;

We have a capable and seasoned technology team, with skill sets ranging from detailed design engineering, project management and plant commissioning experience. Our engineers leverage their gasification and process industry knowledge to continuously improve SGT using data collected from our commercial licensees and test platforms. These improvements increase overall plant reliability, while reducing the capital and operating costs for our project partners, as well as develop core intellectual property for the company. The team is engaged during the earliest stages of project development, allowing for more precise planning and optimization of the integrated technologies. This provides a further competitive edge with respect to cost and project development cycle times. In addition to our technology engineering team, we leverage our resource capability through partnering with international engineering and procurement companies with significant gasification experience.

&#160; 

Business Concentration 

&#160;

Our assets in China accounted for approximately 68% of our total assets as of June 30, 2016, which includes property, plant and equipment of our consolidated ZZ Joint Venture, our investment in the Yima Joint Ventures and other miscellaneous assets.

&#160;

Suppliers 

&#160;

China has rapidly expanded its industrial manufacturing and construction capabilities. This has reduced the cost and build time of traditional sources of supply. In China, through our strategic relationships, we have been successful in locating and contracting with a number of key suppliers of major equipment and services.

&#160;

For projects outside of China where local sourcing is of value, we expect to be able develop supply chain capabilities for our equipment utilizing experienced industrial manufacturing capabilities and low cost sources of labor and materials that will benefit our technology.

&#160;

Patents 

&#160;

We currently hold multiple U.S. and international patents and have a number of pending patent applications, primarily relating to new technology developments that we have made to the U-GAS &#174; technology, known as SGT. This includes our gasification process, the integration of our gasification process with downstream uses and the equipment design for our gasification facilities. Although in the aggregate our patents are important to us, we do not regard any individual patent as critical or essential to our business as a whole.

&#160;

Prior to us entering into the GTI Agreement, U-GAS &#174; had not been commercially deployed on coal above approximately 150 tons per day per gasification system nor had it been commercially deployed on coal using pure oxygen as a reactant or at elevated pressures. Today, we have commercially deployed the technology at a scale of 1,200 tons per day of coal feed using pure oxygen as a reactant and at pressures of up to 10 bar.

&#160;

In addition, we also have new designs underway today, and we are quoting gasification systems for customers that would increase our gasification capacity to approximately 3,000 tons per day of coal using pure oxygen as a reactant. We have made improvements to the U-GAS technology which have either been patented, are in the process of patenting, or are held by us as trade secrets. In addition, we have several new improvements which are currently in development associated with designs of our higher pressure and higher capacity systems that will further enhance the efficiency of the gasification process or reduce capital or operating expenses.

&#160;

Project and Technical Development 

&#160;

We may incur internal and third-party project and technical development costs related to the advancement of our gasification technology and related processes. We plan to continue certain development initiatives that support our strategies and project development activities with a goal of offering our customers the best and most efficient clean coal solutions.

&#160;

Chinese Environmental Regulation 

&#160;

Our operations are subject to stringent national, provincial state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Numerous governmental agencies, including various Chinese authorities, issue regulations to implement and enforce such laws, which often require difficult and costly compliance measures that carry substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties or may result in injunctive relief for failure to comply. These laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before construction or operation at a facility commence, restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with such activities, limit or prohibit construction activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, ecologically sensitive and other protected areas, and impose substantial liabilities for pollution.

&#160;

&#160;

Our facilities may require permits for air emissions and wastewater discharges, as well as other authorizations, some of which must be issued before construction commences. Issuance of these permits could be subject to unpredictable delays, contests and even, in some cases, denial. Although we believe that there will be support for our projects, the permitting process could be complex and time consuming and the issuance of permits may be subject to the potential for contest and other regulatory uncertainties that may result in unpredictable delays. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with current applicable environmental laws and regulations and we have not experienced any material adverse effect from compliance with these environmental requirements.

&#160;

In addition, some recent scientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases, commonly referred to as &#8220;greenhouse gases,&#8221; may be contributing to the warming of the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere. In response to such studies, many countries are actively considering legislation, or have already taken legal measures, to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Examples of such legislation and new legal measures include new environmental laws and regulations that could impose a carbon tax, a cap and trade program requiring us to purchase carbon credits, or measures that would require reductions in emissions or require modification of raw materials, fuel use or production rates. Carbon dioxide, a byproduct of burning fossil fuels such as coal, is an example of a greenhouse gas. Regardless of technology used in gasification facilities, there is carbon dioxide released whenever the syngas is cleaned and prepared for energy or chemicals production. We believe that gasification is currently the most desirable technology for processing coal if CO 2 emissions become regulated. This is because gasification and the adjacent syngas cleaning technologies separate the CO 2 produced from the final products and thereby create a rich CO 2 stream that can be captured, sequestered and/or sold. However, greenhouse gas regulations can add production and capital cost to all fossil fuel technologies and may require us or our customers to obtain additional permits, meet additional control requirements, install additional environmental mitigation equipment, or take other as yet unknown steps to comply with such potential regulations, which could adversely affect our financial performance. 

&#160;

In China, the development and construction of gasification facilities is highly regulated. In the development stage of a project, the key government approvals relate to the project&#8217;s environmental impact assessment report, feasibility study (also known as the project application report) and, in the case of a Sino-foreign joint venture, approval of the joint venture company&#8217;s joint venture contract and articles of association. Approvals in China are required at the municipal, provincial and/or central government levels depending on the total investment in the project and subject to industry specified criteria. Due to the global economic recession in 2008-2009, China&#8217;s State Council issued guidance related to the pace of new project approvals including wind power, polysilicon, steel, cement, glass and coal to methanol and DME. At the same time, the government continues to encourage newer technologies that can cleanly process coal.

&#160;

In April 2009, the Chinese government approved a new national standard for methanol to be used in motor vehicle fuel which become effective on November 1, 2009. The standard includes the technical properties, testing methods, examination procedures as well as identification, packaging, transportation, storage and safety requirements for methanol that is to be used in motor vehicle fuel. Further, in May 2009, the Chinese government approved a new national standard, effective December 1, 2009, for M85 methanol gasoline, which specifies, among other things, the technical requirements, testing methods, examination procedures, identification, packaging, transportation, storage and safety requirements for methanol gasoline that comprises between 84%-86% of methanol and between 14%-16% of gasoline in terms of volume and other performance enhancing additives, for use in motor vehicles. According to the China Petroleum and Chemical Industry Association, the draft national standards for M15 &#8212; 15% percent methanol and 85% gasoline have been submitted to the China National Technical Committee on Petroleum Products and Lubricants of Standardization Administration for review. It is expected that the official national standards for M15 -15% percent methanol and 85% gasoline will soon be promulgated. We are monitoring this development closely. Although these standards do not mandate the use of methanol, we expect that they will act as a catalyst for further growth in the development of infrastructure, fueling stations, and vehicles which can accommodate higher proportion methanol blends. These recent developments are positive for the long term outlook for methanol demand, and with China demonstrating the viability of methanol blending in gasoline, this should also increase the potential for methanol blending to be adopted in other countries.

&#160;

In July 2016, Parts 2-4 of the Norm of Energy Consumption Per Unit Product of Methanol became effective. The Norm sets out the energy consumption limits during the production of methanol from coal, natural gas and coke oven gas, as well as the co-production of ammonia with methanol, for existing and new projects. It raises the threshold of participating in methanol production business and those firms using less advanced technologies currently in the market may seek improvement or replacement of their technologies. It is our belief that regulations such as this will create more opportunities for our technology in the future.

&#160;

&#160;

China continues to put increasing scrutiny on the environmental impacts of all coal based projects, including coal to power and coal to chemicals. New codes and standards have been and continue to be created to minimize the generation of Sulfur Oxides, Nitrous Oxides, Carbon Monoxide, Carbon Dioxide and Particulate Matter. In addition, codes and standards have been put in place in the past few years to increase the efficiency of resource utilization. These include minimum efficiencies required for the production of SNG and other chemicals from coal, limits on the amount of water consumed per unit of SNG and other chemicals produced from coal, and limits on the amount of coal consumed per unit of SNG and other chemicals produced from coal. These codes and standards are relatively new and continue to change. We believe that our gasification technology can currently meet these requirements, while other gasification technologies will be challenged to meet these requirements.

&#160;

In 2016, China released its 13 th Five &#8211; Year Plan, which maps a path for more sustainable economic growth, focusing on energy efficiency and the use of cleaner energy sources to mitigate the effects of rapidly rising energy demand. We believe these policies could lead to expanded syngas application in methanol production as well as in the licensing business of coal gasification technologies, which we believe we are uniquely positioned to benefit from.

&#160;

Although we have been successful in obtaining the permits that are required with respect to the ZZ Joint Venture, Yima Joint Ventures, and the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture, any retroactive change in policy guidelines or regulations or an opinion that the approvals that have been obtained are inadequate, at the municipal, provincial or central government levels in China, could require us to obtain additional or new permits or spend considerable resources on complying with such regulations. Other developments, such as the enactment of more stringent environmental requirements, changes in enforcement policies or discovery of previously unknown conditions, could require us to incur significant capital expenditures or suspend operations.

&#160;

Chinese Foreign Investment and Business Regulations 

&#160;

We operate our business in China under a legal regime consisting of the State Council, which is the highest authority of the executive branch of the Chinese central government, and several ministries and agencies under its authority, including the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (&#8220;SAIC&#8221;), the Ministry of Commerce (&#8220;MOFCOM&#8221;), the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (&#8220;SAFE&#8221;) and their respective authorized local counterparts.

&#160;

The Chinese government imposes restrictions on the convertibility of the yuan and on the collection and use of foreign currency by Chinese entities. Under current regulations, the yuan is generally convertible for current account transactions, which include dividend distributions, and the import and export of goods and services subject to review and approval by SAFE or its designated foreign exchange bank. However, conversion of yuan into foreign currency and foreign currency into yuan for capital account transactions is under the strict scrutiny of SAFE. According to SAFE Circular [2015] 19 (Circular on Reforming the Administration of Foreign Exchange Capital Settlement of Foreign-invested Enterprise), foreign-invested enterprise whose main business is investment may convert foreign currency in a capital account into yuan for equity investment. Other types of foreign-invested enterprises may convert foreign currency in a capital account into yuan for equity investment provided that the enterprise being invested into makes relevant registration with SAFE (or a designated bank) and establishes a settlement payment account.

&#160;

Under current Chinese regulations, foreign-invested enterprises such as our Chinese subsidiaries are required to apply to banks authorized to conduct foreign exchange business by SAFE for a Foreign Exchange Registration Certificate for Foreign-Invested Enterprise. With such registration (which is subject to remaining rights and interests registration with SAFE), a foreign-invested enterprise may open foreign exchange bank accounts at banks authorized to conduct foreign exchange business by SAFE and may buy, sell and remit foreign exchange through such banks, subject to documentation and approval requirements. Foreign-invested enterprises are required to open and maintain separate foreign exchange accounts for capital account transactions and current account transactions. In addition, there are restrictions on the amount of foreign currency that foreign-invested enterprises may retain in such accounts, except that foreign-invested enterprises may retain foreign exchange income under current account transactions in its sole discretion.

&#160;

Also at the time of applying for SAFE registration (including any change registration), foreign-invested enterprises that do not constitute round tripping investment enterprises will be required to represent that its foreign shareholder is not directly or indirectly held by any Chinese residents; foreign-invested enterprises that constitute round tripping investment enterprises will be required to disclose the actual controlling person of its foreign shareholder. Any false or misleading representations may result in administrative liabilities imposed on the onshore entities and their legal representatives. If Chinese residents who are beneficial holders of our shares, make, or have previously made, direct or indirect round tripping investments through a SPV which falls within the scope of the registration under the SAFE Circular 37 (SAFE circular Relating to Foreign Exchange Administration of Offshore Investment, Financing and Round tripping Investment by Domestic Residents utilizing Special Purpose Vehicles), the Chinese residents must make foreign exchange registration for their offshore investments, failing which, the Chinese residents may be ordered to return the capital to China and be imposed a fine by SAFE for such misconduct.

&#160;

&#160;

Failure to comply with the registration procedures, including failure to update its own foreign exchange registration, may result in restrictions on the relevant onshore entity, including restrictions on the payment of dividends and other distributions to its offshore parent or affiliate and restrictions on the capital inflow from the offshore entity, and may also subject relevant Chinese residents to penalties under the Chinese foreign exchange administration regulations. Also at the time of applying for SAFE registration (including any change registration), the onshore entities that do not constitute round tripping investment enterprises will be required to represents that its foreign shareholder is not directly or indirectly held by any Chinese residents; the onshore entities that constitute round tripping investment enterprises will be required to disclose the actual controlling person of its foreign shareholder. Any false or misleading representations may result in administrative liabilities imposed on the onshore entities and their legal representatives.

&#160; 

Under Chinese regulations, wholly foreign-owned enterprises and Sino-foreign equity joint ventures in China may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with Chinese accounting standards and regulations. The foreign invested company may not distribute profits until the losses of the previous fiscal years have been made up. Additionally, the foreign invested company shall make allocations of after-tax profits to a reserve fund and a bonus and welfare fund for their employees. In the case of a Sino-foreign equity joint venture, in addition to the reserve fund and the bonus and welfare fund, the company shall also make allocations to a venture expansion fund. In the case of a wholly foreign-owned enterprise, the amount to be contributed to the reserve fund shall be no less than 10% of the after-tax profits unless the aggregate amount reaches 50% of the registered capital of the company, at which time the company may stop making allocations to the reserve fund. The amount to be contributed to other funds of a wholly foreign-owned enterprise or any of the above funds of a Sino-foreign equity joint venture may be determined by the board of the company in accordance with the applicable laws. Any amounts to be contributed to such funds shall be set aside prior to distribution of after-tax profit.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of June 30, 2016, we had approximately 135 full time employees, including 111 employees at the ZZ Joint Venture plants and excluding those individuals employed through our non-consolidated joint ventures. Subsequent to June 30, 2016 we terminated approximately 70 workers at our ZZ Joint Venture plant due to the permanent shutdown of the existing ZZ Joint Venture Plant and planned restructuring of the ZZ Joint Venture with Xuecheng Energy. None of our employees are represented by any collective bargaining unit. We have not experienced any work stoppages, work slowdowns or other labor unrest. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
