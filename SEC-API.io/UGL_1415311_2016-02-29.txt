Summary 

ProShares Trust II (formerly known as the Commodities and Currencies Trust) (the &#147;Trust&#148;) is a Delaware statutory trust formed on October 9, 2007 and is currently organized into separate series (each, a &#147;Fund&#148; and collectively, the &#147;Funds&#148;). As of December 31, 2015, the following twenty-one series of the Trust have commenced investment operations: (i) ProShares Managed Futures Strategy (the &#147;Managed Futures Fund&#148;); (ii) ProShares VIX Short-Term Futures ETF and ProShares VIX Mid-Term Futures ETF (each, a &#147;Matching VIX Fund&#148; and collectively, the &#147;Matching VIX Funds&#148;); (iii) ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures ETF and ProShares Ultra VIX Short-Term Futures ETF (each, a &#147;Geared VIX Fund&#148; and collectively, the &#147;Geared VIX Funds&#148;); and (iv) ProShares UltraShort Bloomberg Commodity, ProShares UltraShort Bloomberg Crude Oil, ProShares UltraShort Bloomberg Natural Gas, ProShares UltraShort Gold, ProShares UltraShort Silver, ProShares UltraShort Australian Dollar, ProShares UltraShort Euro, ProShares UltraShort Yen, ProShares Ultra Bloomberg Commodity, ProShares Ultra Bloomberg Crude Oil, ProShares Ultra Bloomberg Natural Gas, ProShares Ultra Gold, ProShares Ultra Silver, ProShares Ultra Euro and ProShares Ultra Yen (each, a &#147;Leveraged Fund&#148; and collectively, the &#147;Leveraged Funds&#148;); and (v) ProShares Short Euro (the &#147;Short Euro Fund&#148;). Each of the Funds listed above issues common units of beneficial interest (&#147;Shares&#148;), which represent units of fractional undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of only that Fund. The Shares of each Fund are listed on the New York Stock Exchange Archipelago (&#147;NYSE Arca&#148;), as further described below. The Managed Futures Fund and the Matching VIX Funds are collectively referred to as the &#147;Matching Funds&#148; in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Geared VIX Funds and the Matching VIX Funds are collectively referred to as the &#147;VIX Funds&#148; in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Leveraged Funds, the Short Euro Fund and the Geared VIX Funds, are collectively referred to as the &#147;Geared Funds&#148; in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

On May 22, 2015, the Trust announced plans to liquidate ProShares Ultra Australian Dollar (ticker symbol: GDAY). ProShares Ultra Australian Dollar was closed to purchases and redemptions as of the close of regular trading on the NYSE Arca on June 18, 2015. Beginning June 19, 2015, no secondary market for ProShares Ultra Australian Dollar&#146;s Shares remained. Proceeds of the liquidation were distributed to shareholders on June 29, 2015. Any shareholders remaining in the fund on June 29, 2015 automatically had their shares redeemed for cash at ProShares Ultra Australian Dollar&#146;s net asset value per Share as of June 19, 2015. On June 30, 2015, the NYSE Arca filed a Form 25 removing the listing of ProShares Ultra Australian Dollar on the NYSE Arca. On July 10, 2015, a Form 15 was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;) terminating the registration of ProShares Ultra Australian Dollar. 

The Trust had no operations prior to November 24, 2008, other than matters relating to its organization, the registration of each series under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the sale and issuance to ProShare Capital Management LLC (the &#147;Sponsor&#148;) of fourteen Shares at an aggregate purchase price of $350 in each of the following Funds: ProShares UltraShort Bloomberg Commodity, ProShares UltraShort Bloomberg Crude Oil, ProShares UltraShort Gold, ProShares UltraShort Silver, ProShares UltraShort Euro, ProShares UltraShort Yen, ProShares Ultra Bloomberg Commodity, ProShares Ultra Bloomberg Crude Oil, ProShares Ultra Gold, ProShares Ultra Silver, ProShares Ultra Euro and ProShares Ultra Yen. 

Groups of Funds are collectively referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in several different ways. References to &#147;Short Funds,&#148; &#147;UltraShort Funds,&#148; or &#147;Ultra Funds&#148; refer to the different Funds based upon their investment objectives, but without distinguishing among the Funds&#146; benchmarks. References to &#147;Commodity Index Funds,&#148; &#147;Commodity Funds&#148; and &#147;Currency Funds&#148; refer to the different Funds according to their general benchmark categories without distinguishing among the Funds&#146; investment objectives or Fund-specific benchmarks. References to &#147;VIX Funds&#148; or the &#147;Managed Futures Fund&#148; refer to the different Funds based upon their investment objective and their general benchmark categories. 

Each of the Funds generally invests in Financial Instruments ( i.e. , instruments whose value is derived from the value of an underlying asset, rate or index, including futures contracts, swap agreements, forward contracts and other instruments) as a substitute for investing directly in commodities, currencies, or spot volatility products in order to gain exposure to its applicable commodity futures index, commodity, currency exchange rate or equity volatility index. Financial Instruments also are used to produce economically &#147;inverse,&#148; &#147;inverse leveraged&#148; or &#147;leveraged&#148; investment results for the Geared Funds. 

&#160;

As further described below, each &#147;Short&#148; Fund seeks daily investment results (before fees and expenses) that correspond to the inverse (-1x) of the daily performance of its corresponding benchmark. Each &#147;UltraShort&#148; Fund seeks daily investment results (before fees and expenses) that correspond to two times the inverse (-2x) of the daily performance of its corresponding benchmark. Each &#147;Ultra&#148; Fund seeks daily investment results (before fees and expenses) that correspond to two times (2x) the daily performance of its corresponding benchmark. Each Matching VIX Fund and the Managed Futures Fund seek investment results (before fees and expenses), both over a single day and over time, that match the performance of its corresponding benchmark. Daily performance is measured from the calculation of one net asset value per Share (&#147;NAV&#148;) to the next. 

Each Geared Fund seeks investment results for a single day only, not for longer periods. A &#147;single day&#148; is measured from the time a Fund calculates its respective NAV to the time of the Fund&#146;s next NAV calculation. This is different from most exchange-traded funds and means that the return of such Geared Fund for a period longer than a single trading day will be the result of each day&#146;s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from -1x, -2x or 2x of the return of the index to which such Geared Fund is benchmarked for that period. A Geared Fund will lose money if its benchmark&#146;s performance is flat over time, and it is possible for a Geared Fund to lose money over time even if its benchmark&#146;s performance increases (or decreases, in the case of a Short or UltraShort Fund). Longer holding periods, higher benchmark volatility, inverse exposure and greater leverage each affect the impact of compounding on a Geared Fund&#146;s returns. Daily compounding of a Geared Fund&#146;s investment returns can dramatically and adversely affect its longer-term performance during periods of high volatility. Geared Funds are riskier than similarly benchmarked exchange-traded funds that are not geared. Accordingly, these Funds may not be suitable for all investors and should be used only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged, inverse or inverse leveraged investment results. Shareholders who invest in the Funds should actively manage and monitor their investments, as frequently as daily. 

Each Geared Fund and the Managed Futures Fund continuously offers and redeems its Shares in blocks of 50,000 Shares and each Matching VIX Fund continuously offers and redeems shares in blocks of 25,000 Shares (each such block a &#147;Creation Unit&#148;). Only Authorized Participants may purchase and redeem Shares from a Fund and then only in Creation Units. An Authorized Participant is an entity that has entered into an Authorized Participant Agreement with one or more of the Funds. Shares of the Funds are offered to Authorized Participants in Creation Units at each Fund&#146;s respective NAV. Authorized Participants may then offer to the public, from time to time, Shares from any Creation Unit they create at a per-Share market price that varies depending on, among other factors, the trading price of the Shares of each Fund on the NYSE Arca, the NAV per Share and the supply of and demand for the Shares at the time of the offer. Shares from the same Creation Unit may be offered at different times and may have different offering prices based upon the above factors. Additionally, the price at which an Authorized Participant sells a Share may be higher or lower than the price paid by such Authorized Participant in connection with the creation of such Share in a Creation Unit. The form of Authorized Participant Agreement and related Authorized Participant Handbook set forth the terms and conditions under which an Authorized Participant may purchase or redeem a Creation Unit. Authorized Participants do not receive from any Fund, the Sponsor, or any of their affiliates, any fees or compensation in connection with their sale of Shares to the public. An Authorized Participant may receive commissions or fees from investors who purchase Shares through their commission or fee-based brokerage accounts. 

On March 19, 2015, the company that ran the London U.S. dollar gold fixing, ceased calculating the price of gold for the London Bullion Market Association (the &#147;LBMA&#148;). The LBMA selected ICE Benchmark Administration to calculate the price, which was renamed the LBMA Gold Price, and is based on an electronic, physically settled auction-based methodology, beginning on March 20, 2015. 

As of December 31, 2015, ProShare Capital Management LLC, a Maryland limited liability company, served as the Trust&#146;s Sponsor (the &#147;Sponsor&#148;) and commodity pool operator. On February 17, 2013, the Sponsor&#146;s commodity trading advisor registration was withdrawn. Wilmington Trust Company serves as the Trustee of the Trust (the &#147;Trustee&#148;). The Funds are commodity pools, as defined in the Commodity Exchange Act (the &#147;CEA&#148;) and the applicable regulations of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the &#147;CFTC&#148;) and are operated by the Sponsor, a commodity pool operator registered with the CFTC. The Trust is not an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the &#147;1940 Act&#148;). 

&#160;

The Sponsor maintains an Internet website at www.ProShares.com, through which monthly account statements and the Trust&#146;s Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#147;1934 Act&#148;), can be accessed free of charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#147;SEC&#148;).

Investment Objectives and Principal Investment Strategies 

Investment Objectives 

The Matching Funds 

Investment Objective of the Managed Futures Fund 

The Managed Futures Fund seeks results that, both over a single day and over time, match (before fees and expenses) the performance of its index. If the Managed Futures Fund is successful in meeting its objective, its value (before fees and expenses) should gain approximately as much on a percentage basis as the level of the S&#38;P Strategic Futures Index (the &#147;SFI&#148;) when the index rises. Conversely, its value (before fees and expenses) should lose approximately as much on a percentage basis as the level of the SFI when the index declines. The Managed Futures Fund attempts to profit in both rising and falling markets by obtaining investment exposure to its benchmark through the relevant futures contracts. 

Investment Objectives of the &#147;Matching VIX&#148; Funds 

Each &#147;Matching VIX&#148; Fund seeks results, both over a single day and over time, that match (before fees and expenses) the performance of the S&#38;P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Index (the &#147;Short-Term VIX Index&#148;) or the S&#38;P 500 VIX Mid-Term Futures Index (the &#147;Mid-Term VIX Index&#148;) (each a &#147;VIX Futures Index&#148; and together, the &#147;VIX Futures Indexes&#148;). The VIX Futures Indexes seek to offer exposure to forward market equity volatility through publicly traded futures markets. If a Matching VIX Fund is successful in meeting its objective, its value (before fees and expenses) should gain approximately as much on a percentage basis as the level of its corresponding VIX Futures Index when the benchmark rises. Conversely, its value (before fees and expenses) should lose approximately as much on a percentage basis as the level of its benchmark when the benchmark declines. Each Matching VIX Fund acquires exposure through VIX futures contracts, such that each Matching VIX Fund has exposure intended to approximate its applicable VIX Futures Index at the time of its NAV calculation. The VIX Futures Indexes track the performance of VIX futures contracts; they do not track the performance of the Chicago Board Options Exchange (&#147;CBOE&#148;) Volatility Index (the &#147;VIX&#148;), and the Matching VIX Funds should not be expected to match the performance of the VIX. 

The Geared Funds 

Investment Objectives of the &#147;Short&#148; Funds 

Each &#147;Short&#148; Fund seeks daily investment results (before fees and expenses) that correspond to the inverse (-1x) of the daily performance, whether positive or negative, of the corresponding benchmark shown below. Expenses may include, among other things, costs related to the purchase, sale and storage of commodities or currencies and the cost of leverage, all of which may be embedded in Financial Instruments used by that Fund. If a Short Fund is successful in meeting its objective, its value on a given day (before fees and expenses) should gain approximately as much on a percentage basis as its corresponding benchmark when the benchmark declines. Conversely, its value on a given day (before fees and expenses) should lose approximately as much on a percentage basis as the corresponding benchmark when the benchmark rises. Each Short Fund will acquire short exposure through any one of or combinations of Financial Instruments, including Financial Instruments with respect to the applicable Short Fund&#146;s benchmark, such that each Short Fund has exposure intended to approximate the inverse (-1x) of its corresponding benchmark at the time of its NAV calculation. 

&#160;

Investment Objectives of the &#147;UltraShort&#148; Funds 

Each &#147;UltraShort&#148; Fund seeks daily investment results (before fees and expenses) that correspond to two times the inverse (-2x) of the daily performance, whether positive or negative, of the corresponding benchmark shown below. Expenses may include, among other things, costs related to the purchase, sale and storage of commodities or currencies and the cost of leverage, all of which may be embedded in Financial Instruments used by that Fund. If an UltraShort Fund is successful in meeting its objective, its value on a given day (before fees and expenses) should gain approximately two times as much on a percentage basis as its corresponding benchmark when the benchmark declines. Conversely, its value on a given day (before fees and expenses) should lose approximately two times as much on a percentage basis as the corresponding benchmark when the benchmark rises. Each UltraShort Fund acquires short exposure through any one of or combinations of Financial Instruments, including Financial Instruments with respect to the applicable UltraShort Fund&#146;s benchmark, such that each UltraShort Fund has exposure intended to approximate two times the inverse (-2x) of its corresponding benchmark at the time of its NAV calculation. 

Investment Objectives of the &#147;Ultra&#148; Funds 

Each &#147;Ultra&#148; Fund seeks daily investment results (before fees and expenses) that correspond to two times (2x) the daily performance, whether positive or negative, of the corresponding benchmark shown below. Expenses may include, among other things, costs related to the purchase, sale and storage of commodities or currencies and the cost of leverage, all of which may be embedded in Financial Instruments used by that Fund. If an Ultra Fund is successful in meeting its objective, its value on a given day (before fees and expenses) should gain approximately two times as much on a percentage basis as its corresponding benchmark when the benchmark rises. Conversely, its value on a given day (before fees and expenses) should lose approximately two times as much on a percentage basis as the corresponding benchmark when the benchmark declines. Each Ultra Fund acquires long exposure through any one of or combinations of Financial Instruments, including Financial Instruments with respect to the applicable Ultra Fund&#146;s benchmark such that each Ultra Fund has exposure intended to approximate two times (2x) its corresponding benchmark at the time of its NAV calculation. 

The corresponding benchmark for each Fund is listed below:

Principal Investment Strategies 

In seeking to achieve each Fund&#146;s investment objective, the Sponsor uses a mathematical approach to investing. Using this approach, the Sponsor determines the type, quantity and mix of investment positions, which the Sponsor believes in combination, should produce daily returns consistent with a Fund&#146;s objective. The Sponsor relies upon a pre-determined model to generate orders that result in repositioning each Fund&#146;s investments in accordance with their respective investment objectives. Each Geared Fund invests principally in any one of or combinations of Financial Instruments, including swap agreements, futures contracts, forward contracts and other instruments with respect to the applicable Fund&#146;s benchmark to the extent determined appropriate by the Sponsor. The types of commodity or currency interests in which each Commodity Fund, Commodity Index Fund or Currency Fund invests may vary daily. The Funds do not currently intend to invest directly in any commodity or currency. Each VIX Fund intends to obtain exposure to the applicable equity market volatility index by primarily investing in VIX futures contracts based on the VIX. Each Fund will also hold cash or cash equivalents such as U.S. Treasury securities or other high credit quality, short-term fixed-income or similar securities (such as shares of money market funds and collateralized repurchase agreements) for direct investment or as collateral for Financial Instruments. Each Fund may invest up to 100% of its assets in any of these types of cash or cash equivalent securities. 

The Sponsor does not invest the assets of the Funds based on its view of the investment merit of a particular investment, other than for cash management purposes, nor does it conduct conventional volatility, commodity or currency research or analysis, or forecast market movement or trends, in managing the assets of the Funds. Each Fund seeks to remain fully invested at all times in Financial Instruments and money market instruments that, in combination, provide exposure to its underlying benchmark consistent with its investment objective without regard to market conditions, trends or direction. 

Certain of the Funds may obtain exposure through Financial Instruments to a representative sample of the components in its underlying index, which have aggregate characteristics similar to those of the underlying index. This &#147;sampling&#148; process typically involves selecting a representative sample of components in an index principally to enhance liquidity and reduce transaction costs while seeking to maintain high correlation with, and similar aggregate characteristics (e.g., underlying commodities and valuations) to, the underlying index. In addition, the Funds may obtain exposure to components not included in the underlying index, invest in assets that are not included in the underlying index or may overweight or underweight certain components contained in the underlying index. For further discussion of the Financial Instruments, see &#147;Information About Financial Instruments and Commodities Markets&#148; below. 

&#160;

Information About Financial Instruments and Commodities Markets 

Swap Agreements 

Swap agreements are two-party contracts that have traditionally been entered into primarily by institutional investors in over the counter (&#147;OTC&#148;) markets for a specified period ranging from a day to more than a year. However, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#147;Dodd-Frank Act&#148;) provides for significant reforms of the OTC derivatives markets, including a requirement to execute certain swap and forward transactions on a CFTC-regulated market and/or to clear such transactions through a CFTC-regulated central clearing organization. In a standard swap transaction, the parties agree to exchange the returns on a particular predetermined investment, instrument or index for a fixed or floating rate of return (the &#147;interest rate leg,&#148; which will also include the cost of borrowing for short swaps) in respect of a predetermined notional amount. The notional amount of the agreement reflects the extent of a Fund&#146;s total investment exposure under the swap agreement. Transaction or commission costs are reflected in the benchmark level at which the transaction is entered into. The gross returns to be exchanged are calculated with respect to the notional amount and the benchmark returns to which the swap is linked. Swaps are usually closed out on a net basis, i.e. , the two payment streams are netted out in a cash settlement on the payment date specified in the agreement, with the parties receiving or paying, as the case may be, only the net amount of the two payments. Thus, while the notional amount reflects a Fund&#146;s total investment exposure under the swap agreement ( i.e. , the entire face amount or principal of a swap agreement), the net amount is a Fund&#146;s current obligations (or rights) under the swap agreement, which is the net amount to be paid or received under the agreement based on the relative values of the positions held by each party to the agreement on any given termination date. In a typical swap agreement entered into by an UltraShort Fund or a Short Fund, absent fees, transaction costs and interest, such Fund would be required to make payments to the swap counterparty in the event the benchmark increases and would be entitled to settlement payments in the event the benchmark decreases. In a typical swap agreement entered into by an Ultra Fund, absent fees, transaction costs and interest, the Ultra Fund would be entitled to settlement payments in the event the benchmark increases and would be required to make payments to the swap counterparty in the event the benchmark decreases. In the case of futures contracts-based indexes, such as those used by the VIX Fund, the Managed Futures Fund and the Commodity Index Funds, the reference interest rate is zero, although a financing spread or fee is normally still applied. 

Swap agreements involve, to varying degrees, elements of market risk and exposure to loss in excess of the amount which would be reflected on the Statement of Financial Condition. The notional amounts of the agreement reflect the extent of each Ultra Fund&#146;s total investment exposure under the swap agreement. An UltraShort Fund&#146;s or a Short Fund&#146;s exposure is not limited by the notional amount and its exposure is in theory potentially infinite as there is no fixed limit on the increase in any index value. The primary risks associated with the use of swap agreements arise from the inability of counterparties to perform. Each Fund that invests in swaps bears the risk of loss of the net amount, if any, expected to be received under a swap agreement in the event of the default or bankruptcy of a swap counterparty. Each such Fund enters or intends to enter into swap agreements only with major, global financial institutions; however, there are no limitations on the percentage of its assets each Fund may invest in swap agreements with a particular counterparty. Each Fund that invests in swaps may use various techniques to minimize credit risk including early termination or reset and payment, using different counterparties and limiting the net amount due from any individual counterparty. 

Each Fund that invests in swaps generally collateralizes the swap agreements with cash and/or certain securities. Collateral posted in connection with uncleared derivative transactions is generally held for the benefit of the counterparty in a segregated tri-party account at the Custodian to protect the counterparty against non-payment by the Fund. The counterparty also may collateralize the uncleared swap agreements with cash and/or certain securities, which collateral is typically held for the benefit of the Fund in a segregated tri-party account at the Custodian. In the event of a default by the counterparty, and the Fund is owed money in the uncleared swap transaction, such Fund will seek withdrawal of this collateral from the segregated account and may incur certain costs exercising its right with respect to the collateral. These Funds remain subject to credit risk with respect to the amount it expects to receive from counterparties. 

The Funds have sought to mitigate these risks in connection with the uncleared OTC swaps by generally requiring that the counterparties for each Fund agree to post collateral for the benefit of the Fund, marked to market daily, subject to certain minimum thresholds; however there are no limitations on the percentage of its assets each Fund may invest in swap agreements with a particular counterparty. To the extent any such collateral is insufficient or there are delays in accessing the collateral, the Funds will be exposed to counterparty risk as described above, including possible delays in recovering amounts as a result of bankruptcy proceedings. 

&#160;

The counterparty risk for cleared derivative transactions is generally lower than for uncleared OTC derivatives since generally a clearing organization becomes substituted for each counterparty to a cleared derivative contract and, in effect, guarantees the parties&#146; performance under the contract as each party to a trade looks only to the clearing house for performance of financial obligations. In addition, cleared derivative transactions benefit from daily marking-to-market and settlement, and segregation and minimum capital requirements applicable to intermediaries. 

Forward Contracts 

A forward contract is a contractual obligation to purchase or sell a specified quantity of a particular underlying asset at or before a specified date in the future at a specified price and, therefore, is economically similar to a futures contract. Unlike futures contracts, however, forward contracts are typically traded in the OTC markets and are not standardized contracts. Forward contracts for a given commodity or currency are generally available for various amounts and maturities and are subject to individual negotiation between the parties involved. Moreover, there is generally no direct means of offsetting or closing out a forward contract by taking an offsetting position as one would a futures contract on a U.S. exchange. If a trader desires to close out a forward contract position, he generally will establish an opposite position in the contract but will settle and recognize the profit or loss on both positions simultaneously on the delivery date. Thus, unlike in the futures contract market where a trader who has offset positions will recognize profit or loss immediately, in the forward market a trader with a position that has been offset at a profit will generally not receive such profit until the delivery date, and likewise a trader with a position that has been offset at a loss will generally not have to pay money until the delivery date. In recent years, however, the terms of forward contracts have become more standardized, and in some instances such contracts now provide a right of offset or cash settlement as an alternative to making or taking delivery of the underlying commodity or currency. The primary risks associated with the use of forward contracts arise from the inability of the counterparty to perform. 

Each Fund that invests in forward contracts generally collateralizes the uncleared forward contracts with cash and/or certain securities. Such collateral is generally held for the benefit of the counterparty in a segregated tri-party account at the Custodian to protect the counterparty against non-payment by the Fund. The counterparty also may collateralize the uncleared forward contracts with cash and/or certain securities, which collateral is typically held for the benefit of the Fund in a segregated tri-party account at the Custodian. In the event of a default by the counterparty, and the Fund is owed money in the uncleared forward transaction, such Fund will seek withdrawal of this collateral from the segregated account and may incur certain costs exercising its right with respect to the collateral. These Funds remain subject to credit risk with respect to the amount it expects to receive from OTC counterparties. 

The Funds have sought to mitigate these risks with respect to uncleared OTC forwards by generally requiring that the counterparties for each Fund agree to post collateral for the benefit of the Fund, marked to market daily, subject to certain minimum thresholds; however, there are no limitations on the percentage of its assets each Fund may invest in forward contracts with a particular counterparty. To the extent any such collateral is insufficient or there are delays in accessing the collateral, the Funds will be exposed to counterparty risk as described above, including possible delays in recovering amounts as a result of bankruptcy proceedings. 

The forward markets provide what has typically been a highly liquid market for foreign exchange trading, and in certain cases the prices quoted for foreign exchange forward contracts may be more favorable than the prices for foreign exchange futures contracts traded on U.S. exchanges. Forward contracts have traditionally not been cleared or guaranteed by a third party. However, the Dodd-Frank Act provides for significant reforms of OTC derivatives markets. As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFTC now regulates non-deliverable forwards (including deliverable forwards where the parties do not take delivery). Certain non-deliverable forward contracts, such as non-deliverable foreign exchange forwards, may be subject to regulation as swap agreements, including mandatory clearing. All foreign exchange forwards, including non-deliverable foreign exchange forwards as well as physically settled foreign exchange forwards, are subject to new reporting requirements. Changes in the forward markets may entail increased costs and result in burdensome reporting requirements. 

&#160;

Commercial banks participating in trading OTC foreign exchange forward contracts often do not require margin deposits, but rely upon internal credit limitations and their judgments regarding the creditworthiness of their counterparties. In recent years, however, many OTC market participants in foreign exchange trading have begun to require that their counterparties post margin. 

Futures Contracts 

A futures contract is a standardized contract traded on, or subject to the rules of, an exchange that calls for the future delivery of a specified quantity and type of commodity at a specified time and place or alternatively, may call for cash settlement as is the case with VIX futures contracts. Futures contracts are traded on a wide variety of commodities, including bonds, interest rates, agricultural products, stock indexes, currencies, energy, metals, economic indicators and statistical measures. The notional size and calendar term of futures contracts on a particular commodity are identical and are not subject to any negotiation, other than with respect to price and the number of contracts traded between the buyer and seller. Each Fund generally deposits cash with a Futures Commission Merchant (&#147;FCM&#148;) for its open positions in futures contracts, which may, in turn, transfer such deposits to the clearing house to protect the clearing house against non-payment by the Fund. The clearing house becomes substituted for each counterparty to a futures contract, and, in effect, guarantees performance. In addition, the FCM may require the Funds to deposit collateral in excess of the clearing house&#146;s margin requirements for the FCM&#146;s own protection. 

Certain futures contracts, such as VIX futures contracts (including the futures contracts that comprise each of the VIX Futures Indexes), as well as stock index contracts and certain commodity futures contracts, settle in cash, reflecting the difference between the contract purchase/sale price and the contract settlement price. The cash settlement mechanism avoids the potential for either side to have to deliver the underlying asset. For other futures contracts, the contractual obligations of a buyer or seller may generally be satisfied by taking or making physical delivery of the underlying asset or by making an offsetting sale or purchase of an identical futures contract on the same or linked exchange before the designated date of delivery. The difference between the price at which the futures contract is purchased or sold and the price paid for the offsetting sale or purchase, after allowance for brokerage commissions, constitutes the profit or loss to the trader. 

Regulations 

Derivatives exchanges in the United States are subject to regulation under the CEA, by the CFTC, the governmental agency having responsibility for regulation of derivatives exchanges and trading on those exchanges. Following the adoption of the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFTC also has authority to regulate OTC derivative markets, including certain OTC foreign exchange markets. The CFTC has exclusive authority to designate exchanges for the trading of specific futures contracts and options on futures contracts and to prescribe rules and regulations of the marketing of each. The CFTC also regulates the activities of &#147;commodity pool operators&#148; and the CFTC has adopted regulations with respect to certain of such persons&#146; activities. Pursuant to its authority, the CFTC requires a commodity pool operator, such as the Sponsor, to keep accurate, current and orderly records with respect to each pool it operates. The CFTC may suspend, modify or terminate the registration of any registrant for failure to comply with CFTC rules or regulations. Suspension, restriction or termination of the Sponsor&#146;s registration as a commodity pool operator would prevent it, until such time (if any) as such registration were to be reinstated, from managing, and might result in the termination of the Funds. If the Sponsor were unable to provide services and/or advice to the Funds, the Funds would be unable to pursue their investment objectives unless and until the Sponsor&#146;s ability to provide services and advice to the Funds was reinstated or a replacement for the Sponsor as commodity pool operator could be found. Such an event could result in termination of the Funds. 

The CEA requires all FCMs to meet and maintain specified fitness and financial requirements, segregate customer funds from proprietary funds and account separately for all customers&#146; funds and positions, and to maintain specified books and records open to inspection by the staff of the CFTC. See &#147;Item 1A. Risk Factors. Risks Related to Regulatory Requirements and Potential Legislative Changes-Failure of the FCMs to segregate assets may increase losses in the Funds&#148; in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

The CEA also gives the states certain powers to enforce its provisions and the regulations of the CFTC. 

Under certain circumstances, the CEA grants shareholders the right to institute a reparations proceeding before the CFTC against the Sponsor (as a registered commodity pool operator), an FCM, as well as those of their respective employees who are required to be registered under the CEA. Shareholders may also be able to maintain a private right of action for certain violations of the CEA. 

&#160;

Pursuant to authority in the CEA, the National Futures Association (the &#147;NFA&#148;) has been formed and registered with the CFTC as a registered futures association. At the present time, the NFA is the only self-regulatory organization for commodities professionals other than exchanges. As such, the NFA promulgates rules governing the conduct of commodity professionals and disciplines those professionals that do not comply with such standards. The CFTC has delegated to the NFA responsibility for the registration of commodity pool operators, FCMs, swap dealers, commodity trading advisors, introducing brokers and their respective associated persons and floor brokers. The Sponsor is a member of the NFA (the Funds themselves are not required to become members of the NFA). As an NFA member, the Sponsor is subject to NFA standards relating to fair trade practices, financial condition, and consumer protection. The CFTC is prohibited by statute from regulating trading on foreign commodity exchanges and markets. 

The CEA and CFTC regulations prohibit market abuse and generally require that all futures exchange-based trading be conducted in compliance with rules designed to ensure the integrity of market prices and without any intent to manipulate prices. CFTC regulations and futures exchange rules also impose limits on the size of the positions that a person may hold or control as well as standards for aggregating certain positions. The rules of the CFTC and the futures exchanges also authorize special emergency actions to halt, suspend or limit trading overall or to restrict, halt, suspend or limit the trading of an individual trader or to otherwise impose special reporting or margin requirements. See also &#147;Item 1A. Risk Factors. Regulatory changes or actions, including the implementation of new Legislation, may alter the operations and profitability of the Funds&#148; and &#147;Item 1A. Risk Factors. Regulatory and exchange accountability levels may restrict the creation of Creation Units and the operation of the Trust&#148; in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Description of the S&#38;P Strategic Futures Index (&#147;SFI&#148;) 

Developed by S&#38;P and launched on August 14, 2014, the SFI is a long/short rules-based investable index that seeks to capture the economic benefit derived from both rising and declining trends in futures prices. The SFI is currently composed of 24 underlying futures contracts (each, a SFI Futures Contract, collectively, the SFI Futures Contracts), representing unleveraged long or short positions in futures contracts in the commodity and financial markets. The SFI includes both commodity futures contracts (the &#147;Commodity Futures Contracts&#148;) as well as currency and U.S. Treasury futures contracts (the &#147;Financial Futures Contracts&#148;) that were deemed to have sufficient liquidity. 

The weight assigned to each SFI Futures Contract is determined on a monthly basis, and implemented as of each monthly repositioning. Weights are determined using a proprietary risk-weighting methodology that measures the risk exposure of the SFI Futures Contracts and then weights each SFI Futures Contract so that it contributes the same level of risk to the SFI. 

The SFI&#146;s exposure to the SFI Futures Contracts are not long-only, but will be either long or short based on a comparison of the current price input of each SFI Futures Contract with its own seven-month weighted moving average of its price input. 

The following chart reflects the December 31, 2015 weight (rounded to the nearest one-hundredth) for each SFI Futures Contract of the SFI. The weights will be determined each month and implemented as of the next monthly rebalancing.

&#160;

&#160; &#160; &#160; 100 % Determining the Long/Short Positioning of each SFI Futures Contract 

Each month, S&#38;P will determine whether an SFI Futures Contract should be either a long or short position by comparing the price change of the most recent month (the &#147;First Month Price Change&#148;) of the SFI Futures Contract to the seven-month exponential weighted moving average price change (the &#147;Seven Month Price Change&#148;). Long positions are tracked when an SFI Futures Contract&#146;s First Month Price Change is greater than or equal to the Seven Month Price Change. Short positions are tracked when an SFI Futures Contract&#146;s First Month Price Change is less than the Seven Month Price Change. The First Month Price Change of each SFI Futures Contract is calculated by calculating the percentage difference of each SFI Futures Contract&#146;s price on the last PDD (as defined below) relative to the current PDD. 

When calculating the Seven Month Price Change, each month&#146;s price input is represented as the monthly percentage change of an SFI Futures Contract&#146;s price which is calculated in the same manner as the First Month Price Change. Monthly positions are determined on the second to last SFI business day of the month (defined as the position determination date, or &#147;PDD&#148;) when the monthly percentage change of an SFI Future Contract&#146;s price is compared to past monthly price changes, exponentially weighted to give greatest weight to the most recent return and least weight to the return seven months prior. The weighted sum of the percentage changes of all SFI Futures Contract prices equals the daily movement of the SFI. To create an exponential average for comparison, price inputs (percentage change from current and previous PDDs) are weighted per the schedule below. Due to this weighting methodology, current price movements are more important than those of the more distant past.

&#160;

&#160; Total 

&#160; &#160; 100 % Rolling 

During this monthly rebalancing, the SFI will also &#147;roll&#148; certain of its positions from the current contract to a contract further from settlement. In order to maintain consistent exposure to the SFI Futures Contracts that compose the SFI, each SFI Futures Contract must be sold prior to its expiration date and replaced by a contract maturing at a specified date in the future. This process is known as &#147;rolling.&#148; SFI Futures Contracts are rolled periodically. The rolls are implemented pursuant to a roll schedule over a five-day period from the first (1 st ) through the fifth (5 th ) index business days of the month. An index business day is any day on which the majority of the SFI Futures Contracts are open for official trading and official settlement prices are provided, excluding holidays and weekends. 

&#160;

In order to mitigate the potential negative impact of contango on long commodity positions, certain Commodity Futures Contracts will be rolled according to an &#147;enhanced&#148; rolling methodology. This methodology seeks to modify the normal roll methodology for futures contracts in the energy sector when such long position would be materially and negatively impacted by contango. In addition, the methodology identifies seasonal factors applicable to both the energy and agricultural futures markets and implements a modified roll to mitigate potential costs of such seasonal impacts.

Description of the Bloomberg Commodity Index SM and its Sub-Indexes 

Overview of the Bloomberg Family of Indices 

Bloomberg Commodity Index SM 

The Bloomberg Commodity Index SM (the &#147;Bloomberg Commodity Index&#148;) is designed to be a highly liquid and diversified benchmark for the commodity futures market. It is intended to reflect the overall commodity sector by measuring the performance of commodity futures contracts. The performance of the commodity futures market is often very different than the performance of the physical, or &#147;spot&#148;, commodities market. See &#147;Item 1A. Risk Factors. The Commodity Index Funds are linked to an index comprised of commodity futures contracts, and are not linked to the spot prices of the underlying physical commodities. Commodity futures contracts may perform very differently from the spot price of the underlying physical commodities&#148; in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Unlike equities, which entitle the holder to a continuing stake in a corporation, commodity futures contracts specify a delivery date for the underlying physical commodity or its cash equivalent. The Bloomberg Commodity Index is a &#147;rolling index,&#148; which means that the Bloomberg Commodity Index does not take actual physical possession of any commodities; rather, it tracks a rolling futures position. An investor with a rolling futures position is able to avoid delivering (or taking delivery of) underlying physical commodities while maintaining exposure to those commodities. The roll for each index component occurs over a period of five Bloomberg Commodity Index business days in certain months according to a pre-determined schedule, generally beginning on the fifth business day of the month and ending on the ninth business day. Each day, approximately 20% of each rolling futures position that is included in the month&#146;s roll is rolled, increasing from 0% to 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% and finally 100%. The Bloomberg Commodity Index is calculated by applying the weighting adjustments at the close of each day, with the adjusted weights used for the next day&#146;s calculation. Not all contracts are rolled every month; generally the futures that underlie the indexes within the Bloomberg Commodity Index family roll approximately every other month. The exact roll methodology differs between certain commodities. The index will reflect the performance of its underlying commodities, including the impact of rolling, without regard to income earned on cash positions. For more information about the risks associated with rolling futures positions, see &#147;Item 1A. Risk Factors. Potential negative impact from rolling futures positions&#148; in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

The Bloomberg Commodity Index is comprised of five different commodity sectors: energy, livestock, industrial metals, precious metals and agriculture. These five sectors track futures contracts prices of 22 specific commodities: natural gas, WTI crude oil, brent crude, RBOB gasoline, ULS Diesel, live cattle, lean hogs, Chicago wheat, Kansas City wheat, corn, soybeans, soybean oil, soybean meal, aluminum, COMEX copper, zinc, nickel, gold, silver, sugar, cotton and coffee. The Bloomberg Commodity Index is designed to minimize concentration in any one commodity or sector. No single commodity can constitute more than 15% of the Bloomberg Commodity Index and no related group of commodities ( e.g. , energy, precious metals, livestock or grains) may constitute more than 33% of the index as of the annual reweighting of the components. The Bloomberg Commodity Index family of indices also includes ten subindexes that group commodities based on type, as well as single commodity subindexes representing each of the commodities that are currently tracked by the Bloomberg Commodity Index. As discussed below, ProShares UltraShort Bloomberg Crude Oil and ProShares Ultra Bloomberg Crude Oil are designed to track one of these subindexes, the Bloomberg WTI Crude Oil Subindex SM and ProShares UltraShort Bloomberg Natural Gas and ProShares Ultra Bloomberg Natural Gas are designed to track another one of these sub-indexes, the Bloomberg Natural Gas Subindex SM . 

To determine its component weightings, the Bloomberg Commodity Index relies primarily on liquidity data, or the relative amount of trading activity of a particular commodity. Liquidity is an important indicator of the value placed on a commodity by financial and physical market participants. The index also relies to a lesser extent on dollar-adjusted production data. The index thus relies on data that is endogenous to the futures markets (liquidity) and exogenous to the futures markets (production) in determining relative weightings. All data used in both the liquidity and production calculations is averaged over a five-year period. 

In consultation with the Bloomberg Commodity Index Advisory Committee, the Bloomberg Commodity Index Supervisory Committee meets annually to determine the composition of the index in accordance with the rules established in the Bloomberg Handbook. The Supervisory Committee consists of employees of Bloomberg. Bloomberg Commodity Index Advisory Committee members are drawn from the academic, financial and legal communities. The Bloomberg Commodity Index is re-weighted and rebalanced each year in January on a price-percentage basis. The annual weightings for the Index are determined each year in June or July by Bloomberg under the supervision of the Bloomberg Commodity Index Oversight Committee, announced after approval by the Committee and implemented the following January. 

&#160;

The Bloomberg Commodity Index is composed of commodities traded on U.S. exchanges, with the exception of aluminum, nickel and zinc, which trade on the London Metal Exchange. Trading hours for the U.S. commodity exchanges are between 8:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. (Eastern Time). The Bloomberg Commodity Index contract trades exclusively on the Chicago Board of Trade&#146;s (&#147;CBOT&#148;) electronic trading platform. A daily settlement price for the Bloomberg Commodity Index is published at approximately 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time). 

The Bloomberg Commodity Index is designed to provide:

&#160; &#149; &#160; Diversification &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Annual reweighting and rebalancing &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Liquidity The Bloomberg Commodity Index is a proprietary index that Bloomberg calculates. The methodology for determining the composition and weighting of the Bloomberg Commodity Index and for calculating its level is subject to modification at any time. Bloomberg disseminates the Index level at least every 15 seconds from 8:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. (Eastern Time), and publishes a daily Index level at approximately 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time), each business day. 

As of December 31, 2015, the individual commodity weightings for the Bloomberg Commodity Index components were as follows: 

&#160;

Commodity &#160; Target Weights (%) &#160; Gold

&#160; &#160; 12.68 % Corn

&#160; &#160; 7.98 % Natural Gas

&#160; &#160; 4.72 % WTI Crude Oil

&#160; &#160; 7.42 % Soybeans

&#160; &#160; 5.65 % Live Cattle

&#160; &#160; 3.34 % Sugar

&#160; &#160; 5.00 % Brent Crude Oil

&#160; &#160; 6.28 % Coffee

&#160; &#160; 1.95 % Chicago Wheat

&#160; &#160; 3.28 % Silver

&#160; &#160; 4.34 % Zinc

&#160; &#160; 2.21 % Soybean Oil

&#160; &#160; 3.17 % Nickel

&#160; &#160; 1.46 % ULS Diesel

&#160; &#160; 3.14 % Soybean Meal

&#160; &#160; 2.50 % RBOB Gasoline

&#160; &#160; 4.23 % Lean Hogs

&#160; &#160; 1.78 % Kansas City Wheat

&#160; &#160; 1.08 % Cotton

&#160; &#160; 1.93 % Bloomberg WTI Crude Oil Subindex SM 

ProShares UltraShort Bloomberg Crude Oil and ProShares Ultra Bloomberg Crude Oil are designed to correspond (before fees and expenses) to two times the inverse (-2x) or two times (2x), respectively, of the daily performance of the Bloomberg WTI Crude Oil Subindex SM , a sub-index of the Bloomberg Commodity Index. The Bloomberg WTI Crude Oil Subindex SM is intended to reflect the performance of crude oil as measured by the price of futures contracts of West Texas Intermediate sweet, light crude oil traded on the NYMEX, including the impact of rolling, without regard to income earned on cash positions. The performance of the crude oil futures market is normally very different than the performance of the physical crude oil market ( e.g. , the price of crude oil at port). See &#147;Item 1A. Risk Factors. The Commodity Index Funds are linked to an index comprised of commodity futures contracts, and are not directly linked to the spot prices of the underlying physical commodities. Commodity futures contracts may perform very differently from the spot price of the underlying physical commodities&#148; in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

&#160;

The Bloomberg WTI Crude Oil Subindex SM is based on the Crude Oil component of the Bloomberg Commodity Index, which is described above under &#147;Bloomberg Commodity Index SM ,&#148; and tracks what is known as a rolling futures position. The roll occurs over a period of five Bloomberg business days in certain months according to a pre-determined schedule, generally beginning on the fifth business day of the month and ending on the ninth business day. Each day, approximately 20% of each rolling futures position that is included in the month&#146;s roll is rolled, increasing from 0% to 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% and finally 100%. The exact roll methodology differs between certain commodities. The Bloomberg WTI Crude Oil Subindex SM will reflect the performance of its underlying crude oil futures contracts, including the impact of rolling, without regard to income earned on cash positions. For more information about the risks associated with rolling futures positions, see &#147;Item 1A. Risk Factors. Potential negative impact from rolling futures positions&#148; in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Bloomberg Natural Gas Subindex SM 

ProShares UltraShort Bloomberg Natural Gas and ProShares Ultra Bloomberg Natural Gas are designed to correspond (before fees and expenses) to two times the inverse (-2x) or two times (2x) of the daily performance of the Bloomberg Natural Gas Subindex SM , respectively. The Bloomberg Natural Gas Subindex SM is intended to reflect the performance of a rolling position in natural gas futures contracts traded on the NYMEX without regard to income earned on cash positions. An investment in natural gas futures contracts may often perform very differently than the price of physical natural gas ( e.g. , the wellhead or end-user price of natural gas). See &#147;Item 1A. Risk Factors. The Commodity Index Funds are linked to an index comprised of commodity futures contracts, and are not linked to the spot prices of the underlying physical commodities. Commodity futures contracts may perform very differently from the spot price of the underlying physical commodities&#148; in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

The Bloomberg Natural Gas Subindex SM is based on the Natural Gas component of the Bloomberg Commodity Index, which is described above under &#147;Bloomberg Commodity Index SM ,&#148; and tracks what is known as a rolling futures position. The roll occurs over a period of five Bloomberg Commodity Index business days in certain months according to a pre-determined schedule, generally beginning on the fifth business day of the month and ending on the ninth business day. Each day, approximately 20% of each rolling futures position that is included in the month&#146;s roll is rolled, increasing from 0% to 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% and finally 100%. The exact roll methodology differs between certain commodities. The index will reflect the performance of its underlying natural gas contracts, including the impact of rolling, without regard to income earned on cash positions. For more information about the risks associated with rolling futures positions, see &#147;Item 1A. Risk Factors. Potential negative impact from rolling futures positions&#148; in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Description of the Commodity Benchmarks 

Gold 

ProShares UltraShort Gold and ProShares Ultra Gold are designed to correspond (before fees and expenses) to two times the inverse (-2x) or two times (2x), respectively, of the daily performance of gold bullion as measured by the U.S. dollar p.m. LBMA Gold Price. The Funds do not directly or physically hold the underlying gold, but instead, seek exposure to gold through the use of Financial Instruments whose value is based on the underlying price of gold to pursue their investment objective. The benchmark price of gold is the U.S. dollar price of gold bullion as measured by the London afternoon fixing price per troy ounce of unallocated gold bullion for delivery in London through a member of the LBMA authorized to affect such delivery. On March 19, 2015, the company that ran the London U.S. dollar gold fixing, ceased calculating the price of gold for the LBMA. The LBMA selected ICE Benchmark Administration to calculate the price, which was renamed the LBMA Gold Price, and is based on an electronic, physically settled auction-based methodology, beginning on March 20, 2015. 

The price of gold is volatile with fluctuations expected to affect the value of the Shares of the Fund. The price movement of gold may be influenced by a variety of factors, including announcements from central banks regarding reserve gold holdings, agreements among central banks, political uncertainties and economic concerns. The gold market is a global marketplace consisting of both OTC transactions and exchange-traded products. The OTC market generally consists of transactions in spot, forwards, options and other derivatives, while exchange-traded transactions consist of futures and options. 

The LBMA Gold Price is determined each trading day at 3:00 p.m. London time providing a reference gold price for that day&#146;s trading. Many long-term contracts are priced on the basis of the LBMA Gold Price and market participants will usually refer to the LBMA Gold Price when looking for a basis for valuation. 

Silver 

ProShares UltraShort Silver and ProShares Ultra Silver are designed to correspond (before fees and expenses) to two times the inverse (-2x) or two times (2x), respectively, of the daily performance of silver bullion as measured by the London Silver Price. The Funds do not directly or physically hold the underlying silver, but instead seek exposure to silver through the use of Financial Instruments whose value is based on the underlying price of silver to pursue their investment objective. The benchmark price of silver is the daily performance silver bullion as measured by the London Silver Price. 

The price of silver is volatile with fluctuations expected to affect the value of the Shares of the Fund. The largest industrial users of silver are the photographic, jewelry, and electronic industries and developments in these industries among other factors may influence the price of silver. Like gold, the silver market is a global marketplace consisting of both OTC transactions and exchange-traded products. The OTC market generally consists of transactions in spot, forwards, options and other derivatives, while exchange-traded transactions consist of futures and options. 

The London Silver Price is determined each trading day at 12:00 p.m. London time providing a reference silver price for that day&#146;s trading. Many long-term contracts are priced on the basis of the London Silver Price and market participants will usually refer to the London Silver Price when looking for a basis for valuation. 

Description of the Currencies Benchmarks 

The Currency Funds are designed to correspond (before fees and expenses) to the inverse (-1), two times the inverse (-2x), or two times (2x) of the daily performance of the spot price of the applicable currency versus the U.S. dollar. The spot price of each currency is measured by the 4:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) spot prices as provided by Bloomberg, expressed in terms of U.S. dollars per unit of foreign currency. The Currency Funds do not necessarily directly or physically hold the underlying currency and will instead seek exposure through the use of certain Financial Instruments whose value is based on the price of the underlying currency to pursue its investment objective. 

&#160;

Australian Dollar 

ProShares UltraShort Australian Dollar is designed to correspond (before fees and expenses) to two times the inverse (-2x) of the daily performance of the Australian dollar spot price versus the U.S. dollar, respectively. This Fund uses the 4:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate as provided by Bloomberg, expressed in terms of U.S. dollars per unit of foreign currency, as the basis for the underlying benchmark. 

The Australian dollar is the national currency of Australia and the currency of the accounts of the Reserve Bank of Australia, the Australian central bank. The official currency code for the Australian dollar is &#147;AUD.&#148; The Australian dollar is referred to in Australia as &#147;dollar.&#148; As with U.S. currency, 100 Australian cents are equal to one Australian dollar. In Australia, unlike most other countries, cash transactions are rounded to the nearest five cents. The most commonly used symbol used to represent the Australian dollar is &#147;A$.&#148; 

In 1913, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia issued the first Australian currency notes. In 1915, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia became the exclusive issuer of currency in Australia. From 1930 through the 1960s, the Australian banking system underwent substantial transformation. In 1960, the Reserve Bank of Australia was established. In 1966, a new decimalized currency was introduced. At various times throughout the 1900s, the value of Australian currency was based on a fixed quantity of gold; at other times, the Australian dollar was pegged to foreign currencies, including the U.S. dollar. Beginning in 1983, the Australian dollar&#146;s value was allowed to float, with the result that its value now depends almost entirely on market forces. The foregoing information is compiled from the Reserve Bank of Australia&#146;s website (www.rba.gov.au). 

Euro 

ProShares Short Euro, ProShares UltraShort Euro and ProShares Ultra Euro are designed to correspond (before fees and expenses) to the inverse (-1), two times the inverse (-2x), or two times (2x) of the daily performance of the euro spot price versus the U.S. dollar, respectively. These Funds use the 4:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate as provided by Bloomberg, expressed in terms of U.S. dollars per unit of foreign currency, as the basis for the underlying benchmark. 

In 1998, the European Central Bank in Frankfurt was organized by Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain in order to establish a common currency-the euro. Unlike the U.S. Federal Reserve System, the Bank of Japan and other comparable central banks, the European Central Bank is a central authority that conducts monetary policy for an economic area consisting of many otherwise largely autonomous states. 

At its inception on January 1, 1999, the euro was launched as an electronic currency used by banks, foreign exchange dealers and stock markets. In 2002, the euro became cash currency for approximately 300 million citizens of twelve European countries (the eleven countries mentioned above, in addition to Greece). As of December 31, 2015, 23 countries used the euro, including Andorra, Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Monaco, the Netherlands, Portugal, San Marino, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and the Vatican City. 

Although the European countries that have adopted the euro are members of the European Union (&#147;EU&#148;), the United Kingdom, Denmark and Sweden are EU members that have not adopted the euro as their national currency. 

Japanese Yen 

ProShares UltraShort Yen and ProShares Ultra Yen are designed to correspond (before fees and expenses) to two times the inverse (-2x) or two times (2x), respectively, of the daily performance of the Japanese yen spot price versus the U.S. dollar. These Funds use the 4:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) Japanese yen/U.S. dollar exchange rate as provided by Bloomberg, expressed in terms of U.S. dollars per unit of foreign currency, as the basis for the underlying benchmark. 

The Japanese yen has been the official currency of Japan since 1871. The Bank of Japan has been operating as the central bank of Japan since 1882.

Description of the VIX Futures Indexes 

The VIX Funds seek to offer exposure to forward equity market volatility by obtaining exposure to the VIX Futures Indexes, which are based on publicly traded VIX futures contracts. The VIX Futures Indexes are intended to reflect the returns that are potentially available through an unleveraged investment in the VIX futures contracts comprising each VIX Futures Index. The VIX, which is not the index underlying the VIX Funds, is calculated based on the prices of put and call options on the S&#38;P 500. The VIX Funds can be expected to perform very differently from the VIX. 

The Short-Term VIX Index employs rules for selecting VIX futures contracts comprising the Short-Term VIX Index and a formula to calculate a level for that index from the prices of these VIX futures contracts. Specifically, the VIX futures contracts comprising the Short-Term VIX Index represent the prices of two near-term VIX futures contracts, replicating a position that rolls the nearest month VIX futures to the next month VIX futures on a daily basis in equal fractional amounts. This results in a constant weighted average maturity of one-month. The roll period begins on the Tuesday prior to the monthly CBOE VIX futures settlement and runs through the Tuesday prior to the subsequent month&#146;s CBOE VIX futures settlement date. 

The Mid-Term VIX Index also employs rules for selecting its VIX futures contracts comprising the Mid-Term VIX Index and a formula to calculate a level for that index from the prices of these VIX futures contracts. Specifically, the VIX futures contracts comprising the Mid-Term VIX Index represent the prices for four contract months of VIX futures contracts, representing a rolling long position in the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh month VIX futures contracts. The Mid-Term VIX Index rolls continuously throughout each month while maintaining positions in the fifth and sixth month contracts. This results in a constant weighted average maturity of five months. 

The level of each VIX Futures Index will be published by Bloomberg L.P. in real time and at the close of trading on each VIX Futures Index business day under the following ticker symbols: 

&#160;

&#160; Bloomberg Ticker Symbol

S&#38;P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Index &#160; SPVXSPID S&#38;P 500 VIX Mid-Term Futures Index &#160; SPVXMPID The performance of the VIX Futures Indexes is influenced by the S&#38;P 500 (and options thereon) and the VIX. A description of VIX futures contracts, the VIX and the S&#38;P 500 follows: 

VIX Futures Contracts 

Both VIX Futures Indexes are comprised of VIX futures contracts. VIX futures contracts were first launched for trading by the CBOE in 2004. VIX futures contracts have expirations ranging from the front month consecutively out to the tenth month. VIX futures contracts allow investors the ability to invest based on their view of forward implied market volatility. Investors that believe the forward implied market volatility of the S&#38;P 500, as represented by VIX futures contracts, will increase may buy VIX futures contracts. Conversely, investors that believe that the forward implied market volatility of the S&#38;P 500, as represented by VIX futures contracts, will decline may sell VIX futures contracts. VIX futures contracts are reported by Bloomberg under the ticker symbol &#147;VX.&#148; 

While the VIX represents a measure of the current expected volatility of the S&#38;P 500 over the next 30 days, the prices of VIX futures contracts are based on the current expectation of what the expected 30-day volatility will be at a particular time in the future (on the expiration date). The VIX and VIX futures contracts generally behave quite differently. To illustrate, on November 30, 2015, the VIX was 16.13 and the price of the December 2015 VIX futures contracts expiring on December 16, 2015 was 16.98. In this example, the price of the VIX represented the 30-day implied, or &#147;spot,&#148; volatility (the volatility expected for the period from November 30, 2015 to December 1, 2015) of the S&#38;P 500 and the February VIX futures contracts represented forward implied volatility (the volatility expected for the period from December 16, 2015 to January 15, 2016 of the S&#38;P 500. The spot/forward relationship between the VIX and VIX futures contracts has two noteworthy consequences: (1) the price of a VIX futures contract can be lower, equal to or higher than the VIX, depending on whether the market expects volatility to be lower, equal to or higher in the 30-day forward period covered by the VIX futures contract than in the 30-day spot period covered by the VIX; and (2) an investor cannot create a position equivalent to one in VIX futures contracts by buying the VIX and holding the position to the futures expiration date while financing the transaction. 

&#160;

The VIX 

The VIX Funds are not linked to the VIX and can be expected to perform very differently from the VIX. The VIX is an index designed to measure the implied volatility of the S&#38;P 500 over 30 days in the future, and is calculated based on the prices of certain put and call options on the S&#38;P 500. The VIX is reflective of the premium paid by investors for certain options linked to the level of the S&#38;P 500. During periods of rising investor uncertainty, including periods of market instability, the implied level of volatility of the S&#38;P 500 typically increases and, consequently, the prices of options linked to the S&#38;P 500 typically increase (assuming all other relevant factors remain constant or have negligible changes). This, in turn, causes the level of the VIX to increase. The VIX has historically had a negative correlation to the S&#38;P 500. The VIX was developed by the CBOE and is calculated, maintained and published by the CBOE. The CBOE has no obligation to continue to publish, and may discontinue the publication of, the VIX. The VIX is reported by Bloomberg under the ticker symbol &#147;VIX.&#148; 

The calculation of the VIX involves a formula that uses the prices of a weighted series of out-of-the-money put and call options on the level of the S&#38;P 500 (&#147;SPX Options&#148;) with two adjacent expiry terms to derive a constant 30-day forward measure of market volatility. The VIX is calculated independent of any particular option pricing model and in doing so seeks to eliminate any biases which may otherwise be included in using options pricing methodology based on certain assumptions. Although the VIX measures the 30-day forward volatility of the S&#38;P 500 as implied by the SPX Options, 30-day options are only available once a month. To arrive at the VIX level, a broad range of out-of-the-money SPX Options expiring on the two closest nearby months (&#147;near term options&#148; and &#147;next term options,&#148; respectively) are selected in order to bracket a 30-day calendar period. SPX Options having a maturity of less than eight days are excluded at the outset and, when the near term options have eight days or less left to expiration, the VIX rolls to the second and third contract months in order to minimize pricing anomalies that occur close to expiration. The model-free implied volatility using prices of the near term options and next term options are then calculated on a strike price weighted average basis in order to arrive at a single average implied volatility value for each month. The results of each of the two months are then interpolated to arrive at a single value with a constant maturity of 30 days to expiration. 

The S&#38;P 500 

The S&#38;P 500 is an index that measures large-cap U.S. stock market performance. It is a float-adjusted market capitalization weighted index of 500 U.S. operating companies and real estate investment trusts selected by the S&#38;P U.S. Index Committee through a non-mechanical process that factors in criteria such as liquidity, price, market capitalization and financial viability. Reconstitution occurs both on a quarterly and ongoing basis. As of December 31, 2015, the S&#38;P 500 included companies with capitalizations between $1.8 billion and $586.9 billion. The average capitalization of the companies comprising the Index was approximately $38.9 billion. S&#38;P publishes the S&#38;P 500. The daily calculation of the current value of the S&#38;P 500 is based on the relative value of the aggregate market value of the common stocks of 500 companies as of a particular time compared to the aggregate average initial market value of the common stocks of 500 similar companies at the time of the inception of the S&#38;P 500. The 500 companies are not the 500 largest publicly traded companies and not all 500 companies are listed on the NYSE. S&#38;P chooses companies for inclusion in the S&#38;P 500 with the objective of achieving a distribution by broad industry groupings that approximates the distribution of these groupings in the common stock population of the U.S. equity market. S&#38;P may from time-to-time, in its sole discretion, add companies to, or delete companies from, the S&#38;P 500 to achieve the objectives stated above. Relevant criteria employed by S&#38;P include the viability of the particular company, the extent to which that company represents the industry group to which it is assigned, the extent to which the company&#146;s common stock is widely held and the market value and trading activity of the common stock of that company.

Creation and Redemption of Shares 

Each Fund creates and redeems Shares from time to time, but only in one or more Creation Units. A Creation Unit is a block of 50,000 Shares of the Managed Futures Fund or a Geared Fund or a block of 25,000 Shares of a Matching VIX Fund. Creation Units may be created or redeemed only by Authorized Participants. Except when aggregated in Creation Units, the Shares are not redeemable securities. 

The manner by which Creation Units are purchased and redeemed is dictated by the terms of the Authorized Participant Agreement and Authorized Participant Handbook. By placing a purchase order, an Authorized Participant agrees to deposit cash (unless as provided otherwise in the prospectus) with the Custodian of the Funds. 

If permitted by the Sponsor in its sole discretion with respect to a Fund, an Authorized Participant may also agree to enter into or arrange for an exchange of a futures contract for related position (&#147;EFCRP&#148;) or block trade with the relevant Fund whereby the Authorized Participant would also transfer to such Fund a number and type of exchange-traded futures contracts at or near the closing settlement price for such contracts on the purchase order date. Similarly, the Sponsor in its sole discretion may agree with an Authorized Participant to use an EFCRP to affect an order to redeem Creation Units. 

An EFCRP is a technique permitted by the rules of the applicable futures exchange that, as utilized by a Fund in the Sponsor&#146;s discretion, would allow such Fund to take a position in a futures contract from an Authorized Participant, or give futures contracts to an Authorized Participant, in the case of a redemption, rather than to enter the futures exchange markets to obtain such a position. An EFCRP by itself will not change either party&#146;s net risk position 

&#160;

materially. Because the futures position that a Fund would otherwise need to take in order to meet its investment objective can be obtained without unnecessarily impacting the financial or futures markets or their pricing, EFCRPs can generally be viewed as transactions beneficial to a Fund. A block trade is a technique that permits certain Funds to obtain a futures position without going through the market auction system and can generally be viewed as a transaction beneficial to the Fund. 

Authorized Participants pay a fixed transaction fee of up to $500 in connection with each order to create or redeem a Creation Unit in order to compensate Brown Brothers Harriman &#38; Co. (&#147;BBH&#38;Co.&#148;), as the Administrator, the Custodian and the Transfer Agent of each Fund and its Shares, for services in processing the creation and redemption of Creation Units and to offset the costs of increasing or decreasing derivative positions. Authorized Participants also may pay a variable transaction fee to the Funds of up to 0.10% (and a variable transaction fee to the Matching VIX Funds of 0.05%) of the value of the Creation Unit that is purchased or redeemed unless the transaction fee is waived or otherwise adjusted by the Sponsor. The Sponsor provides such Authorized Participant with prompt notice in advance of any such waiver or adjustment of the transaction fee. Authorized Participants may sell the Shares included in the Creation Units they purchase from the Funds to other investors in the secondary market. 

The form of Authorized Participant Agreement and the related Authorized Participant Handbook set forth the procedures for the creation and redemption of Creation Units and for the payment of cash required for such creations and redemptions. The Sponsor may delegate its duties and obligations under the form of Authorized Participant Agreement to SEI Investments Distribution Co. (&#147;SEI&#148;) or BBH&#38;Co., in its capacity as the Administrator, without consent from any shareholder or Authorized Participant. The form of Authorized Participant Agreement and the related procedures attached thereto may be amended by the Sponsor without the consent of any shareholder or Authorized Participant. Authorized Participants who purchase Creation Units from a Fund receive no fees, commissions or other form of compensation or inducement of any kind from either the Sponsor or the Fund, and no such person has any obligation or responsibility to the Sponsor or the Fund to affect any sale or resale of Shares. 

Authorized Participants are cautioned that some of their activities may result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner which would render them statutory underwriters and subject them to the prospectus delivery and liability provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#147;1933 Act&#148;). 

Each Authorized Participant must be registered as a broker-dealer under the 1934 Act and regulated by Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (&#147;FINRA&#148;), or exempt from being, or otherwise not required to be, so regulated or registered, and must be qualified to act as a broker or dealer in the states or other jurisdictions where the nature of its business so requires. Certain Authorized Participants may be regulated under federal and state banking laws and regulations. Each Authorized Participant must have its own set of rules and procedures, internal controls and information barriers as it determines is appropriate in light of its own regulatory regime. 

Authorized Participants may act for their own accounts or as agents for broker-dealers, custodians and other securities market participants that wish to create or redeem Creation Units. 

Persons interested in purchasing Creation Units should contact the Sponsor or the Administrator to obtain the contact information for the Authorized Participants. Shareholders who are not Authorized Participants are only able to redeem their Shares through an Authorized Participant. 

Pursuant to the Authorized Participant Agreement, the Sponsor agreed to indemnify the Authorized Participants against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the 1933 Act, and to contribute to the payments the Authorized Participants may be required to make in respect of those liabilities. 

The following description of the procedures for the creation and redemption of Creation Units is only a summary and an investor should refer to the relevant provisions of the Amended and Restated Trust Agreement of the Trust, as may be further amended from time to time (the &#147;Trust Agreement&#148;) and the form of Authorized Participant Agreement for more detail. The Trust Agreement and the form of Authorized Participant Agreement are incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

&#160;

Creation Procedures 

On any Business Day, an Authorized Participant may place an order with the Distributor to create one or more Creation Units. For purposes of processing both purchase and redemption orders, a &#147;Business Day&#148; for each Fund means any day on which the NAV of such Fund is determined. Purchase orders must be placed by the cut-off time shown below or earlier if the NYSE, a Fund&#146;s primary listing exchange, or other exchange material to the valuation or operation of such Fund (an &#147;Exchange&#148; as defined below) closes before the cut-off time. If a purchase order is received prior to the applicable cut-off time, the day on which SEI receives a valid purchase order is the purchase order date. If the purchase order is received after the applicable cut-off time, the purchase order date will be the next day. Purchase orders are irrevocable. By placing a purchase order, and prior to delivery of such Creation Units, an Authorized Participant&#146;s DTC account will be charged the non-refundable transaction fee due for the purchase order. 

Determination of Required Payment 

The total payment required to create each Creation Unit is the NAV of 50,000 Shares of the Managed Futures Fund or the applicable Geared Fund or 25,000 Shares of the applicable Matching VIX Fund on the purchase order date plus the applicable transaction fee. For each Fund, Authorized Participants have create/redeem cut-off times prior to the NAV calculation time, which may be different from the close of the U.S. markets, as shown in the table below.

Cash required for settlement will typically be transferred to the Custodian through: (1) the Continuous Net Settlement (&#147;CNS&#148;) clearing process of the National Securities Clearing Corporation (&#147;NSCC&#148;), as such processes have been enhanced to effect creations and redemptions of Creation Units; or (2) the facilities of DTC on a Delivery Versus Payment (&#147;DVP&#148;) basis, which is the procedure in which the buyer&#146;s payment for securities is due at the time of delivery. Security delivery and payment are simultaneous. If the Custodian does not receive the cash by the market close on the first Business Day following the purchase order date (T+1), such order may be charged interest for delayed settlement or cancelled. The Sponsor reserves the right to extend the deadline for the Custodian to receive the cash required for settlement up to the third Business Day following the purchase order date (T+3). In the event a purchase order is cancelled, the Authorized Participant will be responsible for reimbursing the Fund for all costs associated with cancelling the order including costs for repositioning the portfolio. At its sole discretion, the Sponsor may agree to a delivery date other than T+3. Additional fees may apply for special settlement. The Creation Unit will be delivered to the Authorized Participant upon the Custodian&#146;s receipt of the purchase amount. 

Delivery of Exchange of Futures Contract for Related Position (&#147;EFCRP&#148;) Futures Contracts or Block Trades 

In the event that the Sponsor shall have determined to permit the Authorized Participant to transfer futures contracts pursuant to an EFCRP or to engage in a block trade purchase of futures contracts from the Authorized Participant with respect to a Fund, as well as to deliver cash, in the creation process, futures contracts required for settlement must be transferred directly to the Fund&#146;s account at its FCM. If the cash is not received by the market close on the third Business Day following the purchase order date (T+3); such order may be charged interest for delayed 

&#160;

settlements or cancelled. In the event a purchase order is cancelled, the Authorized Participant will be responsible for reimbursing a Fund for all costs associated with cancelling the order including costs for repositioning the portfolio. At its sole discretion, the Sponsor may agree to a delivery date other than T+3. The Creation Unit will be delivered to the Authorized Participant upon the Custodian&#146;s receipt of the cash purchase amount and the futures contracts. 

Suspension or Rejection of Purchase Orders 

In respect of any Fund, the Sponsor may, in its discretion, suspend the right to purchase, or postpone the purchase settlement date, (1) for any period during which any of the NYSE, NYSE Arca, CBOE, CFE, CME (including CBOT and NYMEX) or ICE or other exchange material to the valuation or operation of the Funds (each, an &#147;Exchange&#148;) is closed or when trading is suspended or restricted on such exchanges in any of the underlying commodities; (2) for any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which the fulfillment of a purchase order is not reasonably practicable; or (3) for such other period as the Sponsor determines to be necessary for the protection of the shareholders. The Sponsor will not be liable to any person or in any way for any loss or damages that may result from any such suspension or postponement. 

The Sponsor also may reject a purchase order if: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; it determines that the purchase order is not in proper form; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the Sponsor believes that the purchase order would have adverse tax consequences to a Fund or its shareholders; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the order would be illegal; or &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; circumstances outside the control of the Sponsor make it, for all practical purposes, not feasible to process creations of Creation Units. None of the Sponsor, the Administrator or the Custodian will be liable for the suspension or rejection of any purchase order. 

Redemption Procedures 

The procedures by which an Authorized Participant can redeem one or more Creation Units mirror the procedures for the creation of Creation Units. On any Business Day, an Authorized Participant may place an order with the Distributor to redeem one or more Creation Units. If a redemption order is received prior to the applicable cut-off time, or earlier if the Exchange, or other exchange material to the valuation or operation of such Fund, closes before the cut-off time, the day on which SEI receives a valid redemption order is the redemption order date. If the redemption order is received after the applicable cut-off time, the redemption order date will be the next day. Redemption orders are irrevocable. The redemption procedures allow Authorized Participants to redeem Creation Units. Individual shareholders may not redeem directly from a Fund. 

By placing a redemption order, an Authorized Participant agrees to deliver the Creation Units to be redeemed through DTC&#146;s book-entry system to the applicable Fund not later than noon (Eastern Time), on the first Business Day immediately following the redemption order date (T+1). The Sponsor reserves the right to extend the deadline for the Fund to receive the Creation Units required for settlement up to the third Business Day following the redemption order date (T+3). By placing a redemption order, and prior to receipt of the redemption proceeds, an Authorized Participant must wire to the Custodian the non-refundable transaction fee due for the redemption order or any proceeds due will be reduced by the amount of the fee payable. At its sole discretion, the Sponsor may agree to a delivery date other than T+3. Additional fees may apply for special settlement. 

Upon request of an Authorized Participant made at the time of a redemption order, the Sponsor at its sole discretion may determine, in addition to delivering redemption proceeds, to transfer futures contracts to the Authorized Participant pursuant to an EFCRP or to a block trade sale of futures contracts to the Authorized Participant. 

&#160;

Determination of Redemption Proceeds 

The redemption proceeds from a Fund consist of the cash redemption amount and, if permitted by the Sponsor in its sole discretion with respect to a Fund, an EFCRP or block trade with the relevant Fund, as described in &#147;Creation and Redemption of Shares&#148; above. The cash redemption amount is equal to the NAV of the number of Creation Unit(s) of such Fund requested in the Authorized Participant&#146;s redemption order as of the time of the calculation of such Fund&#146;s NAV on the redemption order date, less transaction fees and any amounts attributable to any applicable EFCRP or block trade. 

Delivery of Redemption Proceeds 

The redemption proceeds due from a Fund are delivered to the Authorized Participant at noon (Eastern Time), on the third Business Day immediately following the redemption order date if, by such time on such Business Day immediately following the redemption order date, a Fund&#146;s DTC account has been credited with the Creation Units to be redeemed. The Fund should be credited through: (1) the CNS clearing process of NSCC, as such processes have been enhanced to effect creations and redemptions of Creation Units; or (2) the facilities of DTC on a Delivery Versus Payment basis. If a Fund&#146;s DTC account has not been credited with all of the Creation Units to be redeemed by such time, the redemption distribution is delivered to the extent whole Creation Units are received. Any remainder of the redemption distribution is delivered on the next Business Day to the extent any remaining whole Creation Units are received if: (1) the Sponsor receives the fee applicable to the extension of the redemption distribution date which the Sponsor may, from time to time, determine, and; (2) the remaining Creation Units to be redeemed are credited to the Fund&#146;s DTC account by noon (Eastern Time), on such next Business Day. Any further outstanding amount of the redemption order may be cancelled. The Authorized Participant will be responsible for reimbursing a Fund for all costs associated with cancelling the order including costs for repositioning the portfolio. 

The Sponsor is also authorized to deliver the redemption distribution notwithstanding that the Creation Units to be redeemed are not credited to a Fund&#146;s DTC account by noon (Eastern Time), on the third Business Day immediately following the redemption order date if the Authorized Participant has collateralized its obligation to deliver the Creation Units through DTC&#146;s book-entry system on such terms as the Sponsor may determine from time-to-time. 

In the event that the Authorized Participant shall have requested, and the Sponsor shall have determined to permit the Authorized Participant to receive futures contracts pursuant to an EFCRP, as well as the cash redemption proceeds, in the redemption process, futures contracts required for settlement shall be transferred directly from the Fund&#146;s account at its FCM to the account of the Authorized Participant at its FCM. 

Suspension or Rejection of Redemption Orders 

In respect of any Fund, the Sponsor may, in its discretion, suspend the right of redemption, or postpone the redemption settlement date: (1) for any period during which any Exchange, or other exchange material to the valuation or operation of the Fund, is closed or when trading is suspended or restricted on such Exchanges in any of the underlying commodities; (2) for any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which the redemption distribution is not reasonably practicable; or (3) for such other period as the Sponsor determines to be necessary for the protection of the shareholders. The Sponsor will not be liable to any person or in any way for any loss or damages that may result from any such suspension or postponement. 

The Sponsor will reject a redemption order if the order is not in proper form as described in the form of Authorized Participant Agreement or if the fulfillment of the order might be unlawful. 

Creation and Redemption Transaction Fee 

To compensate BBH&#38;Co. for services in processing the creation and redemption of Creation Units and to offset some or all of the transaction costs, an Authorized Participant may be required to pay a fixed transaction fee to BBH&#38;Co. of up to $500 per order to create or redeem Creation Units and may pay a variable transaction fee to a Fund of up to 0.10% (and a variable transaction fee to the Matching VIX Funds of 0.05%) of the value of a Creation Unit. An order may include multiple Creation Units. The transaction fee(s) may be reduced, increased or otherwise changed by the Sponsor at its sole discretion. 

&#160;

Special Settlement 

The Sponsor may allow for early settlement of purchase or redemption orders. Such arrangements may result in additional charges to the Authorized Participant. 

NAV 

The NAV in respect of a Fund means the total assets of the Fund including, but not limited to, all cash and cash equivalents or other debt securities less total liabilities of such Fund, each determined on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, consistently applied under the accrual method of accounting. In particular, the NAV includes any unrealized profit or loss on open Financial Instruments, and any other credit or debit accruing to a Fund but unpaid or not received by a Fund. The NAV per Share of each Fund is computed by dividing the value of the net assets of such Fund ( i.e. , the value of its total assets less total liabilities) by its total number of Shares outstanding. Expenses and fees are accrued daily and taken into account for purposes of determining the NAV. Each Fund&#146;s NAV is calculated on each day other than a day when the Exchange is closed for regular trading. The Funds compute their NAVs at the times set forth below, or an earlier time as set forth on www.ProShares.com if necessitated by the Exchange or other exchange material to the valuation or operation of such Fund closing early. Each Fund&#146;s NAV is calculated only once each trading day.

The actual times equate to noon London time for silver and 3:00 p.m. London time for gold. In calculating the NAV of a Fund, the settlement value of the Fund&#146;s non-exchange traded Financial Instruments, is determined by applying the then-current disseminated value for the applicable benchmark to the terms of such Fund&#146;s non-exchange traded Financial Instruments. However, in the event that an underlying reference asset is not trading due to the operation of daily limits or otherwise, the Sponsor may, in its sole discretion, choose to fair value the index level in order to value the Fund&#146;s non-exchange traded Financial Instruments for purposes of the NAV calculation. Such fair value prices would generally be determined based on available inputs about the current value of the underlying reference assets and would be based on principles that the Sponsor deems fair and equitable so long as such principles are consistent with normal industry standards. 

&#160;

Futures contracts traded on a U.S. exchange are calculated at their then-current market value, which is based upon the settlement price (for the VIX Funds, the Managed Futures Fund and the Commodity Index Funds) or the last traded price before the NAV time (for the Currency Funds), for that particular futures contract traded on the applicable U.S. exchange on the date with respect to which the NAV is being determined. If a futures contract traded on a U.S. exchange could not be liquidated on such day, due to the operation of daily limits or other rules of the exchange upon which that position is traded or otherwise, the Sponsor may, in its sole discretion, choose to determine a fair value price as the basis for determining the market value of such position for such day. Such fair value prices would generally be determined based on available inputs about the current value of the underlying reference assets and would be based on principles that the Sponsor deems fair and equitable so long as such principles are consistent with normal industry standards. 

The Funds may use a variety of money market instruments to invest excess cash. Short-term debt instruments used in this capacity and expected to be held-to-maturity will be priced for NAV purposes at amortized cost. 

Indicative Optimized Portfolio Value (&#147;IOPV&#148;) 

The IOPV is an indicator of the value of a Fund&#146;s net assets at the time the IOPV is disseminated. The IOPV is calculated and disseminated every 15 seconds throughout the trading day. The IOPV is generally calculated using the prior day&#146;s closing net assets of a Fund as a base and updating throughout the trading day changes in the value of the Financial Instruments held by a Fund. The IOPV should not be viewed as an actual real time update of the NAV because NAV is calculated only once at the end of each trading day. The IOPV also should not be viewed as a precise value of the Shares. The IOPV for Funds based on the Bloomberg WTI Crude Oil Subindex SM and the Bloomberg Natural Gas Index SM will not update following the determination of the 2:30 p.m. settlement price of the futures contracts underlying those indexes. The IOPVs for Funds based on the Bloomberg Commodity Index SM will receive progressively more limited updates during a trading day as the settlement price for each individual component is determined, and such IOPVs will not update after all of the underlying components have determined settlement prices. 

The NYSE Arca disseminates the IOPV. In addition, the IOPV is published on the NYSE Arca&#146;s website and is available through on-line information services such as Bloomberg and Reuters. 

Dissemination of the IOPV provides additional information that is not otherwise available to the public and may be useful to investors and market professionals in connection with the trading of Shares. Investors and market professionals are able throughout the trading day to compare the market price of a Fund and the IOPV. If the market price of Shares diverges significantly from the IOPV, market professionals may have an incentive to execute arbitrage trades. Such arbitrage trades can tighten the tracking between the market price of a Fund and the IOPV and thus can be beneficial to all market participants.

Fees and Expenses 

Offering Expenses 

The Trust has paid expenses incurred in connection with organizing the initial offering of each Fund&#146;s Shares, and the Sponsor did not charge its fee in the first year of operations of each Fund in an amount equal to the offering costs. The Sponsor reimbursed each Geared Fund and the Short Euro Fund to the extent that its organizational and offering costs exceeded 0.95% of its average daily NAV for the first year of operations. The Sponsor reimbursed each Matching VIX Fund to the extent that its organizational and offering costs exceeded 0.85% of its average daily NAV for the first year of operations. The Sponsor reimbursed the Managed Futures Fund to the extent that its initial offering costs exceed 0.75% of its average daily net assets for the first year of operations. Normal and expected expenses incurred in connection with the continuous offering of Shares of each Fund are paid by the Sponsor. 

Offering expenses mean those expenses incurred in connection with the qualification and registration of the Shares of each Fund and in offering, distributing and processing the Shares of each Fund under applicable federal law, and any other expenses actually incurred and, directly or indirectly, related to the organization of each offering of the Shares of such Fund, including, but not limited to, expenses such as: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; initial SEC registration fees and SEC and FINRA filing fees; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; costs of preparing, printing (including typesetting), amending, supplementing, mailing and distributing the Trust&#146;s Registration Statements, the exhibits thereto and the related prospectuses; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the costs of qualifying, printing (including typesetting), amending, supplementing and mailing sales materials used in connection with the offering and issuance of the Shares; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; accounting, auditing and legal fees (including disbursements related thereto) incurred in connection therewith. Management Fee 

Each Geared Fund pays the Sponsor a Management Fee, monthly in arrears, in an amount equal to 0.95% per annum of its average daily NAV of such Fund. Each Matching VIX Fund pays the Sponsor a management fee, monthly in arrears, in an amount equal to 0.85% per annum of its average daily NAV. The Managed Futures Fund pays the Sponsor a Management Fee, monthly in arrears, in an amount equal to 0.75% per annum of its average daily NAV. For the first year of the Managed Futures Fund&#146;s operations, the Sponsor will not charge its fee in an amount equal to the offering costs. The Sponsor reimbursed the Managed Futures Fund to the extent that its offering costs exceeded the Management Fee for the first year of operations. No other management fee is paid by the Funds. The Management Fee is paid in consideration of the Sponsor&#146;s trading advisory services and the other services provided to the Funds that the Sponsor pays directly. 

&#160;

Licensing Fee 

The Sponsor pays S&#38;P a licensing fee for use of the VIX Futures Indexes as the benchmarks for the VIX Funds and a licensing fee for the S&#38;P Strategic Futures Index as the benchmark for the Managed Futures Fund. The Sponsor pays Bloomberg a licensing fee for the Bloomberg Commodity Index SM , as well as each subindex that serves as a benchmark for a Commodity Index Fund. 

Routine Operational, Administrative and Other Ordinary Expenses 

The Sponsor pays all of the routine operational, administrative and other ordinary expenses of each Fund, generally, as determined by the Sponsor, including, but not limited to, fees and expenses of the Administrator, Custodian, Distributor, ProFunds Distributors, Inc., an affiliated broker-dealer of the Sponsor, and Transfer Agent, licensing fees, accounting and audit fees and expenses, tax preparation expenses, legal fees not in excess of $100,000 per annum, ongoing SEC registration fees not exceeding 0.021% per annum of the NAV of a Fund, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (&#147;FINRA&#148;) filing fees, individual K-1 preparation and mailing fees not exceeding 0.10% per annum of the NAV of a Fund, and report preparation and mailing expenses. 

Non-Recurring Fees and Expenses 

Each Fund pays all its non-recurring and unusual fees and expenses, if any, as determined by the Sponsor. Non-recurring and unusual fees and expenses are fees and expenses which are unexpected or unusual in nature, such as legal claims and liabilities, litigation costs or indemnification or other material expenses which are not currently anticipated obligations of the Funds. Routine operational, administrative and other ordinary expenses are not deemed extraordinary expenses. 

Selling Commission 

Retail investors may purchase and sell Shares through traditional brokerage accounts. Investors are expected to be charged a customary commission by their brokers in connection with purchases of Shares that will vary from investor to investor. Investors are encouraged to review the terms of their brokerage accounts for applicable charges. The price at which an Authorized Participant sells a Share may be higher or lower than the price paid by such Authorized Participant in connection with the creation of such Share in a Creation Unit. 

Brokerage Commissions and Fees 

Each Fund, with the exception of the Matching VIX Funds, pays all of its brokerage commissions, including applicable exchange fees, NFA fees and give-up fees, pit brokerage fees and other transaction related fees and expenses charged in connection with trading activities for each Fund&#146;s investments in CFTC regulated investments. The Sponsor is currently paying brokerage commissions on VIX futures contracts for the Matching VIX Funds in amounts that exceed variable create/redeem fees collected by more than 0.02% of the Matching VIX Fund&#146;s average net assets annually. 

Other Transaction Costs 

The Funds bear other transaction costs including the effects of trading spreads and financing costs/fees, if any, associated with the use of Financial Instruments, and costs relating to the purchase of U.S. Treasury securities or similar high credit quality short-term fixed-income or similar securities (such as shares of money market funds and collateralized repurchase agreements).
