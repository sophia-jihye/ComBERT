 ITEM 1. BUSINESS

&#160;

General. Westfield Financial is a Massachusetts-chartered stock holding company and the parent company of Westfield Bank (the &#8220;Bank&#8221;). Westfield Financial was formed in 2001 in connection with its reorganization from a federally chartered mutual holding company to a Massachusetts-chartered stock holding company with the second step conversion being completed in 2007. The Bank was formed in 1853 and is a federally chartered savings bank regulated by the Office of Comptroller of the Currency (&#8220;OCC&#8221;). As a community bank, we focus on servicing commercial customers, including commercial and industrial lending and commercial deposit relationships. We believe that this business focus is best for our long-term success and viability, and complements our existing commitment to high quality customer service.

&#160;

Elm Street Securities Corporation, a Massachusetts-chartered corporation, was formed by us for the primary purpose of holding qualified securities. In February 2007, we formed WFD Securities, Inc., a Massachusetts-chartered corporation, for the primary purpose of holding qualified securities. In October 2009, we formed WB Real Estate Holdings, LLC, a Massachusetts-chartered limited liability company, for the primary purpose of holding real property acquired as security for debts previously contracted by the Bank.

&#160;

Market Area. We operate 13 banking offices in Agawam, Feeding Hills, East Longmeadow, Holyoke, Southwick, Springfield, West Springfield and Westfield, Massachusetts and Granby and Enfield, Connecticut. Our banking offices in Granby and Enfield, Connecticut, which we opened in June 2013 and November 2014, respectively, are our first locations outside of western Massachusetts. In 2014, we relocated our middle market and commercial real estate lending team to offices in Springfield, Massachusetts. We also have 12 free-standing ATM locations in Holyoke, Southwick, Springfield, West Springfield and Westfield, Massachusetts. Our primary deposit gathering area is concentrated in the communities surrounding these locations and our primary lending area includes all of Hampden County in western Massachusetts and Hartford and Tolland Counties in northern Connecticut. In addition, we provide online banking services through our website located at www.westfieldbank.com .

&#160;

The markets served by our branches are primarily suburban in character, as we operate only one banking office and headquarter our middle market commercial lending team in Springfield, the Pioneer Valley&#8217;s primary urban market. Westfield, Massachusetts, is located in the Pioneer Valley near the intersection of U.S. Interstates 90 (the Massachusetts Turnpike) and 91. The Pioneer Valley of western Massachusetts encompasses the sixth largest metropolitan area in New England. The Springfield Metropolitan area covers a relatively diverse area ranging from densely populated urban areas, such as Springfield, to outlying rural areas.

&#160;

Competition. We face intense competition both in making loans and attracting deposits. Our primary market area is highly competitive and we face direct competition from approximately 17 financial institutions, many with a local, state-wide or regional presence and, in some cases, a national presence. Many of these financial institutions are significantly larger than us and have greater financial resources. Our competition for loans comes principally from commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies and brokerage and investment banking firms. Historically, our most direct competition for deposits has come from savings and commercial banks. We face additional competition for deposits from internet-based institutions, credit unions, brokerage firms and insurance companies.

&#160;

Personnel. As of December 31, 2015, we had 164 full-time employees and 31 part-time employees. The employees are not represented by a collective bargaining unit, and we consider our relationship with our employees to be excellent. 

&#160;

Lending Activities 

&#160;

Loan Portfolio Composition. Our loan portfolio primarily consists of commercial real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans, residential real estate loans, home equity loans and consumer loans. At December 31, 2015, we had total loans of $814,390 million, of which 50.2% were adjustable rate loans and 49.8% were fixed rate loans. Commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans totaled $303.0 million and $168.3 million, respectively. The remainder of our loans at December 31, 2015 consisted of residential real estate loans, home equity loans and consumer loans. Residential real estate and home equity loans outstanding at December 31, 2015 totaled $341.6 million. Consumer loans outstanding at December 31, 2015 were $1.5 million.

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

The interest rates we charge on loans are affected principally by the demand for loans, the supply of money available for lending purposes and the interest rates offered by our competitors. These factors are, in turn, affected by general and local economic conditions, monetary policies of the federal government, including the Federal Reserve Board, legislative tax policies and governmental budgetary matters.

&#160;

The following table presents the composition of our loan portfolio in dollar amounts and in percentages of the total portfolio at the dates indicated.

Commercial and Industrial Loans. We offer commercial and industrial loan products and services that are designed to give business owners borrowing opportunities for modernization, inventory, equipment, construction, consolidation, real estate, working capital, vehicle purchases and the financing of existing corporate debt. We offer business installment loans, vehicle and equipment financing, lines of credit, and other commercial loans. At December 31, 2015, our commercial and industrial loan portfolio consisted of 1,124 loans, totaling $168.3 million, or 20.7% of our total loans. Our commercial loan team includes nine commercial loan officers, four credit analysts and two portfolio managers. We may hire additional commercial loan officers on an as needed basis. 

&#160; 

As part of our strategy of increasing our emphasis on commercial lending, we seek to attract our business customers&#8217; entire banking relationship. Most commercial borrowers also maintain commercial deposits. We provide complementary commercial products and services, a variety of commercial deposit accounts, cash management services, internet banking, sweep accounts, a broad ATM network and night deposit services. We offer a remote deposit capture product whereby commercial customers can receive credit for check deposits by electronically transmitting check images from their own locations. Commercial loan officers are based in our main and branch offices, and we view our potential branch expansion as a means of facilitating these commercial relationships. We intend to continue to expand the volume of our commercial business products and services within our current underwriting standards. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Our commercial and industrial loan portfolio does not have any significant loan concentration by type of property or borrower. The largest concentration of loans was for manufacturing which comprised approximately 6.2% of the total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2015, our largest commercial and industrial loan relationship was $18.0 million to a college. The loan relationship is secured by business assets. The loans to this borrower have performed to contractual terms. 

&#160; 

Commercial and industrial loans generally have terms of seven years or less, however, on an occasional basis, may have terms of up to ten years. Among the $168.2 million we have in our commercial and industrial loan portfolio as of December 31, 2015, $75.4 million have adjustable interest rates and $92.8 million have fixed interest rates. Whenever possible, we seek to originate adjustable rate commercial and industrial loans. Borrower activity and market conditions, however, may influence whether we are able to originate adjustable rate loans rather than fixed rate loans. We generally require the personal guarantee of the business owner. Interest rates on commercial and industrial loans generally have higher yields than residential or commercial real estate loans. 

&#160; 

Commercial and industrial loans are generally considered to involve a higher degree of risk than residential or commercial real estate loans because the collateral may be in the form of intangible assets and/or inventory subject to market obsolescence. Please see &#8220;Risk Factors &#8211; Our loan portfolio includes loans with a higher risk of loss.&#8221; Commercial and industrial loans may also involve relatively large loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers, with the repayment of such loans typically dependent on the successful operation and income stream of the borrower. These risks can be significantly affected by economic conditions. In addition, business lending generally requires substantially greater oversight efforts by our staff compared to residential or commercial real estate lending, including obtaining and analyzing periodic financial statements of the borrowers. In order to mitigate this risk, we monitor our loan concentration and our loan policies generally to limit the amount of loans to a single borrower or group of borrowers. We also utilize the services of an outside consultant to conduct credit quality reviews of the commercial and industrial loan portfolio. 

&#160; 

Commercial Real Estate Loans. We originate commercial real estate loans to finance the purchase of real property, which generally consists of apartment buildings, business properties, multi-family investment properties and construction loans to developers of commercial and residential properties. In underwriting commercial real estate loans, consideration is given to the property&#8217;s historic cash flow, current and projected occupancy, location and physical condition. At December 31, 2015, our commercial real estate loan portfolio consisted of 435 loans, totaling $303.0 million, or 37.2% of total loans. Since 2011, commercial real estate loans have grown by $70.5 million, or 30.3%, from $232.5 million at December 31, 2011 to $303.0 million at December 31, 2015. 

&#160; 

The majority of the commercial real estate portfolio consists of loans which are collateralized by properties in the Pioneer Valley of Massachusetts and northern Connecticut. Our commercial real estate loan portfolio is diverse, and does not have any significant loan concentration by type of property or borrower. We generally lend up to a loan-to-value ratio of 80% on commercial properties. We, however, will lend up to a maximum of 85% loan-to-value ratio and will generally require a minimum debt coverage ratio of 1.15. Our largest non-owner occupied commercial real estate loan relationship was $14.9 million at December 31, 2015, which is secured by a commercial property located in Rhode Island. The loans to this borrower are performing. 

&#160; 

We also offer construction loans to finance the construction of commercial properties located in our primary market area. At December 31, 2015, we had $22.9 million in commercial construction loans and commitments that are committed to refinance into permanent mortgages at the end of the construction period and $239,000 in commercial construction loans and commitments that are not committed to permanent financing at the end of the construction period. 

&#160; 

Commercial real estate lending involves additional risks compared with one-to-four family residential lending. Payments on loans secured by commercial real estate properties often depend on the successful management of the properties, on the amount of rent from the properties, or on the level of expenses needed to maintain the properties. Repayment of such loans may therefore be adversely affected by conditions in the real estate market or the general economy. Also, commercial real estate loans typically involve large loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. In order to mitigate this risk, we obtain and analyze periodic financial statements of the borrowers as well as monitor our loan concentration risk on a quarterly basis and our loan policies generally limit the amount of loans to a single borrower or group of borrowers. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Because of increased risks associated with commercial real estate loans, our commercial real estate loans generally have higher rates than residential real estate loans. Please see &#8220;Risk Factors &#8211; Our loan portfolio includes loans with a higher risk of loss.&#8221; Commercial real estate loans generally have adjustable rates with repricing dates of five years or less; however, occasionally repricing dates may be as long as 10 years. Whenever possible, we seek to originate adjustable rate commercial real estate loans. Borrower activity and market conditions, however, may influence whether we are able to originate adjustable rate loans rather than fixed rate loans. 

&#160; 

Residential Real Estate Loans and Originations. We process substantially all of our originations of residential real estate loans through a third-party mortgage company. Residential real estate borrowers submit applications to us, but the loan is approved by and closed on the books of the mortgage company. The third-party mortgage company owns the servicing rights and services the loans. We retain no residual ownership interest in these loans. We receive a fee for each of these loans originated by the third-party mortgage company. 

&#160; 

In 2015, we purchased $88.6 million in residential loans from a New England-based bank as a means of supplementing our loan growth. In addition, we purchased a total of $2.1 million in residential loans from a third-party mortgage company within and contiguous to our market area during 2015. While in prior quarters management has used residential loan growth to supplement the loan portfolio, the long-term strategy remains focused on commercial lending. At December 31, 2015, loans on one-to-four family residential properties, including home equity lines, accounted for $341.6 million, or 41.9% of our total loan portfolio. 

&#160; 

Our residential adjustable rate mortgage loans generally are fully amortizing loans with contractual maturities of up to 30 years, payments due monthly. Our adjustable rate mortgage loans generally provide for specified minimum and maximum interest rates, with a lifetime cap and floor, and a periodic adjustment on the interest rate over the rate in effect on the date of origination. As a consequence of using caps, the interest rates on these loans are not generally as rate sensitive as our cost of funds. The adjustable rate mortgage loans that we originate generally are not convertible into fixed rate loans. 

&#160; 

Adjustable rate mortgage loans generally pose different credit risks than fixed rate loans, primarily because as interest rates rise, the borrower&#8217;s payments rise, increasing the potential for default. To date, we have not experienced difficulty with payments for these loans. At December 31, 2015, our residential real estate included $70.0 million in adjustable rate loans, or 8.6% of our total loan portfolio, and $228.1 million in fixed rate loans, or 28.0% of our total loan portfolio. 

&#160; 

Our home equity loans totaled $43.5 million, or 5.3% of total loans at December 31, 2015. Home equity loans include $16.5 million in fixed rate loans, or 2.0% of total loans, and $27.0 million in adjustable rate loans, or 3.3% of total loans. These loans may be originated in amounts up to 80% current loan to value (CLTV) of the appraised value of the property securing the loan. The term to maturity on our home equity and home improvement loans may be up to 20 years. 

&#160; 

Consumer Loans. Consumer loans are generally originated at higher interest rates than residential and commercial real estate loans, but they also generally tend to have a higher credit risk than residential real estate loans because they are usually unsecured or secured by rapidly depreciable assets. Management, however, believes that offering consumer loan products helps to expand and create stronger ties to our existing customer base by increasing the number of customer relationships and providing cross-marketing opportunities. 

&#160; 

We offer a variety of consumer loans to retail customers in the communities we serve. Examples of our consumer loans include automobile loans, secured passbook loans, credit lines tied to deposit accounts to provide overdraft protection, and unsecured personal loans. At December 31, 2015, the consumer loan portfolio totaled $1.5 million, or 0.2% of total loans. Our consumer lending will allow us to diversify our loan portfolio while continuing to meet the needs of the individuals and businesses that we serve. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Loans collateralized by rapidly depreciable assets such as automobiles or that are unsecured entail greater risks than residential real estate loans. In such cases, repossessed collateral for a defaulted loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance, since there is a greater likelihood of damage, loss or depreciation of the underlying collateral. The remaining deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower beyond obtaining a deficiency judgment. Further, collections on these loans are dependent on the borrower&#8217;s continuing financial stability and, therefore, are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. There was no repossessed collateral relating to consumer loans at December 31, 2015. Finally, the application of various federal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount which can be recovered on such loans if a borrower defaults. 

&#160; 

Loan Approval Procedures and Authority. Individuals authorized to make loans on our behalf are designated by our Senior Lending Officer and approved by the Board of Directors. Each designated loan officer has loan approval authority up to prescribed limits that depend upon the officer&#8217;s level of experience. 

&#160; 

Upon receipt of a completed loan application from a prospective borrower, we order a credit report and verify other information. If necessary, we obtain additional financial or credit related information. We also require an appraisal for all commercial real estate loans greater than $250,000, which is performed by licensed or certified third-party appraisal firms and reviewed by our credit administration department. 

&#160; 

For loans that are $250,000 or under, an assessment of valuation will be performed by a qualified individual. The individual performing the assessment of valuation is independent from the loan production and will validate the evaluation methodology by supporting criteria. If the valuation assessment is over 70% loan to value (LTV) a full appraisal will be ordered by a licensed appraiser. For loan amounts over $250,000 a full appraisal is required by a licensed appraiser. 

&#160; 

Commercial and Industrial Loans and Commercial Real Estate Loans. We lend up to a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 85% on commercial properties and the majority of these loans require a minimum debt coverage ratio of 1.15. Commercial real estate lending involves additional risks compared with one-to-four-family residential lending. Because payments on loans secured by commercial real estate properties are often dependent on the successful operation or management of the properties, and/or the collateral value of the commercial real estate securing the loan, repayment of such loans may be subject, to a greater extent, to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. Also, commercial real estate loans typically involve large loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. Our loan policies limit the amounts of loans to a single borrower or group of borrowers to reduce this risk. 

&#160; 

Our lending policies permit our lending and underwriting departments to review and approve commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate loans up to $1.0 million. Any commercial and industrial or commercial real estate loan application that exceeds $1.0 million or that would result in the borrower&#8217;s total credit exposure with us to exceed $1.0 million, or whose approval requires an exception to our standard loan approval procedures, requires approval of the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors. An example of an exception to our standard loan approval procedures would be if a borrower was located outside our primary lending area. For loans requiring Board approval, management is responsible for presenting to the Board information about the creditworthiness of a borrower and the estimated value of the subject equipment or property. Generally, these determinations are based on financial statements, corporate and personal tax returns, as well as any other necessary information, including real estate and or equipment appraisals. 

&#160; 

Home Equity Loans. We originate and fund home equity loans. These loans may be originated in amounts up to 85% (CLTV) of the current value of the property. Our lending and underwriting department may approve home equity loans up to $250,000. Home equity loans in amounts greater than $250,000 and up to $350,000 may be approved by certain officers who have been approved by the Board of Directors. Home equity loans over $350,000, or who approval requires an exception to our standard approval procedures, are reviewed and approved by the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Asset Quality 

&#160;

One of our key operating objectives has been and continues to be the achievement of a high level of asset quality. We maintain a large proportion of loans secured by residential and commercial properties, set sound credit standards for new loan originations and follow careful loan administration procedures. We also utilize the services of an outside consultant to conduct credit quality reviews of our commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loan portfolio on at least an annual basis.

&#160;

Nonaccrual Loans and Foreclosed Assets . Our policies require that management continuously monitor the status of the loan portfolio and report to the Board of Directors on a monthly basis. These reports include information on nonaccrual loans and foreclosed real estate, as well as our actions and plans to cure the nonaccrual status of the loans and to dispose of the foreclosed property.

&#160;

The following table presents information regarding nonperforming mortgage, consumer and other loans, and foreclosed real estate as of the dates indicated. All loans where the payment is 90 days or more in arrears as of the closing date of each month are placed on nonaccrual status. At December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we had $8.1 million, $8.8 million, and $2.6 million, respectively, of nonaccrual loans. If all nonaccrual loans had been performing in accordance with their terms, we would have earned additional interest income of $406,000, $221,000 and $162,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

&#160;

(1) Does not include unearned premiums, deferred costs and fees, or allowance for loan losses. &#160;

We maintain an allowance for loan losses to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio based on ongoing quarterly assessments of the estimated losses. Our methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance consists of a review of the components, which include a specific valuation allowance for impaired loans and a general allowance for non-impaired loans. The specific valuation allowance incorporates the results of measuring impairment for specifically identified non-homogenous problem loans and, as applicable, troubled debt restructurings (&#8220;TDRs&#8221;). The specific allowance reduces the carrying amount of the impaired loans to their estimated fair value, less costs to sell, if collateral dependent. A loan is recognized as impaired when it is probable that principal and/or interest are not collectible in accordance with the loan&#8217;s contractual terms. The general allowance is calculated by applying loss factors to outstanding loans by type, excluding loans for which a specific allowance has been determined. As part of this analysis, each quarter we prepare an allowance for loan losses worksheet which categorizes the loan portfolio by risk characteristics such as loan type and loan grade. The general allowance is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant change. There are a number of factors that are considered when evaluating the appropriate level of the allowance. These factors include current economic and business conditions that affect our key lending areas, new loan products, collateral values, loan volumes and concentrations, credit quality trends such as nonperforming loans, delinquency and loan losses, and specific industry concentrations within the portfolio segments that may impact the collectability of the loan portfolio. For information on our methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses please see Footnote 1 &#8211; &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; of our notes to consolidated financial statements.

&#160; 

&#160;

In addition, management employs an independent third party to perform a semi-annual review of a sample of our commercial and industrial loans and owner occupied commercial real estate loans. During the course of their review, the third party examines a sample of loans, including new loans, existing relationships over certain dollar amounts and classified assets.

&#160;

Our methodologies include several factors that are intended to reduce the difference between estimated and actual losses; however, because these are management&#8217;s best estimates based on information known at the time, estimates may differ from actual losses incurred. The loss factors that are used to establish the allowance for pass graded loans are designated to be self-correcting by taking into account changes in loan classification, loan concentrations and loan volumes and by permitting adjustments based on management&#8217;s judgments of qualitative factors as of the evaluation date. Similarly, by basing the pass graded loan loss factors on loss experience over the prior six years, the methodology is designed to take loss experience into account.

&#160;

Our allowance methodology has been applied on a consistent basis. Based on this methodology, we believe that we have established and maintained the allowance for loan losses at appropriate levels. Future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses, however, may be necessary if economic, real estate and other conditions differ substantially from the current operating environment resulting in estimated and actual losses differing substantially. Adjustments to the allowance for loan losses are charged to income through the provision for loan losses.

&#160;

In addition, the OCC, as an integral part of its examination process, periodically reviews our loan and foreclosed real estate portfolios and the related allowance for loan losses and valuation allowance for foreclosed real estate. The OCC may require us to adjust the allowance for loan losses or the valuation allowance for foreclosed real estate based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination, thereby adversely affecting our results of operations. There were no adjustments recommended during 2015.

&#160;

For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a provision of $1.3 million to the allowance for loan losses based on our evaluation of the items discussed above. We believe that the allowance for loan losses adequately reflects the level of incurred losses in the current loan portfolio as of December 31, 2015.

Investment Activities. The Board of Directors reviews and approves our investment policy on an annual basis. The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as authorized by the Board of Directors, implement this policy based on the established guidelines within the written policy.

&#160;

Our investment policy is designed primarily to manage the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities, to generate a favorable return without incurring undue interest rate and credit risk, to complement our lending activities and to provide and maintain liquidity within the range established by policy. In determining our investment strategies, we consider our interest rate sensitivity, yield, credit risk factors, maturity and amortization schedules, and other characteristics of the securities to be held.

Federally chartered savings banks have authority to invest in various types of assets, including U.S. Treasury obligations, securities of various government-sponsored enterprises, mortgage-backed securities, certain certificates of deposit of insured financial institutions, repurchase agreements, overnight and short-term loans to other banks and corporate debt instruments.

&#160;

Securities Portfolio. We invest in government-sponsored enterprise debt securities which consist of bonds issued by the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. We also invest in municipal bonds issued by cities and towns in Massachusetts that are rated as investment grade by Moody&#8217;s, Standard and Poor&#8217;s, or Fitch, the majority of which are also independently insured. These securities have maturities that do not exceed 15 years; however, many have earlier call dates. In addition, we have investments in Federal Home Loan Bank stock and mutual funds that invest only in securities allowed by the OCC.

Our mortgage-backed securities, the majority of which are directly or indirectly insured or guaranteed by Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae or Fannie Mae, consist primarily of fixed rate securities.

Sources of Funds

&#160;

General. Deposits, short-term borrowings, long-term debt, scheduled amortization and prepayments of loan principal, maturities and calls of securities and funds provided by operations are our primary sources of funds for use in lending, investing and for other general purposes. See &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Liquidity and Capital Resources.&#8221; 

&#160;

Deposits. We offer a variety of deposit accounts having a range of interest rates and terms. We currently offer regular savings deposits (consisting of passbook and statement savings accounts), interest-bearing demand accounts, noninterest-bearing demand accounts, money market accounts and time deposits. We have expanded the types of deposit products that we offer to include jumbo certificates of deposit, tiered money market accounts and customer repurchase agreements to complement our increased emphasis on attracting commercial banking relationships.

&#160;

Deposit flows are influenced significantly by general and local economic conditions, changes in prevailing interest rates, pricing of deposits and competition. Our deposits are primarily obtained from areas surrounding our offices. We rely primarily on paying competitive rates, service and long-standing relationships with customers to attract and retain these deposits.

&#160;

When we determine our deposit rates, we consider local competition, U.S. Treasury securities offerings and the rates charged on other sources of funds. Core deposits (defined as regular accounts, money market accounts, and interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing demand accounts) represented 56.1% of total deposits on December 31, 2015 and 57.1% on December 31, 2014. At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, time deposits with remaining terms to maturity of less than one year amounted to $240.7 million and $199.0 million, respectively. See &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Net Interest and Dividend Income&#8221; for information relating to the average balances and costs of our deposit accounts for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.

Short-term borrowings and long-term debt . We also use short-term borrowings and long-term debt as an additional source of funds to finance our lending and investing activities and to provide liquidity for daily operations. Short-term borrowings are made up of Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston (&#8220;FHLBB&#8221;) advances (including line of credit advances) with an original maturity of less than one year as well as customer repurchase agreements, which have an original maturity of one day. Short-term borrowings issued by the FHLBB were $93.8 million at December 31, 2015 and $62.8 million at December 31, 2014. We have an &#8220;Ideal Way&#8221; line of credit with the FHLBB for $9.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Interest on this line of credit is payable at a rate determined and reset by the FHLBB on a daily basis. The outstanding principal is due daily but the portion not repaid will be automatically renewed. There were no advances outstanding under this line at December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2014, there was a $1.8 million advance outstanding under this line.

&#160;

Our repurchase agreements are with commercial customers. These agreements are linked to customers&#8217; checking accounts. Excess funds are swept out of certain commercial checking accounts and into repurchase agreements where the customers can earn interest on their funds. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, such repurchase agreement borrowings totaled $34.7 million and $31.2 million, respectively. In addition, we have a $4.0 million line of credit with Bankers Bank Northeast (&#8220;BBN&#8221;) and a $50.0 million line of credit with PNC Bank, respectively, at an interest rate determined and reset by BBN and PNC on a daily basis. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had no advances outstanding under these lines. As part of our contract with BBN, we are required to maintain a reserve balance of $300,000 with BBN for our use of this line.

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

Long-term debt consists of FHLBB advances, securities sold under repurchase agreements and customer repurchase agreements with an original maturity of one year or more. At December 31, 2015, we had $147.4 million in long-term debt with the FHLBB and $5.9 million in long-term customer repurchase agreements. This compares to $216.7 million in FHLBB advances, $10.0 million in securities sold under repurchase agreements with an approved broker-dealer and $5.8 million in long-term customer repurchase agreements at December 31, 2014. During 2015, we prepaid $10.0 million in repurchase agreements with a rate of 2.65% and incurred a prepayment expense of $593,000. In addition, we prepaid FHLBB borrowings in the amount of $19.0 million with a weighted average rate of 2.87% and incurred a prepayment expense of $707,000.

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;) has significantly changed the financial regulatory landscape in the U.S. Several provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to further rulemaking, guidance and interpretation by the federal banking agencies. As a result, management cannot predict the ultimate impact of the Dodd-Frank Act or the extent to which it could affect operations of Westfield Financial and the Bank. Management will allocate resources to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, including the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing rules, which may increase our costs of operations and adversely impact our earnings. 

&#160; 

Set forth below is a description of the significant elements of the laws and regulations applicable to Westfield Financial and its subsidiaries. Statutes, regulations and policies are subject to ongoing review by Congress, state legislatures and federal and state agencies. A change in any statute, regulation or policy applicable to Westfield Financial may have a material effect on the results of Westfield Financial and its subsidiaries. 

&#160; 

Federal Savings and Loan Holding Company Regulation . Westfield Financial is a savings and loan holding company as defined by the HOLA. In general, the HOLA restricts the business activities of savings and loan holding companies to those permitted for financial holding companies under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the &#8220;BHC Act&#8221;), as amended. Permissible businesses activities includes banking, managing or controlling banks and other activities that the FRB has determined to be so closely related to banking &#8220;as to be a proper incident thereto,&#8221; as well as any activity that is either (i) financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity (as determined by the FRB in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury) or (ii) complementary to a financial activity, and that does not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally (as solely determined by the FRB). Activities that are financial in nature include, among others, securities underwriting and dealing, insurance underwriting and making merchant banking investments. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Mergers and Acquisitions . The HOLA, the federal Bank Merger Act and other federal and state statutes regulate direct and indirect acquisitions of savings associations. The HOLA requires the prior approval of the FRB for the direct or indirect acquisition of more than 5% of the voting shares of a savings association or its parent holding company. Under the Bank Merger Act, the prior approval of the OCC is required for a federal savings association to merge with another insured depository institution, where the resulting institution is a federal savings association, or to purchase the assets or assume the deposits of another insured depository institution. In reviewing applications seeking approval of merger and acquisition transactions, the federal bank regulatory agencies must consider, among other things, the competitive effect and public benefits of the transactions, the capital position of the combined organization, performance records under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (the &#8220;CRA&#8221;) (see the section captioned &#8220;Community Reinvestment Act of 1977&#8221; included elsewhere in this section) and the effectiveness of the subject organizations in combating money laundering. 

&#160; 

Source of Strength Doctrine . FRB policy requires savings and loan holding companies to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary savings associations. Section 616 of the Dodd-Frank Act codified the requirement that holding companies act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their insured depository institution subsidiaries. As a result, Westfield Financial is expected to commit resources to support the Bank, including at times when Westfield Financial may not be in a financial position to provide such resources. Any capital loans by a savings and loan holding company to any of its subsidiary savings associations are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary savings associations. In the event of a savings and loan holding company&#8217;s bankruptcy, any commitment by the savings and loan holding company to a federal banking agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary insured depository institution will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment. 

&#160; 

Dividends . The principal source of Westfield Financial&#8217;s liquidity is dividends from the Bank. The OCC imposes various restrictions or requirements on the Bank&#8217;s ability to make capital distributions, including cash dividends. The OCC&#8217;s prior approval is required if the total of all distributions, including the proposed distribution, declared by a federal savings association in any calendar year would exceed an amount equal to the Bank&#8217;s net income for the year-to-date plus the Bank&#8217;s retained net income for the previous two years, or that would cause the Bank to be less than well capitalized. In addition, section 10(f) of the HOLA requires a subsidiary savings association of a savings and loan holding company, such as the Bank, to file a notice with the Federal Reserve prior to declaring certain types of dividends. 

&#160; 

Westfield Financial and the Bank are also subject to other regulatory policies and requirements relating to the payment of dividends, including requirements to maintain adequate capital above regulatory minimums. The appropriate federal banking agency is authorized to determine, under certain circumstances relating to the financial condition of a savings and loan holding company or a savings association, that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit payment thereof. The federal banking agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete an insured depository institution&#8217;s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice and that banking organizations should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings. 

&#160; 

Capital and Prompt Corrective Action . In July 2013, the FRB, the OCC and the FDIC approved final rules (the &#8220;Capital Rules&#8221;) that established a new capital framework for U.S. banking organizations. The Capital Rules generally implement the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision&#8217;s (the &#8220;Basel Committee&#8221;) December 2010 final capital framework referred to as &#8220;Basel III&#8221; for strengthening international capital standards. In addition, the Capital Rules implement certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, including the requirements of Section 939A to remove references to credit ratings from the federal banking agencies&#8217; rules. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Prior to the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, savings and loan holding companies were not subject to regulatory capital requirements. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, Westfield Financial, as a savings and loan holding company, is subject to the Capital Rules. 

&#160; 

The Capital Rules substantially revised the risk-based capital requirements applicable to holding companies and their depository institution subsidiaries as compared to prior U.S. general risk-based capital rules. The Capital Rules revised the definitions and the components of regulatory capital and impacted the calculation of the numerator in banking institutions&#8217; regulatory capital ratios. The Capital Rules became effective on January 1, 2015, subject to phase-in periods for certain components and other provisions. 

&#160; 

The Capital Rules: (i) require a capital measure called &#8220;Common Equity Tier 1&#8221; (&#8220;CET1&#8221;) and related regulatory capital ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets; (ii) specify that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and &#8220;Additional Tier 1 capital&#8221; instruments meeting certain revised requirements; (iii) mandate that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital; and (iv) expand the scope of the deductions from and adjustments to capital as compared to existing regulations. Under the Capital Rules, for most banking organizations, including Westfield Financial, the most common form of Additional Tier 1 capital is non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and the most common forms of Tier 2 capital are subordinated notes and a portion of the allocation for loan and lease losses, in each case, subject to the Capital Rules&#8217; specific requirements. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the Capital Rules, the minimum capital ratios as of January 1, 2015 are: 

&#160; 

&#183; 4.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets; &#160;

&#183; 6.0% Tier 1 capital (that is, CET1 plus Additional Tier 1 capital) to risk-weighted assets; &#160;

&#183; 8.0% Total capital (that is, Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets; and &#160;

&#183; 4.0% Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets as reported on consolidated financial statements (known as the &#8220;leverage ratio&#8221;). &#160; 

The Capital Rules also require a &#8220;capital conservation buffer,&#8221; composed entirely of CET1, on top of these minimum risk-weighted asset ratios. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity and other capital instrument repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. Thus, when fully phased-in on January 1, 2019, the capital standards applicable to Westfield Financial will include an additional capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of CET1, effectively resulting in minimum ratios inclusive of the capital conservation buffer of (i) CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7%, (ii) Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.5%, and (iii) Total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 10.5%. 

&#160; 

The Capital Rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such items, in the aggregate, exceed 15% of CET1. 

&#160; 

In addition, under the current general risk-based capital rules, the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss (&#8220;AOCI&#8221;) items included in shareholders&#8217; equity (for example, marks-to-market of securities held in the available-for-sale portfolio) under U.S. GAAP are reversed for the purposes of determining regulatory capital ratios. Under the Capital Rules, the effects of certain AOCI items are not excluded; however, banking organizations not using advanced approaches, were permitted to make a one-time permanent election to continue to exclude these items in January 2015. The Company and the Bank made this election. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 that began on January 1, 2015, are phased-in over a 4-year period (beginning at 40% on January 1, 2015 and an additional 20% per year thereafter). The implementation of the capital conservation buffer will begin on January 1, 2016 at the 0.625% level and increase by 0.625% on each subsequent January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019. 

&#160; 

Westfield Financial is in compliance with the targeted capital ratios under the Capital Rules at December 31, 2015. The Bank is subject to the Capital Rules on the same phase-in schedule as Westfield Financial. We believe that Westfield Financial and the Bank will remain in compliance with the targeted capital ratios as such requirements are phased in. 

&#160; 

With respect to the Bank, the Capital Rules revised the PCA regulations adopted pursuant to Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (&#8220;FDIA&#8221;), by: (i) introducing a CET1 ratio requirement at each PCA category (other than critically undercapitalized), with the required CET1 ratio being 6.5% for well-capitalized status; (ii) increasing the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirement for each category, with the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio for well-capitalized status being 8% (as compared to the current 6%); and (iii) eliminating the provision that allowed a bank with a composite supervisory rating of 1 to have a 3% leverage ratio and still be considered adequately capitalized. The Capital Rules did not change the total risk-based capital requirement for any PCA category. 

&#160; 

The federal banking agencies have established by regulation, for each capital measure, the levels at which an insured institution is &#8220;well-capitalized,&#8221; &#8220;adequately capitalized,&#8221; &#8220;undercapitalized,&#8221; &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; or &#8220;critically undercapitalized.&#8221; The federal banking agencies are required to take prompt corrective action (&#8220;PCA&#8221;) with respect to insured institutions that fall below the &#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221; level. Any insured depository institution that falls below the &#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221; level must submit a capital restoration plan, and, if its capital levels further decline or do not increase, will face increased scrutiny and more stringent supervisory action. As of December 31, 2015, the most recent notification from the OCC categorized the Bank as &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; under the PCA framework. 

&#160; 

Volcker Rule . Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, commonly known as the Volcker Rule, restricts the ability of banking entities, such as Westfield Financial, from: (i) engaging in &#8220;proprietary trading&#8221; and (ii) investing in or sponsoring certain types of funds (&#8220;Covered Funds&#8221;), subject to certain limited exceptions. The implementing regulation defines a Covered Fund to include certain investments such as collateralized loan obligation (&#8220;CLO&#8221;) and collateralized debt obligation securities. The regulation also provides, among other exemptions, an exemption for CLOs meeting certain requirements. Compliance with the Volcker Rule is generally required by July 21, 2017. Given the size and the scope of Westfield Financial&#8217;s activities, it does not believe that the implementation of the Volcker Rule will have a significant effect on its financial statements. 

&#160; 

Business Activities . The Bank derives its lending and investment powers from the HOLA and its implementing regulations promulgated by the OCC. Those laws and regulations limit the Bank&#8217;s authority to invest in certain types of assets and to make certain types of loans. Permissible investments include, but are not limited to, mortgage loans secured by residential and commercial real estate, commercial and consumer loans, certain types of debt securities, and certain other assets. The Bank may also establish service corporations that may engage in activities not otherwise permissible for the Bank, including certain real estate equity investments and securities and insurance brokerage. 

&#160; 

Loans to One Borrower . Generally, a federal savings bank may not make a loan or extend credit to a single borrower or related group of borrowers in excess of 15% of unimpaired capital and surplus. An additional amount may be loaned, equal to 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus, if the loan is secured by readily marketable collateral, which generally does not include real estate. As of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with these limitations on loans to one borrower. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Qualified Thrift Lender Test . Under federal law, as a federal savings association the Bank must comply with the qualified thrift lender, or &#8220;QTL&#8221; test. Under the QTL test, the Bank is required to maintain at least 65% of its &#8220;portfolio assets&#8221; in certain &#8220;qualified thrift investments&#8221; in at least nine months of the most recent 12-month period. &#8220;Portfolio assets&#8221; means, in general, the Bank&#8217;s total assets less the sum of: 

&#160; 

&#183; specified liquid assets up to 20% of total assets; &#160; 

&#183; goodwill and other intangible assets; and &#160; 

&#183; value of property used to conduct the Bank&#8217;s business. &#160; 

&#8220;Qualified thrift investments&#8221; include certain assets that are includable without limit, such as residential and manufactured housing loans, home equity loans, education loans, small business loans, credit card loans, mortgage backed securities, Federal Home Loan Bank stock and certain U.S. government obligations. In addition, certain assets are includable as &#8220;qualified thrift investments&#8221; in an amount up to 20% of portfolio assets, including certain consumer loans and loans in &#8220;credit-needy&#8221; areas. 

&#160; 

The Bank may also satisfy the QTL test by qualifying as a &#8220;domestic building and loan association&#8221; as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. Failure by the Bank to maintain its status as a QTL would result in restrictions on activities, including restrictions on branching and the payment of dividends. If the Bank were unable to correct that failure within a specified period of time, it must either continue to operate under those restrictions on its activities or convert to a national bank charter. The Bank met the QTL test in each of the prior 12 months and, therefore, is a &#8220;qualified thrift lender.&#8221; 

&#160; 

The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 . The Bank has a responsibility under the CRA, as implemented by OCC regulations, to help meet the credit needs of its communities, including low and moderate-income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for insured depository institutions nor does it limit an institution&#8217;s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community. The OCC assesses the Bank&#8217;s record of compliance with the CRA. The Bank&#8217;s failure to comply with the provisions of the CRA could, at a minimum, result in regulatory restrictions on its activities and the activities of Westfield Financial. The Bank&#8217;s latest CRA rating was &#8220;Outstanding.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Consumer Protection and CFPB Supervision . The Dodd-Frank Act centralized responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating the CFPB, an independent federal agency charged with responsibility for implementing, enforcing, and examining compliance with federal consumer financial laws. As Westfield Financial is smaller than $10 billion in total consolidated assets, the OCC continues to exercise primary examination authority over the Bank with regard to compliance with federal consumer financial laws and regulations. Under the Dodd-Frank Act state attorneys general are empowered to enforce rules issued by the CFPB. 

&#160; 

Westfield Financial and the Bank are subject to a number of federal and state laws designed to protect borrowers and promote fair lending. These laws include, among others, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, various state law counterparts, and the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010. 

&#160; 

On January 10, 2013, the CFPB issued a final rule implementing the ability-to-repay and qualified mortgage (&#8220;QM&#8221;) provisions of the Truth in Lending Act, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act (the &#8220;QM Rule&#8221;). The ability-to-repay provision requires creditors to make reasonable, good faith determinations that borrowers are able to repay their mortgages before extending the credit based on a number of factors and consideration of financial information about the borrower from reasonably reliable third-party documents. Under the Dodd-Frank Act and the QM Rule, loans meeting the definition of &#8220;qualified mortgage&#8221; are entitled to a presumption that the lender satisfied the ability-to-repay requirements. The presumption is a conclusive presumption/safe harbor for prime loans meeting the QM requirements, and a rebuttable presumption for higher-priced/subprime loans meeting the QM requirements. The definition of a &#8220;qualified mortgage&#8221; incorporates the statutory requirements, such as not allowing negative amortization or terms longer than 30 years. The QM Rule also adds an explicit maximum 43% debt-to-income ratio for borrowers if the loan is to meet the QM definition, though some mortgages that meet GSE, FHA and VA underwriting guidelines may, for a period not to exceed seven years, meet the QM definition without being subject to the 43% debt-to-income limits. The QM Rule became effective January 10, 2014. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Transactions with Affiliates and Loans to Insiders . Under federal law, transactions between insured depository institutions and their affiliates are governed by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act (&#8220;FRA&#8221;), and the FRB&#8217;s implementing Regulation W. In a holding company context, at a minimum, the parent holding company of a bank or savings association, and any companies which are controlled by such parent holding company, are &#8220;affiliates&#8221; of the bank or savings association. Generally, sections 23A and 23B are intended to protect insured depository institutions from losses arising from transactions with non-insured affiliates, by limiting the extent to which a depository institution or its subsidiaries may engage in covered transactions with any one affiliate and with all affiliates of the depository institution in the aggregate, and by requiring that such transactions be on terms that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices. 

&#160; 

Section 22(h) of the FRA restricts loans to directors, executive officers, and principal stockholders (&#8220;insiders&#8221;). Under Section 22(h), loans to insiders and their related interests may not exceed, together with all other outstanding loans to such persons and affiliated entities, the insured depository institution&#8217;s total capital and surplus. Loans to insiders above specified amounts must receive the prior approval of the board of directors. Further, under Section 22(h), loans to insiders must be made on terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to other persons, except that such insiders may receive preferential loans made under a benefit or compensation program that is widely available to the bank&#8217;s employees and does not give preference to the insider over the employees. Section 22(g) of the FRA places additional limitations on loans to executive officers. 

&#160; 

Enforcement . The OCC has primary enforcement responsibility over savings associations, including the Bank. This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist orders and to remove directors and officers. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated in response to unsafe or unsound practices, and any violation of laws and regulations . 

&#160; 

Standards for Safety and Soundness . The Bank is subject to certain standards designed to maintain the safety and soundness of individual insured depository institutions and the banking system. The OCC has prescribed safety and soundness guidelines relating to (i) internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems; (ii) loan documentation; (iii) credit underwriting; (iv) interest rate exposure; (v) asset growth, concentration, and quality; (vi) earnings; and (vii) compensation and benefit standards for officers, directors, employees and principal shareholders. A savings association not meeting one or more of the safety and soundness guidelines may be required to file a compliance plan with the OCC. 

&#160; 

Under the FDIA, the FDIC may terminate deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. Management is not aware of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to the termination of the Bank&#8217;s deposit insurance. 

&#160; 

Federal Deposit Insurance . The deposits of the Bank are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund (&#8220;DIF&#8221;) of the FDIC. The Bank is subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the DIF. The FDIC uses a risk-based assessment system that imposes insurance premiums based upon a risk matrix that takes into account an insured depository institution&#8217;s capital level and supervisory rating, commonly known as the &#8220;CAMELS&#8221; rating. The risk matrix utilizes different risk categories which are distinguished by capital levels and supervisory ratings. 

&#160; 

In 2011, the FDIC issued rules to implement changes to the deposit insurance assessment base and risk-based assessments mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act. The base for insurance assessments changed from domestic deposits to consolidated assets less tangible equity. Assessment rates are calculated using formulas that take into account the risk of the institution being assessed. 

&#160; 

FDIC insurance expenses include deposit insurance assessments and Financing Corporation (&#8220;FICO&#8221;) assessments related to outstanding FICO bonds. The FICO is a mixed-ownership government corporation established by the Competitive Equality Banking Act of 1987, whose sole purpose was to function as a financing vehicle for the now defunct Federal Savings &#38; Loan Insurance Corporation. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Depositor Preference . The FDIA provides that, in the event of the &#8220;liquidation or other resolution&#8221; of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors of the institution, including the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors, and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver, will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution. If an insured depository institution fails, insured and uninsured depositors, along with the FDIC, will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured, non-deposit creditors, including the parent bank holding company, with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution. 

&#160; 

Federal Home Loan Bank System . The Bank is a member of the FHLBB, which is one of the regional Federal Home Loan Banks comprising the Federal Home Loan Bank System. Each Federal Home Loan Bank serves as a central credit facility primarily for its member institutions. The Bank, as a member of the FHLBB, is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the FHLBB. Required percentages of stock ownership are subject to change by the FHLBB, and the Bank was in compliance with this requirement with an investment in FHLBB capital stock at December 31, 2015. If there are any developments that cause the value of our stock investment in the FHLBB to become impaired, we would be required to write down the value of our investment, which could affect our net income and shareholders&#8217; equity. 

&#160; 

Reserve Requirements . FRB regulations require insured depository institutions to maintain non-interest earning reserves against their transaction accounts (primary interest-bearing and regular checking accounts). The Bank&#8217;s required reserves can be in the form of vault cash. If vault cash does not fully satisfy the required reserves, in the form of a balance maintained with the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. 

&#160; 

Financial Privacy Laws . Federal law and certain state laws currently contain client privacy protection provisions. These provisions limit the ability of insured depository institutions and other financial institutions to disclose non-public information about consumers to affiliated companies and non-affiliated third parties. These rules require disclosure of privacy policies to clients and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to affiliates or non-affiliated third parties by means of &#8220;opt out&#8221; or &#8220;opt in&#8221; authorizations. Pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and certain state laws companies are required to notify clients of security breaches resulting in unauthorized access to their personal information. 

&#160; 

USA PATRIOT Act . Under Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act, all financial institutions are required to take certain measures to identify their customers, prevent money laundering, monitor customer transactions and report suspicious activity to U.S. law enforcement agencies. Financial institutions also are required to respond to requests for information from federal banking agencies and law enforcement agencies. Information sharing among financial institutions for the above purposes is encouraged by an exemption granted to complying financial institutions from the privacy provisions of Gramm-Leach Bliley Act and other privacy laws. Financial institutions are required to have anti-money laundering programs in place, which include, among other things, performing risk assessments and customer due diligence. The primary federal banking agencies and the Secretary of the Treasury have adopted regulations to implement several of these provisions. Financial institutions also are required to establish internal anti-money laundering programs. The effectiveness of institutions in combating money laundering activities is a factor to be considered in any application submitted by an insured depository institution under the Bank Merger Act. Westfield Financial and the Bank have in place a Bank Secrecy Act and USA PATRIOT Act compliance program and engage in limited transactions with foreign financial institutions or foreign persons. 

&#160; 

Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation . The U.S. has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others. These are typically known as the &#8220;OFAC&#8221; rules based on their administration by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, which is an office within the U.S. Department of Treasury (the &#8220;OFAC&#8221;). The OFAC-administered sanctions targeting countries take many different forms. Generally, the sanctions contain one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on &#8220;U.S. persons&#8221; engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in, or providing investment-related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country; and (ii) a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons). Blocked assets (e.g., property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without an OFAC license. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have legal and reputational consequences. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Incentive Compensation . The Dodd-Frank Act requires publicly traded companies to give stockholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation at their first annual meeting taking place six months after the date of enactment and at least every three years thereafter and on &#8220;golden parachute&#8221; payments in connection with approvals of mergers and acquisitions. The legislation also authorizes the SEC to promulgate rules that would allow stockholders to nominate their own candidates using a company&#8217;s proxy materials. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act directs the federal banking regulators to promulgate rules requiring the reporting of incentive-based compensation and prohibiting excessive incentive-based compensation paid to executives of depository institutions and their holding companies with assets in excess of $1.0 billion, regardless of whether the company is publicly traded. In April 2011, the FRB, along with other federal financial regulators, issued a joint notice of proposed rulemaking that would implement those requirements. This rule has not yet been finalized. 

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Act also gives the SEC authority to prohibit broker discretionary voting on elections of directors, executive compensation matters and any other significant matter. At the 2012 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, Westfield Financial&#8217;s shareholders voted on a non-binding, advisory basis to hold a non-binding, advisory vote on the compensation of named executive officers of Westfield Financial annually. In light of the results, the Westfield Financial Board of Directors determined to hold the vote annually. 

&#160; 

Future Legislative and Regulatory Initiatives . Various legislative and regulatory initiatives are introduced by Congress, state legislatures and different financial regulatory agencies. Such initiatives may include proposals to expand or contract the powers of bank holding companies, savings and loan holding companies and/or depository institutions. Proposed legislation and regulatory initiatives could change banking statutes and the operating environment of Westfield Financial in substantial and unpredictable ways. If enacted, such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial institutions. Westfield Financial cannot predict whether any such legislation will be enacted, and, if enacted, the effect that it or any implementing regulations would have on the financial condition or results of operations of Westfield Financial. Other legislation may be introduced in Congress, which would further regulate, deregulate or restructure the financial services industry, including proposals to substantially reform the financial regulatory framework. It is not possible to predict whether any such proposals will be enacted into law or, if enacted, the effect which they may have on our business and earnings.

In addition, copies of any document we file with or furnish to the SEC may be obtained from the SEC at its public reference room at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. You may obtain information on the operation of the SEC&#8217;s public reference room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. You can request copies of these documents, upon payment of a duplicating fee, by writing to the SEC at its principal office at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. The SEC maintains a website at www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file or furnish such information electronically with the SEC. The information found on our website or the website of the SEC is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or any other report we file with or furnish to the SEC.
