Insight began operations in Arizona in 1988, incorporated in Delaware in 1991 and completed our initial public offering in 1995. Our corporate headquarters are located in Tempe, Arizona. From our original location in the United States, we expanded nationwide and then entered Canada in 1997 and the United Kingdom in 1998. Over the past 10 years through a combination of acquisitions and organic growth, we continued to increase our geographic coverage and expand our capabilities: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; 2006 &#150; Acquired Software Spectrum, Inc., and expanded our footprint in EMEA and APAC and strengthened our software and related services capabilities; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; 2008 &#150; Acquired Calence, LLC in North America and MINX Limited in the United Kingdom, and enhanced our global technical expertise around higher-end networking and communications technologies, as well as managed services and security; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; 2011 &#150; Acquired Ensynch, Inc. (&#147;Ensynch&#148;) and enhanced our professional services capabilities across the complete Microsoft solution set, including Cloud migration and management; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; 2012 &#150; Acquired Inmac GmbH and Micro Warehouse BV (&#147;Inmac&#148;) and expanded our hardware capabilities into key markets in our existing European footprint, specifically in Germany and the Netherlands; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; 2015 &#150; On October 1, we acquired BlueMetal Architects, Inc. (&#147;BlueMetal&#148;) and strengthened our services capabilities in the area of application design, mobility and big data. BlueMetal is an interactive design and technology architecture firm based in the Boston area, also with offices in Chicago and New York. Our Purpose and Values 

We refreshed Insight&#146;s marketplace brand in 2015, and as part of that effort, clarified our purpose and restated our company values. We believe that our new purpose, &#147;We make meaningful connections to help businesses run smarter,&#148; has infused new energy into our organization. We live by our core values of Hunger, Heart and Harmony, that set the tone for our business and define who we are. We describe our core values simply. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Hunger &#150; Our insatiable desire to create new opportunities for our clients and our business is apparent in everything we do. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Heart &#150; We seek to impact the lives of the people we serve positively by always putting our clients, partners and teammates first. &#160;

INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Harmony &#150; We invite perspective, and we consistently celebrate each other&#146;s unique contributions as we work together to bring the best solutions to our clients. We believe that these values strengthen the overall Insight experience for our clients, partners and teammates (we refer to our customers as &#147;clients,&#148; our suppliers as &#147;partners&#148; and our employees as &#147;teammates&#148;). 

Our Market 

The worldwide total addressable market for information technology is $3.5 trillion according to Gartner, a leading IT research and advisory company, and based on our analysis of Gartner market data, we believe the top 10 most comparable global solution providers represent approximately 10% of the worldwide total addressable market. We believe our addressable worldwide market in the indirect sales IT channel represents approximately $594 billion in annual sales and for the year ended December 31, 2015, our net sales of $5.4 billion represented approximately 1% of that highly diverse market. We believe that we are well positioned in this highly fragmented global market with locations in 22 countries and the capabilities to provide clients with software provisioning and related services across the globe. 

In addition to the fragmentation in the market, the rapid pace of technological innovation is making it more difficult for our clients to effectively assess alternatives and manage their IT systems. We believe that our solution offerings that combine and integrate hardware, software and services will address this need and will provide solutions to help our clients&#146; businesses run smarter. 

Our Differentiation/Value Proposition 

We consult, design, implement and manage integrated IT solutions for our clients. These solutions include services and products designed to support networking, collaboration, storage, security, Cloud, mobility, converged infrastructure and other advanced technologies. The increased complexity across the technology ecosystem, combined with the continual emergence of new trends and offerings, has made it difficult for most clients to effectively design and manage their technology systems. Clients increasingly are looking for technology providers to supply value-added expertise to help them identify, deploy and implement complex IT solutions. We believe that Insight has a unique position in the market to gain profitable market share by providing enhanced value to our clients. 

We believe that what differentiates Insight from our competitors is: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Our global reach &#150; we have the capabilities to serve clients across the globe with software provisioning and related services and with integrated technology solutions in multiple countries directly and more globally through our partner network. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Our scalable services and solutions offerings &#150; we can scale to help organizations of all sizes and have well-developed services capabilities focused on managed, technical and professional services that integrate products and services to provide solutions to meet individualized client needs. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Our software expertise &#150; we understand complex licensing requirements and have the know-how to optimize our clients&#146; usage and compliance management through a portfolio of license consulting and optimization services. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Our financial strength &#150; our strong cash flow generating capabilities allow us to fund acquisitions and return capital to our shareholders. In addition, we have been able to devote the financial resources necessary to invest in sales, technology and engineering resources required to deliver leading edge technology solutions. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Our website &#150; we redesigned our website to enhance the user experience, with clearly defined sections to allow users to Learn about trending topics, Solve their challenges, Buy new products and services, and Manage their customized purchasing, hardware warranties, software licensing and Cloud consumption. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Our e-Commerce capability &#150; we have customizable client portals, primarily in North America, that allow clients to streamline procurement and processes through a self-service online tool, drive standardization and optimize reconciliation. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Our one-stop shopping value proposition &#150; we have a multi-partner approach and have partnerships with leading product manufacturers, software publishers and distribution partners as well as emerging Cloud and other technology partners to service our global portfolio of commercial and public sector clients with the integrated IT solutions that make the most sense for their IT environments. &#160;

INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Our operational expertise and effectiveness &#150; we offer a broad selection of hardware and software products with access to billions of dollars in virtual inventory and efficient supply chain execution as well as product fulfillment and logistics capabilities, management tools and technical expertise. Our Business Strategy 

Our long-term strategy remains consistent and includes three components: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Grow our core business; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Grow services sales; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Accelerate with Cloud. Grow our core business . We believe that there is significant opportunity for profitable growth in our core business as a global provider of integrated technology solutions to business and government clients. Our balanced portfolio of manufacturer and publisher brands, extensive e-Commerce and logistics capabilities and differentiated services capabilities allow us to tailor our offerings based on the size and complexity of our clients. In addition, our go-to-market model leverages both centralized and local market sales, technical and support resources to efficiently serve and advise our clients. 

In each of our geographic operating segments, we are focused on driving our growth objectives by acquiring new clients and expanding our relationships with existing clients by increasing the types of products and services they buy from us. In North America, we have a local market presence in select cities where we have invested in sales, technical and service delivery resources to drive growth with existing and new clients, particularly in the large account client space, as well as to drive expansion in specific service/solution areas with key partners. We are also concentrating our efforts on growing our business with mid-sized and large clients in select vertical markets, including Federal government, state and local, K-12 education, healthcare and service provider, and have invested in both local market and centralized sales resources to drive these efforts. In EMEA, we are focused on increasing our share in the mid-market and public sector by increasing sales of software and select hardware categories across the business. We also expanded our services capabilities in the region and began leveraging strategic relationships with partners and service delivery vendors to bring additional software, Cloud and collaboration solutions to clients in 2015. Our APAC operating segment, which is largely comprised of software sales, is engaged in growing our sales in the mid-market and enterprise space and on the development of specialized software services, particularly in the areas of software license optimization and Cloud. 

Grow services sales . We design, procure, deploy, implement and manage solutions that combine hardware, software and services to help businesses run smarter. Our services capabilities provide significant value add to our clients, driving stronger client relationships and higher margins. Our solutions can be provided through a variety of delivery mechanisms, including at the client location, remotely, or through a private, public or hybrid Cloud. The key areas of focus are: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Customer Engagement &#150; When interacting with their customers, our clients face growing digital engagement and a rapid shift toward social media. We help our clients leverage technology to better engage their customers to build loyalty and increase profitability. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Workforce Enablement &#150; The consumerization of IT, increase in the millennials population and explosion of alternate work models is transforming the workplace. We provide our clients&#146; workforce with tools to enable employee productivity and retention. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Infrastructure Optimization &#150; Consumption-based models and technology convergence are reinventing decades-old infrastructure business models. We optimize our clients&#146; core or branch infrastructure to enable customer and workforce objectives. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Operational Excellence &#150; Growing pressure on IT budgets and increasing trends in outsourcing of non-core functions are changing what clients choose to build versus buy. We outsource the management of client infrastructure and end-user operations to drive IT return on investment. Accelerate with Cloud . Private, public and hybrid Cloud solutions provide flexible, reliable and affordable solutions for delivering critical IT functions, such as email, data security, data center hosting and more. Cloud has become more mainstream, and adoption continues to increase across markets and verticals. Key market imperatives in the adoption of Cloud solutions are speed to market, flexibility, scalability and availability. We have invested in and will continue to invest in technical tools and resources to provide clients with the assessment, migration, integration and managed services required to simplify the Cloud adoption decision, whether that decision results in a private, public or hybrid Cloud environment. 

&#160;

INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC. 

&#160;

Insight is also investing in a global Cloud management platform. Our Cloud management platform serves as a marketplace for our clients to buy and manage their Cloud subscriptions with options that enhance their Software as a Service (&#147;SaaS&#148;) and Infrastructure as a Service (&#147;IaaS&#148;) management capabilities. 

Components of our Cloud management platform include: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; A focus on small to medium-sized clients, providing them with the ability to learn, solve, buy, and manage Cloud products and services via our online experience. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; A similar online experience and capabilities for our larger enterprise clients with added IT as a Service Broker (ITaaSB) capabilities allowing larger IT organizations to centrally provide Cloud offerings while maintaining the manageability and visibility they require. Additionally, we have a strong global position in the service provider or independent software vendor (ISV) market. Building on our existing capabilities in this market, we plan to develop a Cloud portfolio for our service provider clients to resell to their customers, offering them revenue diversification with minimal investment. We also plan to build off of our Cloud management platform capabilities and deliver Cloud portal platforms that provide e-commerce and subscription management capabilities to our service provider clients. 

Our Offerings 

Our offerings in North America and select countries in EMEA include a suite of IT hardware, software and services solutions. Our offerings in the remainder of our EMEA segment and in APAC are largely software and select software-related services. On a consolidated basis, hardware, software and services represented approximately 54%, 41% and 5%, respectively, of our net sales in 2015 compared to 52%, 43% and 5%, respectively, in 2014. 

Services Offerings 

We have developed solutions that integrate hardware, software and services to help businesses run smarter within our focus areas. Our core solutions include: 

Customer Engagement 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Intelligent Applications &#38; Endpoints: Custom or off-the-shelf software applications integrated with desktop, notebook, tablet, smartphone and kiosk endpoints. These applications are increasingly Cloud-based and mobile-centric. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Customer Analytics: Data-based analytics to help clients better predict customer behavior across seasons, geography, channel or a variety of other factors. Workforce Enablement 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Modern Workplace: Desktop, notebook, tablet and smartphone devices coupled with calendar, email, messaging and collaboration software. Cloud-based deployment of this software is now mainstream. In addition, we see growing demand for &#147;Device-as-a-Service.&#148; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Modern Applications: Custom-developed mobile, Cloud and Internet-of-Things applications. Typically, these applications are specific to the client vertical market (e.g., healthcare, financial services or retail). &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Workforce Analytics: Data-based analytics to help clients more effectively allocate workforce resources. Infrastructure Optimization 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Hybrid Cloud: On-premise converged infrastructure (private Cloud) augmented by off-premise public Cloud IaaS integrated and managed via orchestration software. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Intelligent Network: Core WAN, LAN, wireless and security solutions to seamlessly connect Hybrid Cloud, Branch Infrastructure and end users. &#160;

INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC. 

&#160;

Operational Excellence 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Product Life Cycle: Source, procure, stage, configure, integrate, test, deploy and maintain IT products spanning endpoints to infrastructure. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; End User Outsourcing: Service level agreement-based outsourcing of end user support. This comprises dedicated, onsite desktop support technicians coupled with 24x7 Level 1 Service Desk. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Infrastructure Management: 24x7 remote management of clients&#146; server/storage/network infrastructure through our ISO-certified Remote Network Operating Center (RNOC). We have invested in Cloud, mobility, big data and security capabilities and expertise to support our core solutions and continuously seek to identify client-relevant technology solutions. 

Cloud. Cloud computing represents an evolution in the IT world. Cloud-based SaaS is prevalent in the Customer Engagement and Workforce Enablement solutions highlighted above. In addition, public IaaS and converged infrastructure private Cloud represent growing portions of Hybrid Cloud and Branch Infrastructure solutions. We help clients assess readiness, architect appropriate solutions and migrate to both public and private Cloud. 

Mobility. Our clients must engage with their customers and enable their workforce whether they are at work, at home or on-the-go. We help clients do so through solutions such as in-store mobile Point of Sale (mPOS) and customer mobile commerce applications in the retail industry or mobile trading applications for brokerage customers in the financial services industry. 

Big Data. Our clients are deluged with data that they struggle to interpret. We help turn this data into actionable insights with solutions such as weather-based predictive analytics to drive weekly marketing campaigns for consumer products and patient-based intake and health outcomes analysis to optimize nurse staffing. The explosion of sensors for Internet-of-Things will only fuel this data overload and drive further demand for these solutions. 

Security. All of these solutions must be delivered without compromising customer, company or employee private information. We offer services for identity and access management, single-sign-on (SSO) and mobile-device-management (MDM) to protect end users. In addition, we provide network security and Security Incident Event Management (SIEM) solutions to secure our clients&#146; infrastructure. 

Hardware Offerings 

We offer our clients in North America and select countries in EMEA a comprehensive selection of IT hardware products. We offer products from hundreds of manufacturers, including such industry leaders as Cisco, HP, Lenovo, Dell, EMC, NetApp, Apple and IBM. Our scale and purchasing power, combined with our efficient, high-volume and cost effective direct sales and marketing model, allow us to offer competitive prices. We believe that offering choices from multiple partners enables us to better serve our clients by providing a variety of product solutions to address their specific business needs. 

The four hardware technology categories we have identified as key to our clients&#146; Intelligent Technology&#153; solutions are: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Desktop, notebook and tablet &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Networking and communications &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Server and power &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Storage In addition to our distribution facilities, we have &#147;direct-ship&#148; programs with many of our partners, including manufacturers and distributors, allowing us to expand our product offerings without increasing inventory, handling costs or inventory risk exposure. As a result, we are able to provide a product offering with billions of dollars of products in virtual inventory. Convenience and product options among multiple brands are key competitive advantages compared to manufacturers&#146; direct selling programs, which are generally limited to their own brands and may not offer clients a complete or best-in-class solution across all product categories. 

&#160;

INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC. 

&#160;

Software Offerings 

Our clients acquire software applications from us in the form of licensing agreements with software publishers, boxed products, or through SaaS, whereby clients subscribe to software that is hosted either by the software publisher or a dedicated third-party hosting company. We offer products from hundreds of publishers, including such industry leaders as Microsoft, Adobe, VMware, Symantec, McAfee, Citrix, IBM Software and Red Hat, as well as newer entrants, such as Box and 8x8. 

As software publishers choose different models for implementing licensing agreements, businesses must evaluate the alternatives to ensure that they select the appropriate agreements and comply with the publishers&#146; licensing terms when purchasing and managing their software licenses. In addition to software provisioning, we offer holistic software solutions, including software licensing optimization and implementation consulting, to help our clients better understand their software needs, evaluate their existing software and provide options to optimize their assets. 

The four software and licensing technology categories we have identified as key to our clients&#146; Intelligent Technology&#153; solutions are: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Office productivity &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Virtualization &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Creativity &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Data protection Our Information Technology Systems 

We have committed significant resources to the IT systems that we own and use to manage our business and believe that our success is dependent upon our ability to provide prompt and efficient service to our clients based on the accuracy, quality and utilization of the information generated by our IT systems. Because these systems affect our ability to manage our sales, client service, partner relationships and programs, distribution, inventories and accounting systems and our voice and data networks, we have built redundancy into certain systems, maintain system outage policies and procedures and have comprehensive data backup. We are focused on driving improvements in sales productivity through upgraded IT systems to support higher levels of client satisfaction and new client acquisition, as well as garnering efficiencies in our business. 

We operate under a single, standardized IT system across North America and APAC and a separate, single IT system platform in all countries in our EMEA operations. 

For a discussion of risks associated with our IT systems, see &#147;Risk Factors &#150; Disruptions in our IT systems and voice and data networks could affect our ability to service our clients and cause us to incur additional expenses,&#148; in Part I, Item 1A of this report. 

Our Competition 

The IT hardware, software and services industry is very fragmented and highly competitive. Our competition includes: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Direct marketers and resellers, such as CDW (North America), Systemax (Europe), Softchoice, Comparex, PC Connection, PCM, World Wide Technology, SHI, SoftwareONE, Computacenter, Specialist Computercenters, Bechtle and Cancom; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; National and regional resellers, including value-added resellers, specialty retailers, aggregators, distributors, and to a lesser extent, national computer retailers, computer superstores, Internet-only computer providers, consumer electronics and office supply superstores and mass merchandisers; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Product manufacturers, such as Dell, HP, IBM and Lenovo; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Software publishers, such as IBM, Microsoft and Symantec; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Systems integrators, such as Compucom Systems, Inc.; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; National and global service providers, such as IBM Global Services and HP Enterprise Services; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; E-tailers, such as Newegg, Buy.com and e-Buyer (United Kingdom). &#160;

INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC. 

&#160;

The competitive landscape in the industry is continually changing as various competitors expand their product and services offerings. In addition, emerging models such as Cloud computing are creating new competitors and opportunities in messaging, infrastructure, security, collaboration and other services offerings, and, as with other areas, we both resell and compete directly with many of these offerings. 

For a discussion of risks associated with the actions of our competitors, see &#147;Risk Factors &#150; The IT hardware, software and services industry is intensely competitive, and actions of our competitors, including manufacturers and publishers of products we sell, can negatively affect our business,&#148; in Part I, Item 1A of this report. 

Our Partners 

We partner with the top technology brands. During 2015, we purchased products and software from approximately 3,600 partners. Approximately 66% (based on dollar volume) of these purchases were directly from manufacturers or software publishers, with the balance purchased through distributors. Purchases from Microsoft, Cisco and Ingram Micro (a distributor) accounted for approximately 27%, 11% and 11%, respectively, of our aggregate purchases in 2015. No other partner accounted for more than 10% of purchases in 2015. Our top five partners as a group for 2015 were Microsoft, Cisco, Ingram Micro, HP and Tech Data (a distributor), and approximately 65% of our total purchases during 2015 came from this group of partners. Although brand names and individual products are important to our business, we believe that competitive sources of supply are available in substantially all of our product categories such that, with the exception of Microsoft, we are not dependent on any single partner for sourcing products. 

During 2015, sales of Microsoft, HP and Cisco products accounted for approximately 27%, 13% and 11%, respectively, of our consolidated net sales. No other manufacturer&#146;s products accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net sales in 2015. Sales of product from our top five manufacturers/publishers as a group (Microsoft, HP, Cisco, Lenovo and Dell) accounted for approximately 64% of Insight&#146;s consolidated net sales during 2015. 

We obtain incentives from certain product manufacturers, software publishers and distribution partners based typically upon the volume of sales or purchases of their products and services. In other cases, such incentives may be in the form of participation in our partner programs, which may require specific services or activities with our clients, discounts, marketing funds, price protection or rebates. Manufacturers and publishers may also provide mailing lists, contacts or leads to us. We believe that these incentives (or partner funding) and other marketing assistance allow us to increase our marketing reach and strengthen our relationships with leading manufacturers and publishers. 

We are focused on understanding our partners&#146; objectives and developing plans and programs to grow our mutual businesses. We measure partner satisfaction regularly and hold quarterly business reviews with our largest partners to review business results from the prior quarter, discuss plans for the future and obtain feedback. Additionally, we host annual partner forums in North America, EMEA and APAC to articulate our plans for the upcoming year. 

As we move into new service areas, we may become even more reliant on certain partner relationships. For a discussion of risks associated with our reliance on partners, see &#147;Risk Factors &#150; We rely on our partners for product availability, competitive products to sell and related marketing funds and purchasing incentives,&#148; in Part I, Item 1A of this report. 

Our Teammates 

As of December 31, 2015, we employed 5,761 teammates, of whom 2,420 were engaged in sales related activities, 1,797 were engaged in management, support services and administration activities, 1,418 were skilled, certified consulting and service delivery professionals and 126 were engaged in distribution activities. Our teammates in the United States are not represented by a labor union, and our workforces in certain foreign countries, such as Germany, have worker representative committees or work councils with which we maintain strong relationships. We believe our relations with employees are good, and we have never experienced a labor related work stoppage. 

For a discussion of risks associated with our dependence on certain personnel, including sales personnel, see &#147;Risk Factors &#150; We depend on certain personnel,&#148; in Part I, Item 1A of this report. 

&#160;

INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC. 

&#160;

Our Seasonality 

We experience some seasonal trends in our sales of IT hardware, software and services. For example: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; software sales are typically seasonally higher in our second and fourth quarters, particularly the second quarter; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; business clients, particularly larger enterprise businesses in the United States, tend to spend more in our fourth quarter and less in the first quarter; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; sales to the federal government in the United States are often stronger in our third quarter, while sales in the state and local government and education markets are stronger in our second quarter; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; sales to public sector clients in the United Kingdom are often stronger in our first quarter. These trends create overall seasonality in our consolidated results such that sales and profitability are expected to be higher in the second and fourth quarters of the year. 

Our Backlog 

The majority of our backlog historically has been and continues to be open cancelable purchase orders. We do not believe that backlog as of any particular date is predictive of future results. 

Our Intellectual Property 

We do not maintain a traditional research and development group, but we do develop and seek to protect a range of intellectual property, including trademarks, service marks, copyrights, domain name rights, trade dress, trade secrets and similar intellectual property, relying for such protection on applicable statutes and common law rights, trade-secret protection and confidentiality and license agreements, as applicable, with teammates, clients, partners and others to protect our intellectual property rights. Our principal trademark is a registered mark, and we also license certain of our proprietary intellectual property rights to third parties. We have registered a number of domain names, applied for registration of other marks in the United States and in select international jurisdictions, and, from time to time, filed patent applications. We believe our trademarks and service marks, in particular, have significant value, and we continue to invest in the promotion of our trademarks and service marks and in our protection of them. 

For a discussion of risks associated with our intellectual property, see &#147;Risk Factors &#150; We may not be able to protect our intellectual property adequately, and we may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims,&#148; in Part I, Item 1A of this report.
