&#160;

On May 30, 2014, we sent a notice of termination (&#147;Termination Notice&#148;) to Southwest Exploration Inc. (&#147;SWI&#148;) for the Option to Purchase and Royalty Agreement (&#147;Agreement&#148;) dated September 28, 2011 for the Newsboy Project (defined hereafter) in Arizona. The Agreement was terminated on June 30, 2014.

&#160;

On April 25, 2014, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (&#147;SPA&#148;) for an unsecured 12.5% convertible promissory note (the &#147;Note&#148;) with NPX Metals, Inc (&#147;NPX&#148;), as the lender, in the amount of $220,000.

&#160;

On March 31, 2014, we created a new wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company with the name of Rocky Mountain Minerals Corp. (&#147;RMM&#148;). RMM will be used to account for the exploration costs of the Klondike, patents optioned from Mojave that are adjacent to the Company&#146;s properties in the Bullfrog Mining District and perhaps other properties that may be acquired.

&#160;

Company Overview 

We are an exploration stage company engaged in the acquisition and exploration of properties that may contain gold and other mineralization primarily in the United States. 

&#160; 

Bullfrog Project 

The &#147;Bullfrog Project&#148; lies approximately 3 miles northwest of the town of Beatty and 116 miles northwest of Las Vegas, Nevada. Standard Gold initially acquired in 2011 a 100% right, title and interest in 79 lode claims and 2 patented claims that contain approximately 1,600 acres subject to a 3% net smelter royalty.

&#160;

On October 29, 2014, RMM, entered into an Option Agreement (&#147;Option&#148;) with Mojave. Mojave holds and possesses the purchase rights to 100% of 12 patented mining claims located in Nye County, Nevada. This property is contiguous to the Company&#146;s Bullfrog Project and covers approximately 156 acres, including the northeast half of the Montgomery-Shoshone pit mined by Barrick Gold in the 1990&#146;s.

&#160;

Mojave granted to RMM the sole and immediate working right and option with respect to the Property until the 10th anniversary of the closing date, to earn a 100% interest in and to the Property free and clear of all charges encumbrances and claims, save and except a sliding scale NSR Royalty.

&#160;

In order to maintain in force the working right and Option granted to it, and to exercise the Option, RMM granted Mojave 750,000 shares of common stock and paid $16,000. RMM must pay to Mojave a total of $190,000 over the next 10 years. For reference, Barrick Bullfrog (&#147;Barrick&#148;) terminated a lease on these patents after they ceased operations in late 1999.

&#160;

On March 23, 2015, RMM entered into a Mineral Lease and Option to Purchase Agreement with Barrick involving 6 patented mining claims, 20 unpatented mining claims, and 8 mill site claims located three miles west of Beatty, Nevada and covers approximately 444 acres. These properties are strategically located adjacent to the Company&#146;s Bullfrog Gold Project and include two patents that cover the SW half of the Montgomery-Shoshone (M-S) open pit from which Barrick produced approximately 220,000 ounces of gold by the late 1990&#146;s. Underground mining in the early 1900&#146;s produced approximately 70,000 ounces of gold from the M-S deposit. Also included in the agreement is the northern one third of the main Bullfrog deposit where Barrick mined approximately 2.1 million additional ounces by open pit and underground methods. In addition to prospective adjacent lands, these acquisitions provide the potential to expand the M-S deposit along strike and at depth and in the northern part of the main Bullfrog deposit.

&#160;

The Company also has access to Barrick&#146;s substantial data base within a 1.5 mile radius of the leased lands to further advance its exploration and development programs. To maintain the lease and option, the Company must spend $1.5 million dollars within five years on the Barrick properties and then pay Barrick 3.25 million shares of Bullfrog common stock while providing a 2% gross royalty on production from the Barrick properties. Overriding royalties of 5% net smelter returns and 5% gross proceeds are respectively limited to three claims and two patents in the main Bullfrog pit area. Barrick has retained a back-in right to reacquire a 51% interest in the Barrick properties, subject to definition of a mineral resource on the Barrick properties meeting certain criteria, and reimbursing the Company in an amount equal to two and one half times Company expenditures on the Barrick properties.

&#160;

Company management has estimated in April 2015 that 41,000 ounces of gold in 1.44 million tons of material averaging 0.97 gram per ton remains within a cutoff depth up to 75 meters under the existing M-S pit. This manual estimate was based on cross sections typically spaced 15 meters apart, a cutoff grade of 0.3 gram gold per ton at the top and bottom of mineral intervals, and drill data and pit surveys completed by Barrick. Notwithstanding, Barrick makes no representation concerning the accuracy or completeness of the data used by the Company or any estimates made by the Company. Additional drilling is required to confirm some of the Company&#146;s mineral projections and to test for extensions at greater depths and along strike beyond the existing pit limits.

Half of this M-S mineralization is on two Barrick patents within the pit and half is on two of the 12 Mojave patents. The direct ratio of waste to mineral tons within a cross-sectional preliminary pit outline is 0.97:1, but this does not include waste removal required for ramps and other considerations that would otherwise be included in a future pit plan based on computerized block modelling and 3-D mine planning and design programs. It is cautioned that the Company&#146;s current and expanded properties contain no reserves or resources and that the estimates and additional potential mineralization discussed herein may never become viable, feasible or economic. These estimates were mainly prepared to assess the available M-S information and plan additional drilling.

&#160;

Significant drilling is required to test projections of mineralized trends and structures that extend for considerable distances to the north and east of the M-S pit on the original lands acquired by the Company in 2011. Located east of the M-S pit is an area 700 meters by 1,300 meters in which there is only one shallow hole from which there is no data available. Only a small portion of this area may be prospective, but the area certainly warrants additional study and exploration drilling. 

&#160;

There is only one drill hole located about 150 meters NE of the M-S pit limit and another hole 1,000 meters NE of the pit along strike of a major geologic structure. In this regard, the Company&#146;s lands extend nearly 5,000 meters NNE of the pit and there has been very little drilling in this area, even though several structures have been mapped by Barrick and others.

&#160;

Barrick drilled twelve deep holes in the M-S area ranging from 318 meters to 549 meters. Notable mineral intercepts from four holes below the central part of the pit are summarized below:

These results demonstrate that substantial amounts of gold occur in an exceptionally large epithermal system that has good potential for expansion and possibly higher grades at depth. Three of these intercepts are less than 75 meters below the existing pit. Two holes located 40 meters and 90 meters east of the 160 meter interval in hole #717 contained no significant mineralization at this depth, whereas the 29 meters of mineral in hole #733 is 60 meters west and the mineral zone is open to the north, south and west.

&#160;

For reference, Barrick terminated all mining and milling operations in the autumn of 1999 when their cash production costs exceeded gold prices that averaged less than $300 per ounce for the year and reached a low of $258/oz in August 1999. The economic margins for heap leaching lower grades at current gold prices near $1200/oz are deemed better than in 1999, and the Company is positioned to explore such opportunities. Furthermore, Barrick never controlled or had access to a patented claim on the immediate east and north limits of the M-S pit, but this patent is owned by the Company. 

During the past year the Company has studied Barrick&#146;s entire electronic data base and much of their paper data base obtained from their Elko, Nevada and Salt Lake City, Utah offices. In this regard, the Company expects to report during Q2 of 2016 its extensive finding, results and conclusions on the areas mined by Barrick and adjacent lands having exploration potential. Estimates of gold mineralization in and around the M-S and Bullfrog pits will also be estimated and/or updated. 

Klondike Project 

The Company acquired the option to purchase the &#147;Klondike Project&#148; in Nevada in June 2012. The Klondike Project is located in the Alpha Mining District about 40 miles north of Eureka, Nevada. The initial property included 64 unpatented mining claims, to which Bullfrog staked an additional 168 claims but dropped 123 claims in 2015. The current land position is now 109 claims that cover approximately 2,180 acres.

&#160;

The Klondike Project covers mineralized structures 5 miles long and 1.5 miles wide along the west flank of the Sulfur Springs mountain range. The rocks within this corridor are intensely broken by numerous periods of faulting, thereby providing a favorable environment for several sequences of hydrothermal solutions to form mineral deposits. These host rocks are mostly Devonian age sediments typical of most Carlin gold deposits.

&#160;

At least two styles of mineral deposits exist on the Company &#146; s property:

&#160;

&#183;

The oldest is a silver-rich, lead-zinc event that appears to be related to a molybdenum porphyry system that is not exposed but indicated by geochemistry and alteration. In this regard, the Klondike claims lie 10 miles north of the Mt. Hope molybdenum mine which is currently under development as one of the world&#146;s largest molybdenum deposits. The Mt. Hope deposit has a halo of silver-zinc mineralization that is typically more than a thousand feet thick and above several thousand feet of molybdenum mineralization. A silver-rich copper event may also be related to this style of mineralization.

&#183;

A later stage Carlin-style gold-arsenic-barite mineralizing event over-printed the earlier silver-zinc-molybdenum system. This event has wide-spread anomalous gold values with arsenic and associated calcite veining. Barite may be related to all events. A new gold discovery is currently being drilled by other companies 10 miles west of the Klondike and may be the continuation of the massive Cortez gold trend.

Competition 

We do not compete directly with anyone for the exploration or removal of minerals from our property as we hold all interest and rights to the claims. Readily available commodities markets exist in the U.S. and around the world for the sale of minerals. Therefore, we will likely be able to sell minerals that we are able to recover. We will be subject to competition and unforeseen limited sources of supplies in the industry in the event spot shortages arise for supplies such as explosives or large equipment tires, and certain equipment such as bulldozers and excavators and services, such as contract drilling that we will need to conduct exploration. If we are unsuccessful in securing the products, equipment and services we need, we may have to suspend our exploration plans until we are able to secure them.

&#160;

Compliance with Government Regulation 

We will be required to comply with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to the exploration of minerals in the United States generally. We will also be subject to the regulations of

the BLM with respect to mining claims on Federal lands.

&#160;

Future exploration drilling on any of our properties that consist of BLM land will require us to either file a Notice of Intent or a Plan of Operations with the BLM, depending upon the amount of new surface disturbance that is planned. A Notice of Intent is required for planned surface activities that anticipate less than 5.0 acres of surface disturbance, and usually can be obtained within a 30 to 60-day time period. A Plan of Operations will be required if there is greater than 5.0 acres of new surface disturbance involved with the planned exploration work. A Plan of Operations can take several months to be approved, depending on the nature of the intended work, the level of reclamation bonding required, the need for archeological surveys, and other factors as may be determined by the BLM.

&#160;

Research and Development 

As of the date of this filing we have had no expense related to research and development.

&#160;
