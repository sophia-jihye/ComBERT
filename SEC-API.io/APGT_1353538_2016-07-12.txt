 ITEM 1. BUSINESS. &#160;

THE COMPANY&#8217;S HISTORY

&#160;

Newtown Lane Marketing, Incorporated (&#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;our&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221; or &#8220;Newtown&#8221;) was incorporated in Delaware on September 26, 2005. We are a corporation with limited operations and have very limited revenues from our business operations since our incorporation in September 2005. Until December 31, 2007, we held the exclusive license to exploit the Dreesen's Donut Brand in the United States with the exception of the states of Florida and Pennsylvania, and in Suffolk County, New York, which Dreesen retained for itself. In August 2007 there was a change in control, as detailed below, and we discontinued our efforts to promote the Dreesen's Donut Brand at that time. The license from Dreesen expired on December 31, 2007.

&#160;

On August 29, 2008, we implemented a 1 for 50 reverse stock split (the &#8220;Reverse Split&#8221;) of our Common Stock. Pursuant to the Reverse Split, each 50 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding was converted into one share of Common Stock.

&#160;

Effective August 15, 2013, we declared and paid a stock dividend on our outstanding Common Stock to stockholders of record as of August 15, 2013 (the &#8220;Record Date&#8221;). As a result, all stockholders on the Record Date received nine new shares of Common Stock for each share of Common Stock owned by them as of the that date (the &#8220;2013 Stock Dividend&#8221;).

&#160;

All share and per share data contained in this Report has been retroactively restated to reflect the Reverse Split and the 2013 Stock Dividend and all fractional shares, if any, as a result thereof have been rounded upward to the next whole share.

&#160;

As of March 31, 2016, our authorized capital stock consisted of 100,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 1,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock of which 13,757,550 shares of Common Stock, and no shares of Preferred Stock, were issued and outstanding. All shares of Common Stock currently outstanding are validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.

&#160;

CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP TRANSACTIONS

&#160;

On August 8, 2007 (the &#8220;Effective Date&#8221;), we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the &#8220;Purchase Agreement&#8221;) with Moyo Partners, LLC, a New York limited liability company (&#8220;Moyo&#8221;) and R&#38;R Biotech Partners, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (&#8220;R&#38;R&#8221; collectively with Moyo, the &#8220;Purchasers&#8221;), pursuant to which we sold to them, in the aggregate, approximately, four million four hundred seventy nine thousand two hundred fifty (4,479,250) shares of our common stock, par value $.001 per share (&#8220;Common Stock&#8221;) and &#160; five hundred (500 ) shares &#160; of our Series A Preferred Stock, par value $.001 per share (&#8220;Series A Preferred Stock&#8221;), each share convertible at the option of the holder into, approximately, fourteen thousand eight hundred twenty (14,820) shares of Common Stock, for aggregate gross &#160; proceeds to us of $600,000. The shares of Series A Preferred Stock were convertible only to the extent there were a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock available for issuance upon any such conversion.

&#160;

On the Effective Date: (i) the Purchasers acquired control of Newtown, with (a) R&#38;R acquiring nine million five hundred nine thousand four hundred forty (9,509,440) shares of Common Stock (assuming the conversion by R&#38;R of the four hundred (400) shares of Series A Preferred Stock it acquired pursuant to the Purchase Agreement into five million nine hundred twenty eight thousand (5,928,000) shares of Common Stock) constituting 72% of the then issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock, and (b) Moyo acquiring two million three hundred seventy seven thousand three hundred sixty (2,377,360) shares of Common Stock (assuming the conversion by Moyo of its one hundred (100) shares of Series A Preferred Stock it acquired pursuant to the Purchase Agreement into one million four hundred eighty one thousand five hundred ten (1,481,510) shares of Common Stock) constituting 18% of the then issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock; and (ii) in full satisfaction of our obligations under outstanding convertible promissory notes in the principal amount of $960,000 (the &#8220;December Notes&#8221;), the Note holders of the December Notes converted an aggregate of $479,811 of principal and accrued interest into 274,200 shares of Common Stock and accepted a cash payment from us in the aggregate amount of $625,030 for the remaining principal balance.

&#160;

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

On the Effective Date: (i) Arnold P. Kling was appointed to our Board of Directors (&#8220;Board&#8221;) and served together with Vincent J. McGill, a then current director who continued to serve until August 20, 2007, the effective date of his resignation from our Board; (ii) all of our then officers and directors, with the exception of Mr. McGill, resigned from their respective positions with us; (iii) our Board appointed Mr. Kling as president and Kirk M. Warshaw as chief financial officer and secretary; and (iv) we relocated our headquarters to Chatham, New Jersey.

&#160;

Following Mr. McGill&#8217;s resignation from our Board on August 20, 2007, Mr. Kling became our sole director and president.

&#160;

On October 19, 2007, we effected an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation to increase to 100,000,000 the number of authorized shares of Common Stock available for issuance (the &#8220;Charter Amendment&#8221;). As a result of the Charter Amendment, as of October 19, 2007, we had adequate shares of Common Stock available for issuance upon the conversion of all the issued and outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock.

&#160;

On December 19, 2007, the holders of all the issued and outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock elected to convert all of their shares into shares of Common Stock. As a result, the 500 shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding were exchanged for 7,407,540 shares of Common Stock, and all 500 shares of the Series A Preferred Stock were returned to the status of authorized and unissued shares of undesignated preferred stock, par value $.001 per shares. None of the Series A Preferred Stock were outstanding as of the Series A Preferred Elimination Date.

&#160;

In December 2008, we sold 550,000 shares of restricted Common Stock to our Chief Financial Officer, for $2,000. The issuance of these shares was exempt from registration pursuant to Sections 4(2) and 4(6) or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#8220;Act&#8221;). The stock certificate representing these shares was imprinted with a legend restricting transfer unless pursuant to an effective registration statement or an exemption from registration under the Act.

&#160;

On May 6, 2013, Ironbound Partners Fund, LLC (&#8220;Ironbound&#8221;) acquired 9,509,440 shares of our outstanding Common Stock (the &#8220;Acquired Shares&#8221;) for an aggregate purchase price of $15,000, or $0.00157737 per share, from the Chapter 7 Trustee of the Estates of Rodman &#38; Renshaw, LLC (&#8220;Rodman&#8221;), Direct Markets, Inc., and Direct Markets Holdings, Corp. in Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings pending in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (Cases No. 13-10087, 13-10088 and 13-10089). The Acquired Shares constituted all the shares of Common Stock previously owned by R&#38;R, an affiliate of Rodman, and represented 69.1% of our total issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock as of May 6, 2013.

&#160;

On May 14, 2013, Ironbound loaned $100,000 to us and we issued a convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $100,000 to Ironbound (the &#8220;May 2013 Note&#8221;). The May 2013 Note was initially issued with a two-year term and bore interest at the rate of 5.0% per annum, payable at maturity. The principal and accrued interest on the May 2013 Note was convertible into shares of Common Stock upon the consummation of a &#8220;Fundamental Transaction&#8221; (as defined in the May 2013 Note) at the &#8220;Conversion Price&#8221; (as defined in the May 2013 Note). The May 2013 Note was amended in July 2014 in accordance with the Amended and Restated Note, as described below.

&#160;

On July 25, 2014, we raised gross proceeds of $72,000 in a debt financing transaction with Ironbound and, in connection therewith, issued to Ironbound a convertible promissory note (the &#8220;2014 Note&#8221;) in the principal amount of $72,000. The 2014 Note has a maturity date of August 31, 2015 and bears interest at the rate of 5.0% per annum, payable at maturity. The principal and accrued interest on the 2014 Note is convertible, at the election of Ironbound, into shares of our Common Stock following the consummation of a &#8220;Qualified Financing&#8221; (as defined in the 2014 Note), or upon the consummation of a &#8220;Fundamental Transaction&#8221; (as defined in the 2014 Note) at the &#8220;Conversion Price&#8221; (as defined in the 2014 Note).

&#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Further, on July 25, 2014, we issued an amended and restated convertible promissory note (the &#8220;Amended and Restated Note&#8221; and together with the 2014 Note, the &#8220;Prior Notes&#8221;) to Ironbound in the principal amount of $100,000, in substitution for the May 2013 Note. The Amended and Restated Note extended the maturity of the May 2013 Note to August 31, 2015 and provided for the principal and accrued interest on the May 2013 Note to be convertible, at the election of Ironbound, into shares of our Common Stock following the consummation of a &#8220;Qualified Financing&#8221; (as defined in the May 2013 Note), or upon the consummation of a &#8220;Fundamental Transaction&#8221; (as defined in the May 2013 Note) at the &#8220;Conversion Price&#8221; (as defined in the May 2013 Note). The May 2013 Note otherwise remained unchanged.

&#160;

Effective September 1, 2015, the maturity dates of the Prior Notes was extended from August 31, 2015 to August 31, 2016.

&#160;

On October 30, 2015, Mr. Kling resigned from his position as our sole director and from his position as our President. Also on October 30, 2015, Mr. Warshaw resigned from his positions as our Chief Financial Officer and Secretary. Messrs. Kling&#8217;s and Warshaw&#8217;s resignation were not due to any disagreement with the Company or its management on any matter relating to the Company&#8217;s operations, policies or practices. Prior to Mr. Kling&#8217;s resignation, our Board of Directors appointed Jonathan J. Ledecky, the managing member of Ironbound, our largest stockholder, to fill the vacancy created by Mr. Kling&#8217;s resignation and will assume the role of President of the Company.

&#160;

On April 1, 2016, we issued a convertible promissory note (the &#8220;2016 Note&#8221; and together with the Prior Notes, the &#8220;Outstanding Notes&#8221;) in the principal amount of $10,000 to Ironbound. The 2016 Note has the same terms as the Prior Notes. The proceeds of the 2016 Note was and will be utilized by the Company to fund working capital needs.

&#160;

THE COMPANY TODAY

&#160;

Since the Effective Date, our main purpose has been to serve as a vehicle to acquire an operating business and we are currently considered a &#8220;shell&#8221; company in as much as we are not generating revenues, do not own an operating business, and have no specific plan other than to engage in a merger or acquisition transaction with a yet-to-be identified operating company or business. Our principal business objective for the next 12 months and beyond such time will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with an operating company or business. We will not restrict our potential candidate target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical location and, thus, may acquire any type of business. The analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of our officers and directors. We have no employees and no material assets.

&#160;

We currently have no agreements or understandings with any prospective business combination candidates and there are no assurances that we will find a suitable business with which to combine. The implementation of our business objectives is wholly contingent upon a business combination and/or the successful sale of our securities. We intend to utilize the proceeds of any offering, any sales of equity securities or debt securities, bank and other borrowings or a combination of those sources to effect a business combination with a target business which we believe may have significant growth potential. While we may, under certain circumstances, seek to effect business combinations with more than one target business, unless additional financing is obtained, we will not have sufficient proceeds remaining after an initial business combination to undertake additional business combinations.

&#160;

A common reason for a target company to enter into a merger with a shell company is the desire to establish a public trading market for its shares. Such a company would hope to avoid the perceived adverse consequences of undertaking a public offering itself, such as the time delays and significant expenses incurred to comply with the various federal and state securities law that regulate initial public offerings.

&#160;

As a result of our limited resources, unless and until additional financing is obtained we expect to have sufficient proceeds to effect only a single business combination. Accordingly, the prospects for our success will likely be dependent upon the future performance of a single business. Unlike certain entities that have the resources to consummate several business combinations or entities operating in multiple industries or multiple segments of a single industry, we do not expect to have the resources to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses. A target business may be dependent upon the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services, in which case there will be an even higher risk that the target business will not prove to be commercially viable.

&#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

We do not expect our present management to play any managerial role for us following a business combination. Although we intend to scrutinize closely the management of a prospective target business in connection with our evaluation of a business combination with a target business, our assessment of management may be incorrect.

&#160;

In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to consider several factors, including the following:

&#160;

- experience and skill of management and availability of additional personnel of the target business; &#160;

- costs associated with effecting the business combination; &#160;

- equity interest retained by our stockholders in the merged entity; &#160;

- growth potential of the target business; &#160;

- capital requirements of the target business; &#160;

- capital available to the target business; &#160;

- stage of development of the target business; &#160;

- proprietary features and degree of intellectual property or other protection of the target business; &#160;

- the financial statements of the target business; and &#160;

- the regulatory environment in which the target business operates. &#160;

The foregoing criteria are not intended to be exhaustive and any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular target business will be based, to the extent relevant, on the above factors, as well as other considerations we deem relevant. In connection with our evaluation of a prospective target business, we anticipate that we will conduct a due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meeting with incumbent management as well as a review of financial, legal and other information.

&#160;

The time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business (including conducting a due diligence review) and to structure and consummate the business combination (including negotiating and documenting relevant agreements and preparing requisite documents for filing pursuant to applicable corporate and securities laws) cannot be determined at this time. Our president intends to devote only a very small portion of his time to our affairs, and, accordingly, the consummation of a business combination may require a longer time than if he devoted his full time to our affairs. However, he will devote such time as he deems reasonably necessary to carry out our business and affairs. The amount of time devoted to our business and affairs may vary significantly depending upon, among other things, whether we have identified a target business or are engaged in active negotiation of a business combination. We expect to use outside consultants, advisors, attorneys and accountants as necessary. We do not anticipate hiring any full-time employees so long as we are seeking and evaluating business opportunities.

&#160;

We anticipate that various prospective target businesses will be brought to our attention from various sources, including securities broker-dealers, investment bankers, venture capitalists, bankers and other members of the financial community, including, possibly, the executive officers and our affiliates.

&#160;

As a general rule, federal and state tax laws and regulations have a significant impact upon the structuring of business combinations. We will evaluate the possible tax consequences of any prospective business combination and will endeavor to structure a business combination so as to achieve the most favorable tax treatment to our company, the target business and our respective stockholders. There can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service or relevant state tax authorities will ultimately assent to our tax treatment of a particular consummated business combination. To the extent the Internal Revenue Service or any relevant state tax authorities ultimately prevail in recharacterizing the tax treatment of a business combination, there may be adverse tax consequences to our company, the target business, and our respective stockholders.

&#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

We may acquire a company or business by purchasing the securities of such company or business. However, we do not intend to engage primarily in such activities. Specifically, we intend to conduct our activities so as to avoid being classified as an &#34;investment company&#34; under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the &#8220;Investment Act&#8221;) and therefore avoid application of the costly and restrictive registration and other provisions of the Investment Company Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder.

&#160;

Section 3(a) of the Investment Company Act excepts from the definition of an &#34;investment company&#34; an entity which does not engage primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities, or which does not engage in the business of investing, owning, holding or trading &#34;investment securities&#34; (defined as &#34;all securities other than government securities or securities of majority-owned subsidiaries&#34;) the value of which exceed 40% of the value of its total assets (excluding government securities, cash or cash items). We intend to operate any business in the future in a manner which will result in the availability of this exception from the definition of an investment company. Consequently, our acquisition of a company or business through the purchase and sale of investment securities will be limited. Although we intend to act to avoid classification as an investment company, the provisions of the Investment Company Act are extremely complex and it is possible that we may be classified as an inadvertent investment company. We intend to vigorously resist classification as an investment company, and to take advantage of any exemptions or exceptions from application of the Investment Company Act, which allows an entity a one-time option during any three-year period to claim an exemption as a &#34;transient&#34; investment company. The necessity of asserting any such resistance, or making any claim of exemption, could be time consuming and costly, or even prohibitive, given our limited resources.

&#160;

Various impediments to a business combination may arise, such as appraisal rights afforded the stockholders of a target business under the laws of its state of organization. This may prove to be deterrent to a particular combination.

&#160;
