&#160; 

Business 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s primary business, through its subsidiaries Corning Gas and Pike, is natural gas and electric distribution. Corning Gas, the principal subsidiary, serves approximately 15,000 residential, commercial, industrial and municipal customers in the Corning, Hammondsport and Virgil, New York, areas and two other gas utilities which serve the Elmira and Bath, New York, areas. It is franchised to supply gas service in all of the political subdivisions in which it operates. It also transports and compresses gas for a gas producer from the producer&#8217;s gathering network into an interstate pipeline. The Gas Company is under the jurisdiction of the New York Public Service Commission (&#8220;NYPSC&#8221;) which oversees and sets rates for New York gas distribution companies. In addition, the Gas Company has contracts with Corning Incorporated and Woodhull Municipal Gas Company, a small local utility, to provide maintenance service on their gas lines. Pike is an electric and gas utility regulated by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (&#8220;PAPUC&#8221;). It provides electric service to approximately 4,600 customers in the Townships of Westfall, Milford and the northern part of Dingman and in the Boroughs of Milford and Matamoras. Pike provides natural gas service to 1,200 customers in Westfall Township and the Borough of Matamoras. All of these communities are located in Pike County, Pennsylvania. Additionally Leatherstocking Gas distributes gas in Susquehanna and Bradford Counties, Pennsylvania, and has an application pending before the NYPSC for authority to provide gas distribution services in Broome County, New York. Leatherstocking Pipeline, an unregulated company, serves one customer in Lawton, Pennsylvania.

Gas and Electric Supply 

&#160; 

Corning Gas has contracted with various sources to provide natural gas to our distribution system. The Gas Company contracts for pipeline capacity, as well as storage capacity of approximately 736,000 dekatherms (&#8220;Dth&#8221;). The Company manages its transportation and storage capacity with internal resources. Pike has contracted with Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc. (&#8220;O&#38;R&#8221;) to provide electricity and natural gas according to agreements for a term of three years. 

&#160; 

Corning Gas secured the NYPSC-required fixed price and storage gas supply for the 2016-2017 winter season and is managing its storage and gas supply contracts following its gas supply and acquisition plan. Assuming no extraordinary conditions for the winter season, gas supply, flowing and storage, will be adequate to serve its approximately 15,000 customers. 

&#160; 

Corning Gas does not expect a shortage of natural gas to impact our business over the next five to ten years. Natural gas supply over the last several years has been positive, and domestic reserves and production have increased. This is especially true in proximity to our distribution network. We likewise anticipate no shortages of the necessary pipes and valves for safe distribution of natural gas, and continue to receive material inventory from various reliable sources. We also have confidence that our agreement with O&#38;R will enable Pike to meet all of our electric and gas needs for Pike&#8217;s customers. 

&#160; 

Seasonality 

&#160; 

For both Corning Gas and Pike, business is highly seasonal in nature, sales for each quarter of the year vary and are not comparable. Sales vary depending on seasonal variations in temperature. Corning Gas and Pike&#8217;s gas sales peak in the winter, while Pike&#8217;s electric sales peak in the summer. 

&#160; 

Significant Customers 

&#160; 

The Gas Company has four major customers, Corning Incorporated, New York State Electric &#38; Gas, Bath Electric, Gas &#38; Water Systems, and Repsol Energy North America (&#8220;Repsol&#8221;, formerly Talisman Energy USA Incorporated). Although Repsol is a significant customer, the Gas Company does not deliver gas to Repsol. Rather the Gas Company receives gas from several of Repsol&#8217;s gathering systems and wells, and transports its gas through our system. These customers accounted for approximately 18.14% of our revenues in fiscal 2016 and 18.8% in fiscal 2015. The loss of any of these customers would have an adverse or material impact on our financial results. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

The Company had 59 employees as of September 30, 2016, and 58 as of September 30, 2015. Of this total, nearly half are union labor working under a union contract effective until April 2, 2018. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Historically, the competition in the Gas Company&#8217;s residential market has been primarily from electricity for cooking, water heating and clothes drying, and to a small degree, electricity, fuel oil and propane for heating. The price of gas remains low in comparison to that of alternative fuels in our service territory and our competitive position in the residential, commercial and industrial markets continues to be strong. Over 90 percent of our residential customers heat with gas. When we expand our distribution system to attract new customers, our principal competition is oil and propane. Natural gas enjoys a price advantage over these fuels today. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Environmental Regulation 

&#160; 

We believe we are in compliance with present federal, state and local provisions relating to the protection of the environment. We do not expect that continued compliance with these requirements will have any material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings and financial position. The Company has no former manufactured gas plant sites (MGP) and is not a party to any environmental proceedings, litigation or complaints. 

&#160; 

Regulatory Matters 

&#160; 

The Gas Company is regulated by the NYPSC. On October 19, 2015, the NYPSC adopted the terms of a Joint Proposal for Extension of Gas Rate Plan (&#8220;Extension Joint Proposal&#8221;) by the Staff of the NYPSC, the Gas Company and other parties to the proceedings. This Extension Joint Proposal 

settled all contested issues among the parties pertaining to a two-year extension, with modifications, of the original 2012 Joint Proposal&#8217;s three year Gas Rate Plan. On June 17, 2016, the Gas Company made a filing with the NYPSC in Case 16-G-0369, a three-year plan to implement a levelized increase in revenues from gas delivery service of $3,463,287 in each year for the period June 1, 2017 through May 31, 2020, resulting in total bill impacts on customers in each year of 10.4 percent. See &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Regulatory Matters&#8221; for key terms of the Extension Joint Proposal and the Case 16-G-0369 filing. Pike is regulated by the PAPUC. 

&#160; 

Pike is operating under a rate order issued effective September 1, 2014 and extended to March 1, 2018 under the terms of our acquisition (see below under the heading &#8220;Regulatory Matters &#8211; Pike&#8221;). 

&#160; 

Other Recent Developments 

&#160; 

As previously reported, on October 13, 2015, the Holding Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with O&#38;R for the purchase of all of the outstanding capital stock of Pike, a Pennsylvania corporation operating as a regulated electric and gas utility serving approximately 5,800 customers in Pike County, Pennsylvania. The purchase price for the stock of Pike was $13.1 million, with a closing date working capital adjustment of $1.9 million, and assumption of $3.2 million in Pike County Light &#38; Power&#8217;s outstanding bonds. The acquisition closed on August 31, 2016. O&#38;R provides transition assistance pursuant to a Transition Services Agreement (the &#8220;TSA&#8221;), and continues to supply electric power and gas to Pike County pursuant to Electric and Gas Supply Agreements (the &#8220;ESA&#8221; and &#8220;GSA&#8221;). The TSA is for a term of up to twelve months and provides monthly customer services and operations support. The GSA and TSA are each for a term of 36 months, with up to three 12-month renewal terms. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; and Note 13 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and the Exhibits to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. 

The acquisition of Pike was financed in part by financing from M&#38;T Bank, including a $12.0 million term loan, a $2.0 million line of credit, one or more letters of credit with a limit of up to $2.5 million and an initial amount of $2.1 million, issued to O&#38;R as collateral security for the obligations of Pike under the TSA, ESA and GSA. The debt is guaranteed by The Holding Company. Immediately after the closing, the Holding Company caused Pike to issue a notice of redemption to the holders of its $3.2 million in bonds, to repurchase the bonds at 100.4% of their principal amount effective October 2, 2016. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; and &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8221; below for additional information.
