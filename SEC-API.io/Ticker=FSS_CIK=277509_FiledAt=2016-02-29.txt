Narrative Description of Business 

Products manufactured and services rendered by the Company are divided into two major operating segments: the Environmental Solutions Group and the Safety and Security Systems Group.

See Note 14 &#32;&#8211; Discontinued Operations to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further details. 

Marketing and Distribution 

The Environmental Solutions Group uses either a dealer network or direct sales to service customers generally depending on the type and geographic location of the customer. The Environmental Solutions Group&#8217;s direct sales channel concentrates on the industrial, utility and construction market segments, while the dealer network focuses primarily on the municipal market. Dealer representatives demonstrate the vehicles&#8217; functionalities and capabilities to customers and service the vehicles on a timely basis. The Company believes its national and global dealer networks for vehicles distinguish it from its competitors. 

The Safety and Security Systems Group sells to industrial customers through wholesalers and distributors who are supported by Company sales personnel and/or independent manufacturers&#8217; representatives. Products are also sold to municipal and governmental customers through active independent distributors, as well as through original equipment manufacturers and direct sales. The Company sells comprehensive integrated warning and interoperable communications through a combination of a direct sales force and distributors. International sales are made through the Group&#8217;s independent foreign distributors or on a direct basis. 

Customers and Backlog 

Total orders in 2015 &#32;were $686.1 million , of which approximately 47% were to U.S. municipal and governmental customers, 26% were to U.S. commercial and industrial customers and 27% were to non-U.S. customers. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company&#8217;s business. 

During 2015 , the Company&#8217;s U.S. municipal and governmental orders decreased by 11% compared to 2014 &#32;levels, primarily attributable to fewer large fleet orders for street sweepers and sewer cleaners. During 2014 , the Company&#8217;s U.S. municipal and governmental orders increased by 21% compared to 2013 , primarily driven by improved orders of our street sweeper and sewer cleaner products and generally solid municipal demand. 

During 2015 , the Company&#8217;s U.S. commercial and industrial orders decreased by 30% from 2014 , in large part due to lower vacuum truck orders, which were adversely impacted, directly and indirectly, by softness in oil and gas markets and, to a lesser extent, other industrial markets. During 2014 , the Company&#8217;s U.S. commercial and industrial orders increased by 14% when compared to 2013 &#32;levels, largely attributable to higher orders of vacuum trucks, including hydro-excavation products. 

During 2015 , the Company&#8217;s non-U.S. orders decreased by 3% from 2014 . This compared to an increase of 5% in non-U.S orders in 2014 &#32;versus 2013 . Non-U.S. municipal and governmental markets are similar to the U.S. municipal and governmental markets in that they are largely dependent on tax revenues to support spending and orders may be subject to public-entity bid procedures. Of the Company&#8217;s non-U.S. orders received in 2015 , there were approximately 41% from Canada, 26% from Europe, 17% from the Middle East and Africa and less than 10% from any other particular region. 

The Company&#8217;s backlog totaled $171.3 million &#32;at December 31, 2015 &#32;compared to $254.7 million &#32;at December 31, 2014 . Backlogs vary by Group due to the nature of the Company&#8217;s products and the buying patterns of its customers. The Environmental Solutions Group has experienced an average backlog that can range from four to five months of shipments and the Safety and Security Systems Group typically experiences an average backlog of approximately two months of shipments. Production of the Company&#8217;s December 31, 2015 &#32;backlog is expected to be substantially completed during 2016 . 

Suppliers 

The Company purchases a wide variety of raw materials from around the world for use in the manufacture of its products, although the majority of current purchases are from North American sources. To minimize risks relating to availability, price and quality of key products and components, the Company is party to numerous strategic supplier arrangements. Although certain materials are obtained from either a single-source supplier or a limited number of suppliers, the Company has generally identified alternative sources to minimize the interruption of its business in the event of supply disruptions. 

Components critical to the production of the Company&#8217;s vehicles, such as engines, are purchased from a select number of suppliers. The Company also purchases raw and fabricated steel as well as commercial chassis from multiple sources. 

The Company believes it has adequate supplies or sources of availability of the raw materials and components necessary to meet its needs. However, there are risks and uncertainties with respect to the supply of certain raw materials and components that could impact their price, quality and availability in sufficient quantities. 

Competition 

Within the Environmental Solutions Group, Elgin is recognized as a market leader among several domestic sweeper competitors and differentiates itself primarily on product performance. The Vactor and Guzzler brands each maintain a leading domestic position in their respective marketplaces by enhancing product performance with leading technology and application flexibility. Jetstream is a market leader in the in-plant cleaning segment of the U.S. waterblast industry, competing on product performance, rapid delivery and solutions services. 

Within specific product categories and domestic markets, the businesses within the Safety and Security Systems Group are among the leaders with between one and four significant competitors and additional ancillary market participants. The Group&#8217;s international market position varies from leader to ancillary participant depending on the geographic region and product line. Generally, competition is intense within all of the Group&#8217;s product lines and purchase decisions are made based on competitive bidding, price, features, reputation, performance and service. 

Research and Development 

The Company invests in research to support the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products and services. The Company believes this investment is important to maintain and/or enhance its leadership position in key markets. Expenditures for research and development by the Company were $14.0 million &#32;in 2015 , $13.1 million &#32;in 2014 &#32;and $11.0 million &#32;in 2013 , and were reported within Selling, engineering, general and administrative (&#8220;SEG&#38;A&#8221;) expenses on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. 

Patents and Trademarks 

The Company owns a number of patents and possesses rights under others to which it attaches importance, but it does not believe that its business as a whole is materially dependent upon any such patents or rights. The Company also owns a number of trademarks, including those listed within the &#8220; Narrative Description of Business &#8221; section above. We believe these trademarks are important in connection with the identification of our products and associated goodwill with customers, but no material part of the Company&#8217;s business is dependent on our trademarks. 

Employees 

The Company employed approximately 2,200 people in its businesses at December 31, 2015 &#32;with the Company&#8217;s U.S. hourly workers accounting for approximately 48% of its total workforce. Approximately 24% of the Company&#8217;s U.S. hourly workers were represented by unions at December 31, 2015 . We believe that our labor relations with our employees are good. 

Governmental Regulation of the Environment 

The Company believes it substantially complies with federal, state and local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. Capital expenditures in 2015 &#32;attributable to compliance with such laws were not material. The Company believes that the overall impact of compliance with environmental regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flow. 

In May 2012, the Company sold a facility in Pearland, Texas. The facility was previously used by the Company&#8217;s discontinued Pauluhn business, which manufactured marine, offshore and industrial lighting products. While the Company has not finalized its plans, it is probable that the site will require remediation. As of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , $0.9 million &#32;and $1.3 million , respectively, of reserves related to the environmental remediation of the Pearland facility are included in liabilities of discontinued operations on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company&#8217;s estimate may change as more information becomes available; however, the costs are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s results of operations, financial position or cash flow. 

Seasonality 

Certain of the Company businesses are susceptible to the influences of seasonal buying or delivery patterns. The Company tends to have lower sales in the first quarter compared to other quarters as a result of these influences.
