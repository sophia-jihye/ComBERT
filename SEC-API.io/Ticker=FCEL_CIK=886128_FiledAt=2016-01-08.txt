Although we believe that the market research, industry publications and other publicly available information are reliable, including the sources that we cite in this report, they have not been independently verified by us and, accordingly, we cannot assure you that such information is accurate in all material respects. Our estimates, particularly as they relate to our general expectations concerning the electric power supply industry and the distributed generation market, involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors, including those discussed under Item 1A - Risk Factors of this report. 

As used in this report, all degrees refer to Fahrenheit (&#8220;F&#8221;); kilowatt (&#8220;kW&#8221;) and megawatt (&#8220;MW&#8221;) numbers designate nominal or rated capacity of the referenced power plant; &#8220;efficiency&#8221; or &#8220;electrical efficiency&#8221; means the ratio of the electrical energy generated in the conversion of a fuel to the total energy contained in the fuel (lower heating value, the standard for power plant generation, assumes the water in the product is in vapor form; as opposed to higher heating value, which assumes the water in the product is in liquid form, net of parasitic load); &#8220;overall energy efficiency&#8221; refers to efficiency based on the electrical output plus useful heat output of the power plant; kW means 1,000 watts; MW means 1,000,000 watts; &#8220;kilowatt hour&#8221; (&#8220;kWh&#8221;) is equal to 1kW of power supplied to or taken from an electric circuit steadily for one hour; and one British Thermal Unit (&#8220;Btu&#8221;) is equal to the amount of heat necessary to raise one pound of pure water from 59 o F to 60 o F at a specified constant pressure. 

All dollar amounts are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted. 

Additional Technical Terms and Definitions &#32; 

Availability &#32;- A measure of the amount of time a system is available to operate, as a fraction of total calendar time. For power generation equipment, an industry standard (IEEE (The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) 762, &#8220;Definitions for Use in Reporting Electric Generating Unit Reliability, Availability and Productivity&#8221;) is used to compute availability. &#8220;Availability percentage&#8221; is calculated as total period hours since commercial acceptance date (mutually agreed upon time period when our Direct FuelCell power plants have operated at a specific output level for a specified period of time) less hours not producing electricity due to planned and unplanned maintenance divided by total period hours. Grid disturbances, force majeure events and site specific issues such as a lack of available fuel supply or customer infrastructure repair do not penalize the calculation of availability according to this standard. 

Baseload &#32;- Consistent power generation that is available to meet electricity demands around-the-clock. This differs from peak or peaking power generation that is designed to be turned on or off quickly to meet sudden changes in electricity demand, or intermittent power generation such as solar or wind. 

Carbonate Fuel Cell (CFC) &#32;- Carbonate fuel cells, such as the fuel cell power plants produced and sold by FuelCell Energy, are high-temperature fuel cells that use an electrolyte composed of a molten carbonate salt mixture suspended in a porous, chemically inert ceramic-based matrix. CFC's operate at high temperatures, enabling the use of a nickel-based catalyst, a lower cost alternative to precious metal catalysts used in some other fuel cell technologies. 

Combined Heat &#38; Power (CHP) &#32;- A power plant configuration or mode of operation featuring simultaneous on-site generation from the same unit of fuel of both electricity and heat with the byproduct heat used to produce steam, hot water or heated air for both heating and cooling applications. 

Direct FuelCell &#174; &#32;(DFC &#174; ) &#32;- Trademarked product name of FuelCell Energy commercial carbonate fuel cell plants that references the internal reforming process within the fuel cell of a hydrogen-rich fuel source such as natural gas. 

Distributed Generation (DG) &#32;- Electric power that is generated where it is needed (distributed throughout the power grid) rather than from a central location. Centrally generated power requires extensive transmission networks that require maintenance and experience efficiency losses during transmission while distributed generation does not. Distributed generation is small to mid- 

size power plants, typically 75 megawatts or less. Central generation is large power plants generating hundreds or even thousands of megawatts. 

Micro-grid &#32;- Micro-grids are localized electric grids that can disconnect from the traditional electric grid to operate autonomously and strengthen grid resiliency. Micro grids can be composed only of DFC plants due to their continual power output or combine a variety of different types of power generation such as fuel cells and solar arrays. 

Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) &#32;- Generic term for a group of highly reactive gases, all of which contain nitrogen and oxygen in varying amounts. Many of the NOx are colorless and odorless; however they are a major precursor to smog production and acid rain. However, one common pollutant, Nitrogen Dioxide, along with particles in the air, can often be seen as a reddish-brown layer over many urban areas. NOx form when fuel is burned at high temperatures, as in a combustion process. The primary manmade sources of NOx are motor vehicles, electric utilities, and other industrial, commercial and residential sources that burn fuels. 

Particulate Matter &#32;- Solid or liquid particles emitted into the air that is generally caused by the combustion of materials or dust generating activities. Particulate matter caused by combustion can be harmful to humans as the fine particles of chemicals, acids and metals may get lodged in lung tissue. 

Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) - A Power Purchase Agreement is a financing structure that enables a power user to purchase energy under a long-term contract where they agree to pay a predetermined rate for the kilowatt-hours delivered from a power generating asset while avoiding the need to own the equipment and pay the upfront capital cost. The length of the contract varies, typically ranging from 10 to 20 years. The PPA rate is typically fixed (with an escalation clause tied to consumer price index or similar index), or pegged to a floating index that is on par with or below the current electricity rate being charged by the local utility company. 

Reforming &#32;- Catalytic conversion of hydrocarbon fuel (such as natural gas or renewable biogas) to hydrogen-rich gas. The hydrogen-rich gas serves as a fuel for the electrochemical fuel cell power generation reaction. 

Renewable Biogas - Renewable biogas is fuel produced by biological breakdown of organic material. Biogas is commonly produced in biomass digesters employing bacteria in a heated and controlled oxygen environment. These digesters are typically used at wastewater treatment facilities or food processors to breakdown solid waste and the biogas is produced as a byproduct of the waste digestion. Biomass may be generated in digesters from agricultural waste, or it can be produced in less controlled fashion by breakdown of waste in landfills. These biogas fuels can be used as a renewable fuel source for Direct FuelCells located on site where the biogas is produced with minimal gas cleanup, or they can be processed further to meet pipeline fuel standards and injected into a gas pipeline network, which is termed Directed Biogas. 

Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) &#32;- Solid oxide fuel cells use a hard, non-porous ceramic compound as the electrolyte. Solid oxide fuel cells operate at very high temperatures eliminating the need for costly precious-metal catalysts, thereby reducing cost. The high temperature enables internal reforming of the hydrogen rich fuel source. 

Sulfur Oxide (SOx) &#32;- Sulfur oxide refers to any one of the following: sulfur monoxide, sulfur dioxide (SO2) and sulfur trioxide. SO2 is a byproduct of various industrial processes. Coal and petroleum contain sulfur compounds, and generate SO2 when burned. Sox compounds are particulate and acid rain precursors. 

Overview 

We are an integrated fuel cell company with an expanding global presence on three continents. We design, manufacture, sell, install, operate and service ultra-clean, highly efficient stationary fuel cell power plants for distributed power generation. Our power plants provide megawatt-class scalable on-site power and utility grid support, helping customers solve their energy, environmental and business challenges. Our plants are operating in more than 50 locations on three continents and have generated more than four billion kilowatt hours (kWh) of electricity, which is equivalent to powering more than 391,000 average size U.S. homes for one year. Our growing installed base and backlog exceeds 300 megawatts (MW). 

We provide comprehensive turn-key power generation solutions to our customers, including power plant installations as well as power plant operation and maintenance under multi-year service agreements. We both develop projects and sell direct to the end-user of the power and utilities, either the full turn-key solution or the fuel cell equipment only. For projects that we develop, the end-user of the power enters into a PPA and based on the project and credit profile, we either identify a project investor to purchase the power plant, selling the power and heat under the PPA. We target large-scale power users with our megawatt-class installations. To provide a frame-of-reference, one megawatt is adequate to power approximately 1,000 average sized U.S. homes. Our customer base includes utility companies, municipalities, universities, government entities and a variety of industrial and commercial 

enterprises. Our leading geographic markets are South Korea and the United States and we are pursuing expanding opportunities in Asia, Europe, and Canada. 

Our value proposition provides highly efficient and environmentally friendly power generation with easy-to-site stationary fuel cell power plants. The power plants are located in populated areas as they are virtually pollutant free, operate quietly and without vibrations, and have only modest space requirements. Locating power generation near the point of use reduces reliance on the transmission grid, leading to enhanced energy security and power reliability. Utilities can minimize or even avoid the cost and permitting of transmission by adopting distributed generation. Our power plants provide electricity priced competitively to grid-delivered electricity in certain high cost regions and our strategy is to continue to reduce costs, which is expected to lead to wider adoption. 

Utilizing our core DFC plants, we are commercializing both a tri-generation distributed hydrogen configuration that generates electricity, heat and hydrogen for industrial or transportation uses, and carbon capture for coal or gas-fired power plants. We also are developing and commercializing SOFC for adjacent sub-megawatt applications to the markets for our megawatt-class DFC power plants as well as energy storage applications. The market potential for these products is sizeable and these applications are complementary to our core products, as they leverage our existing customer base, project development, sales and service expertise. 

FuelCell Energy was founded in Connecticut in 1969 as an applied research organization, providing contract research and development. The Company went public in 1992, raising capital to develop and commercialize fuel cells, and reincorporated in Delaware in 1999. We began selling stationary fuel cell power plants commercially in 2003. Today we develop turn-key distributed power generation solutions and provide comprehensive service for the life of the asset. 

Markets 

Vertical Markets 

Access to clean, affordable, continuous and reliable power defines modern lifestyles. The ability to provide power cleanly and efficiently is taking on greater importance and urgency in many regions of the world. Central generation and its associated transmission and distribution grid is difficult to site, costly, and generally takes many years to permit and build. Some types of power generation that were widely adopted in the past, such as nuclear power or coal-fired power plants, are no longer welcome in certain regions. The cost and impact to public health and the environment of pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions impacts the siting of new power generation. The attributes of DFC power plants address these challenges by providing virtually emission-free power and heat at the point of use in a highly efficient process that is affordable to rate-payers. 

We have two primary markets for our products. The first is Ultra-Clean Power consisting of our products operating on clean natural gas or directed biogas across seven distinct and diversified vertical markets. The second primary market is Renewable Power with our products operating on renewable biogas across four distinct and diversified vertical markets. These are summarized as follows: 

&#32;&#32;&#32; &#160; &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32; 

&#32;Ultra-Clean Power markets: &#160; &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;Renewable Power markets: 

1) Utilities and Independent Power Producers (IPP) 1) Wastewater 

2) Education and Healthcare 2) Food and Beverage 

3) Gas Transmission 3) Agriculture 

4) Industrial and Data Centers 4) Landfill Gas 

5) Commercial and Hospitality 

6) Oil Production and Refining 

7) Government 

The utilities and Independent Power Producers segment is our largest vertical market with customers that include utilities on both the East and West coast of the USA such as Dominion (NYSE: D), one of the largest utilities in the USA, Avangrid Holdings (NYSE: AGR), and NRG Energy (NYSE: NRG), the largest IPP in the USA. In Europe, utility customers include EON Connecting Energies (DAX: EOAN), one of the largest utilities in the world, and Switzerland based ewz. The greatest number of installed DFC plants is in South Korea primarily supplying that nation's electric grid, with the fuel cells' heat typically used in district heating systems to heat and cool nearby facilities. Our partner in South Korea is POSCO Energy Co., LTD. (POSCO Energy), a subsidiary of South Korean-based POSCO (NYSE: PKX), one of the world's largest steel manufacturers. 

Our DFC power plants are producing power for a variety of industrial, commercial, municipal and government customers including manufacturing, food processing plants, universities, healthcare facilities and wastewater treatment facilities. These institutions 

desire efficient, ultra-clean baseload power to reduce operating expenses, reduce greenhouse gas emissions to meet their sustainability goals, and achieve secure and reliable on-site power. Our products can utilize either renewable biogas generated by the customer on-site or directed biogas, generated at a distant location and transported via the existing gas network. 

Wastewater treatment facilities, food and beverage processors, and agricultural operations produce biogas as a byproduct of their operations. Disposing of this greenhouse gas can be harmful to the environment if released into the atmosphere or flared. Our DFC power plants convert this biogas into electricity and heat efficiently and economically. By doing so, DFC plants transform waste disposal challenges into clean energy solutions. The wastewater vertical market is the largest biogas market for DFC power plants. Since our fuel cells operate on the renewable biogas produced by the wastewater treatment process and their heat is used to support daily operations at the wastewater treatment facility, the overall thermal efficiency of these installations is very attractive, supporting economics and sustainability. A 2.8 MW DFC3000 power plant operating on renewable biogas at a waste water treatment facility in California is the world&#8217;s largest fuel cell plant utilizing on-site renewable biogas. 

We estimate that the distributed generation market and geographies in which we compete is approximately an $18 billion opportunity, composed of $7 billion of power plant sales and $11 billion of associated service agreements. We estimate that the market for distributed hydrogen in the geographies where we compete is approximately a $7 billion opportunity, oriented towards industrial applications at this point in time with transportation application opportunities expanding in the future. We estimate that the market for carbon capture configured fuel cell power plants for coal and gas-fired central generation is approximately $25 billion assuming only a 1% penetration rate and only 5% carbon capture within the geographies where we do business. 

As renewable technologies such as wind and solar power are deployed more widely, the need for a clean, continuous power generation that complements and balances these intermittent sources becomes greater to maintain grid stability. Our installed base includes a number of locations where our customers use DFC plants for meeting power needs that complements their intermittent wind and/or solar power generation. 

Geographic Markets 

We target geographic markets with high urban density that value clean distributed generation. We are pursuing a density strategy, targeting markets with the potential for recurring order flow that justify investment in local service infrastructure. Our target markets currently have regulatory and legislative policy support such as clean air requirements and economic incentives to support the adoption of clean and renewable distributed power generation. Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) is a mechanism designed to promote the adoption of renewable power generation and is one market enabler for demand of our power generation solutions. Fuel cells can play a role in meeting RPS clean power mandates by generating highly efficient, clean electricity continuously and near the point of use. 

United States: &#32;We have active business development activities in the Northeast and on the West Coast where high population density, higher energy costs, the need for distributed generation solutions with a small footprint, and public policy value our product offerings. Most of our installed base in the USA is located in California and Connecticut, both of which have enacted RPS programs. As states look to meet their RPS requirements and utilities further deploy distributed generation to meet consumer demand and improve the resiliency of their service network, we see significant opportunities to grow our U.S. footprint. Trends away from central generation to a distributed generation model are supportive of demand and our initiatives to continue to improve affordability are expected to lead to increased adoption. Both our standard DFC plants and the carbon capture configuration can support the Environmental Protection Agency Clean Power Plan, announced in mid-2015. 

South Korea and the Broader Asia Market: &#32; High efficiency fuel cells are well-suited for South Korea due to the need to import fuel for power generation, ease of siting in populated areas, and high urban density that makes siting transmission more difficult. Intermittent renewable technologies such as solar and wind are not as well suited due to the geography (high urban densities limit available land for power generation) and climate/topography. The South Korean government has made clean distributed generation power sources a priority to support its growing power needs while minimizing additional investment and congestion of the transmission grid. Fuel cells address these needs and have been designated a key economic driver for the country due to their ultra-clean emissions, high efficiency and reliable distributed generation capabilities that are helping South Korea achieve its RPS and electricity generation goals. 

The RPS in South Korea requires an increase of new and renewable power generation to 10% by 2024 from 2% in 2012. The program mandates the addition of 0.5% of renewable power generation per year through 2016, which equates to approximately 350 megawatts, increasing to 1% per year through 2022 or approximately 700 megawatts per year. Fuel cells operating on natural gas and biogas qualify under the mandates of the program. 

Select Asian markets with high urban densities, lack of domestic fuel sources, movement away from nuclear power, and a need for cleaner power to reduce smog represent market opportunities. Highly efficient fuel cells maximize power output from high cost imported fuel, and do so without the need to add costly transmission. 

Europe: &#32;&#32;The European power generation market values distributed generation, efficiency and low emissions and represents opportunity for stationary fuel cell power plants, particularly Germany, as it transitions away from nuclear power generation and struggles to integrate a significant amount of intermittent power generation capacity; the United Kingdom, as it works to achieve aggressive carbon reduction goals; Italy with growing adoption of distributed generation; and other West European countries. FuelCell Energy Solutions, GmbH (FCES), with its German manufacturing base, is the sales, manufacturing and service business for the European Served Area for FuelCell Energy, Inc. FCES is a joint venture that is 89% owned by FuelCell Energy and 11% owned by German-based Fraunhofer Institute for Ceramic Technologies and Systems IKTS (Fraunhofer IKTS). Fraunhofer IKTS focuses on the development of new energy supply systems using ceramic system components, including fuel cells. As discussed in greater detail in the following section, Fraunhofer IKTS has expertise in fuel cell technology and is assisting with the development of the European market for our products. 

Strategic Alliances 

We leverage our core capabilities by forging strategic alliances with carefully selected business partners that bring power generation experience, financial resources, and market access. Our partners typically have extensive experience in developing and selling power generation products. We believe our strength in the development of fuel cell products; coupled with our partners' understanding of broad range of markets and customers, products and services, enhances the sales and development of our products, as well as providing endorsement of our power generation solutions. Our global business partners include: 

NRG Energy: &#32;&#32;In 2013, we entered into a teaming and co-marketing agreement with NRG Energy (NYSE: NRG), encompassing both direct sales to NRG Energy customers in North America as well as sales to NRG Energy, who will own the fuel cell power plants and sell the power and heat to the end user under power purchase agreements. NRG owns approximately 1.4 million shares of our common stock or approximately 5% of our outstanding shares, extends a $40 million revolving construction and term financing facility to FuelCell Finance, our wholly-owned subsidiary, and a senior NRG executive is a member of the FuelCell Energy Board of Directors. NRG is the largest IPP in the U.S. with approximately 50,000 megawatts of generation capacity and almost three million retail and commercial customers. We are actively marketing with NRG Energy to their existing customer base. 

POSCO Energy : &#32;We partner with POSCO Energy, an IPP with 2014 annual revenues of approximately $2.2 billion and a subsidiary of South Korean-based POSCO, one of the world's largest steel manufacturers (NYSE: PKX), with 2014 annual revenue of approximately $60 billion. POSCO Energy owns 2.6 million of our common shares or approximately 10% of our outstanding shares. POSCO Energy has extensive experience in power plant project development, owning and operating power plants in multiple countries and is the largest independent power producer in South Korea. 

Our relationship with POSCO Energy has expanded to support growing market demand for clean distributed generation. The relationship began in 2003 with the sale of a sub-megawatt demonstration plant and South Korea is now our largest market, including a 59 megawatt facility, the world&#8217;s largest fuel cell park consisting of 21 DFC3000 power plants. POSCO Energy is a licensed manufacturer for Asia of our products and collaborates with the Company on many market and product development initiatives.

Fraunhofer IKTS, with its staff of approximately 600 engineers, scientists and technicians, is a world leading institute in the field of advanced ceramics for high tech applications, including fuel cells. The parent organization, Fraunhofer, was founded in 1949 and is Europe's largest application-oriented research organization with an annual research budget of &#8364;2 billion (approximately $2.4 billion) and approximately 24,000 staff, primarily scientists and engineers. Fraunhofer maintains 66 research centers and representative offices in Europe, USA, Asia and the Middle East. 

Fraunhofer IKTS contributed proprietary carbonate fuel cell technology and patents to FCES. In addition, Fraunhofer IKTS is contributing their expertise and extensive research and development capabilities with fuel cells and materials science as well as sharing their industry and government relationships. 

E.ON Connecting Energies GmbH &#32;: During fiscal year 2015, we executed a Project Development Agreement with E.ON Connecting Energies GmbH to offer decentralized CHP solutions with megawatt and multi-megawatt fuel cell power plants to EON&#8217;s existing and prospective customer base, via a power purchase agreement financing or leasing structure. The first sale announced under this agreement was a CHP configured fuel cell plant installation at a German manufacturing company. E.ON 

will own the power plant and FuelCell Energy Solutions will install, operate and maintain the plant under a long-term service agreement. With approximately 59,000 megawatts of power generation assets, a presence in more than 14 countries, and more than 58,000 employees, E.ON is one of the world&#8217;s largest utilities. 

Business Strategy 

Our business model consists of growing and expanding diverse revenue streams, selectively utilizing strategic partnerships for market development and cost reductions, protecting and leveraging intellectual property to generate value, and identifying and developing new markets for our core technology. Revenue streams include power plant and component sales, engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) revenue, royalty and license revenue, service revenue including long term service agreements and the sale of power under PPA's, and revenue from public and private industry research contracts under Advanced Technologies. 

Our Company vision is to provide ultra-clean, highly efficient, reliable distributed power generation at a cost per kilowatt hour that is less than the cost of grid-delivered electricity in our target markets. We have a clear path to attaining this vision through increased market adoption &#32;and continued reduction in the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) &#32;for our fuel cell projects. We believe our vision can be achieved more broadly and without incentives, at a global production volume of approximately 210 megawatts annually. 

Market adoption 

We target vertical markets and geographic regions that value clean distributed generation, are located where there is a premium to the cost of grid-delivered electricity, and are aligned with regulatory frameworks that harmonize energy, economic and environmental policies. Our business model addresses all three of these policy areas with highly efficient and affordable distributed generation that offers local job creation potential and delivers de-centralized power in a low-carbon, virtually pollutant-free manner. Geographic markets that meet these criteria and where we are already well established include South Korea, the Northeast USA and California. We have also installed and are operating plants in the United Kingdom, Germany, and Switzerland and are pursuing further opportunities in Western Europe and certain other states in the USA. We selectively partner with some of the leading power generation companies in our target markets to facilitate demand and deploy our projects. 

While the Company has made significant progress with reducing costs and creating markets since the commercialization of our products in 2003, we face two primary challenges in growing the adoption of our distributed power generation solutions, which are (1) the need to further reduce the total cost of ownership, and (2) the continued education and acknowledgment of the value that our solutions can provide. The business model for the generation and delivery of electricity for over a century has been central generation, which is large scale power generation in distant locations away from urban areas with transmission and distribution to the end users. While distributed generation has the potential to disrupt existing utility models, it is being embraced in an increasing number of markets to improve grid operations. We work with utilities and IPPs to demonstrate how our solutions complement central generation by incrementally adding clean power generation when and where needed. It takes time to build awareness with prospective customers and develop an operating history. We believe that we have a strong business model and strategy, demonstrated project development execution and plant operating performance and committed partners which will enable the Company to overcome these challenges and grow into a sustainable business. 

Levelized Cost of Energy 

Our fuel cell projects are delivering power at a rate comparable to pricing from the grid in our targeted markets. Federal and state level programs that help to support adoption of clean distributed power generation lead to below-grid pricing. We measure power costs by calculating the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) over the life of the project. In order to broaden the appeal of our products, we need to further reduce our LCOE to be below the grid without incentives. 

The Company is integrated across substantially the entire value chain for our projects. We design and own our proprietary fuel cell technology, we sell direct and through partners, we develop and execute comprehensive fuel cell turn-key projects, and manufacture, install, operate and service our plants. Given this level of integration, there are multiple areas and opportunities for cost reductions. There are four primary elements to LCOE for our fuel cell projects, including 1) Capital Cost, 2) Operations and Maintenance, 3) Fuel, and 4) Cost of Capital. We are actively managing and reducing costs in all four areas as follows: 

&#8226; 

Capital Cost &#32;- Capital costs of our projects include cost to manufacture, install, interconnect, and to provide any on-site application requirements such as configuring for a micro-grid and/or heating and cooling applications. We have reduced the product cost of our megawatt-class power plants by more than 60% from the first commercial installation in 2003 through our ongoing product cost reduction program, which involves every aspect of our business including engineering, procurement and manufacturing. Further cost reductions will be primarily obtained from reducing the per-unit cost of materials purchasing from higher volumes, supported by continued actions with engineering and manufacturing cost reductions. We recently 

integrated a global supply chain with our Asian partner, POSCO Energy so as Asian production leads to increased levels of purchasing from the integrated global supply chain, both FuelCell Energy and POSCO Energy will benefit with reductions in LCOE by obtaining lower pricing tiers from suppliers from the greater combined purchasing volume. On-site, our experienced Engineering, Procurement and Construction (&#8220;EPC&#8221;) team has substantial experience in working with contractors and local utilities to safely and efficiently execute our projects and we expect continued cost reduction in this area with experience and continued transition to multi-MW fuel cell parks. In addition to these cost reduction efforts, our technology roadmap includes plans to increase the output of our power plants which will add further value for our customers and reduce LCOE. 

&#8226; 

Operations and Maintenance &#32;- We provide services to remotely monitor, operate, and maintain customer power plants to meet specified performance levels. Operations and maintenance (O&#38;M) is a key driver for power plants to deliver on projected electrical output and revenues for our customers. Many of our service agreements include guarantees for system performance levels including electrical output. While the electrical and mechanical balance of plant (BOP) in our DFC power plants is designed to last over 25 years, the fuel cell modules are currently scheduled for replacement every five years, the price of which is included in our service agreements. Customers benefit from predictable savings and financial returns over the life of the contract and minimal risk. Our goal is to optimize our customers&#8217; power plants to meet expected operating parameters throughout the plant&#8217;s operational life. We expect to continually drive down the cost of O&#38;M with an expanding fleet which will leverage our investments in this area. Additionally, we are actively developing fuel cells that have a longer life which will reduce O&#38;M costs by increasing our scheduled module replacement period to seven years. 

&#8226; 

Fuel - Our fuel cells directly convert chemical energy (fuel) into electricity, heat, water and in certain configurations, other value streams such as high purity hydrogen. Because fuel cells generate power electrochemically rather than by combusting (burning) fuels, they are more efficient in extracting energy from fuels and produce less carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and only trace levels of pollutants compared to combustion-type power generation. Our power plants operate on a variety of existing and readily available fuels including natural gas, renewable biogas, directed biogas and propane. Our core DFC power plants deliver electrical efficiencies of 47% and hybrid applications and advanced configurations are capable of delivering electrical efficiencies of 60% or greater. In a CHP configuration, our plants can deliver up to 90% total system efficiency, depending on the application. Increasing electrical efficiency and reducing fuel costs is a key element of our operating cost reduction efforts. 

&#8226; 

Cost of Capital &#32;- Most of our MW scale projects are financed either by the off-taker that owns the asset or a project investor that owns the asset and sells energy to the off-taker. Other ownership models include utility ownership where the fuel cell project is added to the utility rate-base, direct ownership by the end-user of the power, or we hold a project that we developed, retaining the revenue and associated margins from the sale of power and heat. We are witnessing greater interest in the pay-as-you-go approach by end users that prefer to avoid the up-front investment in power generation assets. Our ability to provide the end-user with financing options or to retain projects that we develop helps to accelerate order flow. Our projects create predictable recurring revenue that is not dependent on weather or time of the day, investment tax credits, accelerated tax depreciation or other incentives. Credit risk is mitigated by contracting with customers with strong credit. In addition, we offer meaningful system-level output performance guarantees over the life of our projects. As a result, cost of capital for our projects has declined over time given our operating experience. With continued execution, we expect our ability to attract bank credit, financial and project performance credibility to continue to improve which we expect will lead to further decreases in financing costs. 

Today, on an unsubsidized basis , our LCOE is approximately $0.12/kWh with natural gas at $4.50MMBtu or $0.11/kWh at $2.50/MMBtu; each $2/MMBtu change equates to about $0.01/kWh. When combined with incentives, this price is competitive in our target markets and creates an attractive value proposition for our customers. The LCOE is approximately 1/3 fuel costs, 1/3 for both cost of capital and capital costs, and 1/3 for operations and maintenance. As a result of our cost reduction and growth strategies, we are working to reduce our LCOE without incentives to $0.09-$0.11/kWh when the combined global production volume reaches 210 MW annually, assuming natural gas prices of $4.00 to $6.00 per million Btu. We expect LCOE reductions to be similar on a percentage basis in Europe and Asia. A LCOE in the range of $0.09-$0.11/kWh will enable pricing below the electric grid without incentives, which we expect will accelerate adoption and broaden potential target markets. 

Our core fuel cell platform is versatile and part of our strategy is finding new applications for our power generation solution. Advanced Technology Programs, discussed in a following section, identifies and obtains private and government funding sources to commercialize new applications of the power plants, such as distributed hydrogen and carbon capture. Energy storage applications are also being pursued utilizing both carbonate and solid oxide fuel cell technology. 

Products 

Our core fuel cell products (Direct FuelCell &#174; &#32;or DFC &#174; &#32;power plants) offer ultra-clean, highly efficient power generation for customers including the 2.8 MW DFC3000 &#174; , the 1.4 MW DFC1500 &#174; &#32;and the 300 kW DFC300 &#174; &#32;plus derivations of this core DFC product for specific applications. The plants are scalable for multi-megawatt utility scale applications or on-site CHP generation for a broad range of applications. We can provide a comprehensive and complete turn-key fuel cell project that includes project development, engineering procurement and construction (EPC) services, O&#38;M and project finance. 

Our proprietary DFC technology generates electricity directly from a fuel, such as natural gas or renewable biogas, by reforming the fuel inside the fuel cell to produce hydrogen, which is why it is called a Direct FuelCell. This &#8220;one-step&#8221; reforming process results in a simpler, more efficient, and cost-effective energy conversion system compared with external reforming fuel cells. Additionally, natural gas has an established infrastructure and is readily available in our existing and target markets. The Direct FuelCell operates at approximately 1,200&#176; Fahrenheit. An advantage of high temperature fuel cells is that they do not require the use of precious metal electrodes required by lower temperature fuel cells, such as proton exchange membrane (PEM) and phosphoric acid. As a result, we are able to use less expensive and readily available industrial metals as catalysts for our fuel cell components. In addition, our DFC fuel cell produces high quality byproduct heat (700&#176;F) that can be utilized for CHP applications using hot water, steam or chiller water for facility heating and cooling. 

The DFC product line is a global platform based on carbonate fuel cell technology. Utilizing a standard design globally enables volume-based cost reduction and optimal resource utilization. Our power plants utilize a variety of available fuels to produce electricity electrochemically, in a process that is highly efficient, quiet, and due to the avoidance of combustion, produces virtually no pollutants. Thus, our plants generate more power and fewer emissions for a given unit of fuel than combustion-based power generation of a similar size, making them economical and environmentally responsible power generation solutions. In addition to electricity, our standard configuration produces high quality heat, suitable for making steam or hot water for facility use as well as absorption cooling. System efficiencies can reach up to 90%, depending on the application, when configured for CHP. 

We market different configurations of the DFC plants to meet specific market needs, including: 

&#8226; 

On-Site Power (Behind the Meter): &#32;&#32;Customers benefit from improved power reliability and energy security from on-site power that reduces reliance on the electric grid. Utilization of the high quality heat produced by the fuel cell in a CHP configuration supports economics and sustainability goals by lessening or even avoiding the need for combustion-based boilers for heat and their associated cost, pollutants and carbon emissions. On-site CHP power projects generally range in size from a single 1.4 MW DFC1500 to combining multiple 2.8 MW DRC3000 power plants for projects up to about 14 MW in size. 

&#8226; 

Utility Grid Support: &#32;The DFC power plants are scalable, which enables siting multiple fuel cell power plants together in a fuel cell park. Fuel cell parks enable utilities to add clean and continuous power generation when and where needed and enhance the resiliency of the electric grid by reducing reliance on large central generation plants and the associated transmission grid. Consolidating certain steps for multiple plants, such as fuel processing, reduces the cost per megawatt hour for fuel cell parks compared to individual fuel cell power plants. Fuel cell park examples include a five plant, 14.9 MW fuel cell park in Bridgeport, Connecticut that is supplying the electric grid, and multiple fuel cell parks in South Korea in excess of 10 megawatts each that supply power to the electric grid and high quality heat to district heating systems, such as a 59 MW installation which is consisting of 21 power plants, the world&#8217;s largest. By producing power near the point of use, our fuel cells help to ease congestion of the electric grid and can also enable the smart grid via distributed generation combined with the continuous monitoring and operation by our service organization. Thus, our solutions can avoid or reduce investment in new central generation and transmission infrastructure which is costly, difficult to site and expensive to maintain. Deploying our DFC power plants throughout a utility service territory can also help utilities comply with government-mandated clean energy regulations and meet air quality standards. A 10 MW fuel cell park only requires about one acre of land whereas an equivalent size solar array requires up to ten times as much land, illustrating how fuel cell parks are easy to site in high density areas with constrained land resources, and adjacent to the demand source thereby avoiding costly transmission construction. Our products can be part of a total on-site power generation solution with our high efficiency products providing continuous power, and can be combined with intermittent power generation, such as solar or wind, or less efficient combustion-based equipment that provides peaking or load following power. The DFC plants can also be configured as a micro-grid, either independently or with other forms of power generation. We possess the capabilities to model, design and operate the micro grid and have multiple examples of our DFC plants operating within micro-grids, some individually and some with other forms of power generation. 

&#8226; 

Higher Electrical Efficiency - Multi-megawatt applications: &#32;&#32;The HEFC&#8482; (High Efficiency Fuel Cell) system is configured with a series of three fuel cell modules that operate in sequence, yielding a higher electrical efficiency than the standard DFC3000 configuration of two fuel cell modules operating in parallel. The heat energy and unused hydrogen from two fuel cell modules is supplied to the third module, along with some natural gas to generate additional electricity. The HEFC 

configuration is designed to extract more electrical power from each unit of fuel with electrical efficiency of approximately 60%. The HEFC system is targeted at applications with large load requirements and limited waste heat utilization such as utility/grid support or data centers. 

&#8226; 

Gas Pipeline Applications : DFC-ERG&#174; (Direct FuelCell Energy Recovery Generation TM ) (DFC-ERG) power plants are used in natural gas pipeline applications, harnessing energy that is otherwise lost during the station&#8217;s natural gas pressure-reduction (&#8220;letdown&#8221;) process. Also, thermal energy produced as a byproduct of the fuel cell&#8217;s operation supports the letdown process, improving the station&#8217;s carbon footprint and enhancing the project&#8217;s economics. Depending on the specific gas flows and application, the DFC-ERG configuration is capable of achieving electrical efficiencies up to 70%. A 3.4 megawatt DFC-ERG system is being installed in Connecticut, purchased by UIL Holdings. 

&#8226; 

Carbon Capture: &#32;&#32;The DFC carbon capture system separates CO 2 &#32;from the flue gases of natural gas or coal-fired power plants or industrial facilities while producing ultra-clean power. Exhaust flue gas from the coal/gas plant is supplied to the cathode side of the fuel cell, instead of ambient air. The CO 2 &#32;in the exhaust is transferred to the anode side of the fuel cell, where it is much more concentrated and easy to separate. The CO 2 &#32;from the anode exhaust stream is liquefied using common chilling equipment. The purified CO 2 &#32;is then available for enhanced oil recovery, industrial applications or sequestration. Carbon concentration and capture within the carbonate fuel cell is a side reaction of the natural gas-fueled power generation process. Carbon capture systems can be implemented in increments, starting with as little as 5% capture with no appreciable change in the cost of power and with minimum capital outlay. Our solution generates a return on capital resulting from the fuel cell's production of electricity rather than increase in operating expense required by other carbon capture technologies, and can extend the life of existing coal-fired power plants, enabling low carbon utilization of domestic coal and gas resources. We are currently evaluating sites with coal plant operators for the first installation of a carbon capture configured DFC3000 power plant, which will be partially funded by the US Department of Energy under an award received in September of this year. 

&#8226; 

Distributed Hydrogen: &#32;&#32;The DFC fuel cells internally reform the fuel source (i.e. natural gas or biogas) to obtain hydrogen. DFC plants can be configured for tri-generation, supplying power, heat and high purity hydrogen. Power output is modestly reduced to support hydrogen generation that can then be used for industrial applications such as metal or glass processing, material handling applications or petrochemicals, or transportation applications. Siting the tri-generation fuel cell plant at a source of biogas such as wastewater treatment facilities, results in renewable hydrogen for transportation, an attractive proposition to regulatory and legislative officials and car companies. After operating two sub-megawatt systems - one for renewable vehicle fueling and one producing industrial hydrogen for our Torrington facility - we are now evaluating a variety of possible sites for the first commercial MW-scale application of the technology. 

We are offering a dispatchability option for utility-scale applications where some degree of power production cycling is valued on a pre-determined schedule to accommodate periods of lower power demand. Our power plants can also provide reactive power avoiding the need for separate static or dynamic VAR (volt-ampere reactive) compensation systems. 

In summary, our solutions offer many advantages: 

&#8226; 

Distributed generation: &#32;Generating power near the point of use improves power reliability and energy security and lessens the need for costly and difficult-to-site generation and transmission infrastructure, enhancing the resiliency of the grid. 

&#8226; 

Ultra-clean: &#32;Our DFC power plants produce electricity electrochemically &#8722; without combustion &#8722; directly from readily available fuels such as natural gas and renewable biogas in a highly efficient process. The virtual absence of pollutants facilitates siting the power plants in regions with clean air permitting regulations and is an important public health benefit. 

&#8226; 

High efficiency: &#32;Fuel cells are the most efficient power generation option in their size class, providing the most power from a given unit of fuel, reducing fuel costs. This high electrical efficiency also reduces carbon emissions compared to less efficient combustion-based power generation. 

&#8226; 

Combined heat and power: &#32;Our power plants provide both electricity and usable high quality heat/steam from the same unit of fuel. The heat can be used for facility heating and cooling or further enhancing the electrical efficiency of the power plant in a combined cycle configuration. When used in CHP configurations, system efficiencies can reach up to 90%, depending on the application. 

&#8226; 

Reliability / continuous operation: &#32;Our DFC power plants improve power reliability and energy security by lessening reliance on transmission and distribution infrastructure of the electric grid. Unlike solar and wind power, fuel cells are able to operate continuously regardless of weather or time of day. 

&#8226; 

Fuel flexibility: &#32;Our DFC power plants operate on a variety of existing and readily available fuels including natural gas, renewable biogas, directed biogas and propane. 

&#8226; 

Scalability: &#32;Our DFC power plants are scalable, providing a cost-effective solution to adding power incrementally as demand grows, such as multi-megawatt fuel cell parks supporting the electric grid. 

&#8226; 

Quiet operation: &#32;Because they produce power without combustion and contain very few moving parts, our DFC power plants operate quietly and without vibrations. 

&#8226; 

Easy to site: &#32;Our DFC power plants are relatively easy to site by virtue of their ultra-clean emissions profile, modest space requirements and quiet operation. Space requirements are about one tenth of the land required for a solar array offering a 

similar rated output. These characteristics facilitate the installation of the power plants in urban locations with scarce and expensive land. 

DFC Emissions Profile 

Fuel cells are devices that directly convert chemical energy (fuel) into electricity, heat and water. Because fuel cells generate power electrochemically rather than by combusting (burning) fuels, they are more efficient in extracting energy from fuels and produce less carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and only trace levels of pollutants compared to combustion-type power generation. The following table illustrates the favorable emission profile of our DFC and high efficiency power plants:

For power plants operating on natural gas, higher fuel efficiency results in lower CO 2 , and also results in less fuel needed per kWh of electricity generated and Btu of heat produced. The high efficiency of our products results in significantly less CO 2 &#32;per unit of power production compared to the average U.S. fossil fuel power plant, and the carbon emissions are reduced even further when configured for combined heat and power. When operating on renewable biogas, government agencies and regulatory bodies generally classify our power plants as carbon neutral due to the renewable nature of the fuel source. 

High electrical efficiency reduces customers' exposure to volatile fuel costs, minimizes operating costs, and provides maximum electrical output from a finite fuel source. Our power plants achieve electrical efficiencies of 47% to 60% or higher depending on configuration, location, and application, and up to 90% total efficiency in a CHP configuration, depending on the application. The electric grid in the United States is only approximately 36% electrically efficient and does not support CHP configurations. 

Manufacturing 

We design and manufacture the core DFC fuel cell components that are stacked on top of each other to build a fuel cell stack. For MW size power plants, four fuel cell stacks are combined to build a fuel cell module. To complete the power plant, the fuel cell module or modules are combined with the BOP. The mechanical BOP processes the incoming fuel such as natural gas or renewable biogas and includes various fuel handling and processing equipment such as pipes and blowers. The electrical BOP processes the power generated for use by the customer and includes electrical interface equipment such as an inverter. The BOP components are either purchased directly from suppliers or the manufacturing is outsourced based on our designs and specifications. This strategy allows us to leverage our manufacturing capacity, focusing on the critical aspects of the power plant where we have specialized knowledge and expertise. BOP components are shipped directly to a customer's site and are assembled with the fuel cell module into a complete power plant. 

Cell Manufacturing and Capacity 

Our strategy is to produce power for prices that are below typical grid prices. Without incentives, annual global production of approximately 210 MW will provide the needed cost reductions to support these price targets. Higher purchasing volume reduces the per unit cost of raw materials and componentry. As explained below, the North American production facility has an annual capacity of 100 MW with an expansion underway, and the Asian manufacturing, owned and operated by our partner, POSCO Energy, has 100 MW of annual capacity in a building that is sized for 200 MW annually. Our global cell manufacturing capabilities are described below: 

North America: We operate a 65,000 square-foot manufacturing facility in Torrington, Connecticut where we produce the DFC cell packages and assemble the fuel cell modules. The completed modules are then conditioned at our facility in Danbury, Connecticut for the final step in the manufacturing process and shipped to customer sites. Our overall DFC manufacturing process in North America (module manufacturing, final assembly, testing and conditioning) has a production capacity of 100 MW per year, with full utilization under its current configuration. 

We are undertaking a multi-year project to reduce costs and position ourselves for future growth in two phases. The first phase is underway to add a 102,000 square foot addition of our North American manufacturing facility. The building expansion will 

allow for consolidation of warehousing and service facilities enabling manufacturing efficiencies by providing the needed space to re-configure production. The fuel cell module conditioning process will be moved to Torrington from Danbury, for example. As demand supports, the second phase will involve the addition of manufacturing equipment to increase annual capacity to at least 200 megawatts. The State of Connecticut is extending two low interest long term loans to us for each of the two phases and up to $10 million of tax credits. Each loan is $10 million, with an interest rate of 2.0% and a term of 15 years. Up to 50% of the principal is forgivable if certain job creation and retention targets are met. 

The Torrington production facility, the Danbury corporate headquarters and research and development, and Field Service are ISO 9001:2008 certified, reinforcing the tenets of the FuelCell Energy Quality Management System and our core values of continual improvement and commitment to quality. 

South Korea: Given the strong demand in Asia, POSCO Energy built a cell manufacturing facility in Pohang, Korea and the facility became operational in late 2015. Annual production capacity is 100 MW and the building is sized to accommodate up to 200 MW of annual production to support future growth in the Asian market. 

Additionally, under a multi-year order that began in 2012 and concludes at the end of 2016, DFC components are manufactured in the USA and then shipped to South Korea for assembly of modules and conditioning. 

Europe: &#32;We have a 20,000 square-foot manufacturing facility in Taufkirchen, Germany that has the capability to perform final module assembly for up to 20 MW per year of sub-megawatt fuel cell power plants for the European market. 

Raw Materials and Supplier Relationships 

We use various commercially available raw materials and components to construct a fuel cell module, including nickel and stainless steel, which are key inputs to our manufacturing process. Our fuel cell stack raw materials are sourced from multiple vendors and are not considered precious metals. We have a global integrated supply chain that serves North American, European, and Asian production facilities. In addition to manufacturing the fuel cell module in our Torrington facility, the electrical and mechanical BOP are assembled by and procured from several suppliers. All of our suppliers must undergo a qualification process. We continually evaluate new suppliers and are currently qualifying several new suppliers. We purchase mechanical and electrical balance of plant componentry from third party vendors, based on our own proprietary designs. 

Product Cost Reduction 

Our overall cost reduction strategy is based on the assumption that continued increases in production will result in further economies of scale, reducing the per-unit cost of the raw materials and componentry we purchase. In addition, our cost reduction strategy relies on implementation of further advancements in our manufacturing process, global competitive sourcing integrated with POSCO sourcing volumes, engineering design and technology improvements (including modules with longer life and increased module power output). We have a broad range of initiatives to reduce costs and improve our overall project affordability. 

Improvements in affordability, driven by product cost reductions, are critical for us to accelerate market adoption of our fuel cell products and attain company profitability. Cost reductions will also reduce or eliminate the need for incentive funding programs which currently allow us to price our products to compete with grid-delivered power and other distributed generation technologies. 

We have reduced the product cost of our megawatt-class power plants by more than 60% from the first commercial installation in 2003 through engineering redesign, sourcing, and improved power output and module life. Growing purchasing volume has reduced costs and strengthened the supply chain by enabling direct purchasing rather than through distributors and the ability to access stronger national and international suppliers rather than small local or regional fabricators. Once POSCO&#8217;s Asian manufacturing facility is operational, we expect that increased levels of purchasing from the integrated global supply chain, whether by POSCO Energy or the Company, will benefit both parties by obtaining lower pricing tiers from suppliers from the greater combined purchasing volume. 

Engineering, Procurement and Construction 

We provide customers with complete turn-key solutions including the development, engineering, procurement, construction, operations and interconnection for our fuel cell projects. From an Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) standpoint, FCE has an extensive history of safe and timely delivery of turnkey projects. We have developed relationships with many design firms and licensed general contractors and have a repeatable, safe, and efficient execution philosophy that has been successfully demonstrated multiple times in many different U.S. states and some European countries with an exemplary safety record. The ability to rapidly and safely execute installations minimizes high cost construction period financing and can assist customers in certain situations when the commercial operating date is time sensitive. 

Services and Warranty Agreements 

We offer a comprehensive portfolio of services including: engineering, project management and installation, long-term operating and maintenance programs, including trained technicians that remotely monitor and operate the plants around the world 24 hours a day and 365 days a year. We employ field technicians to service the power plants and maintain service centers near our customers to ensure high availability of our plants. Virtually all of our customers purchase service agreements ranging up to 20 years. Pricing for service contracts is based upon the markets in which we compete and includes all future maintenance and fuel cell module exchanges. While the electrical and mechanical BOP in our DFC power plants is designed to last about 25 years, the current fuel cell modules must be replaced approximately every five years. 

Under the typical provisions of the service agreements, we provide services to monitor, operate and maintain customer power plants to meet specified performance levels. Operations and maintenance is a key driver for power plants to deliver their projected revenue and cash flows. Many of our service agreements include guarantees for system performance, including electrical output and heat rate. Should the power plant not meet the minimum performance levels, we may be required to replace the fuel cell module with a new or used replacement and/or pay performance penalties. The service aspects of our business model provide a recurring and predictable revenue stream for the Company. We have committed future production for scheduled fuel cell module exchanges under service agreements through the year 2036. The pricing structure of the service agreements incorporates these scheduled fuel cell module exchanges and the committed nature of this production facilitates our production planning. Our goal is to optimize our customers&#8217; power plants to meet expected operating parameters throughout their contracted project term. 

In addition to our service agreements, we provide for a warranty for our products for a specific period of time against manufacturing or performance defects. Our warranty is limited to a term generally 15 months after shipment or 12 months after acceptance of our products, except for fuel cell kits. We warranty fuel cell kits and components for 21 months from the date of shipment due to the additional shipping and customer manufacture time required. We accrue for estimated future warranty costs based on historical experience. 

License Agreements and Royalty Income 

We receive license fees and royalty income from POSCO Energy related to manufacturing and technology transfer agreements entered into in 2007, 2009 and 2012. The Cell Technology Transfer Agreement ("CTTA"), executed in October 2012, provides POSCO Energy with the technology to manufacture Direct FuelCell power plants in South Korea and the market access to sell power plants throughout Asia for an initial term of 15 years with two renewal options of five years each. In conjunction with the CTTA, the Company receives a 3.0% royalty on POSCO Energy net product sales as well as a royalty on each scheduled fuel cell module replacement under service agreements for modules that were built by POSCO Energy and installed at any plant in Asia under terms of the Master Service Agreement between the Company and POSCO Energy. 

We expect royalties to be a growing revenue and margin stream for the Company as POSCO Energy continues to develop the market in Asia and deploy DFC power plants. As we expand into other vertical or geographic markets, we may pursue additional licensing and royalty opportunities. 

Advanced Technology Programs (Third Party Funded Research and Development) 

We undertake both public and privately-funded research and development to expand the markets for our DFC power plants, reduce costs, and expand our technology portfolio in complementary high-temperature fuel cell systems. This research builds on the versatility of our fuel cell power plants and contributes to the development of potentially new end markets. Our power plants provide various value streams including clean electricity, high quality usable heat, hydrogen suitable for vehicle fueling or industrial purposes as well as use of DFC power plants to concentrate carbon dioxide from coal and natural gas fired power plants. Our Advanced Technology Programs are focused on three strategic areas for commercialization within a reasonable timeframe: (1) Distributed hydrogen production, compression, and recovery, (2) Carbon capture for emissions reduction and power generation and (3) Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) for stationary power generation and energy storage. The revenue and associated costs from government and third party sponsored research and development is classified as &#8220;Advanced technologies contract revenues&#8221; and &#8220;Cost of advanced technologies contract revenues&#8221;, respectively, in our consolidated financial statements. 

We have worked on technology development with various U.S. government departments and agencies, including the Department of Energy (DOE), the Department of Defense (DOD), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Office of Naval Research (ONR), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Government funding, principally from the DOE, provided 6%, 6%, and 5% of our revenue for the fiscal years ended 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. 

Significant commercialization programs on which we are currently working include: 

Distributed Hydrogen production, compression, and recovery - On-site or distributed hydrogen generation represents an attractive market for the DFC technology. Our high temperature DFC power plant generates electricity directly from a fuel by reforming the fuel inside the fuel cell to supply hydrogen for the electrical generation process. Gas separation technology can be added to capture hydrogen that is not used by the electrical generation process, and we term this configuration DFC-H2. This value-added proposition may be compelling for industrial users of hydrogen and transportation applications, further summarized as follows: 

Industrial Applications : We are currently operating a tri-generation DFC300-H 2 &#32;power plant at our Torrington manufacturing facility, utilizing natural gas to supply 1) electricity for the facility, 2) heat for the building, and 3) hydrogen for the manufacturing process, replacing hydrogen that was delivered by diesel truck. The installation is a showcase for industrial users of hydrogen to visit. The project is supported by the DOE and the State of Connecticut. 

Vehicle fueling Applications : A tri-generation DFC300-H2 power plant completed a three year demonstration at the Orange County Wastewater Treatment Facility in Irvine, California, utilizing renewable biogas to supply hydrogen for use in fuel cell vehicle fueling and clean renewable electricity. The demonstration was performed under sub-contract to Air Products (NYSE: APD) with funding provided by the DOE, California Air Resources Board, South Coast Air Quality Management District, the Orange County Sanitation District, and Southern California Gas Company. 

Carbon Capture - Coal and natural gas are abundant, low cost, domestic resources that are widely used to generate electricity, but with a significant carbon footprint. Cost effective and efficient carbon capture from coal-fired and gas-fired power plants potentially represents a large global market because it could enable clean use of these domestic fuels. Our carbonate fuel cell technology separates and concentrates carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) as a side reaction during the power generation process. DFC carbon capture research conducted by us has demonstrated that this is a viable technology for the efficient separation of CO 2 from coal or natural gas power plant exhaust streams. Capturing CO 2 as a side reaction while generating additional valuable power is an approach that could be more cost effective than other systems which are being considered for carbon capture. We recently received an award from the US Department of Energy to design and build the first MW-scale carbon capture system, after having proven the technology in cell and sub-megawatt stack tests. The project will be installed at an operating coal fired power plant, and we are currently in discussions with a number of possible utility site hosts. Following the DOE-supported project - which will be based on one DFC3000 plant modified for carbon capture - a second phase is planned which will involve the installation of up to eleven additional fuel cell power plants, for 25 megawatts of fuel cell power plants in total. 

SOFC development and commercialization : We are working towards commercialization of solid oxide fuel cell technology to target sub-megawatt commercial applications including smaller wastewater treatment facilities that do not have enough gas production to support a multi-megawatt solution and storage applications utilizing hydrogen. The potential market opportunity for sub-megawatt applications is for customers that need on-site power generation in either combined heat and power or electric-only configurations. SOFC technology is complementary to our carbonate technology based MW scale DFC product line and affords us the opportunity to leverage our field operating history, existing expertise in power plant design, fuel processing and high volume manufacturing and will leverage our existing installation and service infrastructure. 

We have been a prime contractor in the DOE's Solid State Energy Conversion Alliance (SECA) since 2003 and are currently finishing an award that commenced in September 2014 to demonstrate a sub-megawatt solid oxide fuel cell power plant connected to the electric grid at our Danbury, Connecticut facility. We have also recently received additional awards from DOE to design a 200 kilowatt system and to build three power plants, two of which will go to a customer site. SOFC research is also undertaken at our facility in Calgary, Canada. 

We see significant market opportunities for Distributed Hydrogen Production, Carbon Capture, Solid Oxide Fuel Cells solutions and energy storage. The demonstration projects described above are steps on the commercialization road map as we prudently leverage third-party resources and funding to accelerate the commercialization and realize the market potential for each of these solutions. 

Research and Development (Company Funded Research and Development) 

In addition to research and development performed under research contracts, we also fund our own research and development projects including extending module life, increasing the power output of our modules and reducing the cost of our products. Initiatives include increasing the net power output of the fuel cell stacks to 375 kW from 350 kW currently, and extending the stack life to seven years from five years currently. Greater power output and improved longevity will lead to improved gross margin profitability on a per unit basis for each power plant sold and improved profitability of service contracts, which will support expanding gross margins for the Company. 

In addition to output and life enhancements, we also invest in cost reduction and improving the performance, quality and serviceability of our plants. We are also developing designs for lower cost multi-megawatt fuel cell parks. These efforts continually improve our value proposition and affordability. 

Company-funded research and development is included in Research and development expenses (operating expenses) in our consolidated financial statements. The total research and development expenditures in the consolidated statement of operations, including third party and Company-funded, are as follows:

Competition 

The electric generation market is competitive with continually evolving participants. Our DFC power plants compete in the marketplace for stationary distributed generation. In addition to different types of stationary fuel cells, some other technologies that compete in this marketplace include micro-turbines and reciprocating gas engines. 

Fuel cell technologies are classified according to the electrolyte used by each fuel cell type. Our DFC technology utilizes a carbonate electrolyte. Carbonate-based fuel cells offer a number of advantages over other types of fuel cells designed for megawatt-class commercial applications. These advantages include carbonate fuel cells' ability to generate electricity directly from readily available fuels such as natural gas or renewable biogas, lower raw material costs as the high temperature of the fuel cell enables the use of commodity metals rather than precious metals, and high-quality heat suitable for CHP applications. We are also actively developing SOFC technology, as discussed in the prior Advanced Technology section. Other fuel cell types that may be used for commercial applications include phosphoric acid (PAFC) and proton exchange membrane (PEM). 

The following table illustrates industry estimates of the electrical efficiency, expected capacity range and byproduct heat use of the four principal types of fuel cells as well as highlights of typical market applications:

n/a 

Several companies in the U.S. are engaged in fuel cell development, although we believe we are the only domestic company engaged in significant manufacturing and commercialization of stationary carbonate fuel cells. Emerging fuel cell technologies (and the companies developing them) include stationary PEM fuel cells (Ballard Power Systems), portable PEM fuel cells (Ballard Power Systems, Plug Power, and increasing activity by numerous automotive companies including Toyota, Hyundai, Honda and GM), stationary phosphoric acid fuel cells (Doosan), stationary solid oxide fuel cells (LG/Rolls Royce partnership, General Electric, 

Bloom Energy), and small residential solid oxide fuel cells (Parker Hannifin, Toyota/Kyocera and Ceramic Fuel Cells Ltd.). Each of these competitors with stationary fuel cell applications has the potential to capture market share in our target markets. 

There are other potential fuel cell competitors internationally. In Japan, Fuji Electric has been involved with both PEM and phosphoric acid fuel cells and Panasonic is involved with PEM fuel cells for micro-CHP applications. In the United Kingdom, AFC Energy is engaged in alkaline fuel cell development and Intelligent Energy Holdings is engaged in PEM development for consumer products and transportation. 

Other than fuel cell developers, we also compete with companies such as Caterpillar, Cummins, Wartsilla, MTU Friedrichshafen GmbH (MTU), Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Detroit Diesel, which manufacture more mature combustion-based distributed power generation equipment, including various engines and turbines, and have well-established manufacturing and distribution operations along with product operating and cost features. Competition on larger MW projects may also come from gas turbine companies like General Electric, Caterpillar Solar Turbines and Kawasaki. 

We also compete against the electric grid, which is readily available to prospective customers. The electric grid is supplied by traditional centralized power plants including coal, gas and nuclear, with transmission lines used to transport the electricity to the point of use. 

Our stationary fuel cell power plants generally do not directly compete against solar and wind, but can complement their intermittency with the continuous power output of the fuel cells. Solar and wind require specific geographies and weather profiles, as well as up to ten times the land requirements of our DFC plants, making them difficult to site in urban areas, unlike fuel cell power plants. 

We believe that only carbonate fuel cells are suitable for fuel cell carbon capture applications, so our fuel cell carbon capture solution does not compete against fuel cells from manufacturers utilizing other fuel cell technologies. 

Our distributed hydrogen solution competes against traditional centralized hydrogen generation as well as electrolyzers used for distributed applications. Hydrogen is typically generated at a central location in large quantities by combustion-based steam reforming and then distributed to end users by diesel truck. Besides utilizing tri-generation DFC plants for distributed hydrogen, electrolyzers can be used that are in essence, reverse fuel cells. Electrolyzers take electricity and convert it to hydrogen. The hydrogen can be used as it is generated, compressed and stored, or injected into the natural gas pipeline. Companies using fuel cell-based electrolyzer technology for transportation applications include Proton Onsite and H2 Logic. Hydrogenics is pursuing both transportation and utility-scale electrolyzer applications. 

Incentive Programs 

We are continuing to transition the business towards operating in sustainable markets that do not require specific government subsidies or support programs to compete against more traditional forms of power generation. Support programs for fuel cells, depending on the jurisdiction, include renewable portfolio standards, feed in tariffs and self-generation incentive programs, net energy metering programs and tax incentives. These incentives help to accelerate the adoption of clean, efficient and renewable power generation. 

In the United States, the federal government provides an uncapped investment tax credit (ITC) that allows a taxpayer to claim a credit of 30% of qualified expenditures (up to a tax credit limit of $3,000/kW) for eligible power generation technologies, including fuel cell power plants, that are placed in service on or before December 31, 2016. In December 2015, the United States Congress extended the ITC for 5 years, beginning on January 1, 2017, and phased down to 26% in 2020 and 22% in 2021. The intention, as publicly stated by Congressional leaders, was to extend the ITC to all eligible technologies; however, the actual approved language only extended the ITC for solar energy technologies. Senior Congressional leadership, as stated in the Congressional Record on December 18, 2015 and in the media, acknowledged a drafting issue with the legislation and their commitment to correct this oversight in early 2016. The expectation is that a bill will be introduced for vote to include all eligible technologies in the ITC extension, including fuel cells. The ITC is a primary economic driver of fuel cell projects in the USA. The ITC expiration at the end of 2016 (unless extended) underscores the need for the LCOE on our projects to continue to decline to grid parity and below. While the expiration of the 30% ITC poses some potential uncertainty in the USA, we believe that our LCOE reduction plans can off-set the potential impact, if for some reason Congress does not follow through with including all eligible technologies in the ITC extension. The federal government also provides accelerated depreciation for eligible fuel cell projects. 

The majority of states in the U.S. have enacted legislation adopting Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) mechanisms. Under an RPS, regulated utilities and other load serving entities are required to procure a specified percentage of their total electricity sales to end-user customers from eligible renewable resources, by a specified date. RPS legislation and implementing regulations vary significantly from state to state, particularly with respect to the percentage of renewable energy required to achieve the state&#8217;s RPS, the definition of eligible renewable energy resources, and the extent to which renewable energy credits (certificates representing the generation of renewable energy) qualify for RPS compliance. Fuel cells using biogas qualify as renewable power generation technology in all of the RPS states in the U.S., and eight states specify that fuel cells operating on natural gas are also eligible for these initiatives in recognition of the high efficiency of fuel cells and near-zero pollutants. 

In addition to RPS programs, states and municipalities in the USA have also adopted programs for which our products qualify. Most notably there are strong programs in California supporting self-generation, clean air power generation and carbon reduction. In the Northeast, Connecticut, New York and New Jersey all have programs supporting on-site power production, combined heat and power applications, carbon reduction, grid resiliency / micro-grids and utility ownership of fuel cell projects. 

Internationally, South Korea has adopted an RPS to promote clean energy, reduce carbon emissions, and develop a local green-industry to accelerate economic growth. The RPS is designed to increase renewable power generation to ten percent of total power generation by 2022 from two percent in 2012 by requiring an additional one half of one percent of new &#38; renewable power added annually from 2012 to 2016, increasing to one percent per annum through 2022. This equates to an estimated 350 MW annually through 2016, increasing to about 700 MW annually thereafter. Electric utilities and independent power producers that have in excess of 500 MW of power generation capacity are required to comply with the RPS. In addition, a Renewable Heat Obligation program creation is in process to accelerate the adoption of CHP installations with targeted implementation in 2016. The South Korean government initiated a cap-and-trade system in 2015, targeting about 60 percent of greenhouse gas emissions from industrial operations that produce more than 25,000 tons of CO2 per year. The South Korean government has pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 30 percent by 2020 from projected levels. The cap-and-trade legislation is designed to link internationally with emissions trading systems in other countries. 

In Europe, there are a number of renewable energy programs and several feed-in tariffs which contribute to growth in our markets. In addition, there are a variety of research and development funding programs for fuel cells and hydrogen at the European Union-level as well as state-level within specific countries. In Germany, there are several financial incentives for stationary fuel cell power plants operating on either natural gas or renewable biogas. CHP configurations receive additional incentives as the German government is targeting 25% of electricity generation to include CHP by 2020, up from the current level of 22%. Germany uses a power production bonus as the foundational incentive program driving adoption of CHP, and the National Organization Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technology (NOW) program as the tool to differentiate fuel cells versus combustion-based technology. 

Government Regulation 

Our Company and its products are subject to various federal, provincial, state and local laws and regulations relating to, among other things, land use, safe working conditions, handling and disposal of hazardous and potentially hazardous substances and emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere. Negligible emissions of SOx and NOx from our power plants are substantially lower than conventional combustion-based generating stations, and are far below existing and proposed regulatory limits. The primary emissions from our power plants, assuming no cogeneration application, are humid flue gas that is discharged at temperatures of 700-800&#176;F, water that is discharged at temperatures of 10-20&#176;F above ambient air temperatures, and CO 2 &#32;in per kW hour amounts that are much less than conventional fossil fuel central generation power plants due to the high efficiency of fuel cells. Due to the high temperature of the flue gas emissions, we are required to site or configure our power plants in a manner that allows the flue gas to be vented at acceptable and safe distances. The discharge of water from our power plants requires permits that depend on whether the water is to be discharged into a storm drain or into the local wastewater system. 

We are also subject to federal, state, provincial or local regulation with respect to, among other things, emissions and siting. In addition, utility companies and several states in the USA have created and adopted or are in the process of creating interconnection regulations covering both technical and financial requirements for interconnection of fuel cell power plants to utility grids. Our power plants are designed to meet all applicable laws, regulations and industry standards for use in their international markets. 

We are committed to providing a safe and healthy environment for our employees. All of our employees are required to obey all applicable health, safety and environmental laws and regulations and must observe the proper safety rules and environmental practices in work situations. We are dedicated to seeing that safety and health hazards are adequately addressed through appropriate work practices, training and procedures. 

Proprietary Rights and Licensed Technology 

Our intellectual property consists of patents, trade secrets and institutional knowledge that we feel is a competitive advantage and represents a significant barrier to entry for potential competitors. Our Company was founded in 1969 as an applied research company and began focusing on carbonate fuel cells in the 1980s with our first fully commercialized Direct FuelCell (DFC) power plant sold in 2003. Over this period of time, we have gained extensive experience in designing, manufacturing, operating and maintaining fuel cell power plants. This experience can&#8217;t be easily or quickly replicated and combined with our trade secrets, proprietary processes and patents, safeguard our intellectual property rights. 

As of October 31, 2015, the Company, excluding its subsidiaries, has 93 patents in the U.S. and 94 patent in other jurisdictions covering our fuel cell technology (in certain cases covering the same technology in multiple jurisdictions), with patents directed to various aspects of our Direct FuelCell technology, SOFC technology, PEM fuel cell technology, and applications thereof. We also have 10 patent applications pending in the U.S. and 56 pending in other jurisdictions. Our U.S. patents will expire between 2016 and 2033, and the current average remaining life of our U.S. patents is approximately 10.2 years. 

Our subsidiary, Versa Power Systems, Inc., has 30 current U.S. patents and 73 international patents covering their SOFC technology (in certain cases covering the same technology in multiple jurisdictions), with an average remaining U.S. patent life of approximately 8.7 years. Versa Power Systems, Inc. also has 3 pending U.S. patent applications and 9 patent applications pending in other jurisdictions. In addition, our subsidiary FuelCell Energy Solutions, GmbH has license rights to use FuelCell Energy's carbonate fuel cell technology as well as 9 U.S. and 49 patents outside the U.S. for carbonate fuel cell technology licensed from its co-owner, Fraunhofer IKTS. 

No patents have expired that would have any material impact on our current or anticipated operations. As has historically been the case, we are continually innovating, and have a significant number of invention disclosures that we are reviewing that may result in additional patent applications. 

Many of our U.S. patents are the result of government-funded research and development programs, including our Department of Energy (DOE) programs. U.S. patents we own that resulted from government-funded research are subject to the government exercising &#8220;march-in&#8221; rights. We believe that the likelihood of the U.S. government exercising these rights is remote and would only occur if we ceased our commercialization efforts and there was a compelling national need to use the patents. 

Significant Customers and Information about Geographic Areas 

We contract with a concentrated number of customers for the sale of our products and for research and development contracts.

We have marketing and manufacturing operations both within and outside the United States. We source raw materials and balance of plant components from a diverse global supply chain. In 2015, the foreign country with the greatest concentration risk was South Korea, accounting for 67% of our consolidated net sales. As part of our Strategic Plan, we are in the process of diversifying our sales mix from both a customer specific and geographic perspective. See Item 1A: &#8220;Risk Factors - We are substantially 

dependent on a concentrated number of customers and the loss of any one of these customers could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations" &#32;and "Risk Factors - We depend on relationships with strategic partners, and the terms and enforceability of many of these relationships are not certain ." 

The international nature of our operations subjects us to a number of risks, including fluctuations in exchange rates, adverse changes in foreign laws or regulatory requirements and tariffs, taxes, and other trade restrictions. See Item 1A: &#8220;Risk Factors - We are subject to risks inherent in international operations &#8221;.&#8221; See also Note 13 &#8220;Segment and Geographical Information,&#8221; to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8, &#8220;Consolidated Financial Statements And Supplementary Data&#8221; of the Form 10-K Report for information about our net sales by geographic region for the years ended October 31, 2015 , 2014, and 2013.

Sustainability &#32; 

FuelCell Energy&#8217;s ultra-clean, efficient and reliable fuel cell power plants help our customers achieve their sustainability goals. These highly efficient and environmentally friendly products support the &#8220;Triple Bottom Line&#8221; concept of sustainability, consisting of Environmental, Social and Economic considerations. 

We value sustainability just as seriously as our customers. We continue to incorporate sustainability best practices into our corporate culture and into the design, manufacture, installation and servicing of our stationary fuel cell power plants. For example, at the end-of-life for our power plants, we refurbish and re-use certain parts of the power plant and we are able to recycle most of what we cannot re-use, supporting the sustainability concept of &#8216;cradle-to-cradle&#8217;. Some of the parts in the fuel cell module can be re-furbished, such as end plates, while the individual fuel cell components are sent to a smelter for recycling. The balance of plant has an operating life of twenty to twenty-five years, at which time metals such as steel and copper are reclaimed for scrap value. By weight, approximately 93% of the entire power plant is either re-used or recycled. 

We have a designated Sustainability Officer who promotes sustainable business practices in our manufacturing and administrative functions. For example, on the production floor, we reuse scrap from the manufacturing process, minimizing production waste. We have a tri-generation fuel cell power plant at our North American manufacturing plant, efficiently and cleanly generating power and heat for the facility and hydrogen for the manufacturing process. From a sustainability standpoint, on-site tri-generation avoids the use of a combustion-based boiler for heat and its associated emissions and reduces pollutants from the diesel truck needed for hydrogen delivery, reducing our carbon footprint and benefiting the surrounding community. Other examples include routing excess heat from production processes throughout the facility to reduce both heating costs and associated emissions, installation of high efficiency lighting, partially powering the corporate offices with power generated by the various fuel cell configurations undergoing development in the research area, and utilizing cross-functional teams to evaluate additional areas for improvement. 

While we continue to enhance and adopt sustainable business practices, we recognize this is an ongoing effort with more to be accomplished; such as further reducing the direct and indirect aspects of our carbon footprint. Our manufacturing process has a very low carbon footprint, utilizing an assembly oriented production strategy and obtaining low carbon power and heat from DFC power plants located at both the North American manufacturing plant operated by the Company and the Asian manufacturing plant operated by POSCO Energy. 

Sustainability also incorporates social risks and human rights and we will not knowingly support or do business with suppliers that treat workers improperly or unlawfully, including, without limitation, those that engage in human trafficking, child labor, slavery or other unlawful or morally reprehensible employment practices. We have begun and are continuing to implement comprehensive monitoring of our global supply chain to eliminate social risks and ensure respect for human rights. We contractually ensure that all qualified suppliers in our supply chain comply with the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) of 1938, as amended. Our employees with supply chain responsibilities are trained on sustainability, social risks and human rights and utilize this knowledge to evaluate existing suppliers and new potential suppliers on social and sustainable metrics to ensure compliance with our requirements and congruence with our company values. 

Associates 

At October 31, 2015, we had 596 full-time associates, of whom 279 were located at the Torrington, Connecticut manufacturing plant, 273 were located at the Danbury, Connecticut facility or various field offices, and 44 were located at our foreign locations. In addition, at October 31, 2015, the Company had 23 temporary workers. None of our associates is represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
