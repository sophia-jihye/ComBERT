 Item 1. Business 

Organization 

We were incorporated on December 19, 2013 as a Maryland corporation and elected and qualified to be taxed as a REIT beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2014. On April 24, 2014, we commenced our IPO on a "reasonable best efforts" basis of up to 30.0 million &#32;shares of common stock, $0.01 &#32;par value per share, at a price of $25.00 &#32;per share, subject to certain volume and other discounts, for total gross proceeds of up to $750.0 million , pursuant to our registration statement on Form S-11, as amended (File No. 333-194135 ) (the "Registration Statement") filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). The Registration Statement also covered up to 10.5 million &#32;shares available pursuant to a distribution reinvestment plan (the "DRIP") under which our common stockholders may elect to have their distributions reinvested in additional shares of our common stock at a price of $23.75 &#32;per share, which is equal to 95% &#32;of the offering price in the IPO. 

On May 29, 2014, we received and accepted subscriptions in excess of the minimum offering amount for the IPO of $2.0 million &#32;in shares, broke general escrow and issued shares of common stock to initial investors who were admitted as stockholders. In February 2015, as permitted, we reallocated the remaining 10.0 million &#32;DRIP shares available under the Registration Statement to the primary offering. On May 22, 2015, we registered an additional 25.0 million &#32;shares to be issued pursuant to the DRIP pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-204433). We closed our IPO on May 31, 2015, and continued to accept subscriptions in process as of that date. As of December 31, 2015 , we had 30.4 million &#32;shares of common stock outstanding, including unvested restricted shares and shares issued pursuant to the DRIP, and had received total gross proceeds from the IPO of $754.6 million , inclusive of $24.9 million &#32;from the DRIP. The per share purchase price in the IPO was up to $25.00 &#32;per share (including the maximum allowed to be charged for commissions and fees) and shares issued under the DRIP is equal to $23.75 &#32;per share, which is equal to 95% &#32;of the offering price in the primary offering. Beginning with the net asset value ("NAV") pricing date, the per share price for shares under the DRIP will vary periodically and will be equal to the NAV per share of our common stock ("Estimated Per-Share NAV") as determined by our Advisor. The NAV pricing date means the date on which we first publish an estimated per share NAV, which will be on or prior to October 26, 2016, which is 150 days following the second anniversary from the date we broke escrow in the IPO. 

We were formed to invest our assets in properties in the five boroughs of New York City, with a focus on Manhattan. We may also purchase certain real estate assets that accompany office properties, including retail spaces and amenities, as well as hospitality assets, residential assets and other property types exclusively in New York City. All such properties may be acquired and owned by us alone or jointly with another party. As of December 31, 2015 , we owned five &#32;properties consisting of 841,868 &#32;rentable square feet, which were 89.2% &#32;leased, with a weighted average remaining lease term of 7.8 &#32;years. Our five &#32;properties include one commercial property, one property consisting of three condominium units (one retail unit, a parking garage and one office unit), one parking garage and two institutional-quality office buildings. 

Substantially all of our business is conducted through New York City Operating Partnership, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the &#8220;OP&#8221;). We are the sole general partner and hold substantially all of the units of limited partner interests in the OP entitled "OP Units" (&#8220;OP units&#8221;). The Advisor contributed $2,020 &#32;to the OP in exchange for 90 &#32;OP units, which represents a nominal percentage of the aggregate OP ownership. A holder of OP units has the right to convert OP units for the cash value of a corresponding number of shares of our common stock or, at the option of the OP, a corresponding number of shares of our common stock, in accordance with the limited partnership agreement of the OP, provided, however, that such OP units must have been outstanding for at least one year. The remaining rights of the limited partners in the OP are limited, however, and do not include the ability to replace the general partner or to approve the sale, purchase or refinancing of the OP's assets. 

We have no direct employees. Our Advisor manages our affairs on a day-to-day basis. New York City Properties, LLC (our "Property Manager") manages our properties, unless services are performed by a third party for specific properties. The Advisor and Property Manager are under common control with AR Global, the parent of our Sponsor, as a result of which they are related parties and have received or will continue to receive compensation, fees and expense reimbursements for services related to the investment and management of our assets. 

&#32;Realty Capital Securities, LLC (our "Former Dealer Manager") served as the dealer manager of our IPO and, together with its affiliates, continued to provide us with various services through December 31, 2015. RCS Capital Corporation, the parent company of the Former Dealer Manager and certain of its affiliates that provided services to us, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January 2016, prior to which it was also under common control with AR Global, the parent of our Sponsor. 

Investment Objectives: 

We are focused on helping our stockholders take advantage of the New York City real estate market. Our investment goals are as follows: 

&#8226; 

New York City Focus &#160;- Acquire high-quality commercial real estate located in the five boroughs of New York City, and in particular, Manhattan;

Acquisition and Investment Policies 

Primary Investment Focus 

We have focused and intend to continue focusing our investment activities on acquiring quality, income-producing commercial real estate located in the five boroughs of New York City and, in particular, properties located in Manhattan. We may also originate or acquire real estate debt backed by quality, income-producing commercial real estate located predominantly in New York City. The real estate debt we originate or acquire is expected to be primarily first mortgage debt but also may include bridge loans, mezzanine loans, preferred equity or securitized loans. Pursuant to the Allocation Agreement, each proposed target investment (as defined in such agreement) sourced by our Advisor or its affiliates shall be subject to rotation as defined in the agreement. 

Investing in Real Property 

We have and expect to invest a majority of our assets in office properties located in New York City. We may also invest in real estate assets that accompany office space, including retail spaces and amenities, as well as hospitality assets, residential assets and other property types exclusively in New York City. 

Our Advisor considers relevant real estate and financial factors, including the location of the property, the leases and other agreements affecting the property, its income-producing capacity, its physical condition, its prospects for appreciation, its prospects for liquidity, tax considerations and other factors when evaluating prospective investments. In this regard, our Advisor has substantial discretion with respect to the selection of specific investments, subject to board approval. 

The following table lists the tenants whose annualized rental income on a straight-line basis, based on leases signed, represented greater than 10% of total annualized rental income for all portfolio properties on a straight-line basis as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 :

Tenants annualized rental income on a straight-line basis was not greater than 10% of total annualized rental income on a straight-line basis for all portfolio properties as of the period specified. 

The termination, delinquency or non-renewal of these leases by any of the above tenants may have a material adverse effect on our revenues. No other tenant represents greater than 10% of our annualized rental income on a straight-line basis as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 . 

Real Estate-Related Loans and Debt Securities 

Although not our primary focus, we may, from time to time, make investments in real estate-related loans and debt securities. We do not expect these types of assets to exceed 10.0% of our assets after the proceeds of our IPO have been fully invested, or represent a substantial portion of our assets at any one time. The other real estate-related debt investments in which we may invest include: mortgages; mezzanine; bridge and other loans; debt and derivative securities related to real estate assets, including mortgage-backed securities; collateralized debt obligations; debt securities issued by real estate companies; and credit default swaps. Our criteria for investing in loans are substantially the same as those involved in our investment in properties; however, we will also evaluate such investments based on the current income opportunities presented. 

Investing in Equity Securities 

We may make equity investments in other REITs and other real estate companies that operate assets meeting our investment objectives. We may purchase the common or preferred stock of these entities or options to acquire their stock. We will target a public company that owns commercial real estate or real estate-related assets when we believe its stock is trading at a discount to that company&#8217;s net asset value. We may eventually seek to acquire or gain a controlling interest in the companies that we target. We do not expect our non-controlling equity investments in other public companies to exceed 5.0% of the proceeds of our IPO, or to represent a substantial portion of our assets at any one time. In addition, we do not expect our non-controlling equity investments in other public companies combined with our investments in real estate properties outside of our target investments and other real estate-related investments to exceed 10.0% of our portfolio. 

Acquisition Structure 

We have acquired real estate and real-estate related assets directly, for example, by acquiring fee interests in real property (a "fee interest" is the absolute, legal possession and ownership of land, property, or rights), or by purchasing interests, including controlling interests, in REITs or other "real estate operating companies," such as real estate management companies and real estate development companies, that own real property. We also may acquire real estate assets through investments in joint venture entities, including joint venture entities in which we may not own a controlling interest, or assets under ground leases. Our assets generally are held in wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries of the company, each formed to hold a particular asset. 

Financing Strategies / Offerings 

We use debt financing to fund property improvements, tenant improvements, leasing commissions and other working capital needs. The form of our indebtedness will vary and could be long-term or short-term, secured or unsecured, or fixed-rate or floating rate. We do not enter into interest rate swaps or caps, or similar hedging transactions or derivative arrangements for speculative purposes but may do so in order to manage or mitigate our interest rate risks on variable rate debt. 

Under our charter, the maximum amount of our total indebtedness may not exceed 300% of our total &#8220;net assets&#8221; (as defined in our charter) as of the date of any borrowing, which is generally expected to be approximately 75% of the cost of our investments; however, we may exceed that limit if such excess is approved by a majority of our independent directors. This charter limitation, however, does not apply to individual real estate assets or investments. 

In addition, it is currently our intention to limit our aggregate borrowings to 40.0% &#8211; 50.0% of the aggregate fair market value of our assets, unless borrowing a greater amount is approved by a majority of our independent directors. This limitation will be calculated after the close of our IPO and once we have invested substantially all the proceeds of our IPO. This limitation, however, will not apply to individual real estate assets or investments. At the date of acquisition of each asset, we anticipate that the cost of investment for such asset will be substantially similar to its fair market value. Subsequent events, including changes in the fair market value of our assets, could result in our exceeding these limits. 

We will not borrow from our Sponsor, our Advisor, any of our directors or any of their respective affiliates unless a majority of our directors, including a majority of our independent directors, not otherwise interested in the transaction approves the transaction as being fair, competitive and commercially reasonable and no less favorable to us than comparable loans between unaffiliated parties. 

Except with respect to the investment limitations contained in our charter, we may reevaluate and change our financing policies without a stockholder vote. Factors that we would consider when reevaluating or changing our debt policy include then-current economic conditions, the relative cost and availability of debt and equity capital, our expected investment opportunities, the ability of our investments to generate sufficient cash flow to cover debt service requirements and other similar factors. 

Tax Status 

We elected and qualified to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), effective for our taxable year ended December 31, 2014. We believe that, commencing with such taxable year, we have been organized and operated in a manner so that we qualify for taxation as a REIT under the Code. We intend to continue to operate in such a manner, but no assurance can be given that we will operate in a manner so as to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT. In order to continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT we must, among other things, distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income as calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP")) determined without regard for the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, and must comply with a number of other organizational and operational requirements. If we continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal corporate income tax on that portion of our REIT taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and properties as well as federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income. 

Competition 

The New York City real estate market is highly competitive. We compete based on a number of factors that include location, rental rates, security, suitability of the property's design to prospective tenants' needs and the manner in which the property is operated and marketed. In addition, the number of competing properties in the New York MSA could have a material effect on our occupancy levels, rental rates and on the operating expenses of certain of our properties. 

In addition, we compete with other entities engaged in real estate investment activities to locate suitable properties and to acquire and to locate tenants and purchasers for our properties. These competitors include other REITs, specialty finance companies, savings and loan associations, banks, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, mutual funds, institutional investors, lenders, governmental bodies and other entities. We also may compete with other entities advised or sponsored by affiliates of our Sponsor for properties or tenants. In addition, these same entities seek financing through similar channels. Therefore, we compete for financing in a market where funds for real estate financing may decrease. 

Competition from these and other third party real estate investors may limit the number of suitable investment opportunities available. It also may result in higher prices, lower yields and a narrower spread of yields over our potential borrowing costs, making it more difficult for us to acquire new investments on attractive terms. In addition, the number of competing properties in the New York MSA could have a material effect on our occupancy levels, rental rates and on the operating expenses of certain of our properties. 

&#160; Regulations 

Our investments are subject to various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, including, among other things, zoning regulations, land use controls, environmental controls relating to air and water quality, noise pollution and indirect environmental impacts such as increased motor vehicle activity. We believe that we have all permits and approvals necessary under current law to operate our investments. 

Environmental 

As an owner of real estate, we are subject to various environmental laws of federal, state and local governments. Compliance with existing laws has not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, and management does not believe it will have such an impact in the future. However, we cannot predict the impact of unforeseen environmental contingencies or new or changed laws or regulations on properties in which we hold an interest, or on properties that may be acquired directly or indirectly in the future. We hire third parties to conduct Phase I environmental reviews of the real property that we intend to purchase. 

We did not make any material capital expenditures in connection with environmental, health and safety laws, ordinances and regulations in 2015 and do not expect that we will be required to make any such material capital expenditures during 2016. 

Employees 

We have no direct employees. The employees of our Advisor and its affiliates perform a full range of real estate services for us, including acquisitions, property management, accounting, legal, asset management and investor relations services. 

We are dependent on these entities for services that are essential to us, including capital markets activities, asset acquisition decisions, property management and other general administrative responsibilities. In the event that any of these companies were unable to provide these services to us, we would be required to provide such services ourselves or obtain such services from other sources. 

Financial Information About Industry Segments 

Our current business consists of acquiring, investing in, owning, managing, operating, leasing, and disposing of real estate assets. All of our revenues are from our consolidated real estate properties. We internally evaluate operating performance on an individual property level and view all of our real estate assets as one industry segment, and, accordingly, all of our properties are aggregated into one reportable segment. See our consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 &#32;for our revenues from tenants, net income or loss, total assets and other financial information.
