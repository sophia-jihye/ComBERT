 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

As used in this Annual Report, &#8220;we&#8220;, &#8220;us&#8220;, &#8220;our&#8220;, &#8220;FitLife&#8220;, &#8220;FitLife Brands&#8220; &#8220;Company&#8220; or &#8220;our company&#8220; refers to FitLife Brands, Inc. and all of its subsidiaries. 

Overview 

FitLife Brands, Inc. (the &#8220; Company &#8220;) is a national provider of innovative and proprietary nutritional supplements for health conscious consumers marketed under the brand names NDS Nutrition Products(TM) (&#8220; NDS &#8220;) ( www.ndsnutrition.com ), PMD(TM) ( www.pmdsports.com ), SirenLabs(TM) ( www.sirenlabs.com ), CoreActive(TM) ( www.coreactivenutrition.com ), and Metis Nutrition(TM) ( www.metisnutrition.com ) (together, &#8220; NDS Products &#8220;). With the consummation of the merger with iSatori, Inc. (&#8220; iSatori &#8220;) on September 30, 2015, which became effective on October 1, 2015, described below (the &#8220; Merger &#8220;), the Company added several brands to its product portfolio, including iSatori ( www.isatori.com ), CT Fletcher, BioGenetic Laboratories, and Energize (together, &#8220; iSatori Products &#8220;). The NDS Products are distributed principally through franchised General Nutrition Centers, Inc. (&#8220; GNC &#8220;) stores located both domestically and internationally, and, with the addition of Metis Nutrition, through corporate GNC stores in the United States. The iSatori Products are sold through more than 25,000 retail locations, which include specialty, mass, and online. 

&#160;

The Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 26, 2005. In October 2008, the Company acquired the assets of NDS Nutritional Products, Inc., a Nebraska corporation, and moved those assets into its wholly owned subsidiary NDS Nutrition Products, Inc., a Florida corporation (&#8220; NDS &#8220;). The Company&#8217;s NDS Products are sold through NDS and the iSatori Products are sold through iSatori, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. 

&#160; 

FitLife Brands is headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska and maintains an office in Golden, Colorado, which it acquired in connection with the Merger. For more information on the Company, please go to http://www.fitlifebrands.com . The Company&#8217;s common stock currently trades under the symbol FTLF on the OTCBB market. 

Recent Developments 

iSatori Merger. &#160; On September 30, 2015, the Company consummated the Merger contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated May 18, 2015 (the &#8220; Merger Agreement &#8220;), among the Company, ISFL Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (&#8220; Merger Sub &#8220;), and iSatori, pursuant to which iSatori merged with and into Merger Sub, with iSatori surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The Merger was approved by iSatori shareholders at a special meeting held on September 29, 2015 and became effective on October 1, 2015 (the &#8220; Closing Date &#8220;). 

&#160;

In connection with the closing of the Merger, each share of iSatori common stock outstanding on the Closing Date became exchangeable for 0.1732 shares of the Company's common stock (the &#8220; Exchange Ratio &#8220;). In the event any iSatori shareholder would otherwise be entitled to a fractional share of the Company's common stock, the Company agreed to pay the value of those fractional interests in cash. The Company has issued a total of 2,315,644 shares of common stock and paid a total of $239 for remaining fractional interests to former iSatori shareholders in connection with the Merger. 

&#160;

Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, the Company increased the size of its Board of Directors (the &#8220; Board &#8220;) from five to seven members, appointed Stephen Adele, Chief Executive Officer of iSatori, to serve on the Board, and appointed two independent directors, Messrs. Seth Yakatan and Todd Ordal, each of whom were designated by iSatori, to the Board. Concurrently with these appointments, Dr. Fadi Aramouni resigned from the Board. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

In addition to the foregoing, the Company secured an option to purchase, on or before December 31, 2015, almost 600,000 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock, otherwise issuable to the two largest shareholders of iSatori, and secured a right of first refusal to purchase approximately 460,000 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock issuable to a certain iSatori shareholder in the connection with the Merger. After careful consideration of many factors, including available cash resources, the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors elected not to exercise the purchase option prior to its expiration. The right of first refusal, however, remains outstanding. 

&#160;

&#160; On September 11, 2015, the Company loaned iSatori $750,000 pursuant to a Demand Promissory Note (" Note "), due and payable on demand after October 15, 2015 in the event the Merger was not consummated on or before such date. The proceeds from the Note were to be used by iSatori for the payment, in the ordinary course of business, of payroll and accounts payable of iSatori pending consummation of the Merger. The Note was deemed satisfied in full in connection with the Closing Date of the Merger and was included as an element of the total purchase price, which also included the assumption of outstanding debt of approximately $1.1 million and the issuance of approximately 2.3 million shares of Company common stock. In connection with the Merger, the Company also converted all issued and outstanding options and warrants of iSatori into options and warrants of FitLife in an amount equal to the number of iSatori options and warrants issued and outstanding multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, at an exercise equal to the original exercise price divided by the Exchange Ratio. The treasury stock net equivalent of all issued and outstanding options and warrants were factored into the calculation of the final Exchange Ratio, the vast majority of which were and remain significantly out of the money. 

&#160;

&#160; At closing, in connection with adjustment provisions outlined in the Merger Agreement, iSatori established certain reserves and write-offs totaling approximately $1.8 million, which write-offs, together with the issuance of the Note and other variances of certain working capital accounts, resulted in a reduction of the Exchange Ratio under the terms of the Merger Agreement from 0.3000 to 0.1732 shares of common stock of the Company for each share of iSatori common stock issued and outstanding. 

&#160;

&#160; Share Repurchase Program. On June 30, 2014, the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program, pursuant to which the Company is authorized to purchase up to $600,000 of our common stock per annum, subject to maximum repurchases of $50,000 per month (the &#8220; Repurchase Program &#8220;). Additional purchases under the Repurchase Program may be made from time to time at the discretion of management as market conditions warrant and subject to certain regulatory restrictions and other considerations. 

&#160;

&#160; As of April 12, 2016, the Company had repurchased an aggregate total of 206,187 shares of our common stock under the Repurchase Program at an average purchase price of $1.93 per share. 

&#160;

Industry Overview 

&#160; 

&#160; We compete principally in the nutrition industry. The Nutrition Business Journal categorizes the industry in the following segments: 

&#160;

&#9679; Dietary Supplements (vitamins, minerals, herbs &#38; botanicals, sports nutrition, meal replacements and specialty supplements); 

&#160;

&#9679; Natural &#38; Organic Foods (products such as cereals, milk, non-dairy beverages and frozen meals); 

&#160;

&#9679; Functional Foods (products with added ingredients or fortification specifically for health or performance purposes); and 

&#9679; Natural &#38; Organic Personal Care and Household Products. 

&#160;

&#160; Management believes that the following factors drive growth in the nutrition industry: 

&#9679; The general public&#8217;s awareness and understanding of the connection between diet and health; 

&#9679; The aging population in the Company&#8217;s markets who tend to use more nutritional supplements as they age; 

&#9679; Increasing healthcare costs and the consequential trend toward preventative medicine and non-traditional medicines; and 

&#9679; Product introductions in response to new scientific studies. 

&#160; &#160; 

Our Products 

&#160; 

&#160; The Company currently focuses its sales and marketing efforts on its full line of sports, weight loss and general nutrition products that are currently marketed and sold nationally as well as internationally. The Company currently markets more than 60 different NDS Products to more than 900 GNC franchise locations located in the United States, as well as to approximately 900 additional franchise locations in more than 15 countries, both of which are distributed primarily through GNC&#8217;s distribution system. In addition, as a result of the launch of Metis Nutrition, we distribute products through more than 3,100 corporate GNC stores in the United States, and with the completion of the Merger, we sell iSatori Products through more than 25,000 retail locations, which include specialty, mass, and online.

&#160;

Manufacturing, Sources and Availability of Raw Materials 

All of the Company&#8217;s products are manufactured by pre-selected FDA-regulated contract manufacturers. The Company utilizes third-party manufacturers to provide its finished products, within the United States and Canada. Each contract manufacturer is required by the Company to abide by current Good Manufacturing Practices (&#8220; cGMPs &#8220;) to ensure quality and consistency, and to manufacture its products according to the Company&#8217;s strict specifications, and nearly all our contract manufacturers are certified through a governing body such as the NPA (&#8220; Natural Products Association &#8220;) or NSF International. In most cases, contract manufacturers purchase the raw materials based on the Company&#8217;s specifications; however, from time to time, the Company will license particular raw material ingredients and supply its own source to the manufacturer. Once produced, in addition to in-house testing performed by the contract manufacturer, the Company may also perform independent analysis and testing. The contract manufacturer ships the finished product to one of our fulfillment centers in either Omaha, Nebraska or Denver, Colorado, or to our distributors. The Company has implemented vendor qualification programs for all of its suppliers and manufacturers, including analytical testing of purchased products. As part of the vendor program, the Company also periodically inspects vendors&#8217; facilities to monitor quality control and assurance procedures. 

&#160; Product Reformulations and New Product Identification 

&#160; 

From time to time we reformulate existing products to address market developments and trends, and to respond to customer requests. We also continually expand our product line through the development of new products. New product ideas are derived from a number of sources, including internally, trade publications, scientific and health journals, consultants, distributors, and other third parties. Prior to reformulating existing products or introducing new products, we investigate product formulations as they relate to regulatory compliance and other issues. We introduced a total of 52 new products during the year ended December 31, 2015, which included 16 completely new products, 32 product reformulations and four flavor extensions, including reformulations and new products introduced by iSatori. We anticipate launching 30+ new products, product reformulations and/or flavor extensions in 2016 across all brands. 

Management continually assesses and analyzes developing market trends to detect and proactively address what they believe are areas of unmet or growing demand that represent an opportunity for the Company and, where deemed appropriate, attempts to introduce new products and/or packaging solutions in direct response to meet that demand. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Sales, Marketing and Distribution 

&#160; 

NDS Products. 

NDS Products are sold through more than 900 GNC franchise locations located throughout the United States. The Company also currently distributes NDS Products to approximately 900 GNC international franchise locations in more than 15 countries. On May 1, 2014, the Company transitioned the majority of its distribution of NDS Products to GNC&#8217;s centralized distribution platform for all NDS Products, excluding protein, which transitioned in mid-September 2014. Prior to the change, the majority of the Company&#8217;s revenue was realized upon direct shipment of NDS Products to individual franchise locations. For the year ended December 31, 2015, direct sales of NDS Products to GNC franchise locations represented less than 1% of the total sales of the Company with substantially all of the remaining NDS Products revenue attributable to sales through GNC&#8217;s centralized distribution platform. 

Our sales and marketing efforts are designed to expand sales of NDS Products to additional GNC franchise locations both domestically and internationally, as well as developing a broader retail presence for our Core Active Nutrition Products. In addition, we launched the first product under the Metis Nutrition brand into more than 3,000 corporate owned GNC stores during 2015 and expect to introduce at least one additional product under the Metis Nutrition brand during 2016. While risks and uncertainties remain, the launch of Metis is an exciting milestone for the Company and could represent a compelling growth platform for 2016 and beyond. Management believes that substantial growth opportunities exist to increase revenue attributable to NDS Products with GNC including GNC&#8217;s stated goal of &#8220;refranchising&#8220; (i.e., converting corporate owned stores into franchise locations) 200 stores during 2016 and up to 1,000 total stores over the next three or four years, continued expansion in the international franchise system, and additional domestic growth in GNC&#8217;s corporate stores with Metis Nutrition. The domestic franchise market remains a strong business and the core of our operations. Management is excited to continue to work collaboratively with the franchisees to build on our established track records of growth and innovation. 

iSatori Products. 

iSatori Products are distributed directly to consumers through its websites and a proprietary &#160; online direct marketing system, as well as through wholesalers, specialty, online-only, grocery, convenience, drug and mass-market distribution channels via Fortune 500 partners. Through established distribution channel networks, iSatori has created channel access to over 120,000 domestic and international retail locations. iSatori products are currently sold in over 25,000 retail locations. iSatori creates marketing, promotion, and packaging devices in its efforts to drive demand for its products through its established retail distribution. 

In some cases, iSatori utilizes independent brokers, who work in conjunction with iSatori&#8217;s experienced sales employees and management to oversee the grocery, drug and mass market channels. iSatori sells its products to mass-market merchandisers either directly or through distributors of nutritional supplement products. Major distributor, grocery, drug, convenience, club and mass-market customers are and/or have included: Albertsons, Amazon, Bally&#8217;s Total Fitness, BodyBuilding.com, Costco, CVS, Drugstore.com, Europa Sports, GNC, Kroger, Rite Aid, Super Value, 24 Hour Fitness, 7-Eleven, Vitamin Shoppe, Vitamin World, Walgreens and Wal-Mart. 

iSatori&#8217;s core strategy is to build brands within its channels of distribution that are appropriate for each product brand and to develop increased brand awareness and strong brand recognition among consumers seeking products with a reputation for quality and innovation. iSatori has utilized social media campaigns, coupons, print, radio, online and television advertising, plus cooperative and other incentive programs to build consumer awareness and generate trial and repeat purchases to drive sales revenue. Marketing and sales groups regularly review the media mix for its effectiveness in creating consumer demand and the highest return on investment dollars. 

In addition, iSatori&#8217;s conventional distribution marketing and its proprietary internet marketing strategy are designed to increase awareness of proprietary brands and drive targeted traffic to iSatori&#8217;s websites to make purchases. Through iSatori&#8217;s online marketing system, its network affiliates use a multi-channel approach which includes search engine marketing, email campaigns, banner advertisements and additional affiliate programs to acquire new customers and retain a repeatable customer base. 

Product Returns 

&#160; 

We currently have a 30 day product return policy for NDS Products, which allows for a 100% sales price refund, less a 20% restocking fee, for the return of unopened and undamaged products purchased from us online through one of our websites. Product sold to GNC may be returned from store shelves or the distribution center in the event product is damaged, short dated or expired. We have a 60 day product return policy for iSatori Products. Historically, with a few noted exceptions, product returns have been immaterial. That said, despite the best efforts of management, product returns can and do occur from time to time and can be material. 

Competition 

The Company competes with many companies engaged in the nutritional supplement industry. The Company also competes with companies who sell products similar to the Company&#8217;s products online. Many of the Company&#8217;s competitors have significantly greater financial and human resources than our own. The Company seeks to differentiate its products and marketing from its competitors based on product quality, benefits, and functional ingredients. Patent and trademark applications that cover new formulas and embody new technologies will be pursued whenever possible. While we cannot assure that such measures will block competitive products, we believe our continued emphasis on innovation and new product development targeted at the needs of the consumer will enable the Company to effectively compete in the marketplace. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Regulatory Matters 

&#160; 

Our business is subject to varying degrees of regulation by a number of government authorities in the U.S., including the FDA, the Federal Trade Commission (&#8220; FTC &#8220;), the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the Environmental Protection Agency. Various agencies of the states and localities in which we operate and in which our products are sold also regulate our business, such as the California Department of Health Services, Food and Drug Branch. The areas of our business that these and other authorities regulate include, among others: 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

product claims and advertising; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

product labels; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

product ingredients; and 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

how we manufacture, package, distribute, import, export, sell and store our products. 

&#160; 

The FDA, in particular, regulates the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, storage, labeling, promotion, distribution and sale of vitamins and other nutritional supplements in the U.S., while the FTC regulates marketing and advertising claims. In August 2007, a new rule issued by the FDA went into effect requiring companies that manufacture, package, label, distribute or hold nutritional supplements to meet cGMPs to ensure such products are of the quality specified and are properly packaged and labeled. We are committed to meeting or exceeding the standards set by the FDA and believe we are currently operating within the FDA mandated cGMPs. 

&#160; 

The FDA also regulates the labeling and marketing of dietary supplements and nutritional products, including the following: 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

the identification of dietary supplements or nutritional products and their nutrition and ingredient labeling; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

requirements related to the wording used for claims about nutrients, health claims, and statements of nutritional support; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

labeling requirements for dietary supplements or nutritional products for which &#8220;high potency&#8220; and &#8220;antioxidant&#8220; claims are made; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

notification procedures for statements on dietary supplements or nutritional products; and 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

premarket notification procedures for new dietary ingredients in nutritional supplements. 

&#160; 

The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (&#8220; DSHEA &#8220;) revised the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act concerning the composition and labeling of dietary supplements and defined dietary supplements to include vitamins, minerals, herbs, amino acids and other dietary substances used to supplement diets. DSHEA generally provides a regulatory framework to help ensure safe, quality dietary supplements and the dissemination of accurate information about such products. The FDA is generally prohibited from regulating active ingredients in dietary supplements as drugs unless product claims, such as claims that a product may heal, mitigate, cure or prevent an illness, disease or malady, trigger drug status. 

DSHEA also permits statements of nutritional support to be included in labeling for nutritional supplements without FDA premarket approval. These statements must be submitted to the FDA within 30 days of marketing and must bear a label disclosure that &#8220;This statement has not been evaluated by the FDA. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.&#8220; These statements may describe a benefit related to a nutrient deficiency disease, the role of a nutrient or nutritional ingredient intended to affect the structure or function in humans, the documented mechanism by which a nutrient or dietary ingredient acts to maintain such structure or function, the general well-being from consumption of a nutrient or dietary ingredient, but may not expressly or implicitly represent that a nutritional supplement will diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat or prevent a disease. An entity that uses a statement of nutritional support in labeling must possess scientific evidence substantiating that the statement is truthful and not misleading. If the FDA determines that a particular statement of nutritional support is an unacceptable drug claim or an unauthorized version of a disease claim for a food product, or if the FDA determines that a particular claim is not adequately supported by existing scientific data or is false or misleading, we would be prevented from using the claim. 

In addition, DSHEA provides that so-called &#8220;third-party literature,&#8220; e.g., a reprint of a peer-reviewed scientific publication linking a particular nutritional ingredient with health benefits, may be used in connection with the sale of a nutritional supplement to consumers without the literature being subject to regulation as labeling. Such literature must not be false or misleading; the literature may not promote a particular manufacturer or brand of nutritional supplement; the literature must present a balanced view of the available scientific information on the nutritional supplement; if displayed in an establishment, the literature must be physically separate from the nutritional supplement; and the literature may not have appended to it any information by sticker or any other method. If the literature fails to satisfy each of these requirements, we may be prevented from disseminating it with our products, and any dissemination could subject our products to regulatory action as an illegal drug. Moreover, any written or verbal representation by us that would associate a nutrient in a product that we sell with an effect on a disease will be deemed evidence of intent to sell the product as an unapproved new drug, a violation of the FDCA. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

In December 2006, the Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act (&#8220; DSNDCPA &#8220;) was passed, which further revised the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Under the act, manufacturers, packers or distributors whose name appears on the product label of a dietary supplement or nonprescription drug are required to include contact information on the product label for consumers to use in reporting adverse events associated with the product&#8217;s use and for us to notify the FDA of any serious adverse event report within 15 business days of receiving such report. Events reported to the FDA would not be considered an admission from a company that its product caused or contributed to the reported event. We are committed to meeting or exceeding the requirements of the DSNDCPA. 

&#160;

We are also subject to a variety of other regulations in the U.S., including those relating to bioterrorism, taxes, labor and employment, import and export, the environment and intellectual property. All of these regulations require significant financial and operational resources to ensure compliance, and we cannot assure you that we will always be in compliance despite our best efforts to do so. 

&#160; 

Our operations outside the U.S. are similarly regulated by various agencies and entities in the countries in which we operate and in which our products are sold. The regulations of these countries may conflict with those in the U.S. and may vary from country to country. The sale of our products in certain European countries is subject to the rules and regulations of the European Union, which may be interpreted differently among the countries within the European Union. In other markets outside the U.S., we may be required to obtain approvals, licenses or certifications from a country&#8217;s ministry of health or comparable agency before we begin operations or the marketing of products in that country. Approvals or licenses may be conditioned on reformulation of our products for a particular market or may be unavailable for certain products or product ingredients. These regulations may limit our ability to enter certain markets outside the U.S. As with the costs of regulatory compliance in the U.S., foreign regulations require significant financial and operational resources to ensure compliance, and we cannot assure you that we will always be in compliance despite our best efforts to do so. Our failure to maintain regulatory compliance within and outside the U.S. could impact our ability to sell our products and thus, materially impact our financial position and results of operations. 

Patents, Trademarks and Proprietary Rights 

The Company regards intellectual property, including its trademarks, service marks, website &#160; URLs (domains) and other proprietary rights, as valuable assets and part of their revered brand equity. The Company believes that protecting such intellectual property is crucial to its business strategy. The Company pursues registrations of the registrable trademarks, service marks and patents, associated with its key products in the United States, Canada, Europe and other places it distributes its products. 

The Company formulates its products using proprietary ingredient formulations, flavorings and delivery systems. To further protect its product formulations and flavors, the Company enters into agreements with manufacturers which provide exclusivity to certain products formulations and delivery technologies. When appropriate, the Company will seek to protect its research and development efforts by filing patent applications for proprietary product technologies or ingredient combinations. We have abandoned or not pursued efforts to register certain other patents and marks identifying other items in our product line for various reasons including the inability of some names to qualify for registration or patent applications to qualify for patent protection, and due to our abandonment of certain such products. All trademark registrations are protected for a period of ten years and then are renewable thereafter if still in use. 

Employees 

&#160; 

We had 32 full-time employees (18 for NDS / FitLife and 14 for iSatori) and two part-time employees (one each for NDS / FitLife and iSatori) as of December 31, 2015. We consider our employee relations to be good. In addition to the above, the Company retains consultants for certain services on an as needed basis. 

&#160; 

Environmental Regulation 

&#160; 

Our business does not require us to comply with any particular environmental regulations.
