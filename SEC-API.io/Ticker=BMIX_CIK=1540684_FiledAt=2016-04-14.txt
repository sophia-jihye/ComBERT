 Item 1. Description of Business.

Brazil Minerals, Inc. ("Brazil Minerals", the "Company", "we", "us", or "our"), together with its subsidiaries, is engaged in the business of acquiring controlling positions or significant positions with oversight roles in companies in Brazil in the minerals area or in industries related to minerals. We consolidate the results of our controlled subsidiaries in this Annual Report. 

Our progress has been steady, and can be measured in at least two quantifiable ways. First, in terms of mineral assets, in early 2013, our initial year of operations under the current business model and management team, we had 3 mineral rights. Now we have 30 mineral rights. These include:

a) 10 mineral rights that are mining concessions, the highest level of mineral right in Brazil ("Concess&#227;o de Lavra"); 

b) 8 mineral rights that have status just below mining concession ("Requerimento de Lavra"), which allows us to apply for both an upgrade to mining concession and to conduct limited commercial mining; 

c) 8 mineral rights in the research permit phase ("Autoriza&#231;&#227;o de Resquisa"), and; 

d) 4 mineral rights in the phase of application for research permit ("Requerimento de Pesquisa"). 

Please refer to the table below for details on each of these mineral rights.

&#160;

The second manner in which we expanded as a company from 2013 to now is in the product mix output from our Brazilian subsidiaries. In 2013 we produced and sold rough diamonds and gold. In 2014 we added polished diamonds. In 2015 we added sand and mortar, a product made from our sand.

From 2013 to today, we have been taking shape as a holding company owner of different subsidiaries. We now own the following stakes:

(1) &#160; 100% of BMIX Participa&#231;&#245;es Ltda. ("BMIXP"). BMIXP owns the mineral right for a large area (24,708 acres) located in the state of Amazonas, in the Amazon region of Brazil, with a known presence of gold. 

&#160;

(2) 100% of Minera&#231;&#227;o Duas Barras Ltda. ("MDB"). MDB holds title to two mineral rights, including a mining concession for diamonds, gold and sand. It also owns and operates the largest alluvial processing plant for diamonds and gold in Latin America and has a Brazilian permit to export its diamond production.

&#160;

- 3 -

(3) &#160; 50% of RST Recursos Minerais Ltda. ("RST"). RST holds title to storied mineral rights for diamonds and gold along a premier area in the Jequitinhonha River valley, a well-known area for diamonds and gold for over two centuries. Many of the RST areas are located near MDB's plant. 

(4) &#160; 100% of Hercules Brasil Ltda. ("HBR"). HBR owns an operating mortar manufacturing plant and markets a line of three mortar products for sale to the local construction market under the brand name "Hercules". 

Business Developments &#160; 

Some significant developments to our business during 2015 in chronological order were as follows:

(1) In January 2015, Brazil's mining department approved the addition of sand as a mineral entity to one of our mining concessions. With the addition of sand, MDB's mining concession now permits the mining of diamonds, gold and sand. Geological work performed by an outside consultancy estimated at 454,813 tons the amount of free sand available superficially in one of several areas at our mining concession. Sand is beneficial to us in two ways: its cash flows are independent from diamond and gold operations and it is easily obtained with very low extraction costs. Our high quality sand, as attested by geochemical analysis, is sought after for use in civil construction and preparation of multiple materials. Sand is available naturally since we are at the margins of a river, but, in particular, sand can be continuously replenished or partially replenished over time since sand is also a byproduct of the processing of gravel at our diamond and gold recovery plant. 

&#160;

(2) In March 2015, we retained Jos&#233; Francescatto, a well-known diamond and gold geologist, to be our Senior Geologist. Mr. Francescatto has over 36 years of experience primarily in diamond and gold properties. In particular, he was the Chief of Geology at Minera&#231;&#227;o Tejucana S/A ("Tejucana"). Tejucana has a revered history as the most successful diamond mining company in Brazil. It mined mostly inside the Jequitinhonha River using dredges. Our subsidiary RST is the successor owner for most of Tejucana's diamond and gold properties. The river banks of the RST areas were not explored by Tejucana, and thus remain promising locations for mining. Mr. Francescatto has also worked at Kinross, a large global miner. 

&#160;

(3) During Q2 2015, and also subsequent to the end of the quarter, we announced drilling results of an area belonging to our RST subsidiary (the "RST Initial Area"). It is a dry location, amenable to a program of extraction by open surface excavation and removal and transport of its white gravel to our diamond and gold processing and recovery plant. In relative terms, this researched locale was small compared to the total surface area of this mineral right, which measures 5.3 million square meters or 1,310 acres. While the results obtained have been highly encouraging, there is no assurance that these preliminary findings will be replicable to the entirety of or other locations in this area, or that a material amount of minerals will be found. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

(4) In April 2015, we announced that we had mined our largest rough diamond to date at 4.01 carats. This diamond was cut and polished in Brazil, and yielded a highly attractive 2.01 carat pear shaped polished diamond. 

(5) In May 2015, we launched and began production of our mortar though our newly created subsidiary, Hercules Brasil Ltda. ("HBR"). 

Initially, Hercules is focused on the production and sale of mortar. A medium size plant that can produce mortar, grout and other industrialized sand products has been fully built and is operating. The plant is located next to a busy asphalt highway to facilitate transportation and is 18 miles away from our MDB sand mine. It operates on electric power which lowers costs and utilizes a staff of three. At full capacity, with a staff of five, the plant has the capacity to produce up to 25,000 bags of mortar per month.

The content of sand per weight in a mortar bag ranges from approximately 80% to 90%. On a per kilogram basis, the aggregate value realized from recent mortar sales is 10 to 40 times that of raw sand. Gross product margins obtained on initial mortar sales to stores have ranged from 100% to 300% depending on the type of mortar sold.

Specialists in mortar have worked in developing proprietary formulations which utilize the MDB raw sand for the Hercules mortar. Hercules currently produces the three basic types of mortar used in Brazilian construction: AC-I, AC-II, and AC-III, which have increasing levels of strength. Although mortars have been around for a long time, some specific and innovative solutions were devised that allow Hercules to increase the quality and lower the cost of its products. We believe that initial market response has noted that Hercules products are of high quality and comparable to the best national brands.

Hercules buys sand from our MDB mine and processes it at the mortar plant, adding specific other ingredients for each type of mortar, mixing them, and finally packaging the resulting mixtures in 20-kg bags. AC-I bags have blue details, whereas AC-II bags have details in red and AC-III green.

"Hercules" is the brand name adopted for the mortar business; it has been protected as a trademark in Brazil. Initial buyers of Hercules mortar have been small construction materials stores; some are already recurrent buyers with predictable bi-weekly orders. The Company believes that over time, it will have several additional as well as larger stores and chains as costumers. Some small amount of Hercules mortar has also been sold directly to retail buyers at higher gross margins. We believe that the metropolitan region of Montes Claros, northern part of Minas Gerais state, with a population of over 1 million residents, is an attractive market for our mortar.

In keeping with our entrepreneurial spirit, the entrance into construction materials added a new business which on a standalone basis can have strong prospects for margin and growth. Of relevance to us as a holding company is the fact that cash flows from the construction materials business are uncorrelated to those from diamond and gold mining.

(6) In June 2015, we announced that we had cut our Brazilian fixed costs by 50% as a result of the relocation of our Brazilian administration to an office 15 miles away from our diamond, gold and sand mine operations. To facilitate oversight and communications we eliminated the Belo Horizonte office, which had been established before our acquisitions and located over 300 miles away from the MDB and RST areas. Because of savings in both labor and office costs and the elimination of travel and lodging expenses, the result of the relocation was a large decrease in Brazilian fixed costs.

(7) In July 2015, we completed all contractual cash payments for the purchase of our 50% stake in RST, a Brazilian company with 10 mining concessions and other minerals rights.. Prior to our involvement, the last time RST shares had been acquired by a publicly-traded company occurred in June 2008, when a Canadian issuer contractually agreed to pay US$10.5 million dollars for 100% of RST. Subsequently, and as part of such contractual agreement, this Canadian buyer paid US$2 million to the sellers, but was unable to pay the remainder due to the global financial crisis affecting its situation. RST was not explored by it or other owners since then and its areas have remained essentially untouched.

(8) In September 2015, MDB obtained a 4-year renewal of its environmental license for operations ("Licen&#231;a de Opera&#231;&#227;o"). MDB can reapply for continuous renewals of such license every four years. On September 8, 2015, MDB's renewal application was voted favorably by the COPAM committee, which is made up of representatives from different segments of the local community; the tally was ten votes in favor of our renewal and one abstention. This public vote was held in Montes Claros, state of Minas Gerais, the nearest large city to MDB's mine. We believe that obtaining an environmental license for any mining company in Brazil is a substantial achievement, as the process is a long and detailed, and many studies are required.

(9) In September 2015, we began to expand and improve a dirt road to connect our large diamond and gold recovery plant to the RST Initial Area a few miles away, where we intend to conduct operations for the next several years.

(10) In November 2015, we filed the necessary documents for further permitting of a 24,708-acre gold area in the state of Amazonas, Brazil. In this filling, we have added the mineral copper, also identifiable in the area. In prior filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, we have referred to this area as "Borba". It is a mineral right located in the Apui area of Amazonas, a region of the Amazon now well known for gold deposits. 

(11) In November 2015, we filed the necessary documents for further permitting of the second mineral right that belongs to MDB, and which encompasses an area of 982 acres. This mineral right has not been explored before and holds promise for future mining for diamonds and gold. Our technical team encountered in this area a type of gravel locally called "grupi&#225;ria", which is known for having a lower density concentration of diamonds but yielding much larger stones diamonds when they do occur.

Emerging Growth Company Status

&#160;

We may be deemed to be an "emerging growth company" as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or JOBS Act. As long as we remain an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not "emerging growth companies" including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding an annual nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and seeking nonbinding stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an "emerging growth company."

Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.

We will remain an "emerging growth company" for up to five years, although we would cease to be an "emerging growth company" prior to such time if we have more than $1 billion in annual revenue, more than $700 million in market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates, or issue more than $1 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period.

Markets

&#160;

Rough Diamonds

The market for our rough diamonds is potentially global as we have attracted interest from many foreign buyers. To date we have sold our rough diamonds only in Brazil and to Brazilian institutional buyers that represent merchants from other countries. We have the necessary Siscomex export license obtained from the Brazilian regulatory agency and therefore we can export rough diamonds in the future. The export process for rough diamonds involves obtaining the Kimberly certification on each rough diamond set being exported. This certificate is obtained in the mining department and attests to the fact that we have all of the necessary licensing and that the diamonds are ethically produced. The Kimberly certification is a United Nations procedure to which Brazil is a signatory member; it seeks to eliminate from the global market the so-called "blood diamonds," mined under conditions of duress and without regard for the environment.

The price of our rough diamonds is mostly determined by the overall global market price for diamonds of similar size and characteristics; the prices are quoted in U.S. dollars per carat. For each lot available, we have had several interested and potential buyers, and normally receive multiple bids.

Polished Diamonds

The market for our polished diamonds is global. To date we have sold our polished diamonds in Brazil and abroad. The sales in Brazil were made to a large jewelry chain that is in business since 1946 and caters to the medium-high end of the market. The sales of our diamonds to buyers from abroad were to high net worth individuals interested in acquisition for asset diversification as well as future use in jewelry pieces. Since we have the necessary Siscomex export license, the export process is rather easy for polished diamonds.

&#160;

&#160;

- 7 -

The price for our polished diamonds is determined just like it is for any other polished diamond, and thus primarily by the so-called four C's &#8211; color, carat weight, clarity, and cut. All of our exported diamonds to date have been certified and graded at the Gemological Institute of America ("GIA"), considered the premier analytical laboratory for diamonds and other gems in the world. The highest color grade our polished diamonds have obtained from GIA has been "E", the 2 nd highest possible grade (the color scale starts at "D"). The best clarity our polished diamonds have obtained has been "VVS1", the 2 nd best clarity possible. The majority of our polished diamonds have been graded F-G for color and VVS2-VS2 for clarity. Their weight has been approximately between 0.4 and 2.0 carats. The Rapaport valuation of our polished diamonds graded at GIA has been approximately $3,250 per carat. Rapaport is a premier diamond service provider that publishes well-known, periodic pricing valuations for diamonds based on the four C's, as described above. The prices for our diamonds are quoted in U.S. dollars. 

Gold

The market for our gold is local. There is strong demand from multiple Brazilian buyers. The price of our 96%-purity gold bars is determined by the London price for gold on the day of sale. The prices for our gold are quoted in U.S. dollars. 

Sand

The market for our sand is local, driven by demands of residential and commercial construction. There are a large number of local buyers for our sand. Our sand was analyzed at a top analytical laboratory in Brazil and found to have very high silica levels and low organic matter, both characteristics of high quality sand. We price our sand based on whether it is retrieved by the buyer directly in our sand mine versus being delivered by us, and the size of the trucks used, which determines the volume purchased. The prices for our sand are quoted in Brazilian reais, the local currency.

Mortar

The market for our mortar is local, also driven by demands of residential and commercial construction. We sell mortar to stores and directly to the consumer. The prices for our mortar are quoted in Brazilian reais.

Demand

Demand for our products has been robust. We are constrained by logistical issues (eg., waiting for permits from the mining department to begin mining), equipment malfunction (eg., waiting for repair of excavator, tractor, etc.), and at times, working capital. There is currently no lack of buyers or demand for any of our products.

Overall, there has been an increase in the global demand for rough and polished diamonds, primarily driven by the improvement in the U.S. economy and continued repressed demand from emerging markets such as China and India. Gold has strong continued demand for both jewelry and as an alternative asset. Demand for our sand is robust given that there is no other licensed sand mine within a radius of approximately 200 miles. We have experienced good demand for our mortar, possibly because of its quality, and at times buyers had to wait for us to be able to fulfill their orders.

Distribution

We have not had material issues or bottlenecks with distribution of our products. For mortar, as our production grows, we expect to rely on third-party truckers to transport mortar from our factory to stores and distribution centers.

Competition

&#160;

Diamonds, gold, and sand production are difficult fields to penetrate due to regulatory requirements, long wait times for permitting, and limited availability of new resource areas.

&#160;

&#160;

- 8 -

Our competitive position among suppliers of diamonds and gold is particularly strong because both MDB and RST are known companies in the Brazilian diamond trade and have the necessary minerals rights and environmental licenses in place. Therefore, our merchandise, whether rough diamonds, polished diamonds, or gold is able to be purchased openly and without restrictions since all of the supporting proof of provenance is available and in good order. Other producers that lack rights or licenses do not enjoy our position and can only sell into the "black market," possibly at a substantial discount and facing legal risks.

&#160;

A secondary reason for our strong competitive position is that the diamonds from the Jequitinhonha River valley are known in Brazil and in global diamond centers to be of high quality. Since our sources of diamonds are secondary valley deposits, it is presumed that the primary kimberlitic source of such diamonds suffered erosion by the river for millions of years. In this lengthy process, over millions of years, smaller, but well proportioned, "hardy" gems resulted. These rough diamonds are fairly easy to be cut and polished, and yield attractive, naturally-appealing polished diamonds.

We have very little competition from other sand providers as simply there are no licensed sand mines in a large radius around our location.

We do face competition with respect to mortar. In the local market in which we operate, one finds a few "national" mortar brands, with high name recognition, and some other local brands. It is still early for us in this market, but our differentiators to date have been both quality and reasonable prices. We have also offered stores the ability to pay for our mortar in installments lasting 15 to 60 days, depending on the quantity ordered, which facilitates sales.

Seasonality

&#160;

Our ability to mine for diamonds and gold is highly seasonal. The rainy season where our diamond and gold production is lasts from December through April. We therefore expect that during these months our revenues will be substantially lower than during other periods. The ability to retrieve sand from our sand mine is also impacted during this rainy season, but in lesser scale. The ability to produce mortar is impacted only in the strongest adverse weather such as sometimes occur in January and February, with the heaviest rains.

Raw Materials

We do not have any material dependence on any raw material or raw material supplier. All of the raw materials that we need are available from numerous suppliers and at market-driven prices.

Intellectual Property

We have secured the right to use the name "Hercules" for our mortar with the Brazilian intellectual property agency. We have proprietary formulations for three different types of mortar that we sell.

Government Regulation 

&#160; &#160; 

The Brazilian mining industry is highly regulated. We spend a considerable amount of time preparing filings requested by the mining and the environmental regulatory agencies. We also spend a considerable amount of time urging these agencies to more expeditiously review our filings so that we can move to production. We consider our operations in Brazil to be in compliance with Brazilian federal, state, and municipal regulations. There is no governmental control of the selling of our diamonds (whether rough or polished), gold, sand, and mortar.

&#160;

- 9 -

Mining Regulation and Compliance

Mining regulation in Brazil is carried out by the mining department, a federal entity. Each state in Brazil has a state-level office of this federal entity. For each mineral right that we own, we file any paperwork related to it in the office of the mining department in the state in which such mineral right occurs.

We follow the status of any processes with the environmental agency by periodic visitation to such office. We maintain what we believe to be a good relationship with the offices of the environmental agency and believe that our methods of monitoring are adequate for our current needs.

&#160;

The mining department normally inspects our operations once a year via an unannounced visit which is their standard practice. The Company estimates that it costs $25,000 annually to currently maintain compliance with various mining regulations.

Environmental Regulation and Compliance

Environmental regulation in Brazil is carried out by a state-level agency, which may have multiple offices, one for each region of the state. For each mineral right that we own, we file any paperwork related to it in the local office of the environmental agency that has the applicable geographical jurisdiction.

We follow the status of any processes with the environmental agency by periodic visitation to such office. We maintain a good relationship with the offices of the environmental agency and believe that our methods of monitoring are adequate for our current needs.

The environmental agency normally inspects our operations once every one or two years which is standard practice for companies in good standing. We believe that we are in compliance with environmental laws in our applicable jurisdictions. The Company estimates that it costs $25,000 annually to currently maintain compliance with various environmental regulations.

Surface disturbance from open pit mining at MDB is in full compliance with its mining plan. Furthermore, MDB regularly recuperates areas that have been exploited. The current environmental regulations state that after all mining has ceased at MDB (however long that may take), there would still be five years of available time for any necessary recuperation to be performed. The separation process for diamonds and gold at MDB does not use any chemical products. Tests are conducted regularly and there are no records of groundwater contamination.

&#160;

Export Regulation

&#160;

The export of rough diamonds from Brazil complies with the United Nations Kimberley Process certification system of which Brazil is a signatory country. This system was implemented by a large number of member countries of the United Nations to marginalize and prevent entrance to the diamond marketplace of those gems produced in areas where human exploitation and other specific illicit activities exist. To our knowledge, Brazil was never a jurisdiction that had any issues of these types.

&#160;

Two of our subsidiaries have been granted export licenses, and therefore we can export either rough or polished diamonds. Gold is too heavy and is best sold locally, since its price is essentially the same as abroad. There is no cost to maintain the export license active.

&#160;

Employees and Independent Contractors

As of March 25, 2016, we had 11 full-time equivalent employees and 2 part-time contractors. We also periodically retain consultants to provide specific services deemed necessary. We consider our employee relations to be very good.

Form &#38; Year of Organization &#38; History to Date

We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 15, 2011. From inception until December 2012, we were focused in the software business, which generated minimal revenues and was discontinued when the current management team and business focus began. The Company changed its name to Brazil Minerals, Inc. in December 2012.
