Transportation and Storage Agreements 

&#160; 

SJG has direct connections to the interstate pipeline systems of both Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Company, LLC (Transco) and Columbia Gas Transmission, LLC (Columbia). During 2015, SJG purchased and had delivered approximately 44.8 million decatherms (MMdts) of natural gas for distribution to both on-system and off-system customers and for injections into storage. Of this total, 28.1 MMdts were transported on the Transco pipeline system while 16.7 MMdts were transported on the Columbia pipeline system. Moreover, during 2015 third-party suppliers delivered 30.4 MMdts to SJG's system on behalf of end use customers behind SJG's city gate stations. SJG also secures other long-term services from Dominion Transmission, Inc. (Dominion), a pipeline upstream of the Transco and Columbia systems. Services provided by Dominion are utilized to deliver gas into either the Transco or Columbia systems for ultimate delivery to SJG. Services provided by all of the above-mentioned pipelines are subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Unless otherwise indicated, our intentions are to renew or extend these service agreements before they expire. 

&#160; 

Transcontinental Gas Pipeline (Transco): 

&#160; 

Transco is SJG's largest supplier of long-term gas transmission services which includes both year-round and seasonal firm transportation (FT) service arrangements. When combined, these FT services enable SJG to purchase gas from third parties and have delivered to its city gate stations by Transco a total of 297,958 dts per day (dts/d). Of this total, 133,917 dts/d is long-haul FT (where gas can be transported from the production areas of the Southwest to the market areas of the Northeast) while 164,041 dts/d is market area FT. The terms of SJG's year-round agreements extend for various periods through 2025. SJG's seasonal agreements are currently operating under their respective evergreen provisions. 

&#160; 

Of the 297,958 dts/d of Transco services mentioned above, SJG has released a total of 49,041 dts/d of its market area FT service. These releases were made in association with SJG's Conservation Incentive Program (CIP) discussed further under Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations". In addition, SJG released a total of 50,000 dts/d of its long-haul FT as part of Asset Management Agreements (AMA). The AMA-related releases are discussed below under &#8220;Gas Supplies&#8221;. In addition, SJG released a total of 30,000 dts/d of its long-haul FT as an Off-System Sale capacity release. 

SJG currently has six long-term gas storage service agreements with Transco that, when combined, are capable of storing approximately 5.0 MMdts. Through these agreements, SJG can inject gas into market and production area storages during periods of low demand and extract gas at a Maximum Daily Withdrawal Quantity (MDWQ) of up to 107,407 dts during periods of high demand. The longest term of these storage service agreements extends through March 31, 2023. 

&#160; 

Dominion: 

SJG subscribes to a firm storage service from Dominion, under its Rate Schedule GSS. This storage has an MDWQ of 10,000 dts during the period between November 16 and March 31 of each winter season, with an associated total storage capacity of 423,000 dts. Gas withdrawn from Dominion GSS storage is delivered through both the Dominion and Transco (Leidy Line) pipeline systems for delivery to SJG service territory. The primary term of this agreement extends through March 31, 2019. 

&#160; 

South Jersey Industries, Inc. 

Part I 

Columbia: 

&#160; 

SJG subscribes to four firm transportation agreements with Columbia which provide for an aggregate of 104,022 dts/d with the term of 9,000 dts/d of this capacity extending through October 31, 2017 while the term of 45,022 dts/d of this deliverability extends through October 31, 2019. The remaining 50,000 dts/d continues through October 31, 2030. SJG released 8,671 dts/d of this amount to SJRG in conjunction with its Conservation Incentive Program (CIP) thereby reducing the combined availability of firm transportation on the Columbia system to 95,351 dts/d. In addition, SJG released a total of 20,000 dts/d of this capacity to a gas marketer as part of an AMA leaving a net of 75,351 dts/d available to SJG. This AMA-related release is further discussed below under &#8220;Gas Supplies.&#8221; 

SJG also subscribes to a firm storage service with Columbia under its Rate Schedule FSS along with an associated firm transportation service under Rate Schedule SST, each of which extends through October 31, 2019. SJG has a total FSS MDWQ of 52,891 dts and a related 3,473,022 dts of storage capacity. SJG released to SJRG 19,029 dts/d of its FSS MDWQ along with 1,249,485 dts of its FSS storage capacity. Additionally, SJG released to SJRG 19,029 dts/d of its Columbia SST transportation service. Both releases made by SJG were in connection with its CIP and extend through September 30, 2016. 

&#160; 

Gas Supplies 

During 2015, SJG entered into an AMA with a gas marketer which extends through March 31, 2016. Under this agreement SJG released to the marketer its firm transportation rights equal to 30,000 dts/d of transportation capacity on Transco. The marketer manages this capacity and provides SJG with up to 30,000 dts/d of firm deliverability each day through March 31, 2016. The marketer's intent was to optimize the capacity released to them under this AMA and pay SJG a monthly asset management fee. 

Also during 2015, SJG entered into two additional AMA's with two separate gas marketers which both extend through October 31, 2016. Under these agreements, SJG has released to each of the marketers firm transportation rights equal to 10,000 dts/d of transportation capacity on Transco. The marketers manage their respective capacity and provide SJG with up to 10,000 dts/d each of firm deliverability everyday through October 31, 2016. The marketers will seek to optimize the capacity released to them under these AMA's and pay SJG a one-time asset management fee. 

Also during 2015, SJG entered into two further AMA's with two separate gas marketers which both also extend through October 31, 2016. Under these agreements, SJG has released to each of the marketers firm transportation rights equal to 10,000 dts/d of transportation capacity on Columbia. The marketers manage their respective capacity and provide SJG with up to 10,000 dts/d each of firm deliverability everyday through March 31, 2016. The marketers will seek to optimize the capacity released to it under these AMA's and pay SJG a one-time asset management fee. 

In 2011, SJG entered into a long-term gas purchase agreement with a gas producer, the primary term of which extends through October 31, 2019. The maximum daily quantities (MDQ) available for purchase under this agreement initially start at 6,250 dts/d and ratchet up to an MDQ of 25,000 dts/d. Gas purchased from this producer will be sourced in the Appalachian supply areas and delivered into the Columbia pipeline system for delivery to SJG. 

As part of its gas purchasing strategy, SJG uses financial contracts to hedge against forward price risk. These contracts are recoverable through SJG&#8217;s Basic Gas Supply Service Clause (BGSS), subject to the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU) approval. 

&#160; 

Supplemental Gas Supplies 

During 2015, SJG purchased Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) from two separate third party LNG suppliers. This LNG was purchased as a supply source to replenish SJG's LNG inventory at its storage facility, located in McKee City, NJ. SJG purchased LNG from one supplier during the 2014-15 winter season, and from a second supplier during the 2015 summer season and the 2015-16 winter season. 

South Jersey Industries, Inc. 

Part I 

SJG operates peaking facilities which can store and vaporize LNG for injection into its distribution system. SJG's LNG facility has a storage capacity equivalent to 434,300 dts of natural gas and has an installed capacity to vaporize up to 118,250 dts of LNG per day for injection into its distribution system. 

&#160; 

Peak-Day Supply 

&#160; 

SJG plans for a winter season peak-day demand on the basis of an average daily temperature of 2 degrees Fahrenheit (F). Gas demand on such a design day for the 2015-2016 winter season is estimated to be 503,873 dts (excluding industrial customers). SJG projects that it has adequate supplies and interstate pipeline entitlements to meet its design requirements. SJG experienced its highest peak-day demand for calendar year 2015 &#32;of 507,219 dts (including industrial customers) on February 15, while experiencing an average temperature of 10.1 degrees F that day. 

&#160; 

Natural Gas Prices 

&#160; 

SJG's average cost of natural gas purchased and delivered in 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , including demand charges, was $4.71 per dt, $6.56 per dt and $4.81 per dt, respectively.

Transportation and Storage Agreements - Natural Gas 

&#160; 

Access to gas suppliers and cost of gas are significant to the operations of SJE. No material part of the business of SJE is dependent upon a single customer or a few customers. SJE purchases delivered gas only, primarily from SJRG. Consequently, SJE maintains no transportation or storage agreements. 

&#160; 

Electric Supply 

&#160; 

Due to the liquidity in the market, SJE primarily purchases delivered electric in the day-ahead and real-time markets through regional transmission organizations.

Patents and Franchises 

&#160; 

South Jersey Gas Company 

&#160; 

SJG holds nonexclusive franchises granted by municipalities in the seven-county area of southern New Jersey that it serves. No other natural gas public utility presently serves the territory covered by SJG's franchises. Otherwise, patents, trademarks, licenses, franchises and concessions are not material to the business of SJG. 

&#160; 

Seasonal Aspects 

&#160; 

South Jersey Gas Company 

&#160; 

SJG experiences seasonal fluctuations in sales when selling natural gas for heating purposes. SJG meets this seasonal fluctuation in demand from its firm customers by buying and storing gas during the summer months, and by drawing from storage and purchasing supplemental supplies during the heating season. As a result of this seasonality, SJG's revenues and net income are significantly higher during the first and fourth quarters than during the second and third quarters of the year. 

&#160; 

Non-Utility Companies 

&#160; 

Among SJI's non-utility activities, wholesale and retail gas marketing have seasonal patterns similar to SJG's. Activities such as energy services and energy project development do not follow seasonal patterns. Other activities, such as retail electric marketing and appliance service, can have seasonal earnings patterns that are different from the utility. While growth in the earnings contributions from nonutility operations has improved SJI's second and third quarter net income levels, the first and fourth quarters remain the periods where most of SJI's revenue and net income is produced.
