 Item 1. Business 

Summit Financial Group, Inc. (&#8220;Company&#8221; or &#8220;Summit&#8221;) is a $1.49 billion &#32;financial holding company headquartered in Moorefield, West Virginia incorporated on March 5, 1987. We provide community banking services primarily in the Eastern Panhandle and South Central regions of West Virginia and the Shenandoah Valley and Northern region of Virginia. We provide these services through our community bank subsidiary, Summit Community Bank (&#8220;Summit Community&#8221; or &#8220;Bank&#8221;). We also operate Summit Insurance Services, LLC in Moorefield, West Virginia and Leesburg, Virginia, which provides insurance brokerage services to individuals and businesses covering corporate and personal property and casualty insurance products, as well as group health and life insurance products and consulting services. 

&#160; 

Community Banking 

We provide a wide range of community banking services, including demand, savings and time deposits; commercial, real estate and consumer loans; letters of credit; and cash management services. The deposits of Summit Community are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"). 

In order to compete with other financial service providers, we principally rely upon personal relationships established by our officers, directors and employees with our clients, and specialized services tailored to meet our clients&#8217; needs. We have maintained a strong community orientation by, among other things, supporting the active participation of staff members in local charitable, civic, school, religious and community development activities. We also have a marketing program that primarily utilizes local radio and newspapers to advertise. Banking, like most industries, is becoming more dependent on technology as a means of marketing to customers, including the Internet, which we also utilize. This approach, coupled with continuity of service by the same staff members, enables Summit Community to develop long-term customer relationships, maintain high quality service and respond quickly to customer needs. We believe that our emphasis on local relationship banking, together with a prudent approach to lending, are important factors in our success and growth. 

All operational and support functions that are transparent to clients are centralized in order to achieve consistency and cost efficiencies in the delivery of products and services by each banking office. The central office provides services such as data processing, deposit operations, accounting, treasury management, loan administration, loan review, compliance, risk management and internal auditing to enhance our delivery of quality service. We also provide overall direction in the areas of credit policy and administration, strategic planning, marketing, investment portfolio management, human resources administration, and other financial and administrative services. The banking offices work closely with us to develop new products and services needed by their customers and to introduce enhancements to existing products and services. 

Lending 

Our primary lending focus is providing commercial loans to local businesses with annual sales generally ranging from $300,000 to $30 million and providing owner-occupied real estate loans to individuals. Typically, our customers have financing requirements between $50,000 and $5 million. We generally do not seek loans of more than $10 million but will consider larger lending relationships exhibiting above-average credit quality. Under our commercial banking strategy, we focus on offering a broad line of financial products and services to small and medium-sized businesses through full service banking offices. Summit Community Bank has senior management with extensive lending experience. These managers exercise substantial authority over credit and pricing decisions, subject to loan committee approval for larger credits. 

We segment our loan portfolio in to the following major lending categories: commercial, commercial real estate, construction and development, residential real estate, and consumer. Commercial loans are loans made to commercial borrowers that are not secured by real estate. These encompass loans secured by accounts receivable, inventory, and equipment, as well as unsecured loans. Commercial real estate loans consist of commercial mortgages, which generally are secured by nonresidential and multi-family residential properties. Commercial real estate loans are made to many of the same customers and carry similar industry risks as the commercial loan portfolio. Construction and development loans are loans made for the purpose of financing construction or development projects. This portfolio includes commercial and residential land development loans, one-to-four family housing construction, both pre-sold and speculative in nature, multi-family housing construction, non-residential building construction, and undeveloped land. Residential real estate loans are mortgage loans to consumers and are secured primarily by a first lien deed of trust. These loans are traditional one-to-four family residential mortgages. Also included in this category of loans are second liens on one-to-four family properties, commercial loans secured by one-to-four family residence, and home equity loans. Consumer loans are loans that establish consumer credit that is granted for the consumer&#8217;s personal use. These loans include automobile loans and recreational vehicle loans, as well as personal secured and unsecured loans. 

&#160; 

Our loan underwriting guidelines and standards are consistent with the prudent banking practices applicable to the relevant exposure and are updated periodically and presented to the Board of Directors for approval. The purpose of these standards and guidelines are: to grant loans on a sound and collectible basis; to invest available funds in a safe and profitable manner; to serve the legitimate credit needs of our primary market area; and to ensure that all loan applicants receive fair and equal treatment in the lending process. It is the intent of the underwriting guidelines and standards to: minimize losses by carefully investigating the credit history of each applicant; verify the source of repayment and the ability of the applicant to repay; collateralize those loans in which collateral is deemed to be required; exercise care in the documentation of the application, review, approval, and origination process; and administer a comprehensive loan collection program. 

Our real estate underwriting loan-to-value (&#8220;LTV&#8221;) policy limits are at or below current bank regulatory guidelines, as follows:

Our underwriting standards and practice are designed to originate both fixed and variable rate loan products, consistent with the underwriting guidelines discussed above. Adjustable rate and variable rate loans are underwritten, giving consideration both to the loan&#8217;s initial rate and to higher assumed rates, commensurate with reasonably anticipated market conditions. Accordingly, we want to insure that adequate primary repayment capacity exists to address both future increases in interest rates and fluctuations in the underlying cash flows available for repayment. Historically, we have not offered &#8220;payment option ARM&#8221; loans. Further, we have had no loan portfolio products which were specifically designed for &#8220;sub-prime&#8221; borrowers (defined as consumers with a credit score of less than 599). 

Supervision and Regulation 

General 

We are subject to regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (&#8220;FRB&#8221;), the West Virginia Division of Financial Institutions, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;), and other federal and state regulators. As a financial holding company, we are subject to the restrictions of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (&#8220;BHCA&#8221;), are registered pursuant to its provisions, and are subject to examination by the FRB. As a financial holding company doing business in West Virginia, we are also subject to regulation by and must submit annual reports to the West Virginia Division of Financial Institutions. 

The BHCA prohibits the acquisition by a financial holding company of direct or indirect ownership of more than five percent (5%) of the voting shares of any bank within the United States without prior approval of the FRB. With certain exceptions, a financial holding company is prohibited from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than five percent (5%) of the voting shares of any company that is not a bank, and from engaging directly or indirectly in business unrelated to the business of banking or managing or controlling banks. 

The FRB, in its Regulation Y, permits financial holding companies to engage in non-banking activities closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks. Approval of the FRB is necessary to engage in these activities or to make acquisitions of corporations engaging in these activities as the FRB determines whether these acquisitions or activities are in the public interest. In addition, by order, and on a case by case basis, the FRB may approve other non-banking activities. 

The BHCA permits us to purchase or redeem our own securities. However, Regulation Y provides that prior notice must be given to the FRB if the total consideration for such purchase or consideration, when aggregated with the net consideration paid by us for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months is equal to ten percent (10%) or more of our consolidated net worth. Prior notice is not required if (i) both before and immediately after the redemption, the financial holding company is well capitalized; (ii) the financial holding company is well managed and (iii) the financial holding company is not the subject of any unresolved supervisory issues. 

The FRB has broad authority to prohibit activities of bank holding companies and their non-banking subsidiaries that represent unsafe and unsound banking practices or which constitute violations of laws or regulations. The FRB also can assess civil money penalties for certain activities conducted on a knowing and reckless basis, if those activities caused a substantial loss to a depository institution. The penalties can be as high as $1 million for each day the activity continues. 

Summit Community, our only bank subsidiary, is subject to West Virginia banking statutes and regulations, and is primarily regulated by the West Virginia Division of Financial Institutions and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;). The Bank is also subject to regulations promulgated by the FRB. As a member of the FDIC, Summit Community&#8217;s deposits are insured as required by federal law. Bank regulatory authorities regularly examine revenues, loans, investments, management practices, and other aspects of Summit Community. These examinations are conducted primarily to protect depositors and not shareholders. In addition to these regular examinations, the Bank must furnish to regulatory authorities quarterly reports containing full and accurate statements of its affairs. 

Because we are a public company, we are subject to regulation by the SEC. SEC regulations require us to disclose certain types of business and financial data on a regular basis to the SEC and to our shareholders. We are required to file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. We prepare and file an annual report on Form 10-K with the SEC that contains detailed financial and operating information, as well as a management response to specific questions about our operations. SEC regulations require that our annual reports to shareholders contain certified financial statements and other specific items such as management&#8217;s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations. We must also file quarterly reports with the SEC on Form 10-Q that contain detailed financial and operating information for the prior quarter and we must file current reports on Form 8-K to provide the pubic with information on recent material events. 

In addition to periodic reporting to the SEC, we are subject to proxy rules and tender offer rules issued by the SEC. Our officers, directors and principal shareholders (holding 10% or more of our stock) must also submit reports to the SEC regarding their holdings of our stock and any changes to such holdings, and they are subject to short-swing profit liability. Because we are traded on the NASDAQ, we are also subject to the listing standards of NASDAQ. 

Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 

&#160; 

On July 21, 2010, sweeping financial regulatory reform legislation, entitled the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act&#8221; (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;), was signed into law. The Dodd-Frank Act, which is complex and broad in scope, established the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (the &#8220;CFPB&#8221;), which has extensive regulatory and enforcement powers over consumer financial products and services, and the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which has oversight authority for monitoring systemic risk. We will be required to comply with the Consumer Financial Protection Act and the CFPB&#8217;s rules; however, these rules will be enforced by our primary regulator, the FRB, not the CFPB. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act alters the authority and duties of the federal banking and securities regulatory agencies, implements certain corporate governance requirements for all public companies, including financial institutions with regard to executive compensation, proxy access by shareholders, and certain whistleblower provisions, and restricts certain proprietary trading and hedge fund and private equity activities of banks and their affiliates. Although the regulations that directly affect our business have been adopted, many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to final rulemaking by the U.S. financial regulatory agencies, and the implications of the Dodd-Frank Act for our business will depend to some extent on how such rules are adopted and implemented by the primary U.S. financial regulatory agencies. 

Bank Holding Company Activities 

&#160; 

In general, the BHC Act limits the business of bank holding companies to banking, managing or controlling banks and other activities that the FRB has determined to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto. In addition, bank holding companies that qualify and elect to be financial holding companies may engage in any activity, or acquire and retain the shares of a company engaged in any activity, that is either (i) financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity (as determined by the FRB in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury) or (ii) complementary to a financial activity and does not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally (as solely determined by the FRB), without prior approval of the FRB. 

&#160; 

Activities that are financial in nature include securities underwriting and dealing, insurance underwriting and making merchant banking investments. Some examples of non-banking activities which presently may be performed by a financial holding company are: making or acquiring, for its own account or the account of others, loans and other extensions of credit; operating as an industrial bank, or industrial loan company, in the manner authorized by state law; servicing loans and other extensions of credit; performing or carrying on any one or more of the functions or activities that may be performed or carried on by a trust company in the manner authorized by federal or state law; acting as an investment or financial advisor; leasing real or personal property; making equity or debt investments in corporations or projects designed primarily to promote community welfare, such as the economic rehabilitation and the development of low income areas; providing bookkeeping services or financially oriented data processing services for the holding company and its subsidiaries; acting as an insurance agent or a broker; acting as an underwriter for credit life insurance, which is directly related to extensions of credit by the financial holding company system; providing courier services for certain financial documents; providing management consulting advice to non-affiliated banks; selling retail money orders having a face value of not more than $1,000, traveler&#8217;s checks and U.S. savings bonds; performing appraisals of real estate; arranging commercial real estate equity financing under certain limited circumstances; providing securities brokerage services related to securities credit activities; underwriting and dealing in government obligations and money market instruments; providing foreign exchange advisory and transactional services; and acting, under certain circumstances, as futures commission merchant for non-affiliated persons in the execution and clearance on major commodity exchanges of futures contracts and options. 

&#160; 

To maintain financial holding company status, a financial holding company and all of its depository institution subsidiaries must be &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; and &#8220;well managed.&#8221; A depository institution subsidiary is considered to be &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; if it satisfies the requirements for this status discussed in the section captioned &#8220;Capital Requirements&#8221; included elsewhere in this item. A depository institution subsidiary is considered &#8220;well managed&#8221; if it received a composite rating and management rating of at least &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; in its most recent examination. A financial holding company&#8217;s status will also depend upon it maintaining its status as &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; and &#8220;well managed&#8217; under applicable FRB regulations. If a financial holding company ceases to meet these capital and management requirements, the FRB&#8217;s regulations provide that the financial holding company must enter into an agreement with the FRB to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements. Until the financial holding company returns to compliance, the FRB may impose limitations or conditions on the conduct of its activities, and the company may not commence any of the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies or acquire a company engaged in such financial activities without prior approval of the FRB. If the company does not return to compliance within 180 days, the FRB may require divestiture of the holding company&#8217;s depository institutions. Bank holding companies and banks must also be both well capitalized and well managed in order to acquire banks located outside their home state. 

&#160; 

In order for a financial holding company to commence any new activity permitted by the BHC Act or to acquire a company engaged in any new activity permitted by the BHC Act, each insured depository institution subsidiary of the financial holding company must have received a rating of at least &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; in its most recent examination under the Community Reinvestment Act. See the section captioned &#8220;Community Reinvestment Act&#8221; included elsewhere in this item. 

&#160; 

The FRB has the power to order any bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when the FRB has reasonable grounds to believe that continuation of such activity or such ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness, safety or stability of any bank subsidiary of the bank holding company. 

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Act amends the BHC Act to require the federal financial regulatory agencies to adopt rules that prohibit banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in and sponsoring certain unregistered investment companies (defined as hedge funds and private equity funds). The statutory provision is commonly called the &#8220;Volcker Rule&#8221;. The Volcker Rule became effective on July 21, 2012. On December 10, 2013, the Federal Reserve adopted final rules implementing the Volcker Rule. Compliance with the final rule became effective on April 1, 2014; however, the Federal Reserve issued an order on December 18, 2014 extending the period which institutions have to conform their activities and investments to the requirements of the Volcker Rule to July 21, 2016. The Federal Reserve also announced its intention to grant an additional one-year extension of the conformance period until July 21, 2017. On January 14, 2014, the banking agencies approved an interim rule to permit banking entities to retain interests in certain collateralized debt obligations backed primarily by trust preferred securities from the investment prohibitions of the Volcker Rule. Although we continue to evaluate the impact of the Volcker Rule and the final rules adopted thereunder, we do not anticipate that the Volcker Rule will have a material effect on our operations as we do not generally engage in the activities prohibited by the Volcker Rule. We may incur costs to adopt additional policies and systems to ensure compliance with the Volcker Rule, but any such costs are not expected to be material. 

&#160; 

The BHC Act, the Bank Merger Act, the West Virginia Banking Code and other federal and state statutes regulate acquisitions of commercial banks. The BHC Act requires the prior approval of the FRB for the direct or indirect acquisition by a bank holding company of more than 5.0% of the voting shares of a commercial bank or its parent holding company. Under the Bank Merger Act, the prior approval of the FRB or other appropriate bank regulatory authority is required for a member bank to merge with another bank or purchase the assets or assume the deposits of another bank. In reviewing applications seeking approval of merger and acquisition transactions, the bank regulatory authorities will consider, among other things, the competitive effect and public benefits of the transactions, the capital position of the combined organization, the risks to the stability of the U.S. banking or financial system, the applicant&#8217;s performance record under the Community Reinvestment Act (see the section captioned &#8220;Community Reinvestment Act&#8221; included elsewhere in this item) and its compliance with fair housing and other consumer protection laws and the effectiveness of the subject organizations in combating money laundering activities. 

&#160; 

Dividends 

&#160; 

The principal source of our liquidity is dividends from Summit Community. The prior approval of the Federal Reserve is required if the total of all dividends declared by a state-chartered member bank in any calendar year would exceed the sum of the bank&#8217;s net profits for that year and its retained net profits for the preceding two calendar years, less any required transfers to surplus or to fund the retirement of preferred stock. Federal law also prohibits a state-chartered, member bank from paying dividends that would be greater than the bank&#8217;s undivided profits. Summit Community is also subject to limitations under West Virginia state law regarding the level of dividends that may be paid. 

&#160; 

In addition, the Company and Summit Community are subject to other regulatory policies and requirements relating to the payment of dividends, including requirements to maintain adequate capital above regulatory minimums. The appropriate federal regulatory authority is authorized to determine under certain circumstances relating to the financial condition of a bank holding company or a bank that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit payment thereof. The appropriate federal regulatory authorities have stated that paying dividends that deplete a bank&#8217;s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice and that banking organizations should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings. 

&#160; 

Credit and Monetary Policies and Related Matters 

Summit Community is affected by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies, including the FRB. An important function of these policies is to curb inflation and control recessions through control of the supply of money and credit. The operations of Summit Community are affected by the policies of government regulatory authorities, including 

the FRB, which regulates money and credit conditions through open-market operations in United States Government and Federal agency securities, adjustments in the discount rate on member bank borrowings, and requirements against deposits and regulation of interest rates payable by member banks on time and savings deposits. These policies have a significant influence on the growth and distribution of loans, investments and deposits, and interest rates charged on loans, or paid for time and savings deposits, as well as yields on investments. The FRB has had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and is expected to continue to do so in the future. Future policies of the FRB and other authorities and their effect on future earnings cannot be predicted. 

The FRB has a policy that a financial holding company is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and to commit resources to support each such subsidiary bank. Under the source of strength doctrine, the FRB may require a financial holding company to contribute capital to a troubled subsidiary bank, and may charge the financial holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices for failure to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank. This capital injection may be required at times when Summit may not have the resources to provide it. Any capital loans by a holding company to any subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank. In addition, the Crime Control Act of 1990 provides that in the event of a financial holding company's bankruptcy, any commitment by such holding company to a Federal bank or thrift regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment. 

Capital Requirements 

Regulatory Capital Rules in Effect Year End 2014. As a financial holding company, we are subject to FRB risk-based capital guidelines. The federal regulatory authorities&#8217; current risk-based capital guidelines are based upon the 1988 capital accord (&#8220;Basel I&#8221;) of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the &#8220;Basel Committee&#8221;). The guidelines establish a systematic analytical framework that makes regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banking organizations, takes off-balance sheet exposures into explicit account in assessing capital adequacy, and minimizes disincentives to holding liquid, low-risk assets. Under the guidelines and related policies, financial holding companies must maintain capital sufficient to meet both a risk-based asset ratio test and leverage ratio test on a consolidated basis. The risk-based ratio is determined by allocating assets and specified off-balance sheet commitments into four weighted categories, with higher levels of capital being required for categories perceived as representing greater risk. Summit Community is subject to substantially similar capital requirements adopted by its applicable regulatory agencies. 

Under the requirements, banking organizations are required to maintain minimum ratios for Tier 1 capital and total capital to risk-weighted assets (including certain off-balance sheet items, such as letters of credit). For purposes of calculating the ratios, a banking organization&#8217;s assets and some of its specified off-balance sheet commitments and obligations are assigned to various risk categories. A depository institution&#8217;s or holding company&#8217;s capital, in turn, is classified in one of two tiers, depending on type: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Core Capital (Tier 1). Tier 1 capital includes common equity, retained earnings, qualifying non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries (and, under existing standards, a limited amount of qualifying trust preferred securities and qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock at the holding company level), less goodwill, most intangible assets and certain other assets. 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Supplementary Capital (Tier 2). Tier 2 capital includes, among other things, perpetual preferred stock and trust preferred securities not meeting the Tier 1 definition, qualifying mandatory convertible debt securities, qualifying subordinated debt, and allowances for loan and lease losses, subject to limitations. 

&#160; 

We, like other financial holding companies, currently are required to maintain Tier 1 capital and &#8220;total capital&#8221; (the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital) equal to at least 4.0% and 8.0%, respectively, of our total risk-weighted assets (including various off-balance-sheet items, such as letters of credit). Summit Community, like other depository institutions, is required to maintain similar capital levels under capital adequacy guidelines. In addition, for a depository institution to be considered &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, its Tier 1 and total capital ratios must be at least 6.0% and 10.0% on a risk-adjusted basis, respectively. 

&#160; 

Financial holding companies and banks are also currently required to comply with minimum leverage ratio requirements. The leverage ratio is the ratio of a banking organization&#8217;s Tier 1 capital to its total adjusted quarterly average assets (as defined for regulatory purposes). The requirements necessitate a minimum leverage ratio of 3.0% for bank holding companies and member banks that either have the highest supervisory rating or have implemented the appropriate federal regulatory authority&#8217;s risk-adjusted measure for market risk. All other bank holding companies and member banks are required to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%, unless a different minimum is specified by an appropriate regulatory authority. In addition, for a 

depository institution to be considered &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, its leverage ratio must be at least 5.0%. 

&#160; 

Our regulatory capital ratios and Summit Community&#8217;s capital ratios as of year end 2015 &#32;are set forth in the table in Note 18 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page 85. 

&#160; 

Basel III Capital Rules Effective Beginning 2015 . In July 2013, the Company&#8217;s and Summit Community&#8217;s federal banking regulators published the Basel III Capital Rules establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations. The rules implement the Basel Committee&#8217;s December 2010 framework known as &#8220;Basel III&#8221; for strengthening international capital standards as well as certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Basel III Capital Rules substantially revise the risk-based capital requirements applicable to financial holding companies and depository institutions, including the Company and Summit Community, compared to the current U.S. risk-based capital rules. The Basel III Capital Rules define the components of capital and address other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions&#8217; regulatory capital ratios. The Basel III Capital Rules also address risk weights and other issues affecting the denominator in banking institutions&#8217; regulatory capital ratios and replace the existing risk-weighting approach, which was derived from the Basel I capital accords of the Basel Committee, with a more risk-sensitive approach based, in part, on the standardized approach in the Basel Committee&#8217;s 2004 &#8220;Basel II&#8221; capital accords. The Basel III Capital Rules also implement the requirements of Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act to remove references to credit ratings from the federal banking agencies&#8217; rules. The Basel III Capital Rules were effective for the Company and Summit Community on January 1, 2015 (subject to a phase-in period). 

&#160; 

The Basel III Capital Rules, among other things, (i) introduce a new capital measure called &#8220;Common Equity Tier 1&#8221; (&#8220;CET1&#8221;), (ii) specify that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and &#8220;Additional Tier 1 capital&#8221; instruments meeting specified requirements, (iii) define CET1 narrowly by requiring that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital and (iv) expand the scope of the deductions/adjustments as compared to existing regulations. 

&#160; 

When fully phased in on January 1, 2019, the Basel III Capital Rules will require the Company and Summit Community to maintain (i) a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5% &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221; (which is added to the 4.5% CET1 ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7% upon full implementation), (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 6.0% Tier 1 capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5% upon full implementation), (iii) a minimum ratio of Total capital (that is, Tier 1 plus Tier 2) to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 8.0% total capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5% upon full implementation) and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 4%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average assets (as compared to a current minimum leverage ratio of 3% for banking organizations that either have the highest supervisory rating or have implemented the appropriate federal regulatory authority&#8217;s risk-adjusted measure for market risk). 

&#160; 

The aforementioned capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer will face regulatorily prescribed limitations on dividend payments, discretionary payments on tier 1 capital instruments, share buybacks, and discretionary bonus payments to certain Company officers based on the amount of the shortfall. 

Under the Basel III Capital Rules, the initial minimum capital ratios as of January 1, 2015 are as follows: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 4.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets. 

&#8226; 6.0% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets. 

&#8226; 8.0% Total capital to risk-weighted assets. 

The Basel III Capital Rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1. Furthermore, the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income items included in capital are excluded for the purposes of determining regulatory capital ratios under current capital standards. However, under the Basel III Capital Rules, the effects of certain accumulated other comprehensive items are not excluded; however, certain banking organizations, including the Company and Summit Community, may make a one-time permanent election to continue to exclude these items. The Company and Summit Community expect to make this election in order to minimize variations in the level of capital. 

The Basel III Capital Rules also preclude certain hybrid securities, such as trust preferred securities, as Tier 1 capital of bank holding companies, subject to phase-out. However, for holding companies of depository institutions with less than $15 billion in consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2009, the rules do not require a phase out of trust preferred securities issued prior to May 19, 2010. This means that all of our trust preferred securities are permanently grandfathered as Tier 1 capital instruments. 

&#160; 

Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 began on January 1, 2015 and will be phased-in over a four-year period (beginning at 40% on January 1, 2015 and an additional 20% per year thereafter). The implementation of the capital conservation buffer will begin on January 1, 2016 at the 0.625% level and be phased in over a four-year period (increasing by that amount on each subsequent January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019). 

&#160; 

With respect to Summit Community, the Basel III Capital Rules also revise the &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; regulations pursuant to Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as discussed below under &#8220;Prompt Corrective Action.&#8221; 

&#160; 

The Basel III Capital Rules prescribe a standardized approach for risk weightings that expand the risk-weighting categories from the current four Basel I-derived categories (0%, 20%, 50% and 100%) to a much larger and more risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the assets, generally ranging from 0% for U.S. government and agency securities, to 600% for certain equity exposures, and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories. Specific changes to current rules impacting our determination of risk-weighted assets include, among other things: 

&#8226; 

Applying a 150% risk weight instead of a 100% risk weight for certain high volatility commercial real estate acquisition, development and construction loans. 

&#8226; 

Assigning a 150% risk weight to exposures (other than residential mortgage exposures) that are 90 days past due. 

&#8226; 

Providing for a 20% credit conversion factor for the unused portion of a commitment with an original maturity of one year or less that is not unconditionally cancellable (currently set at 0%). 

&#8226; 

Providing for a risk weight, generally not less than 20% with certain exceptions, for securities lending transactions based on the risk weight category of the underlying collateral securing the transaction. 

In addition, the Basel III Capital Rules provide more advantageous risk weights for derivatives and repurchase-style transactions cleared through a qualifying central counterparty and increase the scope of eligible guarantors and eligible collateral for purposes of credit risk mitigation. 

&#160; 

The Basel III Capital Rules continue to apply the existing risk-based standard for residential mortgage loans which includes a 50% risk-weight for prudently underwritten first-lien mortgages that are not past due. 

&#160; 

The Company and Summit Community Bank exceed all capital adequacy requirements, including applicable conservation buffers, under the Basel III Capital Rules as if such requirements were currently in effect on a fully phased-in basis. 

Prompt Corrective Action. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 ("FDICIA") establishes a new regulatory scheme, which ties the level of supervisory intervention by bank regulatory authorities primarily to a depository institution's capital category. Among other things, FDICIA authorizes regulatory authorities to take "prompt corrective action" with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. FDICIA establishes five capital tiers: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized.The relevant capital measures, which reflect changes under the Basel III Capital Rules that became effective on January 1, 2015, are the total capital ratio, the CET1 capital ratio, the Tier 1 capital ratio and the leverage ratio. 

A bank will be (i) &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a CET1 capital ratio of 6.5% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, and a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater, and is not subject to any order or written directive by any such regulatory authority to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure; (ii) &#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221; if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, and a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater and is not &#8220;well capitalized&#8221;; (iii) &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221; if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 8.0%, a CET1 capital ratio less than 4.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0% or a leverage ratio of less than 4.0%; (iv) &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a CET1 capital ratio less than 3.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0% or a leverage ratio of less than 3.0%; and (v) &#8220;critically undercapitalized&#8221; if the institution&#8217;s tangible equity is equal to or less than 2.0% of average quarterly tangible assets. An institution may be downgraded to, or deemed to be in, a capital category that is lower than indicated by its capital ratios if it is 

determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters. A bank&#8217;s capital category is determined solely for the purpose of applying prompt corrective action regulations, and the capital category may not constitute an accurate representation of the bank&#8217;s overall financial condition or prospects for other purposes.&#8221; 

Community Reinvestment Act 

Financial holding companies and their subsidiary banks are also subject to the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (&#8220;CRA&#8221;). Under the CRA, the FRB (or other appropriate bank regulatory agency) is required, in connection with its examination of a bank, to assess such bank&#8217;s record in meeting the credit needs of the communities served by that bank, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. Further, such assessment is also required of any financial holding company that has applied to (i) charter a national bank, (ii) obtain deposit insurance coverage for a newly chartered institution, (iii) establish a new branch office that will accept deposits, (iv) relocate an office, or (v) merge or consolidate with, or acquire the assets or assume the liabilities of a federally-regulated financial institution. In the case of a financial holding company applying for approval to acquire a bank or other financial holding company, the FRB will assess the record of each subsidiary of the applicant financial holding company, and such records may be the basis for denying the application or imposing conditions in connection with approval of the application. On December 8, 1993, the Federal regulators jointly announced proposed regulations to simplify enforcement of the CRA by substituting the present twelve (12) categories with three (3) assessment categories for use in calculating CRA ratings (the &#8220;December 1993 Proposal&#8221;). In response to comments received by the regulators regarding the December 1993 Proposal, the federal bank regulators issued revised CRA proposed regulations on September 26, 1994 (the &#8220;Revised CRA Proposal&#8221;). The Revised CRA Proposal, compared to the December 1993 Proposal, essentially broadens the scope of CRA performance examinations and more explicitly considers community development activities. Moreover, in 1994, the Department of Justice became more actively involved in enforcing fair lending laws. 

In the most recent CRA examination by the bank regulatory authorities, Summit Community was given a &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; CRA rating. 

Graham-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 

The enactment of the Graham-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (the &#8220;GLB Act&#8221;) represents a pivotal point in the history of the financial services industry. The GLB Act swept away large parts of a regulatory framework that had its origins in the Depression Era of the 1930s. New opportunities were available for banks, other depository institutions, insurance companies and securities firms to enter into combinations that permit a single financial services organization to offer customers a more complete array of financial products and services. The GLB Act provides a new regulatory framework through the financial holding company, which has as its &#8220;umbrella regulator&#8221; the FRB. Functional regulation of the financial holding company&#8217;s separately regulated subsidiaries is conducted by their primary functional regulators. The GLB Act makes a CRA rating of satisfactory or above necessary for insured depository institutions and their financial holding companies to engage in new financial activities. The GLB Act specifically gives the FRB the authority, by regulation or order, to expand the list of &#8220;financial&#8221; or &#8220;incidental&#8221; activities, but requires consultation with the U.S. Treasury Department, and gives the FRB authority to allow a financial holding company to engage in any activity that is &#8220;complementary&#8221; to a financial activity and does not &#8220;pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Under the GLB Act, all financial institutions are required to adopt privacy policies, restrict the sharing of nonpublic customer data with nonaffiliated parties at the customer&#8217;s request, and establish procedures and practices to protect customer data from unauthorized access. We have established policies and procedures to assure our compliance with all privacy provisions of the GLB Act. 

Deposit Acquisition Limitation 

Under West Virginia banking law, an acquisition or merger is not permitted if the resulting depository institution or its holding company, including its affiliated depository institutions, would assume additional deposits to cause it to control deposits in the State of West Virginia in excess of twenty five percent (25%) of such total amount of all deposits held by insured depository institutions in West Virginia. This limitation may be waived by the Commissioner of Banking by showing good cause. 

Consumer Laws and Regulations 

In addition to the banking laws and regulations discussed above, bank subsidiaries are also subject to certain consumer laws and regulations that are designed to protect consumers in transactions with banks. Among the more prominent of such laws and regulations are the Truth in Lending Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and Regulation C, the Electronic Funds Transfer 

Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, and the Fair Housing Act. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits or making loans to such customers. Bank subsidiaries must comply with the applicable provisions of these consumer protection laws and regulations as part of their ongoing customer relations. 

Dodd-Frank centralized responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating the CFPB, and giving it responsibility for implementing, examining and enforcing compliance with federal consumer protection laws. The CFPB has broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement authority over consumer financial products and services, including deposit products, residential mortgages, home-equity loans, and credit cards. The CFPB&#8217;s functions include investigating consumer complaints, rulemaking, supervising and examining banks&#8217; consumer transactions, and enforcing rules related to consumer financial products and services. Banks with less than $10 billion in assets, such as Summit Community, will be subject to these federal consumer financial laws, but will continue to be examined for compliance by the FDIC, its primary federal banking regulator. 

&#160; 

On January 10, 2013, the CFPB issued final regulations implementing provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that require all creditors to determine a consumer&#8217;s ability to repay a mortgage loan before making a loan. The final rule, referred to as the Ability-to Repay (ATR)/Qualified Mortgage (QM) standards, provide that a lender making a special type of loan, known as a Qualified Mortgage, is entitled to presume that the loan complies with the ATR safe harbor requirements. The rule establishes different types of Qualified Mortgages that are generally identified as loans with restrictions on loan features, limits on fees being charged and underwriting requirements. The ATR/QM standards were effective for loan applications taken on or after January 10, 2014. 

&#160; 

USA Patriot Act of 2001 

The USA Patriot Act of 2001 and its related regulations require insured depository institutions, broker-dealers, and certain other financial institutions to have policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing. The statute and its regulations also provide for information sharing, subject to conditions, between federal law enforcement agencies and financial institutions, as well as among financial institutions, for counter-terrorism purposes. Federal banking regulators are required, when reviewing bank holding company acquisition and bank merger applications, to take into account the effectiveness of the anti-money laundering activities of the applicants. 

Pursuant to Title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, we, like all other financial institutions, are required to: 

&#8226; 

provide notice to our customers regarding privacy policies and practices, 

&#8226; 

inform our customers regarding the conditions under which their non-public personal information may be disclosed to non-affiliated third parties, and 

&#8226; 

give our customers an option to prevent certain disclosure of such information to non-affiliated third parties. 

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (&#8220;SOA&#8221;) addresses, among other issues, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information. SOA requires our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer each to certify that Summit&#8217;s Quarterly and Annual Reports do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact. The rules have several requirements, including requiring these officers certify that: they are responsible for establishing, maintaining and regularly evaluating the effectiveness of our internal controls; they have made certain disclosures to our auditors and the audit committee of the Board of Directors about our internal controls; and they have included information in Summit&#8217;s Quarterly and Annual Reports about their evaluation and whether there have been significant changes in our internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect internal controls subsequent to the evaluation. 

Furthermore, in response to the directives of the SOA, NASDAQ adopted substantially expanded corporate governance criteria for the issuers of securities quoted on the NASDAQ Capital Market (the market on which our common stock is listed for trading). The new NASDAQ rules govern, among other things, the enhancement and regulation of corporate disclosure and internal governance of listed companies and of the authority, role and responsibilities of their boards of directors and, in particular, of &#8220;independent&#8221; members of such boards of directors, in the areas of nominations, corporate governance, compensation and the monitoring of the audit and internal financial control processes. 

Cybersecurity 

In March 2015, federal regulators issued two related statements regarding cybersecurity. One statement indicates that financial institutions should design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials, including security measures to reliably authenticate customers accessing internet-based services of the financial institution. The other statement indicates that a financial institution&#8217;s management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid recovery, resumption and maintenance of the institution&#8217;s operations after a cyber-attack involving destructive malware. A financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations and address rebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service providers fall victim to this type of cyber-attack. If we fail to observe the regulatory guidance, we could be subject to various regulatory sanctions, including financial penalties. 

In the ordinary course of business, we rely on electronic communications and information systems to conduct our operations and to store sensitive data. We employ an in-depth, layered, defensive approach that leverages people, processes and technology to manage and maintain cybersecurity controls. We employ a variety of preventative and detective tools to monitor, block, and provide alerts regarding suspicious activity, as well as to report on any suspected advanced persistent threats. Notwithstanding the strength of our defensive measures, the threat from cyber attacks is severe, attacks are sophisticated and increasing in volume, and attackers respond rapidly to changes in defensive measures. While to date, we have not experienced a significant compromise, significant data loss or any material financial losses related to cybersecurity attacks, our systems and those of our customers and third-party service providers are under constant threat and it is possible that we could experience a significant event in the future. Risks and exposures related to cybersecurity attacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, as well as due to the expanding use of Internet banking, mobile banking and other technology-based products and services by us and our customers. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a further discussion of risks related to cybersecurity. 

Transactions with Affiliates 

Federal law restricts subsidiary banks of a financial holding company from making certain extensions of credit to the parent financial holding company or to any of its subsidiaries; from investing in the holding company stock; and limits the ability of a subsidiary bank to take its parent company stock as collateral for the loans of any borrower. Additionally, federal law prohibits a financial holding company and its subsidiaries from engaging in certain tie-&#173;in arrangements in conjunction with the extension of credit or furnishing of services. 

&#160; 

There are various statutory and regulatory limitations, including those set forth in sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and the related Federal Reserve Regulation W, governing the extent to which the bank will be able to purchase assets from or securities of or otherwise finance or transfer funds to us or our non-banking affiliates. Among other restrictions, such transactions between the bank and any one affiliate (including Summit) generally will be limited to ten percent (10%) of the bank&#8217;s capital and surplus, and transactions between the bank and all affiliates will be limited to twenty percent (20%) of the bank&#8217;s capital and surplus. Furthermore, loans and extensions of credit are required to be secured in specified amounts and are required to be on terms and conditions consistent with safe and sound banking practices. 

&#160; 

In addition, any transaction by a bank with an affiliate and any sale of assets or provisions of services to an affiliate generally must be on terms that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable, to the bank as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non-affiliated companies. 

&#160; 

Incentive Compensation 

The Federal Reserve Board reviews, as part of its regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as Summit, that are not &#8220;large, complex banking organizations.&#8221; These reviews are tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organization&#8217;s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. The findings of this supervisory initiative will be included in reports of examination. Deficiencies will be incorporated into the organization&#8217;s supervisory ratings, which can affect the organization&#8217;s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization&#8217;s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies. 

In June 2010, the Federal Reserve Board, OCC and FDIC issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to 

materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization&#8217;s incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization&#8217;s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization&#8217;s board of directors. 

In April 2011, the Federal Reserve Board, other federal banking agencies and the SEC jointly published proposed rulemaking designed to implement provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act prohibiting incentive compensation arrangements that would encourage inappropriate risk taking at a covered institution, which includes a bank or bank holding company with $1 billion or more of assets, such as Summit. The proposed rule (i) prohibits incentive-based compensation arrangements that encourage executive officers, employees, directors or principal shareholders to expose the institution to inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation (based on the standards for excessive compensation adopted pursuant to the FDIA) and (ii) prohibits incentive-based compensation arrangements for executive officers, employees, directors or principal shareholders that could lead to a material financial loss for the institution. The proposed rule requires covered institutions to establish policies and procedures for monitoring and evaluating their compensation practices. The comment period ended in May 2011. Although final rules have not been adopted as of February 2016, officials from the Federal Reserve have recently indicated that the U.S. banking regulators are in the process of preparing for public comment a new rule on incentive compensation. If these or other regulations are adopted in a form similar to that initially proposed, they will impose limitations on the manner in which we may structure compensation for our executives. 

The scope and content of the U.S. banking regulators&#8217; policies on incentive compensation are continuing to develop. It cannot be determined at this time whether or when a final rule will be adopted and whether compliance with such a final rule will adversely affect the ability of Summit and its subsidiaries to hire, retain and motivate their key employees. 

Competition 

We engage in highly competitive activities. Each activity and market served involves competition with other banks and savings institutions, as well as with non-banking and non-financial enterprises that offer financial products and services that compete directly with our products and services. We actively compete with other banks, mortgage companies and other financial service companies in our efforts to obtain deposits and make loans, in the scope and types of services offered, in interest rates paid on time deposits and charged on loans, and in other aspects of banking. 

&#160; 

Of particular note, banking laws limit the total amount we can lend to any one borrower generally to 15 percent of Summit Community&#8217;s Tier 1 capital plus its allowance for loan losses. Summit Community evaluated the risks and rewards of lending up to this legal lending limit, and established a self-imposed lending limit equal to 75 percent of its legal lending limit. Accordingly, institutions larger than Summit Community have a natural competitive advantage to serve the loan needs of larger clients as their legal lending limits are proportionally greater than ours. 

In addition to competing with other banks and mortgage companies, we compete with other financial institutions engaged in the business of making loans or accepting deposits, such as savings and loan associations, credit unions, industrial loan associations, insurance companies, small loan companies, finance companies, real estate investment trusts, certain governmental agencies, credit card organizations and other enterprises. In addition, competition for money market accounts from securities brokers has also intensified. Additional competition for deposits comes from government and private issues of debt obligations and other investment alternatives for depositors, such as money market funds. We take an aggressive competitive posture, and intend to continue vigorously competing for market share within our service areas by offering competitive rates and terms on both loans and deposits. 

&#160; 

Employees 

At February 25, 2016, we employed 231 full-time equivalent employees.
