General 

&#160; 

LightPath Technologies, Inc. (&#8220;LightPath&#8221;, the &#8220;Company&#8221;, &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;our&#8221;, or &#8220;us&#8221;) was incorporated under Delaware law in 1992 as the successor to LightPath Technologies Limited Partnership, a New Mexico limited partnership formed in 1989, and its predecessor, Integrated Solar Technologies Corporation, a New Mexico corporation formed in 1985. We manufacture optical components and higher level assemblies including precision molded glass aspheric optics, infrared aspheric lenses, GRADIUM glass lenses and other optical materials used to produce products that manipulate light. We design, develop, manufacture and distribute optical components and assemblies utilizing advanced optical manufacturing processes. Our products are incorporated into a variety of applications by our customers in many industries, including defense products, medical devices, laser aided industrial tools, automotive safety applications, barcode scanners, optical data storage, hybrid fiber coax datacom, telecommunications, machine vision and sensors, among others. Products that we produce enable lasers and imaging devices to function more effectively. For example: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Molded glass aspheres and assemblies are used in various high performance optical applications primarily based on laser technology; &#160; &#9679; Infrared molded lenses and assemblies using short (SWIR), mid (MWIR) and long (LWIR) wave materials imaging are used in applications for firefighting, predictive maintenance, homeland security, surveillance, automotive, cell phone infrared cameras and defense; and &#160; &#9679; GRADIUM extends the performance of a spherically polished glass lens technology improving optical performance so that it approximates aspheric lens performance. &#160; 

In &#160; November 2005, &#160; we formed &#160; LightPath Optical Instrumentation (Shanghai) Co., Ltd (&#8220;LPOI&#8221;), a wholly-owned subsidiary, located in Jiading, People&#8217;s Republic of China. The LPOI facility is primarily used for sales and support functions. 

&#160; 

In December 2013, we formed LightPath Optical Instrumentation (Zhenjiang) Co., Ltd. (&#8220;LPOIZ&#8221;), a wholly-owned subsidiary located in the New City district, of the Jiangsu province, of the People&#8217;s Republic of China. LPOIZ&#8217;s 26,000 square foot manufacturing facility serves as our primary manufacturing facility in China and provides a lower cost structure for production of larger volumes of optical components and assemblies. 

&#160; 

Recent Events &#8211; ISP Optics Corporation Acquisition

&#160; 

Product Groups and Markets 

&#160; 

During fiscal 2015, we started evaluating our business based on five product groups: low volume precision molded optics (&#8220;LVPMO&#8221;), high volume precision molded optics (&#8220;HVPMO&#8221;), specialty products, infrared products, and non-recurring engineering (&#8220;NRE&#8221;). Our LVPMO product group consists of precision molded optics with a sales price greater than $10 per lens that are usually sold in smaller lot quantities. Our HVPMO product group consists of precision molded optics with a sales price of less than $10 per lens that are usually sold in larger lot quantities. Our infrared product group is comprised of both molded lens and assemblies. Our specialty product group is comprised of value added products such as optical subsystems, assemblies, GRADIUM lenses, and isolators. Our NRE product group consists of those products we develop pursuant to product development agreements we enter into with customers. Typically, customers approach us and request that we develop new products or applications for our existing products to fit their particular needs or specifications. The timing and extent of any such product development is outside of our control. 

&#160; 

We currently serve the following major markets: distribution and catalog, laser, industrial, instrumentation, telecommunications, and defense. Within our product groups, we have various applications that serve these major markets. For example, our HVPMO lenses are typically used in industrial tools, especially in China. Our HVPMO and LVPMO lenses are also used in applications for the telecommunications market, such as cloud computing, video distribution via digital technology, wireless broadband, and machine to machine connection, and, the laser market, such as laser tools, scientific and bench top lasers, and bar code scanners. Our infrared products can also be used in various applications within our major markets. Currently, sales of our infrared products are primarily for customers in the industrial market that use thermal imaging cameras. Our infrared products can also be used for gas sensing devices, spectrometers, night vision systems, automotive driver systems, thermal weapon gun sights, and infrared counter measure systems, among others. Within the larger overall markets, which are estimated to be in the multi-billions of dollars, we believe there is a market of approximately $800 million for our current products and capabilities. We continue to believe our products will provide significant growth opportunities over the next several years and, therefore, we will continue to target specific applications in each of these major markets. Our strategy is to leverage our technology, know-how, established low cost manufacturing capability, and partnerships to grow our business. We plan to accomplish this growth through the implementation of the following objectives: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Continue to Drive Operational Excellence and Asset Efficiency . Operational excellence, which includes a commitment to safety, environmental stewardship, and improved reliability, is key to our future success. We continually evaluate our business to identify opportunities to increase operational efficiency throughout our production facilities with a focus on maintaining operational excellence, reducing costs, and maximizing asset efficiency. We intend to continue focusing on increasing manufacturing efficiencies through selected capital projects, process improvements, and best practices in order to lower unit costs. We will also carefully manage our portfolio and take appropriate actions to address product lines that face challenging market conditions and do not generate returns on invested capital that we believe are sufficient to create long-term shareholder value. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Focus on Cash Flow Generation . Our goal is to focus on cash flow generation and return on invested capital through the continuing optimization of our cost structure, improvement in working capital and supply chain efficiencies, and a disciplined approach to capital expenditures. We have a proven track record of mitigating fixed cost inflation with cost saving actions and productivity improvements. We intend to continue to identify incremental cost saving opportunities based in large part on benchmarks of industry-leading performance and productivity improvements by utilizing our engineering and manufacturing technology expertise and partnerships with low cost producers. Our goal is to maintain a cost structure that positions us favorably to compete and grow. We intend to continue to upgrade our customer and product mix by adding products that move up the supply chain by offering assemblies that use our lenses, thereby increasing our sales of value-added, differentiated products, and achieving premium pricing to improve margins and enhance cash flow. &#160; 

4&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

&#160; &#160; We also intend to actively manage our working capital by increasing inventory turnover and reducing finished goods and raw materials inventory without affecting our ability to deliver products to our customers. We strive to improve our supply chain efficiency by focusing on reducing both operating costs and working capital needs. Our supply chain efforts to lower operating costs have consisted of reducing procurement spending, lowering transportation and warehouse costs, and optimizing production scheduling. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; We remain focused on disciplined capital allocation among our product groups. We plan to allocate our capital expenditures to projects required to enhance the reliability of our manufacturing operations and maintain the overall asset portfolio. This includes key maintenance and repair activities in each product group, and necessary regulatory and maintenance spending to ensure safe operations. We intend to optimize capital spending on growth projects across our various product groups based on a thorough comparison of risk-adjusted returns for each project. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Maintain Strong Customer Focus . A key component of our strategy is to produce innovative, high-performance products that offer enhanced value propositions to our customers at competitive prices. Our goal is to work closely with our customers to provide solutions and products that optimize their products. This market-driven product development enables us to offer a high-quality product portfolio to our customers and provides our business with the ability to respond quickly and efficiently to changes in market demands. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Leverage our Leadership to Drive Organic Growth . We plan to continue to capitalize on our global operations network, distribution infrastructure, and technology to pursue global growth. We will focus our efforts on those geographic areas and end products that we believe offer the most attractive growth and long-term profit prospects. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Deepen Our Presence in Emerging Markets . Emerging markets are a strategic priority for our business. We are well positioned not only to leverage our strong market positions in mature but highly sophisticated markets in North America and Europe, but also to participate in the expected growth of emerging markets in Asia and Eastern Europe. We believe that improving living standards and growth in GDP across emerging markets are combining to create increased demand for our products. We expect to capitalize on this growth opportunity by expanding our customer base and local capabilities in order to increase our market share across emerging markets, especially in China. To accelerate our penetration of these markets and maintain our competitive cost position, we may develop relationships with leading local partners, especially in businesses where participation in the fast-growing Chinese market is particularly important for long-term sustainable growth. For example, we are well positioned to leverage our strong production technology in the Chinese market as a result of an increasing percentage of aerospace, automotive, semiconductor, electronics, and telecommunications manufacturing transitioning to China. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Drive Organizational Alignment . We believe that maintaining alignment of the efforts of our employees with our overall business strategy and operational excellence goals is critical to our success. We have outstanding people and assets and, with the commitment to values of safety, customer appreciation, simplicity, collective entrepreneurship, and integrity, we believe that we can maintain our competitiveness and help achieve our operational excellence and asset efficiency strategic objectives. &#160; 

The following further discusses the various products we offer and certain growth opportunities we anticipate for each such product. 

&#160; 

LVPMO and HVPMO Product Groups. Aspheric lenses are known for their optimal performance. Aspheric lenses simplify and shrink optical systems by replacing several conventional lenses. However, aspheric lenses are difficult and costly to machine. Our glass molding technology enables the production of both low and high volumes of aspheric optics while still maintaining the highest quality at an affordable price. Molding is the most consistent and economical way to produce aspheres and we have perfected this method to offer the most precise molded aspheric lenses available. 

&#160; 

In recent years, sales of both our LVPMOs and HVPMOs have increased. We expect this growth to continue for the next several years with what we believe is a multi-year growth cycle of the optical market. This multi-year growth cycle is driven by four major trends: cloud computing; video distribution via digital technology; wireless broadband; and machine-to-machine connection. Cloud computing has caused a shift in enterprise technology with increased spending for software-as-a-service (&#8220;SAAS&#8221;) and infrastructure-as-a-service (&#8220;IAAS&#8221;) capital investments. Delivery of applications and technology using SAAS or IAAS requires larger and faster network bandwidth. The explosion of mobile devices, which includes smartphones and tablet devices, is also requiring the expansion of network bandwidth as users are receiving and transferring larger amounts of data via their mobile devices. The number of mobile devices exceeded the global population at the beginning of 2015 and is estimated to be 1.5 mobile devices per capita by 2019. Individuals are also streaming more video on their mobile devices or through their smart TVs. This type of video distribution, which is estimated to be 80% of all network traffic by 2019, is creating a huge demand for larger and faster bandwidth. Finally, machine-to-machine connection technology allows wireless and wired systems to communicate with other devices of the same type. This type of networking often requires bandwidth in order for the machines to communicate with each other. All of these trends require the expansion of bandwidth, and thus, the growth of optical communication networks. Our products, such as our precision molded optical lenses, can be used as a component in optical communication networks. We also anticipate growth in our precision molded aspheres product revenues as we add new product lenses and applications for a variety of markets and industries, including laser tools, telecom transceivers, micro-projectors, scientific and bench top lasers, range finders, medical devices, bar code scanners and laser based spectrometers. 

&#160; 

5&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#9679; LVPMOs . The growth in our LVPMO business is driven by a variety of market applications such as medical endoscopes, medical flow cytometers, scientific and bench-top lasers, laser based spectrometers, military telecom, and telescopic weapon sights. These products have precision specifications and 100% testing to verify that our lenses conform to a higher level of performance than most of the competition in these markets. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; HVPMOs . The continued growth in our HVPMO business is driven by market applications supporting mostly the laser diode applications for high volume markets in laser tools, range finders, laser gun sights, bar code scanners, and micro-projectors. The same basic tooling used for high precision in the LVPMO applications allows us to realize a competitive advantage for high volume production that benefits the end customer while maintaining low price targets. Markets for laser diode applications are expected to grow substantially in the next few years as applications such as Lidar, which uses light and radar for distance tracking and speed detection, headlights for automobiles, and many other related disciplines begin to rely more and more on laser technology. &#160; 

Infrared Product Group . Advances in chalcogenide materials have enabled compression molding for MWIR and LWIR optics in a process similar to precision molded lenses. Our molded infrared optics technology enables high performance, cost-effective infrared aspheric lenses that do not rely on traditional diamond turning or lengthy polishing methods. Utilizing precision molded aspheric optics significantly reduces the number of lenses required for typical thermal imaging systems and the cost to manufacture these lenses, as well as the size of the lens system. Traditional germanium or zinc selenide aspheres are manufactured by diamond turning, which is a time-consuming and expensive process. Diamond turned lenses are made one at a time and the lenses suffer from variations in the surface resulting in variations of performance from lens to lens. The infrared optics molding process allows lenses to be manufactured in high volume with a highly repeatable, consistent performance and allows for sophisticated beam shaping or achromatization over a range of wavelengths to be molded directly into the surfaces of the lens. 

&#160; 

Overall, we anticipate growth for infrared optics and increased requirements for systems requiring molded aspheric optics over traditional ground and polished lenses. Infrared systems, which include thermal imaging cameras, gas sensing devices, spectrometers, night vision systems, automotive driver awareness systems such as blind spot detection, thermal weapon gun sights, and infrared counter measure systems, represent a market that is forecasted to grow to greater than $5.6 billion at the complete systems level by 2020 at a compound annual growth rate of 10%. As infrared imaging systems become widely available, the cost of optical components needs to decrease before the market demand will increase. Our aspheric molding process is an enabling technology for the cost reduction and commercialization of infrared imaging systems because the aspheric shape of our lenses enables system designers to reduce the lens element in a system and provide similar performance at a lower cost. 

&#160; 

Specialty Product Group . We have a rapidly growing group of specialty products and assemblies that take advantage of our unique technologies and capabilities. These products include custom optical designs, mounted lenses, optical assemblies, and GRADIUM lenses. We expect growth from defense communications programs and commercial optical sub-assemblies. 

&#160; 

Our GRADIUM glass is an optical quality glass material with axially varying refractive index, capable of reducing optical aberrations inherent in conventional lenses and performing with a single lens tasks traditionally performed by multi-element, conventional lens systems. Typical applications include surgical lasers, high power YAG lasers for welding, cutting and marking, defense-market uses, and test and measurement. GRADIUM has a unique capability to handle up to 10 kilowatts of power and is servicing a niche market for laser high-power cutting and laser welding. 

&#160; 

We design, build, and sell optical assemblies into markets for test and measurement, medical devices, military, industrial, and communications based on our proprietary technologies. Many of our optical assemblies consist of several products that we manufacture. 

&#160; 

Sales and Marketing 

&#160; 

Marketing . Extensive product diversity and varying levels of product maturity characterize the optics industry. Product markets range from consumer (e.g., cameras, copiers) to industrial (e.g., lasers, data storage, infrared imaging), from products where the lenses are the central feature (e.g., telescopes, microscopes, lens systems) to products incorporating lens components (e.g., robotics, semiconductor production equipment) and communications (e.g., various optics are required for bandwidth expansion and improved data transfer for the optical network). As a result, we market our products across a wide variety of customer groups including laser systems manufacturers, laser OEMs, infrared-imaging systems vendors, industrial laser tool manufacturers, telecommunications equipment manufacturers, medical and industrial measurement equipment manufacturers, government defense agencies, and research institutions worldwide. 

&#160; 

6&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Organization Optimization Plan. In February 2015, we transitioned to a technical sales process that leveraged the success of our existing demand-creation model. To align the organization for specific goals and accountability, we created an executive structure with three direct reporting lines: Operations, China, and Finance. Technical and engineering staffs are now more fully integrated with our sales force, and two new sales positions were created: (i) Executive Sales Manager, which combined the responsibility for all sales and marketing, and (ii) Marketing Manager. We also combined the organizations supporting our aspheric visible lens products and our infrared products. Sales, marketing, engineering, and quality report to the Executive Vice President &#8211; Operations. 

&#160; 

Sales Organization . We have regional sales forces that market and sell our products directly to customers in North America and China. We also have a master distributor in Europe. We have formalized relationships with 14 industrial, laser, and optoelectronics distributors and channel partners located in the United States and various foreign countries to assist in the distribution of our products in highly specific target markets. We also have reseller arrangements with the top three product catalog companies in the optics and opto-electronics market. In addition, we also maintain our own product catalog and internet website ( www.lightpath.com ) as vehicles for broader promotion of our products. We make use of print media advertisements in various trade magazines and participate in appropriate domestic and foreign trade shows. 

&#160; 

All of our partners work diligently to expand opportunities in emerging geographic markets and through alternate channels of distribution. We believe that we provide a high level of support in developing and maintaining our long-term relationships with our customers. Customer service and support are provided through our offices and those of our partners that are located throughout the world. 

&#160; 

Trade Shows . We display our product line additions and enhancements at one or more trade shows each year. For example, we participated in several United States based shows including Society of Photographic Instrumentation Engineers (&#8220;SPIE&#8221;) Photonics West &#160; in January 2016 and SPIE Defense, Security and Sensing in May 2016. We also participate in shows in China such as the China International Optoelectronic Exposition in Shenzhen. In addition, we partner with key distributors to attend exhibitions such as Laser World of Photonics in Munich, Germany. This strategy underscores our strategic directive of broadening our base of innovative optical components and assemblies. These trade shows also provide an opportunity to meet with and enhance existing business relationships, meet and develop potential customers, and to distribute information and samples regarding our products. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The market for optical components generally is highly competitive and highly fragmented. We compete with manufacturers of conventional spherical lenses and optical components, providers of aspheric lenses and optical components, and producers of optical quality glass.To a lesser extent, we compete with developers of specialty optical components and assemblies.Many of these competitors have greater financial, manufacturing, marketing, and other resources than we do. 

&#160; 

We believe our unique capabilities in optical design engineering, our low cost structure and our substantial presence in Asia, particularly in China, provides us with a competitive edge and assists us in securing business. Additionally, we believe that we offer value to some customers as a second or backup supply source in the United States should they be unwilling to commit to purchase their entire supply of a critical component from a foreign production source. We also have a broad product offering to satisfy a variety of applications and markets. 

&#160; 

LVPMOs and HVPMOs Product Groups . Our LVPMO products compete with conventional lenses and optical components manufactured by companies such as Asia Optical, Anteryon, RPO, and Sunny Optics. 

&#160; 

Aspheric lenses compete with lens systems comprised of multiple conventional lenses. Machined aspheric lenses compete with our molded glass aspheric lenses, which are part of our HVPMO product group. Aspheric lens system manufacturers include Panasonic, ALP&#8217;s, Hoya Corporation, as well as newer competitors from China and Taiwan such as E-pin Optical Industry Co. and Kinik Company. The use of aspheric surfaces provides the optical designer with a powerful tool in correcting spherical aberrations and enhancing performance in state-of-the-art optical products. However, we believe that our optical design expertise and our flexibility in providing custom high performance optical components at a low price are key competitive advantages for us over these competitors. 

&#160; 

Plastic molded aspheres and hybrid plastic/glass aspheric optics, on the other hand, allow for high volume production, but primarily are limited to low cost consumer products that do not place a high demand on performance (such as plastic lenses in disposable or mobile phone cameras). Molded plastic aspheres appear in products that stress cost or weight as their measure of success over performance and durability. Our low cost structure allows us to compete with these lenses based on higher performance and durability from our glass lenses at only a small premium in price over plastic or plastic/glass hybrid lenses. 

&#160; 

7&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Infrared Product Group . Our infrared molded aspheric optics competes with traditional infrared lenses manufactured from germanium, such as those produced by Janos Technologies, Ophir Optics or Elcan Optical Technologies. These traditional infrared lenses can either be polished spherical or are diamond turned aspherical. Our molded lenses compete with spherical lenses because like all aspheres they can replace doublets or triplets based on the higher performance of an aspheric lens. Diamond turned aspheres from germanium are expensive to produce in high volumes and time consuming to manufacture. We believe our low cost, high volume lens business strategy enables us to compete with the manufacturers of traditional infrared lens. 

&#160; 

Our molded infrared optics competes with products manufactured by Umicore, Kiro, and Free Form. We believe that our optical design expertise and our flexibility in providing custom, high performance infrared optical components are key advantages over the products manufactured by these competitors. A specific advantage over Umicore, a foreign company, is that the infrared market is highly dependent on the United States defense industry, which prefers to purchase from United States based companies such as LightPath. 

&#160; 

Specialty Product Group . GRADIUM lenses are often used for products in the niche high power laser optics market. GRADIUM lenses are produced using a unique, well-established technology that no other manufacturer possesses, which provides us with a competitive advantage. However, there are other competing technologies, such as traditional fused silica doublets and triplets, as well as newer large diameter aspheres, such as those manufactured by Asphericon or Edmund Optics. 

&#160; 

Manufacturing 

&#160; 

Facilities . Our manufacturing is largely performed in our 26,000 square foot production facility in Orlando, Florida and in LPOIZ&#8217;s 26,000 square foot production facility in Zhenjiang, China. In October 2015, LPOI moved its sales and support functions to a 1,700 square foot facility in Shanghai. With space remaining in the Zhenjiang and Orlando facilities, we believe our facilities are adequate to accommodate our needs for the foreseeable future. 

&#160; 

Our manufacturing facilities feature areas for each step of the manufacturing process, including coating work areas, preform manufacturing and a clean room for pressing and integrated assembly. Our Orlando and Zhenjiang facilities include new product development laboratories and space that includes development and metrology equipment. Our Zhenjiang facility has anti-reflective coating equipment to coat our lenses in-house. 

&#160; 

Production and Equipment . Our Orlando facility contains a manufacturing area for our molded glass aspheres, a tooling and machine shop to support new product development, commercial production requirements for our machined parts, the fabrication of proprietary press work stations and mold equipment, and a clean room for our molding and assembly workstations. We also have glass coring equipment to meet our current needs of GRADIUM product sales worldwide. The Orlando facility is also International Traffic in Arms and Regulation (ITAR) compliant. LPOIZ&#8217;s Zhenjiang facility features a molded glass aspheres manufacturing area, clean room, and an area for anti-reflective coating. Our Orlando and Zhenjiang facilities are ISO 9001:2008 certified. For more information regarding our facilities, please see Item 2. Properties in this Annual Report. 

&#160; 

Subcontractors and Strategic Alliances . We believe that low-cost manufacturing is crucial to our long-term success. In that regard, we generally use subcontractors in our production process to accomplish certain processing steps requiring specialized capabilities. For example, we presently use a number of qualified subcontractors for fabricating, polishing, and coating certain lenses as necessary. We have taken steps to protect our proprietary methods of repeatable high quality manufacturing by patent disclosures and internal trade secret controls. 

&#160; 

Suppliers . We utilize a number of glass compositions in manufacturing our molded glass aspheres and lens array products. These glasses or equivalents are available from a large number of suppliers, including CDGM Glass Company, Ohara, and Sumita. Base optical materials, used in both GRADIUM and collimator products, are manufactured and supplied by a number of optical and glass manufacturers. We believe that a satisfactory supply of such production materials will continue to be available at reasonable prices, although there can be no assurance in this regard. 

&#160; 

We also rely on local and regional vendors for component materials and services such as housings, fixtures, magnets, chemicals and inert gases, specialty ceramics, UV and AR coatings, and other specialty coatings. In addition, certain products require external processing such as anodizing and metallization. To date, we are not dependent on any of these manufacturers and have found a suitable number of qualified vendors and suppliers for these materials and services. 

&#160; 

We currently purchase a few key materials from single or limited sources. We believe that a satisfactory supply of production materials will continue to be available at competitive prices, although there can be no assurance in this regard. 

&#160; 

8&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

Our policy is to protect our technology by, among other things, patents, trade secret protection, trademarks, and copyrights. We primarily rely upon trade secrets and unpatented proprietary know-how to protect certain process inventions, lens designs and innovations. For example, a key feature of GRADIUM glass is that, once fabricated, it does not reveal our formula upon inspection and, to our knowledge, cannot be reverse-engineered. We have taken security measures to protect our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, to the extent possible. 

&#160; 

In addition to trade secrets and proprietary know-how, we have limited patents and/or patent applications in the areas of glass composition, glass molding, gradient geometries, and certain production processes such as fiber attachment and micro-fabrication. The first of our issued patents expired in 2006; the remainder expire at various times through 2023. 

&#160; 

Our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate and our competitors may independently develop technology or products that are similar to ours or that compete with ours. Patent, trademark, and trade secret laws afford only limited protection for our technology and products. The laws of many countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Third parties may also design around our proprietary rights, which may render our protected technology and products less valuable, if the design around is favorably received in the marketplace. In addition, if any of our products or technology is covered by third-party patents or other intellectual property rights, we could be subject to various legal actions. We cannot assure you that our technology platform and products do not infringe patents held by others or that they will not in the future. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, or to defend against claims of infringement, invalidity, misappropriation, or other claims. 

&#160; 

We own several registered and unregistered service marks and trademarks that are used in the marketing and sale of our products. The following table sets forth our registered and unregistered service marks and trademarks, if registered, the country in which the mark is filed, and the renewal date for such mark. 

&#160; 

Mark &#160; Type &#160; Registered &#160; Country &#160; Renewal Date 

LightPath &#174; &#160; service mark &#160; Yes &#160; United States &#160; October 22, 2022 GRADIUM &#8482; &#160; Trademark &#160; Yes &#160; United States &#160; February 5, 2017 Circulight &#160; Trademark &#160; No &#160; - &#160; - BLACK DIAMOND &#160; Trademark &#160; No &#160; - &#160; - GelTech &#160; Trademark &#160; No &#160; - &#160; - Oasis &#160; Trademark &#160; No &#160; - &#160; - LightPath &#174; &#160; service mark &#160; Yes &#160; People&#8217;s Republic of China &#160; Application filed 

Environmental and Governmental Regulation 

&#160; 

Currently, emissions, and waste from our manufacturing processes are at such low levels that no special environmental permits or licenses are required. In the future, we may need to obtain special permits for disposal of increased waste by-products. The glass materials we utilize contain some toxic elements in a stabilized molecular form. However, the high temperature diffusion process results in low-level emissions of such elements in gaseous form. If production reaches a certain level, we believe that we will be able to efficiently recycle certain of our raw material waste, thereby reducing disposal levels. We believe that we are presently in compliance with all material federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing our operations and have obtained all material licenses and permits necessary for the operation of our business. 

&#160; 

We also utilize certain chemicals, solvents, and adhesives in our manufacturing process. We believe we maintain all necessary permits and are in full compliance with all applicable regulations. 

&#160; 

To our knowledge there are currently no United States federal, state or local regulations that restrict the manufacturing and distribution of our products. Certain end-user applications require government approval of the complete optical system, such as United States Food and Drug Administration approval for use in endoscopy. In these cases, we will generally be involved on a secondary level and our OEM customer will be responsible for the license and approval process. 

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act imposes disclosure requirements regarding the use of &#8220;conflict minerals&#8221; mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries in products, whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties. The conflict minerals include tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold, and their derivatives. Pursuant to these requirements, we are required to report on Form SD the procedures we employ to determine the sourcing of such minerals and metals produced from those minerals. There are costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including for diligence in regards to the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products, in addition to the cost of remediation and other changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. In addition, the implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply, and pricing of materials used in our products. We strive to only use suppliers that source from conflict-free smelters and refiners; however, in the future, we may face difficulties in gathering information regarding our suppliers and the source of any such conflict minerals.

New Product Development 

&#160; 

For many years, we engaged in basic research and development that resulted in the invention of GRADIUM glass and certain proprietary processes for fabricating GRADIUM glass lenses. Thereafter, our new product development efforts led to the development of our capabilities in molded aspheric lenses and infrared lenses. We incurred expenditures for new product development during fiscal 2016 and 2015 of approximately $669,000 and $1.1 million, respectively. We concentrated our efforts to support existing and new customers in the design and manufacture of items in three of our product lines: HVPMO lenses, LVPMO lenses and infrared products. 

&#160; 

In fiscal 2017, we anticipate focusing our new product development efforts on infrared optics products for imaging and sensing, fiber lasers, defense, medical devices, industrial, optical data storage, machine vision, sensors, and environmental monitoring. We currently plan to expend approximately $847,000 for new product development during fiscal 2017, which could vary depending upon revenue levels, customer requirements, and perceived market opportunities. 

&#160; 

For more difficult or customized products, we bill our customers for engineering services as a non-recurring engineering fee. 

&#160; 

Concentration of Customer Risk 

&#160; 

In fiscal 2016, we had sales to three customers that comprised an aggregate of approximately 25% of our annual revenue with one customer at 10% of our sales, another customer at 8% of our sales and the third customer at 7% of our sales. In fiscal 2015, we had sales to three customers that comprised an aggregate of approximately 28% of our annual revenue with one customer at 11% of our sales, another customer at 10% of our sales and the third customer at 7% of our sales. The loss of any of these customers, or a significant reduction in sales to any such customer, would adversely affect our revenues. We continue to diversify our business in order to minimize our sales concentration risk. 

&#160; 

In fiscal 2016, 59% of our net revenue was derived from sales outside of the United States, with 91% of our foreign sales derived from customers in Europe and Asia. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of June 30, 2016, we had 181 employees, of which 180 were full-time equivalent employees, with 71 located in Florida and 110 located in China. Of our 181 employees, we have 24 employees engaged in management, administrative, and clerical functions, 13 employees in new product development, 13 employees in sales and marketing, and 131 employees in production and quality control functions. Any employee additions or terminations over the next twelve months will be dependent upon the actual sales levels realized during fiscal 2017. We have used and will continue utilizing part-time help, temporary employment agencies, and outside consultants, where appropriate, to qualify prospective employees and to ramp up production as required from time to time. None of our employees are represented by a labor union.
