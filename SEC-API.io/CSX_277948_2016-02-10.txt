 Item 1. Business 

CSX Corporation (&#8220;CSX&#8221;), and together with its subsidiaries (the &#8220;Company&#8221;), based in Jacksonville, Florida, is one of the nation's leading transportation companies. The Company provides rail-based transportation services including traditional rail service and the transport of intermodal containers and trailers. 

The Company&#8217;s number of employees was approximately 29,000 &#32;as of December 2015 , which includes approximately 24,000 &#32;union employees. Most of the Company&#8217;s employees provide or support transportation services. 

CSX Transportation, Inc. 

CSX&#8217;s principal operating subsidiary, CSX Transportation, Inc. (&#8220;CSXT&#8221;), provides an important link to the transportation supply chain through its approximately 21,000 &#32;route mile rail network, which serves major population centers in 23 &#32;states east of the Mississippi River, the District of Columbia and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec. It has access to over 70 &#32;ocean, river and lake port terminals along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, the Mississippi River, the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence Seaway. The Company&#8217;s intermodal business links customers to railroads via trucks and terminals. CSXT also serves thousands of production and distribution facilities through track connections to approximately 240 &#32;short-line and regional railroads. 

Lines of Business 

During 2015 , the Company services generated $11.8 billion &#32;of revenue and served three primary lines of business: 

&#8226; 

The merchandise business shipped nearly 2.9 million &#32; carloads and generated 62% &#32;of revenue and 42% &#32;of volume in 2015 . The Company&#8217;s merchandise business is comprised of shipments in the following diverse markets: agricultural products, phosphates and fertilizers, food and consumer, chemicals, automotive, metals, forest products, minerals and waste and equipment. 

&#8226; 

The coal business shipped about 1.1 million &#32;carloads and accounted for 19% &#32;of revenue and 16% &#32;of volume in 2015 . The Company transports domestic coal, coke and iron ore to electricity-generating power plants, steel manufacturers and industrial plants as well as export coal to deep-water port facilities. Roughly one-third &#32;of export coal and the majority &#32;of the domestic coal that the Company transports is used for generating electricity. 

&#8226; 

The intermodal business accounted for 15% &#32;of revenue and 42% &#32;of volume in 2015 . The intermodal business combines the superior economics of rail transportation with the short-haul flexibility of trucks and offers a cost advantage over long-haul trucking. Through a network of more than 50 &#32;terminals, the intermodal business serves all major markets east of the Mississippi River and transports mainly manufactured consumer goods in containers, providing customers with truck-like service for longer shipments. 

&#160; 

Other revenue accounted for 4% &#32;of the Company&#8217;s total revenue in 2015 . This category includes revenue from regional subsidiary railroads, demurrage, revenue for customer volume commitments not met, switching and other incidental charges. Revenue from regional railroads includes shipments by railroads that the Company does not directly operate. Demurrage represents charges assessed when freight cars are held beyond a specified period of time. Switching revenue is primarily generated when CSXT switches cars for a customer or another railroad.

&#160; 

Company History 

A leader in freight rail transportation for nearly 190 years, the Company&#8217;s heritage dates back to the early nineteenth century when The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company (&#8220;B&#38;O&#8221;) &#8211; the nation&#8217;s first common carrier &#8211; was chartered in 1827. Since that time, the Company has built on this foundation to create a railroad that could safely and reliably service the ever-increasing demands of a growing nation. 

&#160; 

Since its founding, numerous railroads have combined with the former B&#38;O through merger and consolidation to create what has become CSX. Each of the railroads that combined into the CSX family brought new geographical reach to valuable markets, gateways, cities, ports and transportation corridors. 

&#160; 

CSX was incorporated in 1978 under Virginia law. In 1980, the Company completed the merger of the Chessie System and Seaboard Coast Line Industries into CSX. The merger allowed the Company to connect northern population centers and Appalachian coal fields to growing southeastern markets. Later, the Company&#8217;s acquisition of key portions of Conrail, Inc. ("Conrail") allowed CSXT to link the northeast, including New England and the New York metropolitan area, with Chicago and midwestern markets as well as the growing areas in the Southeast already served by CSXT. This current rail network allows the Company to directly serve every major market in the eastern United States with safe, dependable, environmentally responsible and fuel efficient freight transportation and intermodal service. 

&#160; 

Competition 

The business environment in which the Company operates is highly competitive. Shippers typically select transportation providers that offer the most compelling combination of service and price. Service requirements, both in terms of transit time and reliability, vary by shipper and commodity. As a result, the Company&#8217;s primary competition varies by commodity, geographic location and mode of available transportation and includes other railroads, motor carriers that operate similar routes across its service area and, to a less significant extent, barges, ships and pipelines. 

&#160; 

CSXT&#8217;s primary rail competitor is Norfolk Southern Railway, which operates throughout much of the Company&#8217;s territory. Other railroads also operate in parts of the Company&#8217;s territory. Depending on the specific market, competing railroads and deregulated motor carriers may exert pressure on price and service levels. For further discussion on the risk of competition to the Company, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.

PART I 

Regulatory Environment 

The Company's operations are subject to various federal, state, provincial (Canada) and local laws and regulations generally applicable to businesses operating in the United States and Canada. In the U.S., the railroad operations conducted by the Company's subsidiaries, including CSXT, are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board (&#8220;STB&#8221;), the Federal Railroad Administration (&#8220;FRA&#8221;), and its sister agency within the U.S. Department of Transportation, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (&#8220;PHMSA&#8221;). Together, FRA and PHMSA have broad jurisdiction over railroad operating standards and practices, including track, freight cars, locomotives and hazardous materials requirements. In addition, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;) has regulatory authority with respect to matters that impact the Company's properties and operations. The EPA is considering regulatory action directed towards the railroad industry governing the disposal of creosote cross-ties and seeking to increase air emission regulations that may impact our operations or increase costs. Similarly, the Transportation Security Administration (&#8220;TSA&#8221;), a component of the Department of Homeland Security, has broad authority over railroad operating practices that may have homeland security implications. In Canada, the railroad operations conducted by the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries, including CSXT, are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Canadian Transportation Agency. 

&#160; &#32; 

Although the Staggers Act of 1980 significantly deregulated the U.S. rail industry, the STB has broad jurisdiction over rail carriers. The STB regulates routes, fuel surcharges, conditions of service, rates for non-exempt traffic, acquisitions of control over rail common carriers and the transfer, extension or abandonment of rail lines, among other railroad activities. 

Positive Train Control 

In 2008, Congress enacted the Rail Safety Improvement Act (the &#8220;RSIA&#8221;). The legislation included a mandate that all Class I freight railroads implement an interoperable positive train control system (&#8220;PTC&#8221;) by December 31, 2015. Implementation of a PTC system is designed to prevent train-to-train collisions, over-speed derailments, incursions into established work-zone limits, and train diversions onto another set of tracks. On October 29, 2015, the President of the United States signed the Positive Train Control Enforcement and Implementation Act of 2015 into law extending the deadline. This Act requires the installation of all PTC hardware be completed by December 31, 2018, and, assuming certain conditions are met, requires that the PTC system be fully operational by December 31, 2020. 

PTC must be installed on all main lines with passenger and commuter operations as well as most of those over which toxic-by-inhalation hazardous materials are transported. The Company expects to incur significant capital costs in connection with the implementation of PTC as well as related ongoing operating expenses. CSX currently estimates that the total multi-year cost of PTC implementation will be approximately $2.2 billion &#32;for the Company. Total PTC investment through 2015 &#32;was $ 1.5 billion . 

&#160; 

STB Proceedings 

In 2012, the STB announced it would accept comments on a proposal by the National Industrial Transportation League that would require Class I railroads to provide a form of "competitive access" to customers served solely by one railroad. Under this proposal, CSX would be required to allow a competing railroad to access certain customers that are currently solely served by CSX's network. In early 2013, shippers, railroads and other parties submitted comments on the proposal, and the STB held a hearing in March 2014 to receive further input from participating parties. Since the hearing, the STB has taken no further action in the proceeding. 

In April 2014, the STB announced it would receive comments to explore its methodology for determining railroad revenue adequacy. The revenue adequacy standard represents the level of profitability for a healthy carrier. Shippers, railroads and other parties filed comments in late 2014. More recently, the STB held a hearing in July 2015 to receive further input from participating parties. Since the hearing, the STB has taken no further action in the proceeding.
