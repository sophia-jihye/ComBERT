(the &#34;Company&#8221;) is the originator of a new &#8220;Delicatessen&#8221; concept called &#8220;Your Hometown Deli.&#8221; Your Hometown Delis plan to feature &#8220;home-style&#8221; sandwiches, food items, and groceries in a casual and friendly atmosphere.

&#160;

The Your Hometown Deli Concept 

&#160; 

Your Hometown Deli is a delicatessen concept that will focus on providing high-quality food products not available in local supermarkets or take-out restaurants. The delicatessen concept has a worldwide history with the term first appearing in the English language in 1889. The word &#8220;delicatessen&#8221; originates in the German language and means &#34;delicacies&#34; or &#8220;fine foods.&#8221; Delicatessens vary throughout the world, but in the United States a delicatessen (or &#8220;deli&#8221;) is a small retail store that is a blend of a grocery and a fast-food restaurant.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s Your Hometown Deli concept is patterned after traditional delicatessens, offering a wider and fresher menu than found at fast-food restaurants. Sandwiches and green salads will be made fresh to order. Like many delis, Your Hometown Deli serves some hot foods kept on a steam table, similar to a cafeteria. In addition to ready-to-eat food, the Your Hometown Deli sells cold cuts by weight. A wide variety of beverages are also expected to be sold together with potato chips and similar products.

&#160;

In addition to the lunch items, Your Hometown Deli offers a number of additional items geared toward the breakfast crowd. Newspapers, limited household items and small snack items, such as candy, cookies and chewing gums are planned to be available for purchase. Your Hometown Deli also provides take-out service and limited seating in the store.

&#160;

Products 

&#160;

Your Hometown Deli provides sandwiches, soups, salads, deli meats/cheeses, hot/cold drinks, fresh breads/rolls and small retail items for cooking, baking, and home use. Salads include made-to-order green salads, prepared pasta, potato, chicken, or other variety of &#34;wet&#34; salads. Breakfast products include baked goods (breakfast pastries, bagels, toast), yogurt, and hot breakfast sandwiches. Fresh coffee, tea and other hot and cold beverages are also available for purchase.

&#160;

Strategy 

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s business strategy is to create a food-centered social environment within the local community that offers higher-quality prepared food and ingredients than is typically found locally. The Company&#8217;s management believes that broader market trends and certain locality-specific attributes support this strategy. The average American eats out 4-5 times a week and according to the United States Department of Labor. Management of the Company believes the increased popularity of eating out in the United States is a social trend that is likely to continue in the future. In addition, Management will select Your Hometown Deli locations that appear to support this strategy.

&#160; 

Location 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s first location is in Paulsboro, a borough in Gloucester County, New Jersey that was founded in 1904. Paulsboro is located directly across the Delaware River from the city of Philadelphia and the Philadelphia airport. The Your Hometown Deli will be located on a property in the commercial area of downtown Paulsboro that has two buildings. The front building will be the location of the new Your Hometown Deli as well as the local Conrail offices. The rear building is used throughout the week as a practice facility by the local wrestling club and other sports groups. Paulsboro has a national reputation for its wrestling activities and one of the Company&#8217;s founders is a leader in the sport of wrestling.

&#160;

The borough of Paulsboro is undergoing a redevelopment phase from a petroleum products specialty port into an adaptable &#8220;OmniPort&#8221; able to handle a diversity of bulk, break bulk cargo and shipping containers. Studies completed in 2012 concluded that the port is well suited to become a center for the manufacturing, assembly, and transport of wind turbines and platforms for the development of Atlantic Wind Connection. The port is located approximately one mile from the site of the Your Hometown Deli. The Company&#8217;s management believes that hundreds of employees around the area will eventually pass the Your Hometown Deli, the only food establishment on the main commuter route to the Port, within the next few months, if not already.

&#160;

The Market 

&#160;

The local Paulsboro market is small, but conducive to hosting a Your Hometown Deli. According to the 2010 United States Census, there were 6,097 people and 2,286 households residing in the borough. The median household income was $43,846. The broader Philadelphia Metropolitan Statistical Area is the sixth-largest metropolitan area in the United States with a population to 6.53 million people.

&#160;

The Company anticipates drawing customers from people living in Paulsboro and the adjacent communities of Greenwich, Clarksboro, and West Deptford, New Jersey. Commuting workers are also anticipated to be customers.

&#160;

Local students and coaches who frequently use the sports practice facility on the property are another group of potential customers. The practice facility is also home to the &#8220;The Monster Factory,&#8221; a professional wrestling training and wrestling match promotions organization. In business more than 30 years, the Monster Factory has become &#8220;the world&#8217;s most famous wrestling school&#8221; and has been featured in the Rolling Stone , NewsWeek , and Wall Street Journal . The Company believes that the attendees of Monster Factory wrestling events are potential customers for Your Hometown Deli.

&#160;

Local competing delicatessen concept stores include Wally&#8217;s Grocery &#38; Deli. Other dining and grocery options in the area include locally owned pizzerias, seafood, and fine dining restaurants. Fast food options in the vicinity include McDonalds, Burger King, and Wendy&#8217;s. Grocery stores include Wawa, Dollar General, Heritage&#8217;s Dairy Stores and Fair Deal Food Market.

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160;

The Company presently has ten employees apart from its officers and directors, Paul F. Morina, President and Christine T. Lindenmuth.

From time to time, the Company may hire more employees based on its business needs and these decisions will be made by the officers if and when appropriate

&#160; 

Sales and Marketing 

&#160;

The Company relies heavily on word of mouth for its marketing. The Company&#8217;s founders have close ties to the community in which the first store is located in and Company believes that these relationships will help the Company&#8217;s sales and marketing efforts. A portion of the Company&#8217;s marketing budget is allocated to be spent on signage and other forms of local advertising. The Company launched its website (www.yourhometowndeli.com) that describes its offerings, menu, and daily specials and coupons, which is used to attract new customers and to increase sales. Social media is also used to describe the quality, atmosphere, products, specials, customer opinions and general information about the Your Hometown Deli&#8217;s operation. All sales and marketing messages will attempt to describe the unique character of the Your Hometown Deli and its family-oriented style and old-world feel.
