Overview 

Rigel Pharmaceuticals, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in June 1996, and is based in South San Francisco, California. We are a clinical &#8209;stage biotechnology company dedicated to the discovery and development of novel, targeted drugs in the therapeutic areas of immunology, oncology and immuno-oncology. Our pioneering research focuses on signaling pathways that are critical to disease mechanisms. Our current clinical programs include fostamatinib, an oral spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) inhibitor, which is in Phase 3 clinical trials for immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP); a Phase 2 clinical trial for autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) ; and a Phase 2 clinical t rial for IgA nephropathy (IgAN) . In addition, we have two oncology product candidates in Phase 1 development with partners BerGenBio AS (BergenBio ) and Daiichi Sankyo (Daiichi). 

Since the beginning of 201 5 , we have experienced the following significant business events: 

&#183; 

In February 2016, we announced that we initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate fostamatinib as a potential treatment for AIHA . The trial is a two-stage study and we expect to report the results of the Stage 1 segment by the end of 2016. 

&#183; 

In January 2016, we experienced the following fostamatinib events: 

i.) 

we completed patient enrollment of the first of two Phase 3 studies with fostamatinib for the treatment of ITP and expect to report results from the first study in the middle of 2016 . &#160; We expect to report results on the second study shortly thereafter; &#160; &#160; 

ii.) 

we announced that the Phase 2 study of fostamatinib in IgAN &#160; continues to enroll patients for the first cohort in various centers throughout Asia, the U.S. and Europe , and that the study is on track to report top line results in the second half of 2016 ; and 

&#183; 

In September 2015, we announced that we entered into an exclusive, worldwide license agreement with Aclaris Therapeutics International Limited (Aclaris) for the development and commercialization of certain JAK inhibitors for the treatment of alopecia areata and other dermatological conditions. 

&#183; 

In September 2015, we announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Orphan Drug designation to f ostamatinib for the treatment of ITP . 

&#183; 

In June 2015, we announced that Keith A. Katkin, president and chief executive officer of Avanir Pharmaceuticals, has been appointed to our board of directors. 

&#183; 

In February 2015, we announced that we entered into a collaboration agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS) for the discovery, development and commercialization of cancer immunotherapies based on our extensive portfolio of small molecule TGF beta receptor kinase inhibitors, in which BMS paid us an upfront payment of $30.0 million. 

&#183; 

In January 2015, we announced that in December 2014 we earned a non &#8209;refundable payment of $5.8 million from AZ resulting from AZ&#8217;s continued development of R256 in asthma as of December 2014 , which we received in the first quarter of 2015 . 

Strategy 

Our research team is focused on creating a portfolio of product candidates that may be developed as therapeutics for our own proprietary programs or for development by potential collaborative partners. We recognize that the product development process is subject to both high costs and a high risk of failure. We believe that identifying a variety of product candidates and working in conjunction with other pharmaceutical partners may minimize the risk of failure, fill the product pipeline gap at major pharmaceutical companies, and ultimately increase the likelihood of advancing clinical development and potential commercialization of the product candidates. 

&#160;

The key elements to our business and scientific strategy are to: 

&#183; 

develop and commercialize fostamatinib in the United States where we believe a company our size can successfully compete; 

&#183; 

outlicense European and Asian rights to fostamatinib with Phase 3 clinical data in hand; 

&#183; 

develop and commercialize fostamatinib for possible additional indications; 

&#183; 

develop a diverse portfolio of drug candidates that address a focused b and of therapeutic indications or that represent significant market opportunities; 

&#183; 

utilize our robust discovery engine to rapidly discover and validate new product candidates in a focused range of therapeutic indications; and 

&#183; 

develop drug candidates and establish strategic collaborations with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to further develop and market our product candidates. 

Product Development Programs 

Our product development portfolio features multiple novel, targeted drug candidates in the therapeutic areas of immunology, oncology and immuno-oncology .

Current Stage 

&#160; 

Status 

Fostamatinib&#8212;Oral SYK Inhibitor 

Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP) 

Phase 3 

W e completed patient enrollment of the first of two Phase 3 studies with fostamatinib for the treatment of ITP in January 2016 and expect to report results from the first study in the middle of 2016 . &#160; We expect to report results on the second study shortly thereafter. 

IgA Nephropathy (IgAN) 

Phase 2 

The Phase 2 study of fostamatinib in IgAN continues to enroll patients for the first cohort in various centers throughout Asia, the U.S. and Europe, and that the study is on track to report top line results in the second half of 2016. 

Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia (AIHA) 

Phase 2 

We initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with AIHA in February 2016 . &#160; The trial is a two-stage study and we expect to report the results of the Stage 1 segment by the end of 2016. 

R348&#8212;Topical Ophthalmic JAK/SYK Inhibitor 

Dry Eye in Patients with Ocular Graft &#8209;Versus &#8209;Host Disease (GvHD) 

Phase 2 

R348 &#160; is being evaluated in a Phase 2 clinical trial of patients with ocular GvHD to determine if it reduces inflammation and limits the damage to the eye tissue caused by the disease. We expect results of this clinical trial in 2016. 

&#160; 

Clinical Stage Programs 

Fostamatinib&#8212;Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura 

Disease background. Chronic ITP affects an estimated 60,000 to 125,000 people in the U.S. In patients with ITP, the immune system attacks and destroys the body&#8217;s own blood platelets, which play an active role in blood clotting and healing. ITP patients can suffer extraordinary bruising, bleeding and fatigue as a result of low platelet counts. 

&#160;

Current therapies for ITP include steroids, blood platelet production boosters that imitate thrombopoietin (TPOs) and splenectomy. 

Orally &#8209;available SYK inhibitor program. Taken in tablet form, fostamatinib blocks the activation of SYK inside immune cells. ITP causes the body to produce antibodies that attach to healthy platelets in the blood stream. Immune cells recognize these antibodies and affix to them, which activates the SYK enzyme inside the immune cell, and triggers the destruction of the antibody and the attached platelet. When SYK is inhibited by fostamatinib, it interrupts this immune cell function and allows the platelets to escape destruction. The results of our Phase 2 clinical trial, in which fostamatinib was orally administered to sixteen adults with chronic ITP, published in Blood , showed that fostamatinib significantly increased the platelet counts of certain ITP patients, including those who had failed other currently available agents. 

In October 2013, we met with the U.S. FDA for an end-of-Phase 2 meeting for fostamatinib in ITP. Based on that meeting, we designed a Phase 3 clinical program, called fostamatinib in thrombocytopenia (FIT), in which a total of 150 ITP patients will be randomized into two identical multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials. The patients will have been diagnosed with persistent or chronic ITP, and have blood platelet counts consistently below 30,000 per microliter of blood. Two-thirds of the subjects will receive fostamatinib orally at 100 mg bid (twice daily) and the other third will receive placebo on the same schedule. Subjects are expected to remain on treatment for 24 weeks. At week four of treatment, subjects who meet certain platelet count and tolerability thresholds will have their dosage of fostamatinib (or corresponding placebo) increased to 150 mg bid. The primary efficacy endpoint of this program is a stable platelet response by week 24 with platelet counts at or above 50,000 per microliter of blood for at least four of the final six qualifying blood draws. In August 2015, the FDA granted our request for Orphan Drug designation to fostamatinib, our oral SYK inhibitor, for the treatment of ITP. The first trial of our Phase 3 clinical program for ITP completed patient enrollment in January 2016. Our second Phase 3 trial is currently actively enrolling patients . We expect to separately report top line results of the two Phase 3 trials, with the first trial reporting in the middle of 2016 and the other trial reporting shortly thereafter. 

Fostamatinib&#8212;IgAN 

Disease background. IgAN is an autoimmune disease that severely affects the functioning of the kidneys. An estimated 12,000 Americans are diagnosed with this type of glomerulonephritis each year, with 25% of its victims eventually requiring dialysis and/or kidney transplantation over time. IgAN is characterized by the deposition of IgA immune complexes in the glomeruli of the kidneys leading to an inflammatory response and subsequent tissue damage that ultimately disrupts the normal filtering function of the kidneys. By inhibiting SYK in kidney cells, fostamatinib may block the signaling of IgA immune complex receptors and arrest or slow destruction of the glomeruli. 

Orally-available SYK inhibitor program. Our Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with IgAN , called SIGN (SYK Inhibition for Glomerulonephritis) continues to enroll patients for the first cohort . We expect to report top line results in the second half of 2016. 

Fostamatinib&#8212;AIHA 

Disease background. 

AIHA is a rare, serious blood disorder where the immune system produces antibodies that result in the destruction of the body's own red blood cells. Symptoms can include fatigue, shortness of breath, rapid heartbeat, jaundice or enlarged spleen. While no medical treatments are currently approved for AIHA, physicians generally treat acute and chronic cases of the disorder with corticosteroids, other immuno-suppressants, or splenectomy. Research has shown that inhibiting SYK with fostamatinib may reduce the destruction of red blood cells. This disorder affects an estimated 40,000 Americans, for whom no approved treatment options currently exist. 

Orally &#8209;available SYK inhibitor program. We initiat ed a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with AIHA in February 2016. The trial is an open-label, multi-center, two-stage study that will evaluate the efficacy and safety of fostamatinib in patients with warm antibody AIHA who have previously received treatment for the disorder, but have relapsed. Stage 1 

&#160;

will enroll 17 patients who will receive 150 mg of fostamatinib orally twice a day for a period of 12 weeks. The patients will return to the clinic every two weeks for blood draws and medical assessment. The primary efficacy endpoint of this study is to achieve increased hemoglobin levels by week 12 of greater than 10 g/dL, and greater than or equal to 2 g/dL higher than baseline. Stage 2 will begin after enrollment in Stage 1 has been completed and will include an additional 20 patients who will receive the same treatment protocol as Stage 1. We expect to have results of the Stage 1 segment of the trial by the end of 2016. 

R348&#8212;Dry Eye in Patients with Ocular Graft &#8209;Versus &#8209;Host Disease (GvHD) 

Disease background. According to an article published by the American Academy of Ophthalmology, a significant number (22% to 80%) of patients with acute or chronic GvHD develop a secondary incidence of dry eye (keratoconjunctivitis sicca). In general, these patients are severely ill and have a great medical need for a topical therapy that may better manage their symptoms. 

Topical Ophthalmic JAK/SYK inhibitor program. R348, an ophthalmic JAK/SYK inhibitor, is being evaluated in a Phase 2 study of patients with ocular GvHD to determine if it reduces inflammation and limits the damage to the eye tissue caused by the disease. We expect results of this clinical trial in 2016. 

Research/Preclinical Programs 

We are conducting proprietary research in the broad disease areas of inflammation/immunology , immun o -oncology, cancers and muscle wasting/muscle endurance. Within each disease area, our researchers are investigating mechanisms of action as well as screening compounds against potential novel targets and optimizing those leads that appear to have the greatest potential. 

We are conducting preclinical studies to identify a lead molecule for our IRAK program . T his program may provide opportunities in both the oncology and immunology areas, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We are currently targeting AML and MDS with different mechanisms of action in various preclinical projects. 

Leveraging our extensive immunology expertise, we are continuing to explore novel immuno-oncology approaches to treating various oncology indications. The first of these resulted in a collaboration with BMS for TGF beta receptor kinase inhibitors. Several other projects are currently underway. 

Sponsored Research and License Agreements 

We conduct research and development programs independently and in connection with our corporate collaborators. We are a participant in our collaboration agreement with BMS for the discovery, development and commercialization of cancer immunotherapies based on our small molecule TGF beta receptor kinase inhibitors, as discussed below. Our participation is limited to the Joint Research Committee and the performance of research activities based on billable full-time equivalent fees as specified in the agreement. We do not have ongoing participation obligations under our agreements with Aclaris for the development and commercialization of certain JAK inhibitors for the treatment of alopecia areata and other dermatological conditions, AZ for the development and commercialization of R256, an inhaled JAK inhibitor, BerGenBio for the development and commercialization of an oncology program, and Daiichi to pursue research related to a specific target from a novel class of drug targets called ligases. Under these agreements, which we entered into in the ordinary course of business, we received or may be entitled to receive upfront cash payments, progress dependent contingent payments on events achieved by such partners and royalties on any net sales of products sold by such partners under the agreements. Total future contingent payments to us under all of these current agreements could exceed $533.6 million if all potential product candidates achieved all of the payment triggering events under all of our current agreements (based on a single product candidate under each agreement). Of this amount, up to $150.5 million relates to the achievement of development events, up to $345.6 million relates to the achievement of regulatory events and up to $37.5 million relates to the achievement of certain commercial or launch events. This estimated future contingent amount does not include any estimated royalties that could be due to us if the partners successfully commercialize any of the licensed products. &#160; Future events that may trigger payments to us under the 

&#160;

agreements are based solely on our partners&#8217; future efforts and achievements of specified development, regulatory and/or commercial events. 

Because we do not control the research, development or commercialization of the product candidates generated under these agreements, we are not able to reasonably estimate when, if at all, any contingent payments would become payable to us. As such, the contingent payments we could receive thereunder involve a substantial degree of risk to achieve and may never be received in the next twelve months or thereafter . Accordingly, we do not expect, and investors should not assume, that we will receive all of the potential contingent payments provided for under these agreements and it is possible that we may never receive any additional significant contingent payments or royalties under these agreements. &#160; 

In October 2015, we entered into a non-exclusive license agreement with a third party, pursuant to which we received a payment in the single-digit millions in exchange for granting a non-exclusive license to certain limited intellectual property rights . We concluded that the granting of the license, which was fully delivered to such third party in the fourth quarter of 2015, represents the sole deliverable under this agreement. Accordingly, we have recognized the payment as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2015. 

In August 2015, we entered into a license agreement with Aclaris, pursuant to which Aclaris will have exclusive rights and will assume responsibility for the continued development of certain JAK inhibitor compounds for the treatment of alopecia areata and other dermatological conditions. Under the license agreement, we received a noncreditable and non-refundable upfront payment of $8.0 million in September 2015. We are also entitled to receive development and regulatory contingent fees that could exceed $80.0 million for a successful compound approved in certain indications. In addition, we are also eligible to receive tiered royalties on the net sales of any products under the agreement. We concluded that the granting of the license, which has been fully delivered to Aclaris in the third quarter of 2015, represents the sole deliverable under this agreement. Accordingly, we have recognized the $8.0 million payment as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2015. 

In February 2015, we entered into a collaboration agreement with BMS for the discovery, development and commercialization of cancer immunotherapies based on our extensive portfolio of small molecule TGF beta receptor kinase inhibitors. Under the collaboration agreement, BMS will have exclusive rights and will be solely responsible for the clinical development and commercialization of any products. Pursuant to the collaboration agreement with BMS, we received a noncreditable and non-refundable upfront payment of $30.0 million in March 2015. We are also entitled to receive development and regulatory contingent fees that could exceed $309.0 million for a successful compound approved in certain indications. In addition, we are also eligible to receive tiered royalties on the net sales of any products from the collaboration. BMS shall also reimburse us for agreed upon costs based on a contractual cost per full-time equivalent employee in connection with the performance of research activities during the research term. Under the collaboration agreement, we were obligated to provide the following deliverables: (i) granting of license rights to our program, (ii) participation in the Joint Research Committee, and (iii) performance of research activities. We concluded that these deliverables are a single unit of accounting as the license does not have stand-alone value apart from the other deliverables. Accordingly, the $30.0 million upfront payment is being recognized ratably as revenue from the effective date of the agreement through September 2016, the end of the estimated research term. We believe that straight-line recognition of this revenue is appropriate as the research is expected to be performed ratably over the research period. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized revenue of $16.6 million and $82 2 ,000 relating to the upfront payment and research activities we performed, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, deferred revenue related to the $30.0 million upfront payment was $13.4 million. 

Our Discovery Engine 

The approaches that we use in connection with both our proprietary product development programs and our corporate collaborations are designed to identify protein targets for compound screening and validate the role of those targets in the disease process. Unlike genomics &#8209;based approaches, which begin by identifying genes and then searching for their functions, our approach identifies proteins that are demonstrated to have an important role in a specific disease pathway. By understanding the disease pathway, we attempt to avoid studying genes that will not make good drug 

&#160;

targets and focus only on the subset of expressed proteins of genes that we believe are specifically implicated in the disease process. 

We begin by developing assays that model the key events in a disease process at the cellular level. We then identify potential protein targets. In addition, we identify the proteins involved in the intracellular process and prepare a map of their interactions, thus giving us a comprehensive picture of the intracellular disease pathway. We believe that our approach has a number of advantages, including: 

&#183; 

improved target identification: it focuses only on the subset of expressed proteins of genes believed to be specifically implicated in the disease process; 

&#183; 

rapid validation of protein targets: it produces validated protein targets quickly because it uses key events in the disease process as the basis to design the functional, disease &#8209;based screen; 

&#183; 

improved disease pathway mapping: it produces a comprehensive map of the intracellular disease pathway, enabling the identification of a large number of potential protein targets; 

&#183; 

informed target selection: it provides a variety of different types of targets and information concerning the role each plays in their endogenous state to better select targets more susceptible to pharmaceutical intervention; 

&#183; 

efficient compound screening: it increases the probability and speed with which compound screening will identify &#8220;hits&#8221; because it provides detailed knowledge of the target that can be used to guide the design of the compound screen; and 

&#183; 

risk reduction: it may reduce the risk of failure in the product development process due to serious side effects, including toxicity or other reasons, by selecting only targets that are specific to the disease in question and that have no apparent role in other cell types or signaling pathways. 

Because of the very large numbers of screens employed, our technology is labor intensive. The complexity of our technology requires a high degree of skill and diligence to perform successfully. We believe we have been and will continue to be able to meet these challenges successfully and increase our ability to identify targets for drug discovery. 

Pharmacology and Preclinical Development 

We believe that the rapid characterization and optimization of compounds identified in high &#8209;throughput screening (HTS) will generate high quality preclinical development candidates. Our pharmacology and preclinical development group facilitates lead optimization by characterizing lead compounds with respect to pharmacokinetics, potency, efficacy and selectivity. The generation of proof &#8209;of &#8209;principle data in animals and the establishment of standard pharmacological models with which to assess lead compounds represent integral components of lead optimization. As programs move through the lead optimization stage, our pharmacology and preclinical development groups support our chemists and biologists by performing the necessary studies, including toxicology, for IND application submissions. 

Clinical Development 

We have assembled a team of experts in drug development to design and implement clinical trials and to analyze the data derived from these trials. The clinical development group possesses expertise in project management and regulatory affairs. We work with external clinical research organizations with expertise in managing clinical trials, drug formulation, and the manufacture of clinical trial supplies to support our drug development efforts. 

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

We are able to protect our technology from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that it is covered by valid and enforceable patents or is effectively maintained as a trade secret. Accordingly, patents and other proprietary rights are an essential element of our business. We have about 7 4 pending patent applications and about 3 30 issued and active patents in the United States, as well as corresponding pending foreign patent applications and issued foreign patents. &#160; Our policy is to file patent applications to protect technology, inventions and improvements to inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business. We seek U.S. and international patent protection for a variety of technologies, including new screening methodologies and other research tools, target molecules that are associated with disease states identified in our screens, and lead compounds that can affect disease pathways. We also intend to seek patent protection or rely upon trade secret rights to protect other technologies that may be used to discover and validate targets and that may be used to identify and develop novel drugs. We seek protection, in part, through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements. We are a party to various license agreements that give us rights to use technologies in our research and development. 

Our patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. Our material patents relate to compositions of matter covering specific drug candidates in clinical trials that target SYK. These patents will expire, excluding patent term extensions, in 2023, 2024 and 2026. Several of these patents will have patent term extensions, depending on the length of time required to conduct clinical trials. 

We currently hold a number of issued patents in the United States, as well as corresponding applications that allow us to pursue patents in other countries, some of which have been allowed and/or granted and others of which we expect to be granted. Specifically, in most cases where we hold a U.S. issued patent, the subject matter is covered at least by an application filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), which is then used or has been used to pursue protection in certain countries that are members of the treaty. Our material patents relate to fostamatinib, an oral SYK inhibitor, and R406, the active metabolite of fostamatinib. 

Fostamatinib. Fostamatinib is covered as a composition of matter in a U.S. issued patent that has an expiration date in September 2026, after taking into account a patent term adjustment, and may be granted further protection under the patent term extension rules related to conducting clinical trials. Fostamatinib is also covered under broader composition of matter claims in a U.S. issued patent that has an expiration date in March 2026, after taking into account a patent term adjustment. Methods of using fostamatinib to treat various indications, methods of making fostamatinib, and compositions of matter covering certain intermediates used to make fostamatinib are also covered, respectively, in three U.S. issued patents; the earliest expiration date of any of these patents is in April 2023 and the latest expiration date is in June 2026, after taking into account patent term adjustments. Corresponding applications have been filed in foreign jurisdictions under the PCT, and are at various stages of prosecution. Of note, a patent covering fostamatinib as a composition of matter and in compositions for use treating various diseases has been granted by the European Patent Office. 

R406. R406 is covered as a composition of matter in a U.S. issued patent and, with a patent term adjustment, has an expiration date in February 2025. R406 is also covered under two broader composition of matter patents issued in the U.S. expiring in February 2023 and July 2024. Methods of using R406 to treat various indications and compositions of matter covering certain intermediates used to make R406 are also covered under patents described above. Corresponding applications have been filed in foreign jurisdictions under the PCT and are at various stages of prosecution. 

Competition 

The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Many of the drugs that we are attempting to discover will be competing with existing therapies. In addition, a number of companies are pursuing the development of pharmaceuticals that target the same diseases and conditions that we are targeting. For example, there are existing therapies and drug candidates in development for the treatment of ITP that may be alternative therapies to fostamatinib, if it is ultimately approved for commercialization. We 

&#160;

face, and will continue to face, intense competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as from academic and research institutions and government agencies, both in the United States and abroad. Some of these competitors are pursuing the development of pharmaceuticals that target the same diseases and conditions as our research programs. Our major competitors include fully integrated pharmaceutical companies that have extensive drug discovery efforts and are developing novel small molecule pharmaceuticals. We also face significant competition from organizations that are pursuing the same or similar technologies, including the discovery of targets that are useful in compound screening, as the technologies used by us in our drug discovery efforts. 

Competition may also arise from: 

&#183; 

new or better methods of target identification or validation; 

&#183; 

other drug development technologies and methods of preventing or reducing the incidence of disease; 

&#183; 

new small molecules; or 

&#183; 

other classes of therapeutic agents. 

Our competitors or their collaborative partners may utilize discovery technologies and techniques or partner with collaborators in order to develop products more rapidly or successfully than we or our collaborators are able to do. Many of our competitors, particularly large pharmaceutical companies, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources and larger research and development staffs than we do. In addition, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection with respect to potentially competitive products or technologies and may establish exclusive collaborative or licensing relationships with our competitors. 

We believe that our ability to compete is dependent, in part, upon our ability to create, maintain and license scientifically advanced technology and upon our and our collaborators&#8217; ability to develop and commercialize pharmaceutical products based on this technology, as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, obtain patent protection or otherwise develop proprietary technology or processes and secure sufficient capital resources for the expected substantial time period between technological conception and commercial sales of products based upon our technology. The failure by any of our collaborators or us in any of those areas may prevent the successful commercialization of our potential drug targets. 

Many of our competitors, either alone or together with their collaborative partners, have significantly greater experience than we do in: 

&#183; 

identifying and validating targets; 

&#183; 

screening compounds against targets; and 

&#183; 

undertaking preclinical testing and clinical trials. 

Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection, identifying or validating new targets or discovering new drug compounds before we do. 

Our competitors might develop technologies and drugs that are more effective or less costly than any that are being developed by us or that would render our technology and product candidates obsolete and noncompetitive. In addition, our competitors may succeed in obtaining the approval of the FDA or other regulatory agencies for product candidates more rapidly. Companies that complete clinical trials, obtain required regulatory agency approvals and commence commercial sale of their drugs before us may achieve a significant competitive advantage, including certain patent and FDA marketing exclusivity rights that would delay or prevent our ability to market certain products. Any drugs resulting from our research and development efforts, or from our joint efforts with our existing or future 

&#160;

collaborative partners, might not be able to compete successfully with competitors&#8217; existing or future products or obtain regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere. 

We face and will continue to face intense competition from other companies for collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, for establishing relationships with academic and research institutions and for licenses to additional technologies. These competitors, either alone or with their collaborative partners, may succeed in developing technologies or products that are more effective than ours. 

Our ability to compete successfully will depend, in part, on our ability to: 

&#183; 

identify and validate targets; 

&#183; 

discover candidate drug compounds that interact with the targets we identify; 

&#183; 

attract and retain scientific and product development personnel; 

&#183; 

obtain patent or other proprietary protection for our new drug compounds and technologies; and 

&#183; 

enter commercialization agreements for our new drug compounds. 

Research and Development Expenses 

A significant portion of our operating expenses is related to research and development and we intend to maintain our strong commitment to research and development. See &#8220;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; of this Annual Report on Form 10 &#8209;K for costs and expenses related to research and development, and other financial information for each of the fiscal years 201 5 , 201 4 and 201 3 . 

Government Regulation 

Our ongoing development activities are and will continue to be subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the United States and other countries, including the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The regulatory review and approval process is expensive and uncertain. Securing FDA approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to the FDA for each indication to establish a product candidate&#8217;s safety and efficacy. 

Preclinical studies generally are conducted in laboratory animals to evaluate the potential safety and the efficacy of a product. Drug developers submit the results of preclinical studies to the FDA as part of an IND application that must be approved before clinical trials can begin in humans. Typically, clinical evaluation involves a time consuming and costly three &#8209;phase process. 

&#183; 

Phase 1&#8212;Clinical trials are conducted with a small number of patients to determine the early safety profile, maximum tolerated dose and pharmacological properties of the product in human volunteers. 

&#183; 

Phase 2&#8212;Clinical trials are conducted with groups of patients afflicted with a specific disease in order to determine preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and expanded evidence of safety. 

&#183; 

Phase 3&#8212;Large &#8209;scale, multi &#8209;center, comparative clinical trials are conducted with patients afflicted with a specific disease in order to determine safety and efficacy as primary support for regulatory approval by the FDA to market a product candidate for a specific disease. 

The approval process takes many years, requires the expenditure of substantial resources and may involve ongoing requirements for post &#8209; marketing studies. Clinical trials are subject to oversight by institutional review boards and the FDA. In addition, clinical trials: 

&#183; 

must be conducted in conformance with the FDA&#8217;s good clinical practices and other applicable regulations; 

&#183; 

must meet requirements for institutional review board oversight; 

&#183; 

must meet requirements for informed consent; 

&#160;

&#183; 

are subject to continuing FDA oversight; 

&#183; 

may require large numbers of participants; and 

&#183; 

may be suspended by us, our collaborators or the FDA at any time if it is believed that the subjects participating in these trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks or if the FDA finds deficiencies in the IND or the conduct of these trials. 

Even if we are able to achieve success in our clinical testing, we, or our collaborative partners, must provide the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities with clinical data that demonstrates the safety and efficacy of our products in humans before they can be approved for commercial sale. We do not know whether any current or future clinical trials will demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy necessary to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals or will result in marketable products. Our failure, or the failure of our strategic partners, to adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our products under development will prevent receipt of FDA and similar foreign regulatory approval and, ultimately, commercialization of our products. 

Any clinical trial may fail to produce results satisfactory to the FDA. Preclinical and clinical data can be interpreted in different ways, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. Negative or inconclusive results or adverse medical events during a clinical trial could cause a clinical trial to be repeated or a program to be terminated. In addition, delays or rejections may be encountered based upon additional government regulation from future legislation or administrative action or changes in FDA policy or interpretation during the period of product development, clinical trials and FDA regulatory review. Failure to comply with applicable FDA or other applicable regulatory requirements may result in criminal prosecution, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production or injunction, as well as other regulatory action against our potential products, collaborative partners or us. 

Outside the United States, our ability to market a product is contingent upon receiving a marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, marketing authorization, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. At present, foreign marketing authorizations are applied for at a national level, although within the E.U., registration procedures are available to companies wishing to market a product in more than one E.U. member state. If the regulatory authority is satisfied that adequate evidence of safety, quality and efficacy has been presented, a marketing authorization will be granted. This foreign regulatory approval process involves all of the risks associated with FDA clearance. 

Manufacturing and Raw Materials 

We currently rely on, and will continue to rely on, third party contract manufacturers to produce sufficient quantities of our product candidates for use in our preclinical and clinical trials. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 201 5 , we had 12 6 employees. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining arrangement, and we believe our relationship with our employees is good. Recruiting and retaining qualified scientific personnel to perform research and development work in the future will be critical to our success. We may not be able to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic and research institutions and government agencies for experienced scientists. 

Scientific and Medical Advisors 

We utilize scientists and physicians to advise us on scientific and medical matters as part of our ongoing research and product development efforts, including experts in clinical trial design, preclinical develo pment work, chemistry, biology , immunology, muscle wasting and metabolism, general metabolism and oncology. Certain of our consultants receive non &#8209;employee options to purchase our common stock and certain of our scientific and medical advisors receive honorarium for time spent assisting us.
