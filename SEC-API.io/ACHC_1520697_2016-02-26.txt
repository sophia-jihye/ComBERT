 Item 1. Business. 

Overview 

Our business strategy is to acquire and develop behavioral healthcare facilities and improve our operating results within our facilities and our other behavioral healthcare operations. We strive to improve the operating results of our facilities by providing high-quality services, expanding referral networks and marketing initiatives while meeting the increased demand for behavioral healthcare services through expansion of our current locations as well as developing new services within existing locations. At December 31, 2015, we operated 258 behavioral healthcare facilities with over 9,900 beds in 39 states, the United Kingdom and Puerto Rico. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we acquired 176 facilities with approximately 3,450 beds and added 670 new beds, including 460 to existing facilities and 210 in two de novo facilities. On February 16, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Priory Group No. 1 Limited (&#147;Priory&#148;) which operated 327 facilities with approximately 7,100 beds at December 31, 2015. For the year ending December 31, 2016, we expect to add approximately 800 total beds exclusive of acquisitions. 

We are the leading publicly traded pure-play provider of behavioral healthcare services, with operations in the United States and the United Kingdom. Management believes that the Company&#146;s recent acquisitions position the Company as a leading platform in a highly fragmented industry under the direction of an experienced management team that has significant industry expertise. Management expects to take advantage of several strategies that are more accessible as a result of our increased size and geographic scale, including continuing a national marketing strategy to attract new patients and referral sources, increasing our volume of out-of-state referrals, providing a broader range of services to new and existing patients and clients and selectively pursuing opportunities to expand our facility and bed count. 

Acadia was formed as a limited liability company in the State of Delaware in 2005, and converted to a corporation on May 13, 2011. Our common stock is listed for trading on The NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol &#147;ACHC.&#148; Our principal executive offices are located at 6100 Tower Circle, Suite 1000, Franklin, Tennessee 37067, and our telephone number is (615) 861-6000.

Financing Transactions 

On February 16, 2016, we issued $390.0 million of 6.500% Senior Notes due 2024 (the &#147;6.500% Senior Notes&#148;). The 6.500% Senior Notes mature on March 1, 2024 and bear interest at a rate of 6.500% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning on September 1, 2016. We used the net proceeds to fund a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of Priory and the fees and expenses for such acquisition and the related financing transactions. 

On February 16, 2016, we entered into a Second Incremental Facility Amendment (the &#147;Second Incremental Amendment&#148;) to our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of December 31, 2012 (the &#147;Amended and Restated Credit Agreement&#148;). The 

&#160;

Second Incremental Amendment activated a new $955.0 million incremental Term Loan B facility (the &#147;New TLB Facility&#148;) and added $135.0 million to the Term Loan A facility (the &#147;TLA Facility&#148;) to our Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility (the &#147;Amended and Restated Senior Credit Facility&#148;), subject to limited conditionality provisions. Borrowings under the New TLB Facility were used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of Priory and the fees and expenses for such acquisition and the related financing transactions. Borrowings under the TLA Facility were used to pay down the majority of our $300.0 million revolving credit facility. 

On January 25, 2016, we entered into the Ninth Amendment (the &#147;Ninth Amendment&#148;) to the Amended and Restated Senior Credit Facility. The Ninth Amendment modifies certain definitions and provides increased flexibility to us in terms of our financial covenants. 

On January 12, 2016, we completed the offering of 11,500,000 shares of common stock (including shares sold pursuant to the exercise of the over-allotment option that we granted to the underwriters as part of the offering) at a public offering price of $61.00 per share. The net proceeds to us from the sale of the shares, after deducting the underwriting discount of $15.8 million and additional offering related costs of $0.7 million, were approximately $685.0 million. We used the net offering proceeds to fund a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of Priory. 

On September 21, 2015, we issued $275.0 million of additional 5.625% Senior Notes due 2033 (the &#147;5.625% Senior Notes&#148;). The additional notes form a single class of debt securities with the existing 5.625% Senior Notes. Giving effect to this issuance, we have outstanding and aggregate of $650.0 million of 5.625% Senior Notes. 

On September 21, 2015, we purchased approximately $88.3 million aggregate principal amount of 12.875% Senior Notes due 2018 (the &#147;12.875% Senior Notes&#148;) in connection with a tender offer for any and all of the 12.875% Senior Notes. The notes purchased represented 90.6% of the outstanding $97.5 million principal amount of 12.875% Senior Notes. The 12.875% Senior Notes were purchased at a price of 107.875% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, September 21, 2015. On September 18, 2015, we delivered a notice to redeem all $9.2 million in principal amount of the 12.875% Senior Notes remaining outstanding following the consummation of the tender offer. On November 1, 2015, we redeemed all of the outstanding $9.2 million principal amount of the 12.875% Senior Notes. As a result of this redemption, both the 12.875% Senior Notes and the indenture governing the 12.875% Senior Notes were satisfied and discharged in accordance with their terms. In connection with the purchase of notes, the Company recorded a debt extinguishment charge of approximately $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, including the premium and write-off of deferred financing costs, which was recorded in debt extinguishment costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. 

On May 11, 2015, we completed the offering of 5,175,000 shares of common stock (including shares sold pursuant to the exercise of the over-allotment option that we granted to the underwriters as part of the offering) at a price of $66.50 per share. The net proceeds to us from the sale of the shares, after deducting the underwriting discount of $12.0 million and additional offering-related costs of $0.8 million, were $331.3 million. We used the net offering proceeds to repay outstanding indebtedness and fund acquisitions. 

On April 22, 2015, we entered into an Eighth Amendment to our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the &#147;Eighth Amendment&#148;). The Eighth Amendment changed the definition of &#147;Change of Control&#148; in part to remove a provision whose purpose was, when calculating whether a majority of incumbent directors have approved new directors, that any incumbent director that became a director as a result of a threatened or actual proxy contest was not counted in such calculation. 

On February 11, 2015, we issued $375.0 million of 5.625% Senior Notes. The 5.625% Senior Notes mature on February 15, 2023 and bear interest at a rate of 5.625% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on August 15, 2015. We used the net proceeds to fund a portion of the consideration for the acquisition of CRC. 

On February 11, 2015, we entered into a First Incremental Facility Amendment (the &#147;First Incremental Amendment&#148;) to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The First Incremental Amendment activated a new $500.0 million incremental Term Loan B facility (the &#147;Existing TLB Facility&#148;) that was added to the Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility, subject to limited conditionality provisions. Borrowings under the Existing TLB Facility were used to fund a portion of the consideration for the acquisition of CRC. 

On February 6, 2015, we entered into a Seventh Amendment (the &#147;Seventh Amendment&#148;) to our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Seventh Amendment added Citibank, N.A. as an &#147;L/C Issuer&#148; under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement in order to permit the rollover of CRC&#146;s existing letters of credit into the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and increased both the Company&#146;s Letter of Credit Sublimit and Swing Line Sublimit to $20.0 million. 

On December 15, 2014, we entered into a Sixth Amendment (the &#147;Sixth Amendment&#148;) to our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the Sixth Amendment, we incurred $235.0 million of additional term loans. A portion of the additional term 

&#160;

loan advance was used to prepay our outstanding revolving loans, and a portion of the additional term loan advance was held as cash on our consolidated balance sheet. The Sixth Amendment also specifically permitted the acquisition of CRC. In connection with the acquisition of CRC, the Sixth Amendment (i) imposed a temporary reserve on our revolving credit facility in the amount of $110.0 million in order to preserve such reserved amounts for later borrowings to partially fund the consideration for the acquisition of CRC (subject to limited conditionality provisions) (the reserve is no longer in effect due to the acquisition of CRC), (ii) permitted the incurrence of an additional incremental term loan facility under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement partially to fund the consideration for the acquisition of CRC (subject to limited conditionality provisions) and (iii) permitted our issuance of additional senior unsecured indebtedness or senior unsecured bridge indebtedness partially to fund the consideration for the acquisition of CRC.

The 5.125% Senior Notes mature on July 1, 2022 and bear interest at a rate of 5.125% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on January 1 and July 1 of each year, beginning on January 1, 2015. We used the net proceeds to fund a portion of the consideration for the acquisition of Partnerships in Care. 

On June 17, 2014, we completed the offering of 8,881,794 shares of common stock (including shares sold pursuant to the exercise of the over-allotment option that we granted to the underwriters as part of the offering) at a price of $44.00 per share. The net proceeds to us from the sale of the shares, after deducting the underwriting discount of $15.6 million and additional offering-related expenses of $0.8 million, were $374.4 million. We used the net offering proceeds to fund a portion of the consideration for the acquisition of Partnerships in Care. 

On June 16, 2014, we entered into a Fifth Amendment (the &#147;Fifth Amendment&#148;) to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Fifth Amendment specifically permitted our acquisition of Partnerships in Care, gave us the ability to incur a tranche of term loan B debt in the future through its incremental credit facility, and modified certain of the restrictive covenants on miscellaneous investments and incurrence of miscellaneous liens. The restrictive covenants on investments in joint ventures and foreign subsidiaries were also amended such that we may now invest, in any given fiscal year, up to five percent (5%) of its total assets in both joint ventures and foreign subsidiaries, respectively; provided that the aggregate amount of investments in both joint ventures and foreign subsidiaries, respectively, may not exceed ten percent (10%) of its total assets over the life of the Amended and Restated Senior Credit Facility; provided further that the aggregate amount of investments made in both joint ventures and foreign subsidiaries collectively pursuant to the foregoing may not exceed fifteen percent (15%) of its total assets. Finally, the Fifth Amendment provided increased flexibility to us in terms of its financial covenants. 

On February 13, 2014, we entered into a Fourth Amendment (the &#147;Fourth Amendment&#148;) to our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, to increase the size of our Amended and Restated Senior Credit Facility and extend the maturity date thereof, which resulted in our having a revolving line of credit of up to $300.0 million and term loans of $300.0 million. The Fourth Amendment also reduced the interest rates applicable to the Amended and Restated Senior Credit Facility and provided increased flexibility to us in terms of our financial and other restrictive covenants. 

On March 12, 2013, we issued $150.0 million of 6.125% Senior Notes due 2021 (the &#147;6.125% Notes&#148; and together with the 5.125% Senior Notes, the 5.625% Senior Notes and the 6.500% Senior Notes, the &#147;Senior Notes&#148;). The 6.125% Senior Notes mature on March 15, 2021 and bear interest at a rate of 6.125% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on September 15, 2013. 

On March 12, 2013, we redeemed $52.5 million of the 12.875% Senior Notes using a portion of the net proceeds of our December 2012 equity offering pursuant to the provision in the indenture permitting an optional redemption with equity proceeds of up to 35% of the principal amount of 12.875% Senior Notes. The 12.875% Senior Notes were redeemed at a redemption price of 112.875% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date in accordance with the provisions of the indenture governing the 12.875% Senior Notes. As part of the redemption of 35% of the 12.875% Senior Notes, we recorded a debt extinguishment charge of $9.4 million, including the premium and write-off of deferred financing costs, which was recorded in debt extinguishment costs in the consolidated statements of income. 

On December 31, 2012, we amended and restated our existing senior secured credit agreement, to provide a revolving line of credit of $100.0 million and term loans of $300.0 million, which resulted in debt proceeds of $151.1 million. We used $151.1 million of the term loans partially to fund the acquisition of Behavioral Centers of America, LLC (&#147;BCA&#148;) and AmiCare Behavioral Centers, LLC (&#147;AmiCare&#148;) on December 31, 2012. The credit agreement was amended further in 2013 and 2014 as disclosed above and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;). 

On December 12, 2012, we completed the offering of 7,000,000 shares of Acadia common stock and on December 24, 2012, we completed the offering of 1,050,000 shares of Acadia common stock sold pursuant to the exercise of the over-allotment option that we granted to the underwriters as part of the offering at a price of $22.50 per share. The net proceeds to us from the sale of the shares, after deducting the underwriting discount of $6.3 million and additional offering-related expenses of $1.0 million, were $172.8 million. We used the net proceeds principally to fund the acquisitions of AmiCare and BCA on December 31, 2012. 

&#160;

On May 21, 2012, we completed the offering of 9,487,500 shares of Acadia common stock (including shares sold pursuant to the exercise of the over-allotment option that we granted to the underwriters as part of the offering) at a price of $15.50 per share. The net proceeds to us from the sale of the shares, after deducting the underwriting discount of $6.4 million and additional offering-related expenses of $0.7 million, were $139.0 million. We used the net offering proceeds to fund the acquisition of Timberline Knolls, LLC and acquisitions of certain facilities previously leased. 

Competitive Strengths 

Management believes the following strengths differentiate us from other providers of behavioral healthcare services: 

Premier operational management team with track record of success . Our management team has over 185 combined years of experience in acquiring, integrating and operating a variety of behavioral health facilities. Following the sale of Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. (&#147;PSI&#148;) to Universal Health Services, Inc. (&#147;UHS&#148;) in November 2010, certain of PSI&#146;s key former executive officers joined Acadia in February 2011. The extensive national experience and operational expertise of our management team give us what management believes to be the premier leadership team in the behavioral healthcare industry. Our management team strives to use its years of experience operating behavioral healthcare facilities to generate strong cash flow and grow a profitable business. 

Favorable industry and legislative trends. According to a 2012 survey by Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (&#147;SAMHSA&#148;), 18.6% of adults in the United States aged 18 years or older suffer from a mental illness in a given year and about 4% suffer from a serious mental illness. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, over 20% of children, either currently or at some point in their life, have had a seriously debilitating mental disorder. Management believes the market for behavioral services will continue to grow due to increased awareness of mental health and substance abuse conditions and treatment options. According to a 2014 SAMHSA report, national expenditures at substance abuse treatment facilities are expected to reach $42.1 billion in 2020, up from $24.3 billion in 2009. 

While the growing awareness of mental health and substance abuse conditions is expected to accelerate demand for services, recent healthcare reform in the United States is expected to increase access to industry services as more people obtain insurance coverage. A key aspect of reform legislation is the extension of mental health parity protections established into law by the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 (the &#147;MHPAEA&#148;). The MHPAEA requires employers who provide behavioral health and addiction benefits to provide such coverage to the same extent as other medical conditions. 

The mental health hospitals market in the United Kingdom was roughly &#163;14.4 billion in 2011. As a result of government budget constraints and an increased focus on quality, the independent mental health hospitals market has witnessed significant expansion in the last decade, making it one of the fastest growing sectors in the United Kingdom healthcare industry. Demand for independent sector beds has grown significantly as a result of the National Health Service (the &#147;NHS&#148;) reducing its bed capacity and increasing hospitalization rates. Independent sector demand is expected to further increase in light of additional bed closures and reduction in community capacity by the NHS. 

Leading platform in attractive healthcare niche . We are a leading behavioral healthcare platform in an industry that is undergoing consolidation in an effort to reduce costs and expand programs to better serve the growing need for inpatient behavioral healthcare services. 

Diversified revenue and payor bases . As of December 31, 2015, we operated 258 facilities in 39 states, the United Kingdom and Puerto Rico. On a pro forma basis as of December 31, 2015, giving effect to the Priory acquisition, we would have operated 585 facilities in 39 states, the United Kingdom and Puerto Rico. Our payor, patient and geographic diversity mitigates the potential risk associated with any single facility. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we received 33% from Medicaid, 20% from the NHS (including Local Authorities in the United Kingdom), 23% from commercial payors, 12% from Medicare and 12% from other payors. On a pro forma basis for the year ended December 31, 2015, giving effect to the 2014 and 2015 Acquisitions and the Priory acquisition, we would have received 23% of our revenue from Medicaid, 41% from the NHS (including Local Authorities in the United Kingdom), 16% from commercial payors, 8% from Medicare and 12% from other payors. As we receive Medicaid payments from 43 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, management does not believe that we are significantly affected by changes in reimbursement policies in any one state or territory. Substantially all of our Medicaid payments relate to the care of children and adolescents. Management believes that children and adolescents are a patient class that is less susceptible to reductions in reimbursement rates. No facility accounted for more than 2% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 on a pro forma basis giving effect to the 2014 and 2015 Acquisitions and the Priory acquisition, and no state or U.S. territory accounted for more than 6% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015. We believe that our increased geographic diversity will mitigate the impact of any financial or budgetary pressure that may arise in a particular state or market where we operate. 

&#160;

Strong cash flow generation and low capital requirements . We generate strong free cash flow by profitably operating our business and by actively managing our working capital. Moreover, as the behavioral healthcare business does not typically require the procurement and replacement of expensive medical equipment, our maintenance capital expenditure requirements are generally less than that of other facility-based healthcare providers. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our maintenance capital expenditures amounted to approximately 3% of our revenue. In addition, our accounts receivable management is less complex than medical/surgical hospital providers because behavioral healthcare facilities have fewer billing codes and generally are paid on a per diem basis. 

Business Strategy 

We are committed to providing the communities we serve with high-quality, cost-effective behavioral healthcare services, while growing our business, increasing profitability and creating long-term value for our stockholders. To achieve these objectives, we have aligned our activities around the following growth strategies: 

Increase margins by enhancing programs and improving performance at existing facilities. Management believes we can improve efficiencies and increase operating margins by utilizing our management&#146;s expertise and experience within existing programs and their expertise in improving performance at underperforming facilities. Management believes the efficiencies can be realized by investing in growth in strong markets, addressing capital-constrained facilities that have underperformed and improving management systems. Furthermore, our recent acquisitions of additional facilities give us an opportunity to develop a marketing strategy in many markets which should help us increase the geographic footprint from which our existing facilities attract patients and referrals. 

Opportunistically pursue acquisitions . With the completed acquisitions of Priory, CRC and Partnerships in Care, we have positioned our company as a leading provider of mental health services in the United States and the United Kingdom. The behavioral healthcare industry in the United States and the independent behavioral healthcare industry in the United Kingdom are highly fragmented, and we selectively seek opportunities to expand and diversify our base of operations by acquiring additional facilities. Acadia management believes there are a number of acquisition candidates available at attractive valuations, and we have a number of potential acquisitions in various stages of development and consideration in the United States. In addition, management sees meaningful opportunities to pursue additional select acquisitions in the United Kingdom. 

Management believes our focus on behavioral healthcare and history of completing acquisitions provides us with a strategic advantage in sourcing, evaluating and closing acquisitions. We leverage our management team&#146;s expertise to identify and integrate acquisitions based on a disciplined acquisition strategy that focuses on quality of service, return on investment and strategic benefits. We also have a comprehensive post-acquisition strategic plan to facilitate the integration of acquired facilities that includes improving facility operations, retaining and recruiting psychiatrists and other healthcare professionals and expanding the breadth of services offered by the facilities. 

Drive organic growth of existing facilities. We seek to increase revenue at our facilities by providing a broader range of services to new and existing patients and clients. In addition, management intends to increase bed counts in our existing facilities. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we acquired 176 facilities and added 670 new beds, including 460 to our existing facilities and 210 in two de novo facilities. Furthermore, management believes that opportunities exist to leverage out-of-state referrals to increase volume and minimize payor concentration in the United States, especially with respect to our youth and adolescent focused services and our substance abuse services. 

U.S. Operations 

Our U.S. facilities and services can generally be classified into the following categories: acute inpatient psychiatric facilities; specialty treatment facilities; residential treatment centers; and outpatient community-based services. The table below presents the percentage of our total revenue attributed to each category on a pro forma basis giving effect to the 2014 and 2015 Acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2015: 

&#160;

Facility/Service 

&#160; Revenue for the Year Ended December 31, 2015 &#160; Acute inpatient psychiatric facilities

&#160; &#160; 40 % Specialty treatment facilities

&#160; &#160; 41 % Residential treatment centers

&#160; &#160; 16 % Outpatient community-based services

&#160; &#160; 3 % We receive payments from the following sources for services rendered in our U.S. facilities: (i) state governments under their respective Medicaid and other programs; (ii) commercial insurers; (iii) the federal government under the Medicare 

&#160;

program administered by CMS; and (iv) individual patients and clients. For the year ended December 31, 2015 in our U.S. facilities, we received 41% from Medicaid, 29% from commercial payors, 15% from Medicare and 15% from other payors. On a pro forma basis for the year ended December 31, 2015 in our U.S. facilities, giving effect to the 2014 and 2015 Acquisitions, we would have received 42% of our revenue from Medicaid, 29% from commercial payors, 15% from Medicare and 16% from other payors. 

At December 31, 2015, our U.S. facilities included 204 behavioral healthcare facilities with approximately 7,700 beds in 39 states and Puerto Rico. Of the 204 behavioral healthcare facilities, 109 are comprehensive treatment centers, of which 98 are leased properties. Of the remaining 95 facilities, 71 are owned properties and 24 are leased properties. 

Acute Inpatient Psychiatric Facilities 

Acute inpatient psychiatric facilities provide a high level of care in order to stabilize patients that are either a threat to themselves or to others. The acute setting provides 24-hour observation, daily intervention and monitoring by psychiatrists. Generally, due to shorter lengths of stay, the related higher patient turnover, and the special security and health precautions required, acute inpatient psychiatric facilities have lower average occupancy than residential treatment centers. Our facilities that offer acute care services provide evaluation and crisis stabilization of patients with severe psychiatric diagnoses through a medical delivery model that incorporates structured and intensive medical and behavioral therapies with 24-hour monitoring by a psychiatrist, psychiatric trained nurses, therapists and other direct care staff. Lengths of stay for crisis stabilization and acute care range from three to five days and from five to twelve days, respectively. 

Specialty Treatment Facilities 

Our specialty treatment facilities include residential recovery facilities, eating disorder facilities and comprehensive treatment centers (&#147;CTCs&#148;). We provide a comprehensive continuum of care for adults with addictive disorders and co-occurring mental disorders. Our detoxification, inpatient, partial hospitalization and outpatient treatment programs are cost-effective and give patients access to the least restrictive level of care. All programs offer individualized treatment in a supportive and nurturing environment. 

The majority of our specialty treatment services are provided to patients who abuse addictive substances such as alcohol, illicit drugs or opiates, including prescription drugs. Some of our facilities also treat other addictions and behavioral disorders such as chronic pain, sexual compulsivity, compulsive gambling, mood disorders, emotional trauma and abuse. The goal of our treatment facilities is to provide the appropriate level of treatment to an individual no matter where they are in the lifecycle of their disease in order to restore the individual to a healthier, more productive life, free from dependence on illicit substances and destructive behaviors. Our treatment facilities provide a number of different treatment services such as assessment, detoxification, medication-assisted treatment, counseling, education, lectures and group therapy. We assess and evaluate the medical, psychological and emotional needs of the patient and addresses these needs in the treatment process. Following this assessment, an individualized treatment program is designed to provide a foundation for a lifelong recovery process. Many modalities are used in our treatment programs to support the individual, including the twelve step philosophy, cognitive/behavioral therapies, supportive therapies and continuing care. 

Residential Recovery Facilities. Our inpatient facilities house and care for patients over an extended period and typically treat patients from a broadly defined regional market. We provide three basic levels of residential treatment depending on the severity of the patient&#146;s addiction and/or behavioral disorder. Patients with the most severe dependencies are typically placed into inpatient treatment, in which the patient resides at a treatment facility. If a patient&#146;s condition is less severe, he or she will be offered day treatment, which allows the patient to return home in the evening. The least intensive service is where the patient visits the facility for just a few hours a week to attend counseling/group sessions. 

Following primary treatment, our extended care programs typically offer residential care, which allows patients to develop healthy and appropriate living skills while remaining in a safe and nurturing setting. Patients are supported in their recovery by a semi-structured living environment that allows them to begin the process of employment or to pursue educational goals and to take personal responsibility for their recovery. The structure of this treatment phase is monitored by a primary therapist who works with each patient to integrate recovery skills and build a foundation of sobriety with a strong support system. Length of stay will vary depending on the patient&#146;s needs with a minimum stay of 30 days and could be multiple months if needed. 

Our outpatient clinics serve patients that do not require inpatient treatment or are transitioning from a residential treatment program; have employment, family or school commitments; and have stabilized in their substance addiction recovery practices and are seeking ongoing continuing care. 

Eating Disorder Facilities. Our eating disorder facilities provide treatment services for eating disorders and weight management, each of which may be effectively treated through a combination of medical, psychological and social treatment programs. 

&#160;

Comprehensive Treatment Centers . Our CTCs specialize in providing medication-assisted and abstinent-based treatment. Medication-assisted treatment combines behavioral therapy and medication to treat substance use disorders. CTCs utilize medication-assisted treatment to individuals addicted to opiates such as opioid analgesics (prescription pain medications) and heroin. Medication is used to normalize brain chemistry to block the euphoric effects of alcohol and opioids allowing our professional staff to provide behavioral therapy. Patients begin their treatment attending the clinic almost daily. Then, through successfully progressing in treatment, patients attend less frequently depending on individual treatment plans. The length of treatment differs from patient to patient, but typically ranges from one to three years.

Each of our CTCs provide a range of comprehensive substance abuse treatment support services that include medical, counseling, vocational, educational, and other treatment services. Our behavioral therapies are delivered in array of treatment models that may include individual and group therapy, intensive outpatient, outpatient, partial hospitalization/day treatment, road to recovery, and other programs that can be either abstinent or medication assisted based. 

Residential Treatment Centers 

Residential treatment centers treat patients with behavioral disorders in a non-hospital setting, including outdoor programs. The facilities balance therapy activities with social, academic and other activities. Because the setting is less intensive, demands on staffing, security and oversight are generally lower than inpatient psychiatric facilities. In contrast to acute care psychiatric facilities, occupancy in residential treatment centers can be managed more easily given a longer length of stay. Over time, however, residential treatment centers have continued to serve increasingly severe patients who would have been treated in acute care facilities in earlier years. 

We provide residential treatment care through a medical model residential treatment facility, which offers intensive, medically-driven interventions and individualized treatment regimens designed to deal with moderate to high level patient acuity. Children and adolescents admitted to these facilities typically have had multiple prior failed treatment plans, severe physical, sexual and emotional abuse, termination of parental custody, substance abuse, marked deficiencies in social, interpersonal and academic skills and a wide range of psychiatric disorders. Treatment typically is provided by an interdisciplinary team coordinating psychopharmacological, individual, group and family therapy, along with specialized accredited educational programs in both secure and unlocked environments. Lengths of stay range from three months to several years. 

Certain of our residential treatment centers provide group home, therapeutic group home and therapeutic foster care programs. Our group home programs provide family-style living for youths in a single house or apartment within residential communities where supervision and support are provided by 24-hour staff. The goal of a group home program is to teach family living and social skills through individual and group counseling sessions within a real life environment. The residents are encouraged to take responsibility for the home and their health as well as actively take part in community functions. Most attend an accredited and licensed on-premises school or a local public school. We also operate therapeutic group homes that provide comprehensive treatment services for seriously, emotionally disturbed adolescents. The ultimate goal is to reunite or place these children with their families or prepare them, when appropriate, for permanent placement with a relative or an adoptive family. We also manage therapeutic foster care programs, which are considered the least restrictive form of therapeutic placement for children and adolescents with emotional disorders. Children and adolescents in our therapeutic foster care programs often are part of the child welfare or juvenile justice system. Care is delivered in private homes with experienced foster parents who are trained to work with children and adolescents with special needs. 

Outpatient Community-Based Services 

Our community-based services can be divided into two age groups: children and adolescents (seven to 18 years of age) and young children (three months to six years of age). Community-based programs are designed to provide therapeutic treatment to children and adolescents who have a clinically-defined emotional, psychiatric or chemical dependency disorder while enabling the youth to remain at home and within their community. Many patients who participate in community-based programs have transitioned out of a residential facility or have a disorder that does not require placement in a facility that provides 24-hour care. 

Community-based programs developed for these age groups provide a unique array of therapeutic services to a very high-risk population of children. These children suffer from severe congenital, neurobiological, speech/motor and early onset psychiatric disorders. These services are provided in clinics and employ a treatment model that is consistent with our interdisciplinary medical treatment approach. Depending on their individual needs and treatment plan, children receive speech, physical, occupational and psychiatric interventions that are coordinated with services provided by their referring primary care physician. The children generally receive treatment during regular business hours. 

&#160;

U.K. Operations 

Overview 

With the Priory and Partnerships in Care acquisitions, we are the leading independent provider of mental health services in the United Kingdom, operating 381 inpatient behavioral health facilities with approximately 9,300 beds. The facilities are located in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. For the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our U.K. facilities generated revenue of $360.7 million and $151.1 million, respectively, primarily through the operation and management of inpatient behavioral health facilities. 

United Kingdom Mental Health Industry 

In the United Kingdom, central government spending on health for fiscal year 2015-2016 is budgeted at approximately &#163;141 billion, according to the United Kingdom government budget. This spending is primarily delivered by the NHS, a national public sector body. Local government spending on health and social care for the fiscal year 2015-2016 is budgeted at approximately &#163;25.1 billion and is commissioned by Local Authorities in the United Kingdom, which we refer to as Local Authorities. The NHS and Local Authorities dominate the United Kingdom healthcare market in terms of the funding of care, with private health insurers and self-payment playing a lesser role in the sector. 

The mental health market in the United Kingdom accounted for approximately &#163;14.4 billion in 2011. The independent mental health market accounted for roughly &#163;1.1 billion of that amount, or approximately 8% market share. As a result of government budget constraints and an increased focus on quality, the independent mental health market has witnessed significant expansion in the last decade, making it one of the fastest growing sectors in the United Kingdom healthcare industry. 

Mental health services in the United Kingdom are provided through three separate commissioning entities, each with their own separate budget and defined service responsibilities. The three entities are as follows: (i) Local Area Teams, which commission specialist mental health services (e.g., secure facilities and some acute facilities), (ii) Clinical Commissioning Groups, which commission all acute, rehabilitation and most community based services, and (iii) Local Authorities, which commission the remaining community mental health services (which focus primarily on learning disability services). In recent years, the NHS has placed increasing emphasis on implementing integrated care pathways in its mental health commissioning strategy, and the three commissioning entities are currently working to implement an integrated care pathways strategy through which all the services within the secure pathway are commissioned from the same provider (or provider consortium). Integrated care pathways provide patients with highly coordinated and personalized care overseen by a single provider that can monitor patient progression through each stage of the care pathway. 

Additionally, commissioning trends toward moving patients more quickly down care pathways, out of secure settings and into community focused care teams have increased the demand for community and rehabilitation services in the independent mental health market. The United Kingdom Department of Health recently identified priorities for essential change in mental health that include, among other things, funding providers based on the quality of their service rather than volume of patients, allocating funds to support specialized housing for people with mental health problems and adopting a new rating system and inspection process to improve the quality of care. Increasing political focus on the provision of mental health services in the United Kingdom and increasing support for the rights of mental health patients are expected to lead to further increases in the size of the mental health market in the United Kingdom. In addition, rising demand for mental health services in the United Kingdom coupled with a constrained mental healthcare funding environment are increasing pressure to improve operational efficiency and refer patients to single provider programs with care pathways that more appropriately reflect each patient&#146;s specific mental health needs. As a result of these pressures and an increased focus on quality, the independent mental health market has witnessed significant expansion in the last decade, making it one of the fastest growing sectors in the United Kingdom healthcare industry. 

&#160;

Description of U.K. Facilities 

In the United Kingdom, we provide inpatient services through a variety of facilities, including mental health hospitals, clinics, care homes, schools, colleges and children&#146;s homes. In addition to these services, we also operate a U.K. division that leverages on our clinical knowledge to provide Employee Assistance Programs (&#147;EAP&#148;) to organizations. 

Our U.K. facilities and services can generally be classified into the following categories: healthcare facilities, education and children&#146;s services, adult care facilities and elderly care facilities. The table below presents the percentage of our total revenue attributed to each category on a pro forma basis giving effect to the 2014 and 2015 Acquisitions and the Priory acquisition for the year ended December 31, 2015: 

&#160;

Facility/Service 

&#160; Revenue for the Year Ended December 31, 2015 &#160; Healthcare facilities

&#160; &#160; 65 % Education and Children&#146;s Services

&#160; &#160; 13 % Adult Care facilities

&#160; &#160; 13 % Elderly Care facilities

&#160; &#160; 9 % We receive payments from the NHS (including over 400 Local Authorities) and individual patients and clients. For the year ended December 31, 2015 in our U.K. facilities, we received 99% of our revenue from the NHS (including Local Authorities) and 1% from other payors. On a pro forma basis for the year ended December 31, 2015 in our U.K. facilities, giving effect to the 2014 and 2015 Acquisitions and the Priory acquisition, we would have received 93% of our revenue from the NHS (including Local Authorities) and 7 % from other payors. 

At December 31, 2015, our U.K. facilities included 54 behavioral healthcare facilities with approximately 2,200 beds in the United Kingdom. At December 31, 2015, all of our U.K. Facilities were owned properties. 

Healthcare 

In the United Kingdom, mental health hospitals provide psychiatric treatment and nursing for sufferers of mental disorders, specifically for patients detained under a section of the United Kingdom&#146;s Mental Health Act of 1983, and whose risk of harm to others and risk of escape from hospitals cannot be managed safely within other mental health settings. In order to manage the risks involved with treating patients, the facility is managed through the application of a range of security measures depending on the level of dependency and risk exhibited by the patient. The levels of dependency and risk stemming from the wide range of disorders treated at these hospitals determine the level of care provided, which are comprised of: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Secure Services . Medium secure facilities treat patients who may present a serious danger to others and themselves but do not need the physical security arrangements of a high security hospital. The purpose of medium secure services is to provide effective care and treatment to reduce risk, promote recovery and support patients moving through the care pathway to lower levels of security or to reestablishing themselves successfully in the community. Low secure facilities provide treatment for patients whom, because of the level of risk or challenge they present, cannot be treated in open mental health settings. Low secure services deliver intensive, comprehensive and multidisciplinary treatment to patients demonstrating disturbed behavior in the context of a serious mental disorder and require the provision of security but pose a lesser risk of harm to themselves and to others. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Specialty Treatment Services . Specialty treatment services provide treatment relating to eating disorders and addiction. Our eating disorder facilities provide treatment services for eating disorders and weight management for both adults and adolescents. Our addiction services provide treatment for abuse of addictive substances such as alcohol and illicit drugs as well as facilities for other addictions and behavioral disorders such as compulsive gambling. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services . Child and adolescent mental health services provide treatment to young people in need of expert care and support for behavioral, emotional or mental health difficulties. These services are designed to enable the children and young people within our care to improve their long-term wellbeing and effectively reintegrate into the community when they are ready. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Rehabilitation Services . Both locked and open mental health rehabilitation services provide a bridge between secure hospital facilities and community living by providing relapse prevention and social integration services as well as vocational opportunities. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Acute Services . Acute services provide treatment relating to emergency admissions for patients at risk to themselves or others, as well as crisis intervention and treatment of behavioral emergencies. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Care Homes . Care homes provide long-term, non-acute care for adults suffering from a mental illness or addiction, or who have a learning disability or brain injury and are unable to cope unsupported in the community. Other Services 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Education and Children&#146;s Services. Education and children&#146;s services provide specialist education for children and young people with special educational needs, including autism, Asperger&#146;s Syndrome, social, emotional and mental health, and specific learning difficulties, such as dyslexia. The division also offers standalone children&#146;s homes for children that require 52-week residential care to support complex and challenging behavior and fostering services. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Adult Care . Adult Care focuses on care of service users with a variety of learning difficulties, mental health illnesses and adult autism spectrum disorders. Care is provided in a number of settings, including in residential care homes and through supported living. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Elderly Care . Elderly care provides long-term, short-term and respite nursing care to high-dependency elderly individuals who are physically frail or suffering from dementia. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Care First . Care First leverages our clinical knowledge to provide EAP to organizations. These support services are designed to help employees manage difficult issues in their professional or personal lives with services that include: &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; A call center for telephone counseling available 24-hours a day, seven days a week; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; A national network of counselors available for live, face-to-face support; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Interactive health and wellness programs; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Debt management advice services; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Management training. Sources of Revenue 

We receive payments from the following sources for services rendered in our facilities: (i) state governments under their respective Medicaid and other programs; (ii) commercial insurers; (iii) the federal government under the Medicare program administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (&#147;CMS&#148;); (iv) the NHS (including Local Authorities in the United Kingdom); and (v) individual patients and clients. Revenue is recorded in the period in which services are provided at established billing rates less contractual adjustments based on amounts reimbursable by Medicare or Medicaid under provisions of cost or prospective reimbursement formulas or amounts due from other third-party payors at contractually determined rates. See &#147;Item 7. Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#150; Revenue&#148; for additional disclosure. Other information related to our revenues, income and other operating information is provided in our Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Regulation 

U.S. Overview 

The healthcare industry is subject to numerous laws, regulations and rules including, among others, those related to government healthcare program participation requirements, various licensure and accreditation standards, reimbursement for patient services, health information privacy and security rules, and government healthcare program fraud and abuse provisions. Providers that are found to have violated any of these laws and regulations may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs, subjected to loss or limitation of licenses to operate, subjected to significant fines or penalties and/or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services. Management believes we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and is not aware of any material pending or threatened investigations involving allegations of wrongdoing. 

Licensing, Certification and Accreditation 

All of our facilities must comply with various federal, state and local licensing and certification regulations and undergo periodic inspection by licensing agencies to certify compliance with such regulations. The initial and continued licensure of our facilities and certification to participate in government healthcare programs depends upon many factors including various state licensure regulations relating to quality of care, environment of care, equipment, services, staff training, personnel and the existence of adequate policies, procedures and controls. Federal, state and local agencies survey our facilities on a regular basis to determine whether the facilities are in compliance with regulatory operating and health standards and conditions for participating in government healthcare programs. 

&#160;

Most of our residential facilities maintain accreditation from private entities, such as The Joint Commission or the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (&#147;CARF&#148;). The Joint Commission and CARF are private organizations that have accreditation programs for a broad spectrum of healthcare facilities. The Joint Commission accredits a broad variety of healthcare organizations, including hospitals and behavioral health organizations. CARF accredits behavioral health organizations providing mental health and alcohol and drug use and addiction services, as well as opiate treatment programs, and many other types of programs. These accreditation programs are intended generally to improve the quality, safety, outcomes and value of healthcare services provided by accredited facilities. Accreditation is generally a requirement for participation in government and private healthcare payment programs. In addition, certain federal and state licensing agencies require that providers be accredited. Accreditation is typically granted for a specified period, typically ranging from one to three years, and renewals of accreditation generally require completion of a renewal application and an on-site renewal survey. 

Certificates of Need 

Many of the states in which we operate facilities have enacted certificate of need (&#147;CON&#148;) laws that regulate the construction or expansion of certain healthcare facilities, certain capital expenditures or changes in services or bed capacity. Failure to obtain CON approval of certain activities can result in: our inability to complete an acquisition, expansion or replacement; the imposition of civil penalties; the inability to receive Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement; or the revocation of a facility&#146;s license, any of which could harm our business. 

Utilization Review 

Federal regulations require the treatment of patients in government healthcare programs be reviewed to confirm efficient utilization of facilities and services. The regulations require Quality Improvement Organizations (&#147;QIOs&#148;) and other agencies to review the appropriateness of Medicare and Medicaid patient admissions and discharges, the quality of care provided, the validity of diagnosis related group classifications and the appropriateness of length of stay. The agencies may deny payment for services provided, assess fines, or recommend to the Department of Health and Human Services and other regulatory agencies that a provider that is in substantial non-compliance with the Medicare Conditions of Participation be excluded from participating in the Medicare program. 

Audits 

Our healthcare facilities are subject to federal, state and commercial payor audits to validate the accuracy of claims submitted to the government healthcare programs and commercial payors. If these audits identify overpayments, we could be required to make substantial repayments, subject to various appeal rights. Several of our facilities have undergone claims audits related to their receipt of payments during the last several years with no material overpayments identified. However, potential liability from future audits could ultimately exceed established reserves, and any excess could potentially be substantial. Further, Medicare and Medicaid regulations, as well as commercial payor contracts, also provide for withholding payments in certain circumstances, which could adversely affect our cash flow. 

The Anti-Kickback Statute and Stark Law 

A provision of the Social Security Act known as the Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits healthcare providers and others from directly or indirectly soliciting, receiving, offering or paying money or other remuneration to other individuals and entities in return for using, referring, ordering, recommending or arranging for such referrals or orders of services or other items paid for by a government healthcare program. The Anti-Kickback Statute may be found to have been violated if only one purpose of the payment or remuneration is to induce referrals. A provider is not required to have actual knowledge or specific intent to commit a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute to be found guilty of violating the law. 

The Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services has issued regulations that provide &#147;safe harbors&#148; from federal Anti-Kickback Statute liability for various activities. The fact that conduct or a business arrangement does not fall within a safe harbor or exception does not automatically render the conduct or business arrangement illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. However, conduct and business arrangements falling outside the safe harbors may lead to increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities. 

Although management believes that our arrangements with physicians and other referral sources comply with current law and available interpretations, there can be no assurance that all arrangements comply with an available safe harbor or that regulatory authorities enforcing these laws will determine these financial arrangements do not violate the Anti-Kickback Statute or other applicable laws. 

These laws and regulations are extremely complex and, in many cases, we do not have the benefit of regulatory or judicial interpretation. It is possible that different interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our arrangements relating to facilities, equipment, personnel, services, capital expenditure programs and operating expenses. A determination that we have violated one or more of these laws, or the public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of one or more of these laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, we cannot predict whether other federal or state legislation or regulations will be adopted, what form such legislation or regulations may take or what their impact on us may be. 

&#160;

If we are deemed to have failed to comply with the Anti-Kickback Statute or other applicable laws and regulations, we could be subjected to liabilities, including criminal penalties, civil penalties, and exclusion of one or more facilities from participation in the government healthcare programs. The imposition of such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

The Social Security Act also includes a provision regarding physician self-referrals, commonly known as the &#147;Stark Law.&#148; This law prohibits physicians from referring Medicare patients to healthcare entities in which they or any of their immediate family members have an ownership or other financial interest for the furnishing of any &#147;designated health services.&#148; A violation of the Stark Law may result in a denial of payment, require refunds to the Medicare program, civil monetary penalties of up to $15,000 for each violation, civil monetary penalties of up to $100,000 for circumvention schemes, civil monetary penalties of up to $10,000 for each day that entity fails to report required information, exclusion from the government healthcare programs, and additionally could result in penalties for false claims. There are ownership and compensation arrangement exceptions for many customary financial arrangements between physicians and facilities, including the employment exception, personal services exception, lease exception and certain recruitment exceptions. Our financial arrangements with physicians are structured to comply with the statutory exceptions to the Stark Law and related regulations. However, future Stark Law regulations may alter the scope or interpretation of this law in a manner different from the manner in which we have interpreted them. We cannot predict the effect such future regulations will have on us. 

Federal False Claims Act and Other Fraud and Abuse Provisions 

The Social Security Act also imposes criminal and civil penalties for submitting false claims to the government healthcare programs. False claims include, but are not limited to, billing for services not rendered, billing for services without adequate documentation, misrepresenting the services rendered in order to obtain higher reimbursement, knowingly retaining overpayments and committing cost report fraud. Like the Anti-Kickback Statute, these provisions are very broad. 

Violations of the federal False Claims Act are punishable by fines of up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties. There are many potential bases for liability under the False Claims Act. The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 has expanded the number of actions for which liability may attach under the False Claims Act, eliminating requirements that false claims be presented to federal officials or directly involve federal funds. The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act also clarifies that a false claim violation occurs upon the knowing retention of overpayments. In addition, recent changes to the Anti-Kickback Statute have made violations of that law punishable under the civil False Claims Act. 

A current trend affecting the healthcare industry is the increased use of the False Claims Act, and, in particular, actions being brought by individuals on the government&#146;s behalf under the False Claims Act&#146;s qui tam, or whistleblower, provisions. Whistleblower provisions allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the government by alleging that the defendant has defrauded the federal government. Further, a number of states have adopted their own false claims provisions as well as their own whistleblower provisions whereby a private party may file a civil lawsuit on behalf of the state. 

Further, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (&#147;HIPAA&#148;) broadened the scope of the fraud and abuse laws by adding several criminal provisions for healthcare fraud offenses that apply to all health benefit programs, whether or not payments under such programs are paid pursuant to federal programs. HIPAA also introduced enforcement mechanisms to prevent fraud and abuse under Medicare. There are civil penalties for prohibited conduct, including, but not limited to, billing for medically unnecessary products or services. 

HIPAA Administrative Simplification and Privacy and Security Requirements 

The administrative simplification provisions of HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (&#147;HITECH&#148;), require the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for healthcare claims and payment transactions submitted or received electronically. These provisions are intended to encourage electronic commerce in the healthcare industry. HIPAA also established federal rules protecting the privacy and security of individually identifiable patient health information (&#147;PHI&#148;). The privacy and security regulations control the use and disclosure of PHI and the rights of patients to understand and control how such PHI is used and disclosed. Violations of HIPAA can result in both criminal and civil fines and penalties. 

The HIPAA security regulations require healthcare providers to implement administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of PHI. HITECH has strengthened certain HIPAA rules regarding the use and disclosure of PHI, extended certain HIPAA provisions to business associates, and created security breach notification requirements including notifications to the individuals affected by the breach, the Department of Health and Human Services, and in certain cases, the media. HITECH has also increased maximum penalties for violations of HIPAA privacy rules. Management believes that we have been in material compliance with the HIPAA regulations and have developed our policies and procedures to ensure ongoing compliance. 

&#160;

The Emergency Medical Treatment &#38; Labor Act 

The Emergency Medical Treatment &#38; Labor Act (&#147;EMTALA&#148;) is intended to ensure public access to emergency services regardless of ability to pay. Section 1867 of the Social Security Act imposes specific obligations on Medicare-participating hospitals that offer emergency services to provide a medical screening examination when a request is made for examination or treatment for an emergency medical condition regardless of an individual&#146;s ability to pay. Hospitals are then required to provide stabilizing treatment for patients with emergency medical conditions. If a hospital is unable to stabilize a patient within its capability, or if the patient requests, an appropriate transfer must be implemented. EMTALA imposes additional obligations on hospitals with specialized capabilities, such as ours, to accept the transfer of patients in need of such specialized capabilities if those patients present in the emergency room of a hospital that does not possess the specialized capabilities. CMS is currently considering rules that would require our hospitals to accept the transfer of patients in need of psychiatric services even if the patient is already admitted to the transferring hospital. 

Mental Health Parity Legislation 

The MHPAEA was signed into law in October 2008 and requires health insurance plans that offer mental health and addiction coverage to provide that coverage on par with financial and treatment coverage offered for other illnesses. The MHPAEA has some limitations because health plans that do not already cover mental health treatments are not required to do so, and health plans are not required to provide coverage for every mental health condition published in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders by the American Psychiatric Association. The MHPAEA also contains a cost exemption which operates to exempt a group health plan from the MHPAEA&#146;s requirements if compliance with the MHPAEA becomes too costly. 

Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act 

On March 23, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the &#147;PPACA&#148;). The Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the &#147;Reconciliation Act&#148;), which contains a number of amendments to the PPACA, was signed into law on March 30, 2010. Two primary goals of the PPACA, combined with the Reconciliation Act (collectively referred to as the &#147;Health Reform Legislation&#148;), are to provide for increased access to coverage for healthcare and to reduce healthcare-related expenses. 

On June 28, 2012, the United States Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the requirement in PPACA that individuals maintain health insurance or pay a penalty under Congress&#146;s taxing power. The Supreme Court upheld the PPACA provision expanding Medicaid eligibility to new populations as constitutional, but only so long as the expansion of the Medicaid program is optional for the states. States that choose not to expand their Medicaid programs to newly eligible populations in PPACA can only lose the new federal Medicaid funding in PPACA but not their eligibility for existing federal Medicaid matching payments. 

The Health Reform Legislation expands coverage of uninsured individuals and provides for significant reductions in the growth of Medicare program payments, material decreases in Medicare and Medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments, and the establishment of programs where reimbursement is tied in part to patient outcomes. Based on Congressional Budget Office estimates, the Health Reform Legislation, as enacted, is expected to expand health insurance coverage to approximately 32 to 34 million additional individuals through a combination of public program expansion and private sector health insurance reforms. 

Some of the most significant changes will expand the categories of individuals eligible for Medicaid coverage and permit individuals with relatively higher incomes to qualify. The federal government reimburses the majority of a state&#146;s Medicaid expenses, and it conditions its payment on the state meeting certain requirements. The federal government currently requires that states provide coverage for only limited categories of low-income adults under 65 years old (e.g., women who are pregnant, and the blind or disabled). In addition, the income level required for individuals and families to qualify for Medicaid varies widely from state to state. While the Health Reform Legislation will greatly expand the number of adults who are eligible for Medicaid, it may not impact our business as Medicaid generally does not reimburse for care provided to adults treated in freestanding behavioral health facilities. 

U.K. Overview 

The regulatory environment applicable to facilities in the United Kingdom is complex and multifaceted. The regulatory regime is made up of multiple statutes, regulations and minimum standards that are subject to continuous change. The laws and regulations applicable to the United Kingdom facilities include, without limitation, the Mental Capacity Act of 2005, Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act of 2006, Mental Health Act of 2007, Health and Social Care Act of 2008 and Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act of 2008. These laws and regulations are predominantly protective in nature and share the same general underlying 

&#160;

purpose to protect vulnerable persons from exploitation or harm. The regulatory requirements relevant to our facilities in the United Kingdom cover our operations from the initial establishments of new facilities, which are subject to registration and licensing requirements, to the recruitment and appointment of staff, occupational health and safety, duty of care to service users, clinical and educational standards, conduct of our professional and support staff and other areas. 

Mental Capacity Act of 2005. The Mental Capacity Act of 2005 establishes the process for determining whether a person lacks mental capacity at a particular time and also sets out who can make decisions in those circumstances and how they should go about this. The Act sets out when liability may arise for actions in connection with the care or treatment of persons who lack capacity to consent to such actions. 

Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act of 2006. The Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act of 2006 created the Independent Safeguarding Authority (&#147;ISA&#148;). In December 2012, the ISA merged with the Criminal Records Bureau to form the Discharge and Barring Service (&#147;DBS&#148;) and is required to establish and maintain lists of persons barred from working with children and adults. It is a criminal offense for a barred person to seek to work, or work in, activities from which they are barred. It is also generally a criminal offense for an employer to allow a barred person, or person who is not appropriately registered, to work in any regulated activity. 

The Mental Health Act of 2007. The Mental Health Act of 2007 regulates the manner in which an individual can be committed or detained against his or her will. The main purpose of the legislation is to ensure that people with serious mental disorders which threaten their health or safety or the safety of the public can be treated irrespective of their consent where it is necessary to prevent them from harming themselves or others. The Act places the burden on the entity detaining a person to prove that the entity has the right to hold the detainee. This places a substantial regulatory burden on service providers to ensure compliance with the law. 

The Health and Social Care Act of 2008 . The Health and Social Care Act of 2008 (&#147;HSCA&#148;), as amended by the Care Act 2014, established the Care Quality Commission (&#147;CQC&#148;) as the registration and regulatory body for health and adult social care in England. Under the HSCA, service providers carrying out &#147;regulated activities&#148; must be registered with the CQC for each separate regulated activity provided. Where the service provider is a company, each regulated activity/location must also have an individual registered as the registered manager. Registration depends both on an assessment of the fitness of the registered provider and also the individual registered manager. Regulated activities include the provision of residential accommodation together with nursing or personal care and the provision of treatment for a disease, disorder or injury by or under the supervision of a social worker or a multidisciplinary team which includes a social worker where the treatment is for a mental disorder. 

The Care Act 2014 . The Care Act 2014 came into force on April 1, 2015 along with a range of supporting regulations and a single set of statutory guidance. The Care Act 2014 requires Local Authorities to set personal budgets for individuals that are appropriate to meeting those individuals&#146; assessed eligible care and support needs. The Care Act 2014 also imposes new statutory duties upon Local Authorities to ensure the supply of diverse, good quality, local services, including a duty to plan for future demand and to ensure that services are high quality and sustainable. 

The regulated activities regulations and the registration regulations issued pursuant to the HSCA place legally binding obligations on health and social care providers. Breach of certain provisions of the HSCA or the regulations is a criminal offense. In addition, a breach may lead to the CQC taking action to suspend, cancel or vary the conditions of registration of a service provider or impose a substantial fine. 

Inspections by regulators in the United Kingdom can be carried out on both an announced and an unannounced basis depending on the specific regulatory provisions relating to the different services provided and also depending upon whether the inspection is routine or as a result of specific information regarding the service that has been provided to the regulator. Generally, however, a majority of inspections tend to be unannounced. A failure to comply with laws and regulations, the receipt of a poor inspection report rating or a lower rating, or the receipt of a negative report that leads to a determination of regulatory non-compliance or a failure to cure any defect noted in an inspection report may result in reputational damage, fines, the revocation or suspension of the registration of any facility or a decrease in, or cessation of, the services provided at any given location. 

Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act of 2007. The Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act of 2007 provides liability if the way in which a provider&#146;s activities are managed or organized causes a person&#146;s death and amounts to a gross breach of a relevant duty of care owed to the deceased person. 

Regulatory and Enforcement Bodies 

The primary healthcare regulatory enforcement bodies in the United Kingdom are Monitor, the CQC, HIW, CCSIW, HIS, SCSWIS and RQIA. In addition, OFSTED, Estyn, Education Scotland and other regulatory bodies regulate and inspect education 

&#160;

services in England, Wales and Scotland, as applicable. These enforcement bodies control and administer the registration, inspection and complaints procedures set out under the applicable laws and regulations. The enforcement bodies have the power to terminate a facility&#146;s registration, refuse to register a facility, impose admissions holds, or impose significant fines if a service provider fails to meet the key minimum standards and requirements prescribed under the various laws and regulations. See &#147;Risk Factors&#151; If we fail to comply with extensive laws and government regulations, we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations.&#148; 

Monitor. Monitor is the sector regulator for healthcare, tasked with regulating all providers of nonexempt NHS funded services in England. Monitor is the general economic and competition regulator. It fulfills this role through licensing health care providers and, together with the NHS England, sets the national price tariff for NHS services. Monitor&#146;s role includes regulating clinical commissioning groups, community services and secondary care services, protecting and promoting patients&#146; interests, tackling abuses and dealing with unjustifiable restrictions on competition. Monitor must exercise its functions with a view to preventing anticompetitive behavior in the provision of health care services. 

The CQC. The CQC is the independent regulator for health and adult social care in England. The CQC is distinct from Monitor in that it focuses on quality and ensuring the maintenance of standards in health and social care practices. The CQC licenses NHS and adult social care service providers to enable it to keep a check on safety and quality standards. The CQC also carries out facility inspections. Care homes for young adults (including specialist college accommodation) are registered and inspected by the CQC. 

HIW . HIW is the independent inspectorate and regulator of all health care in Wales. Certain independent healthcare services are required to register with HIW. HIW also inspects NHS and independent healthcare organizations in Wales to ensure compliance with its and the NHS&#146;s standards, policies, guidance and regulations. The HIW Review Service for Mental Health monitors the use of the Mental Health Act 1983 to ensure that it is being used properly on behalf of Welsh Ministers. 

CCSIW . Social care and social services in Wales are regulated by the Care and Social Services Inspectorate Wales (&#147;CCSIW&#148;). CCSIW carries out unannounced inspections and measure against regulations. Children&#146;s homes in Wales are inspected by CCSIW. 

HIS . Healthcare Improvement Scotland (&#147;HIS&#148;) is the independent regulator for healthcare services in Scotland. HIS inspects healthcare providers in Scotland to ensure compliance with its standards, policies, guidance and regulations. 

SCSWIS . Care services in Scotland are regulated by the Care Inspectorate Scotland (also known as Social Care and Social Work Improvement Scotland) (&#147;SCSWIS&#148;) and all care services in Scotland must be registered with them. As well as registration, SCSWIS inspects services against the National Care Standards and they can take action to force services to improve and can close services if necessary. Independent schools with boarding facilities must register their boarding provision with SCSWIS for the regulation of care as a school care accommodation service. 

RQIA . In Northern Ireland, the Regulation and Quality Improvement Authority (&#147;RQIA&#148;) is Northern Ireland&#146;s independent health and social care regulator. RQIA is responsible for registering, inspecting and encouraging improvement in a range of health and social care services in accordance with the Health and Personal Social Services (Quality, Improvement and Regulation) (Northern Ireland) Order 2003 and its supporting regulations. RQIA inspections are based on certain minimum care standards. 

OFSTED . The Office for Standards in Education, Children&#146;s Services and Skills (&#147;OFSTED&#148;) regulates and inspects services in England that care for children and young people, and services providing education and skills for learners of all ages. OFTSED carries out routine day school and further education college inspections to ensure compliance with inspection frameworks. 

Estyn . In Wales, the Office of Her Majesty&#146;s Inspectorate for Education and Training (&#147;Estyn&#148;) inspects quality standards in education and training for children&#146;s homes, residential schools and colleges. 

Education Scotland . In Scotland, the education provision for independent schools with boarding facilities is regulated by Education Scotland. 

Risk Management and Insurance 

The healthcare industry in general continues to experience an increase in the frequency and severity of litigation and claims. As is typical in the healthcare industry, we could be subject to claims that our services have resulted in injury to our patients or clients or other adverse effects. In addition, resident, visitor and employee injuries could also subject us to the risk of litigation. While management believes that quality care is provided to patients and clients in our facilities and that we materially comply with all applicable regulatory requirements, an adverse determination in a legal proceeding or government investigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

&#160;

Our statutory workers&#146; compensation program is fully insured with a $500,000 deductible per accident. Our operations have professional and general liability insurance for claims in excess of a $1,000,000 self-insured retention with an insured excess limit of $50 million. 

Environmental Matters 

We are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws that: (i) regulate certain activities and operations that may have environmental or health and safety effects, such as the handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of medical waste products generated at our facilities, the identification and warning of the presence of asbestos-containing materials in buildings, as well as the removal of such materials, the presence of other hazardous substances in the indoor environment, and protection of the environment and natural resources in connection with the development or construction of our facilities; (ii) impose liability for costs of cleaning up, and damages to natural resources from, past spills, waste disposals on and off-site, or other releases of hazardous materials or regulated substances; and (iii) regulate workplace safety. Some of our facilities generate infectious or other hazardous medical waste due to the illness or physical condition of our patients. The management of infectious medical waste is subject to regulation under various federal, state and local environmental laws, which establish management requirements for such waste. These requirements include record-keeping, notice and reporting obligations. Each of our facilities has an agreement with a waste management company for the disposal of medical waste. The use of such companies, however, does not completely protect us from violations of medical waste laws or from related third-party claims for clean-up costs. 

From time to time, our operations have resulted in, or may result in, non-compliance with, or liability pursuant to, environmental or health and safety laws or regulations. Management believes that our operations are generally in compliance with environmental and health and safety regulatory requirements or that any non-compliance will not result in a material liability or cost to achieve compliance. Historically, the costs of achieving and maintaining compliance with environmental laws and regulations at our facilities have not been material. However, we cannot assure you that future costs and expenses required for us to comply with any new or changes in existing environmental and health and safety laws and regulations or new or discovered environmental conditions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

We have not been notified of and management is otherwise currently not aware of any contamination at our currently or formerly operated facilities for which we could be liable under environmental laws or regulations for the investigation and remediation of such contamination and we currently are not undertaking any remediation or investigation activities in connection with any contamination conditions. There may, however, be environmental conditions currently unknown to us relating to our prior, existing or future sites or operations or those of predecessor companies whose liabilities we may have assumed or acquired which could have a material adverse effect on our business. 

New laws, regulations or policies or changes in existing laws, regulations or policies or their enforcement, future spills or accidents or the discovery of currently unknown conditions or non-compliances may give rise to investigation and remediation liabilities, compliance costs, fines and penalties, or liability and claims for alleged personal injury or property damage due to substances or materials used in our operations, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

Competition 

The healthcare industry is highly competitive. Our principal competitors include other behavioral healthcare service companies, including UHS, and the NHS in the U.K. We also compete against hospitals and general healthcare facilities that provide mental health services. An important part of our business strategy is to continue making targeted acquisitions of other behavioral health facilities. However, reduced capacity, the passage of mental health parity legislation and increased demand for mental health services are likely to attract other potential buyers, including diversified healthcare companies and possibly other pure-play behavioral healthcare companies. 

The mental health services sector in the United Kingdom comprises hospitals or establishments that provide psychiatric treatment for illness or mental disorder at all security and treatment levels. We operate in several highly competitive markets in the United Kingdom with a variety of for-profit, the NHS and other not-for-profit groups in each of our markets. Most competition is regional or local, based on relevant catchment areas and procurement initiatives. The NHS is often the dominant provider, although the trend has been towards increased outsourcing, whereby the NHS is both a provider and customer of mental healthcare services. The NHS (including Local Authorities) accounts for approximately 70% of the total mental health hospital beds providing care in the United Kingdom, with independent providers accounting for the remaining approximately 30% of beds. 

&#160;

In addition to the competition we face for acquisitions, we must also compete for patients. Patients are referred to our behavioral healthcare facilities through a number of different sources, including healthcare practitioners, public programs, other treatment facilities, managed care organizations, unions, emergency departments, judicial officials, social workers, police departments and word of mouth from previously treated patients and their families, among others. These referral sources may instead refer patients to hospitals that are able to provide a full suite of medical services or to other behavioral healthcare centers. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 26,400 employees, of which approximately 17,800 were employed full-time. At the acquisition date, Priory had over 16,000 employees. As of December 31, 2015, labor unions represented approximately 472 of our employees, at five of our U.S. facilities through eight collective bargaining agreements. Organizing activities by labor unions and certain potential changes in federal labor laws and regulations could increase the likelihood of employee unionization in the future. The Royal College of Nursing is the trade union for all full and part-time nurses, nursing cadets and healthcare assistants in the U.K. 

Typically, our inpatient facilities are staffed by a chief executive officer, medical director, director of nursing, chief financial officer, clinical director and director of performance improvement. Psychiatrists and other physicians working in our facilities are licensed medical professionals who are generally not employed by us and work in our facilities as independent contractors or medical staff members. 

Seasonality of Demand for Services 

Our residential recovery and other inpatient facilities typically experience lower patient volumes and revenue during the holidays, and our child and adolescent facilities typically experience lower patient volumes and revenue during the summer months, holidays and other periods when school is out of session. 

Pro Forma Financial Information 

This report contains certain unaudited information, including revenue and operating statistics based on revenue, that is presented on a pro forma basis assuming that acquisitions we completed during 2014 and 2015 and the acquisition of Priory occurred as of an earlier date. The unaudited pro forma information gives effect to each acquisition as if it occurred on January 1, 2014. Management believes that the pro forma financial information is helpful given the rapid growth of Acadia through acquisitions. The unaudited pro forma financial information has been prepared using the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (&#147;GAAP&#148;). The unaudited pro forma financial information is for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to represent what our financial condition or results of operations actually would have been had the events in fact occurred on the assumed date or to project our financial condition or results of operations for any future date or future period. The unaudited pro forma financial information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto elsewhere in this report and the financial statements of Acadia and the acquired companies in other reports that we have filed with the SEC.
