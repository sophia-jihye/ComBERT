 Item 1. Business

&#160;

Tronox is a public limited company registered under the laws of the State of Western Australia. We are a global leader in the production and marketing of titanium bearing mineral sands and titanium dioxide (&#8220;TiO 2 &#8221;) pigment, and the world&#8217;s largest producer of natural soda ash. Titanium feedstock is primarily used to manufacture TiO 2 . Our TiO 2 products are critical components of everyday applications such as paint and other coatings, plastics, paper, and other uses, and our related mineral sands product streams include titanium feedstock, zircon, and pig iron. Zircon, a hard, glossy mineral, is used for the manufacture of ceramics, refractories, TV screen glass, and a range of other industrial and chemical products. Pig iron is a metal material used in the steel and metal casting industries to create wrought iron, cast iron, and steel.

&#160;

We produce natural soda ash from a mineral called trona, which we mine at two facilities we own near Green River, Wyoming. At these facilities we process the trona ore into chemically pure soda ash and specialty sodium products such as sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) and sodium sesquicarbonate (S- Carb &#174; and Sesqui&#8482;). We sell soda ash directly to customers in the United States, Canada and the European Community, European Free Trade Association and South African Customs Union and to the American Natural Soda Ash Corporation (&#8220;ANSAC&#8221;), a non-profit foreign sales association in which we and two other U.S. soda ash producers are members. ANSAC then resells the soda ash to customers around the world. Our soda ash is used primarily by customers in the glass, detergent, and chemicals manufacturing industries. We use a portion of our soda ash at Green River to produce specialty sodium products such as sodium bicarbonate and sodium sesquicarbonate that have uses in food, animal feed, pharmaceutical, and medical applications.

&#160;

In June 2012, Tronox Limited issued Class B ordinary shares (&#8220;Class B Shares&#8221;) to Exxaro Resources Limited (&#8220;Exxaro&#8221;) and one of its subsidiaries in consideration for 74% of Exxaro&#8217;s South African mineral sands business, and the existing business of Tronox Incorporated was combined with the mineral sands business in an integrated series of transactions whereby Tronox Limited became the parent company (the &#8220;Exxaro Transaction&#8221;). Exxaro has agreed not to acquire any additional voting shares of Tronox Limited if, following such acquisition, Exxaro will have a voting interest in Tronox Limited of 50% or more unless Exxaro brings any proposal to make such an acquisition to the Board of Directors of Tronox Limited on a confidential basis. In the event an agreement regarding the proposal is not reached, Exxaro is permitted to make a takeover offer for all the shares of Tronox Limited not held by affiliates of Exxaro, subject to certain non-waivable conditions. At December 31, 2015, Exxaro held approximately 44% of the voting securities of Tronox Limited. See Note 24 for additional information regarding Exxaro transactions.

&#160;

Principal Business Segments

&#160;

We currently operate our business in two operating and reportable segments, TiO 2 and Alkali.

&#160;

On April 1, 2015 we completed the acquisition of 100% of the Alkali business (&#8220;Alkali&#8221;) from FMC Corporation (&#8220;FMC&#8221;) for an aggregate purchase price of $1.65 billion in cash (the &#8220;Alkali Transaction&#8221;). Prior to the Alkali Transaction, we had two operating and reportable segments, Mineral Sands and Pigment, based on the way the management team was organized and our Chief Operating Decision Maker (&#8220;CODM&#8221;) monitored performance, aligned strategies and allocated resources. As a result of the increased interdependency between the Mineral Sands and Pigment businesses, and related organizational changes, our CODM determined that it was better to review the Mineral Sands and Pigment businesses, along with our electrolytic business, as a combined segment, TiO 2 , and to assess performance and allocate resources at that level. Following the Alkali Transaction, we restructured our organization to reflect two integrated businesses, TiO 2 and Alkali, as our two operating and reportable segments.

&#160;

TiO 2 Segment 

&#160;

TiO 2 is used in a wide range of products due to its ability to impart whiteness, brightness, and opacity. TiO 2 is used extensively in the manufacture of paint and other coatings, plastics and paper, and in a wide range of other applications, including inks, fibers, rubber, food, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals. Moreover, it is a critical component of everyday consumer applications due to its superior ability to cover or mask other materials effectively and efficiently relative to alternative white pigments and extenders. TiO 2 is considered to be a quality of life product, and some research indicates that consumption generally increases as disposable income increases. At present, it is our belief that there is no effective mineral substitute for TiO 2 because no other white pigment has the physical properties for achieving comparable opacity and brightness, or can be incorporated as cost effectively.

&#160;

Our TiO 2 segment includes the following:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; exploration, mining, and beneficiation of mineral sands deposits; 

&#160;

&#183; production of titanium feedstock (including chloride slag, slag fines, rutile, synthetic rutile and leucoxene), pig iron, and zircon; 

&#160;

&#183; production and marketing of TiO 2 ; &#160; and 

&#160;

&#183; electrolytic manganese dioxide manufacturing and marketing, which is primarily focused on advanced battery materials and specialty boron products. 

&#160;

Exploration, Mining and Beneficiation of Mineral Sands Deposits

&#160;

&#8220;Mineral sands&#8221; refers to concentrations of heavy minerals in an alluvial environment (sandy or sedimentary deposits near a sea, river or other water source). Our exploration, mining and beneficiation of mineral sands deposits are comprised of the following:

&#160;

&#183; Our KwaZulu-Natal (&#8220;KZN&#8221;) Sands operations located in South Africa consist of the Fairbreeze mine (which we expect will enter into commercial production in early 2016), a concentration plant, a mineral separation plant, and a smelter complex with two furnaces; 

&#160;

&#183; Our Namakwa Sands operations located in South Africa include the Namakwa Sands mine, a primary concentration plant, a secondary concentration plant, a mineral separation plant, and a smelter complex with two furnaces; and 

&#160;

&#183; Our Western Australia operations, which consist of the Cooljarloo Sands mine and concentration plant and the Chandala processing plant, which includes a mineral separation plant, and a synthetic rutile plant. 

&#160;

Exploration

&#160;

Ilmenite - Ilmenite is the most abundant titanium mineral, with naturally occurring ilmenite having a titanium dioxide content ranging from approximately 45% to 65%, depending on its geological history. The weathering of ilmenite in its natural environment results in oxidation of the iron, which increases titanium content.

&#160;

Rutile - Rutile is essentially composed of crystalline titanium dioxide and, in its pure state, would contain close to 100% titanium dioxide. Naturally occurring rutile, however, usually contains minor impurities and therefore, commercial concentrates of this mineral typically contain approximately 94% to 96% titanium dioxide.

&#160;

Leucoxene - Leucoxene is a natural alteration of ilmenite with a titanium dioxide content ranging from approximately 65% to more than 90%. The weathering process is responsible for the alteration of ilmenite to leucoxene, which results in the removal of iron, leading to an upgrade in titanium dioxide content.

&#160;

Titanium Slag - The production of titanium slag involves smelting ilmenite in an electric arc furnace under reducing conditions, normally with anthracite (coal) used as a reducing agent. The slag forms a liquid layer on top a layer of liquid pig iron. Slag, containing the bulk of the titanium and impurities other than iron, and a high purity pig iron are both produced in this process. The final quality of the slag is highly dependent on the quality of the original ilmenite and the ash composition of the anthracite used in the furnace. Titanium slag has a titanium dioxide content of approximately 75% to 91%. Our slag typically contains 85% to 88% titanium dioxide.

&#160;

Titanium Slag Fines - For titanium slag to be suitable for use in the chloride process, it needs to be milled down to a particle size range which allows it to be processed effectively during the chlorination step of the chloride process. The milling of titanium slag results in the generation of a smaller size than can readily be used by chloride producers, which is separated and sold as a separate product. These slag fines are mostly sold to pigment producers who operate the sulfate process.

&#160;

Synthetic Rutile - A number of processes have been developed for the beneficiation of ilmenite into products containing between approximately 90% and 95% titanium dioxide. These products are known as synthetic rutile or upgraded ilmenite. The processes employed vary in terms of the extent to which the ilmenite grain is reduced, and the precise nature of the reducing reaction and the conditions used in the subsequent removal of iron. All of the existing commercial processes are based on the reduction of ilmenite in a rotary kiln, followed by leaching under various conditions to remove the iron from the reduced ilmenite grains. Our synthetic rutile has a titanium dioxide content of approximately 90% to 93%.

&#160;

Zircon - Zircon is frequently, but not always, found in the mineral sands deposits containing ilmenite. It is extracted, alongside ilmenite and rutile, as part of the initial mineral sands beneficiation process.

&#160;

Mining

&#160;

The mining of mineral sands deposits is conducted either &#8220;wet,&#8221; by dredging or hydraulic water jets, or &#8220;dry,&#8221; using earth-moving equipment to excavate and transport the sands. Dredging, as used at the Cooljarloo mine, is generally the favored method of mining mineral sands, provided that the ground conditions are suitable and water is readily available. In situations involving hard ground, discontinuous ore bodies, small tonnage, high slimes contents or very high grades, dry mining techniques are generally preferred.

&#160;

Dredge Mining - Dredge mining, or wet mining, is best suited to ore reserves located below the water table. A floating dredge removes the ore from the bottom of an artificial pond through a large suction pipe. The bulk sand material is fed as slurry through a primary, or &#8220;wet,&#8221; concentrator that is typically towed behind the dredge unit. The dredge slowly advances across the pond and deposits clean sand tailings behind the pond for subsequent revegetation and rehabilitation. Because of the high capital cost involved in the manufacturing and location, dredge mining is most suitable for large, long-life deposits. The dredging operations at Cooljarloo use two large floating dredges in a purpose-built pond. The slurry is pumped to a floating concentrator, which recovers heavy minerals from the sand and clay.

&#160;

Hydraulic Mining - At our Fairbreeze mine in KZN, we employ a hydraulic mining method for mineral sands due to the topography of the ore body and the ore characteristics. A jet of high-pressure water is aimed at the mining face, thereby cutting into and loosening the sand so that it collapses on the floor. The water acts as a carrier medium for the sand, due to the high fines (mineral particles that are too fine to be economically extracted and other materials that remain after the valuable fraction of an ore has been separated from the uneconomic fraction) content contained in the ore body. The slurry generated by the hydraulic monitors flows to a collection sump where oversize material is removed and the slurry is then pumped to the primary concentration plant.

&#160;

Dry Mining - Dry mining is suitable where mineral deposits are shallow, contain hard bands of rock, or are in a series of unconnected ore bodies. Dry mining is performed at Namakwa Sands, which is located in an arid region on the west coast of South Africa. The ore is mined with front end loaders in a load and carry operation, dumping the mineral bearing sands onto a conveyor belt system that follows behind the mining face. The harder layers are mined using hydraulic excavators in a backhoe configuration or by bulldozer. Namakwa Sands does not use blasting in its operations. The mined material is transported by trucks to the mineral sizers where primary reduction takes place.

&#160;

Processing and Mineral Separation

&#160;

Processing - Both wet and dry mining techniques utilize wet concentrator plants to produce a high grade of heavy mineral concentrate (typically approximately 90% to 98% heavy mineral content). Screened ore is first deslimed, a process by which slimes are separated from larger particles of minerals, and then washed through a series of spiral separators that use gravity to separate the heavy mineral sands from lighter materials, such as quartz. Residue from the concentration process is pumped back into either the open pits or slimes dams for rehabilitation and water recovery. Water used in the process is recycled into a clean water dam with any additional water requirements made up from pit dewatering or rainfall.

&#160;

Mineral Separation - The non-magnetic (zircon and rutile) and magnetic (ilmenite) concentrates are passed through a dry separation process, known as the &#8220;dry mill&#8221; to separate out the minerals. Electrostatic and dry magnetic methods are used to further separate the ilmenite, rutile and zircon. Electrostatic separation relies on the difference in surface conductivity of the materials to be separated. Conductive minerals (such as ilmenite, rutile and leucoxene) behave differently from non-conductive minerals (such as zircon) when subjected to electrical forces. Magnetic separation techniques are dependent on the iron content of a mineral. Magnetic minerals (such as ilmenite) will separate from non-magnetic minerals (such as rutile and leucoxene) when subjected to a magnetic field. A combination of gravity and magnetic separation is used to separate zircon from the non-magnetic portion of the heavy mineral concentrate. The heavy mineral concentrate at KZN Sands and Namakwa Sands is passed through wet high-intensity magnetic separation to produce a non-magnetic fraction and a magnetic fraction.

&#160;

Production of titanium feedstock, pig iron, and zircon

&#160;

Our TiO 2 operations have a combined annual production capacity of approximately 753,000 metric tons (&#8220;MT&#8221;) of titanium feedstock, which is comprised of 71,000 MT of rutile, 20,000 MT of leucoxene, 220,000 MT of synthetic rutile, and 410,000 MT of titanium slag. Our TiO 2 operations also have the capability to produce approximately 220,000 MT of zircon and 221,000 MT of pig iron.

&#160;

Titanium Feedstock - Ilmenite, rutile, leucoxene, titanium slag and synthetic rutile are all used primarily as feedstock for the production of TiO 2 . Titanium feedstock can be segmented based on the level of titanium contained within the feedstock, with substantial overlap between each segment. Different grades of titanium feedstock have similar characteristics. As such, TiO 2 producers generally source and supply a variety of feedstock grades, and often blend them into one feedstock. The lower amount of titanium used in the TiO 2 manufacturing process, the more feedstock required and waste material produced. Naturally occurring high-grade titanium minerals required for the production of TiO 2 are limited in supply. Two processes have been developed commercially: one for the production of titanium slag and the other for the production of synthetic rutile. Both processes use ilmenite as a raw material, and involve the removal of iron oxides and other non-titanium material.

&#160;

Titanium Slag - Ilmenite at KZN Sands and Namakwa Sands is processed further through direct current arc furnaces to produce titanium slag with a titanium content of approximately 86% to 89%. The smelting process comprises the reduction of ilmenite to produce titanium slag and pig iron. Ilmenite and anthracite are fed in a tightly controlled ratio into an operating furnace where the endothermic reduction of ilmenite occurs. The resultant titanium slag has a lower density than the iron, and separation of the two liquid products occurs inside the furnace. The slag and iron are tapped periodically from separate sets of tapholes located around the circumference of the furnace. Slag is tapped into steel pots and cooled for several hours in the pots before the slag blocks are tipped out. The blocks are subsequently transported to the blockyard where they are cooled under water sprays for a number of days. They are then crushed, milled, and separated according to size fractions, as required by the customers. The tapped pig iron is re-carburized, de-sulfurized, and cast into pigs.

&#160;

High Purity Pig Iron - The process by which ilmenite is converted into titanium slag results in the production of high purity iron containing low levels of manganese. When iron is produced in this manner, the molten iron is tapped from the ilmenite furnace during the smelting process, alloyed by adding carbon and silicon and treated to reduce the sulfur content, and is then cast into ingots, or &#8220;pigs.&#8221; The pig iron produced as a co-product of our titanium slag production is known as low manganese pig iron.

&#160;

Synthetic Rutile Production -Ilmenite may also be upgraded into synthetic rutile. Synthetic rutile, or upgraded ilmenite, is a chemically modified form of ilmenite that has the majority of the ferrous, non-titanium components removed, and is also suitable for use in the production of titanium metal or TiO 2 using the chloride process. Ilmenite is converted to synthetic rutile in a two-stage pyrometallurgical and chemical process. The first stage involves heating ilmenite in a large rotary kiln. Coal is used as a heat source and, when burned in an oxygen deficient environment, it produces carbon monoxide, which promotes a reducing environment that converts the iron oxide contained in the ilmenite to metallic iron. The intermediate product, called reduced ilmenite, is a highly magnetic sand grain due to the presence of the metallic iron. The second stage involves the conversion of reduced ilmenite to synthetic rutile by removing the metallic iron from the reduced ilmenite grain. This conversion is achieved through aeration (oxidation), accelerated through the use of ammonium chloride as a catalyst, and acid leaching of the iron to dissolve it out of the reduced ilmenite. Activated carbon is also produced as a co-product of the synthetic rutile production process.

&#160;

Zircon

&#160;

Zircon (ZrSiO 4 ) is a mineral which is primarily used as an additive in ceramic glazes to add hardness, which makes the ceramic glaze more water, chemical and abrasion resistant. It is also used for the production of zirconium metal and zirconium chemicals, in refractories, as molding sand in foundries, and for TV screen glass, where it is noted for its structural stability at high temperatures and resistance to abrasive and corrosive conditions. Zircon typically represents a relatively low proportion of the in-situ heavy mineral sands deposits, but has a relatively higher value compared to other heavy mineral products. Refractories containing zircon are expensive and are only used in demanding, high-wear and corrosive applications in the glass, steel and cement industries. Foundry applications use zircon when casting articles of high quality and value where accurate sizing is crucial, such as aerospace, automotive, medical, and other high-end applications.

&#160;

Competitive Conditions

&#160;

Globally, there are a small number of large mining companies or groups that are involved in the production of titanium feedstock, and these are dominated by close relationships between miners and consumers (predominately pigment producers).

&#160;

Production and Marketing of TiO 2 

&#160;

We operate three TiO 2 pigment facilities at the following locations: Hamilton, Mississippi; Botlek, the Netherlands; and Kwinana, Western Australia, representing an aggregate annual TiO 2 production capacity of 465,000 MT.

&#160;

Production

&#160;

TiO 2 is produced using a combination of processes involving the manufacture of base pigment particles followed by surface treatment, drying and milling (collectively known as finishing). Two commercial production processes are used by manufacturers: the chloride process and the sulphate process. All of our TiO 2 is produced using the chloride process. We are one of a limited number of TiO 2 producers in the world with chloride production technology. We believe that we are one of the largest global producers and marketers of TiO 2 manufactured via chloride technology. TiO 2 produced using the chloride process is preferred for some of the largest end-use applications.

&#160;

We believe the chloride process has several advantages over the sulphate process: it generates less waste, uses less energy, is less labor intensive, permits the direct recycle of chlorine, a major process chemical, back into the production process, and produces what is considered a high quality product. In the chloride process, high quality feedstock (slag, synthetic rutile, natural rutile or, in limited cases, high titanium content ilmenite ores) are reacted with chlorine (the chlorination step) and carbon to form titanium tetrachloride (&#8220;TiCl 4 &#8221;) in a continuous fluid bed reactor. Purification of TiCl 4 to remove other chlorinated products is accomplished using a distillation process. The purified TiCl 4 is then oxidized in a vapor phase form to produce raw pigment particles and chlorine gas. The latter is recycled back to the chlorination step for reuse. Raw pigment is then typically slurried with water and dispersants prior to entering the finishing step. The chloride process currently accounts for substantially all of the industry-wide TiO 2 production capacity in North America, and approximately 45% of industry-wide capacity globally.

&#160;

Commercial production of TiO 2 results in one of two different crystal forms: rutile, which is manufactured using either the chloride process or the sulphate process, or anatase, which is only produced using the sulfate process. All of our global production capacity utilizes the chloride process to produce rutile TiO 2 . Rutile TiO 2 is preferred over anatase TiO 2 for many of the largest end-use applications, such as coatings and plastics, because its higher refractive index imparts better hiding power at lower quantities than the anatase crystal form and it is more suitable for outdoor use because it is more durable. Although rutile TiO 2 can be produced using either the chloride process or the sulphate process, some customers prefer rutile produced using the chloride process because it typically has a bluer undertone and greater durability.

&#160;

The primary raw materials used in the production of TiO 2 include titanium feedstock, chlorine and coke. Chemicals used in the production of TiO 2 include oxygen and nitrogen. Other chemicals used in the production of TiO 2 are purchased from various companies under long-term supply contracts. In the past we have been, and we expect that we will continue to be, successful in obtaining short-term and long-term extensions to these and other existing supply contracts prior to their expiration. We expect the raw materials purchased under these contracts, and contracts that we may enter into in the near term, to meet our requirements over the next several years.

&#160;

Marketing

&#160;

We supply and market TiO 2 under the brand name TRONOX &#174; to approximately 1,200 customers in approximately 90 countries, including market leaders in each of the key end-use markets for TiO 2, and we have supplied each of our top ten customers with TiO 2 for more than 10 years. For information regarding 2015 sales volume by geography and end-use market, see section &#8220;Segment and Geographic Revenue Information&#8221;. 

&#160;

In addition to price and product quality, we compete on the basis of technical support and customer service. Our direct sales and technical service organizations execute our sales and marketing strategy, and work together to provide quality customer service. Our direct sales staff is trained in all of our products and applications. Due to the technical requirements of TiO 2 applications, our technical service organization and direct sales offices are supported by a regional customer service staff located in each of our major geographic markets.

&#160;

We believe the integrated nature of our TiO 2 operations provides us with a significant unit cash cost advantage over most of our TiO 2 producing peers. This is of particular importance as it positions us to be competitive through all facets of the TiO 2 cycle. Moreover, our three TiO 2 production facilities are strategically positioned in key geographies. The Hamilton facility is one of the largest TiO 2 production facilities in the world, and has the size and scale to service customers in North America and around the globe. Our Kwinana plant, located in Australia, is well positioned to service the growing demand from Asia. Our Botlek facility, located in the Netherlands, services our European customers and certain specialized applications globally.

&#160;

Our sales and marketing strategy focuses on effective customer management through the development of strong relationships. We develop customer relationships and manage customer contact through our sales team, technical service organization, research and development team, customer service team, plant operations personnel, supply chain specialists, and senior management visits. We believe that multiple points of customer contact facilitate efficient problem solving, supply chain support, formula optimization and co-development of products.

&#160;

The global market in which our TiO 2 business operates is highly competitive. Competition is based on a number of factors such as price, product quality, and service. We face competition not only from chloride process pigment producers, but from sulfate process pigment producers as well. Moreover, because transportation costs are minor relative to the cost of our product, there is also competition between products produced in one region versus products produced in another region.

&#160;

We face competition from competitors with facilities in multiple regions, including Chemours, Cristal Global, Huntsman and Kronos Worldwide Inc. In addition to the major competitors discussed above, we compete with numerous regional producers, including producers in China such as Sichuan Lomon, Henan Billions, CNNC and Blue Star.

&#160;

Electrolytic Manganese Dioxide Manufacturing and Marketing

&#160;

Our electrolytic and other chemical products operations are primarily focused on advanced battery materials and specialty boron products. We closed our sodium chlorate business line in the second quarter of 2015.

&#160;

Electrolytic manganese dioxide (&#8220;EMD&#8221;) &#160;&#8212; EMD is the active cathode material for alkaline batteries used in flashlights, electronic games, and medical and industrial devices. We believe that we are one of the largest producers of EMD for the global alkaline battery industry. EMD quality requirements for alkaline technology are much more demanding than for zinc carbon technology and, as a result, alkaline-grade EMD commands a higher price than zinc carbon-grade EMD. The United States primary battery market, predominantly based on alkaline-grade EMD, is the largest in the world followed by China and Japan according to the Freedonia Group. As such, we expect demand for alkaline-grade EMD to be sustained by the long-term growth of consumer electronics devices, partly offset by the trend toward smaller battery sizes and rechargeable batteries. The older zinc carbon technology remains in developing countries such as China and India. As the economies of China and India continue to mature, and the need for more efficient energy sources develops, we anticipate that the demand for alkaline-grade EMD will increase.

&#160;

Boron &#160;&#8212; Specialty boron product end-use applications include semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, high-performance fibers, specialty ceramics and epoxies, as well as igniter formulations. According to publicly available industry reports, we are one of the leading suppliers of boron trichloride, along with JSC Aviabor, Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, and several Asian manufacturers. We anticipate demand for boron trichloride will remain positive, driven primarily by the growth of the semiconductor industry. We believe we hold a similar leading position in the elemental boron market. We expect demand for elemental boron will continue to be largely flat following the trends in the defense and automotive industries in the United States.

&#160;

Alkali Segment 

&#160;

Our Alkali business is the world&#8217;s largest natural soda ash producer. We provide our soda ash to a variety of industries such as flat glass, container glass, detergent and chemical manufacturing. Soda ash, also known by its chemical name sodium carbonate (Na 2 CO 3 ) is a highly valued raw material in the manufacture of glass due to its properties of lowering the melting point of silica in the batch. Soda ash is also valued by detergent manufacturers for its absorptive and water softening properties. We produce our products from trona, which we mine at two sites in the Green River Basin, Wyoming. &#160; The vast majority of the world&#8217;s accessible trona reserves are located in the Green River Basin. According to historical production statistics, approximately one-quarter of global soda ash is produced from trona, with the remainder being produced synthetically, which requires chemical transformation of limestone and salt using a significantly higher amount of energy. Production of soda ash from trona is significantly less expensive than producing it synthetically. In addition, life-cycle analyses reveal that production from trona consumes less energy and produces less carbon dioxide and fewer undesirable by-products than synthetic production.

&#160;

Our Alkali segment includes the following:

&#160;

&#183; Dry mining of trona ore underground at our Westvaco facility; 

&#160;

&#183; Secondary recovery of trona from previously dry mined areas underground at our Westvaco and Granger facilities through solution mining; 

&#160;

&#183; Refining of raw trona ore into soda ash and specialty sodium alkali products; and 

&#160;

&#183; Marketing, sale and distribution of alkali products. 

&#160;

Our Alkali segment currently produces approximately 4 million tons of soda ash and downstream specialty products. All mining and processing activities related to our products take place in our facilities located in the Green River Basin of Wyoming, United States.

&#160;

Dry mining of Trona Ore

&#160;

Trona is dry mined underground at our Westvaco facility primarily through the operation of our single longwall mining machine. Longwall mining provides higher recovery rates leading to extended mine life compared to other dry mining techniques. Development of the &#8220;tunnels&#8221; necessary to access and ventilate our longwall is through room and pillar mining completed primarily by our fleet of bore miners. The ore is conveyed underground to two hoisting operations where it travels about 1,600 feet vertically to the surface where it is either taken directly into the processing facilities or stored on outdoor stockpiles for future consumption. 

&#160;

Secondary Recovery Solution Mining

&#160;

We solution mine trona at both our Westvaco and Granger sites using secondary recovery techniques. Our secondary recovery mining starts with the recovery of water streams from our operations and non-trona solids (&#8220;insolubles&#8221;) left over from the processing of dry mined trona. The water and insolubles are injected through a number of wells into the old dry mine workings at both our Westvaco and Granger sites. The insolubles settle out while the water travels through the old workings, dissolving trona that was left behind during previous dry mining. Multiple pumping systems are used to pump the enriched solution to the surface for processing.

&#160;

Refining of Trona into Finished Alkali Products

&#160;

Our Sesqui and Mono plants, located at our Westvaco site, convert dry-mined trona into soda ash. Crushing, dissolution in water, filtration, and crystallization techniques are used to produce the desired final products. In the Mono process, the ore is calcined with heat prior to dissolution, in order to convert the trona to soda ash via the removal of water and carbon dioxide. A final drying step using steam produces a dense soda ash product from the Mono process. In our Sesqui plant the calcination is instead performed at the end of the process, producing a light density soda ash that is preferred in applications desiring increased absorptivity. The Sesqui process also has the ability to produce refined sodium sesquicarbonate, (which we sell under the names S-Carb &#174; and Sesqui&#8482;) for use as a buffer in animal feed formulations and in cleaning and personal care applications.

&#160;

Solution mined trona is converted into dense soda ash in our ELDM operation at the Westvaco site and at our Granger facility. The steps to produce soda ash are similar to the dry mined processes, except the crushing and dissolving steps are eliminated because the trona is already in a water solution as it leaves the mine.

&#160;

Intermediate, semi-refined products are extracted from our soda ash processes at Westvaco at strategic locations for use as feedstocks for production of sodium bicarbonate and 50% caustic soda (NaOH).

&#160;

Marketing, Sale and Distribution of Alkali Products

&#160;

We sell our alkali-products to customers directly in the United States, Canada, the European Community, the European Free Trade Area and the South African Customs Union. We sell through ANSAC exclusively in all other markets. ANSAC is a nonprofit foreign sales association in which we and two other U.S. soda ash producers are members, whose purpose is to promote export sales of U.S. produced soda ash in conformity with the Webb-Pomerene Act.

&#160;

All of our alkali-products are shipped by rail and truck from our facilities in the Green River Basin. We operate a fleet of nearly 3,300 covered hopper cars which we use to deliver nearly 90% of the sales of alkali-products from the Green River facilities, all of which are shipped via a single rail line owned and operated by Union Pacific Railroad. Tronox leases these railcars from banks and leasing companies and from FMC under agreements with varying term-lengths. We recover costs of leasing through mileage credits paid under agreements with customers and carriers in accordance with established industry practices and government requirements.

&#160;

Alkali sells most of its product as soda ash. &#160; Soda ash is the only product we sell to ANSAC. Soda ash is highly valued by manufacturers of flat and container glass because it lowers the temperature of the batch in a glass furnace. It is also valued by detergent manufacturers for its absorptive qualities. Demand for soda ash in the United States has been relatively flat over the last five years. Sales of soda ash in rapidly developing economies have grown more rapidly as a growing middle class demands more products that use soda ash, such as glass for housing and autos and detergents for cleaning.

&#160;

Specialty Alkali Products

&#160;

Alkali markets sodium bicarbonate to private label manufacturers who package it for sale to retail grocery customers as baking soda. Alkali also sells sodium bicarbonate to manufacturers of packaged baked goods and similar products. Animal feed is an important market for sodium bicarbonate, which is mixed with feed to increase the yield of dairy cows and improve the health of poultry and other livestock. Sodium bicarbonate is also sold to customers who use it in hemodialysis applications and as an active ingredient in pharmaceutical products.

&#160;

Customers

&#160;

ANSAC is Alkali&#8217;s largest customer, with total sales representing 35% of total sales in the segment. Apart from ANSAC, Alkali is not dependent on any single or small group of customers, the loss of one of which would not have a material adverse effect on the Company.

&#160;

Competitive Conditions

&#160;

The global market in which our Alkali business operates is competitive. Competition is based on a number of factors such as price, favorable logistics and consistent customer service. In North America, our primary competition is from other U.S.-based natural soda ash operations: Solvay Chemicals, Ciner Resources, L.P., Tata Chemicals Soda Ash Partners in Wyoming, and Searles Valley Minerals, in California. Because of the cost advantages of natural soda ash production in the United States, imports have not been an important source of competition in North America. Sales of alkali-products outside of North America (principally through ANSAC) face competition from a variety of others, in most cases producers of soda ash using the synthetic method, but to a lesser extent producers of natural soda ash based in Turkey, China and Africa. Our specialty Alkali products also experience significant competition from producers of sodium bicarbonate, such as Church &#38; Dwight Co., Solvay Chemicals and Natural Soda LLC.

&#160;

Research and Development

&#160;

We have research and development facilities that service our products, and focus on applied research and development of both new and existing processes. Our research and development facilities supporting our mineral sands business are located in South Africa, while the majority of scientists supporting our pigment and electrolytic research and development efforts are located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. We also have research and development capabilities that support our Alkali business at our Green River, Wyoming facility.

&#160;

New process developments are focused on increased throughput, efficiency gains and general processing equipment-related improvements. Ongoing development of process technology contributes to cost reduction, enhanced production flexibility, increased capacity, and improved consistency of product quality. In 2015, our product development and commercialization efforts were focused on several TiO 2 products that deliver added value to customers across all end use segments by way of enhanced properties of the pigment. Alkali is a leader in trona solution mining and our development efforts are focused on continued improvement of our extraction and processing efficiencies.

&#160;

Patents, Trademarks, Trade Secrets and Other Intellectual Property Rights

&#160;

Protection of our proprietary intellectual property is important to our business. At December 31, 2015, we held 44 U.S. patents, 11 patent applications, and approximately 223 in foreign counterparts, including both issued patents and pending patent applications. Our U.S. patents have expiration dates ranging through 2131. Additionally, we have 5 trademark registrations and no pending trademark registration in the U.S., as well as 39 trademark registrations and 2 pending trademark registrations in foreign counterparts.

&#160;

We rely upon, and have taken steps to secure our unpatented proprietary technology, know-how and other trade secrets. The substantial majority of business patents relate to our chloride products and production technology. Our proprietary chloride production technology is an important part of our overall technology position. However, much of the fundamental intellectual property associated with both chloride and sulfate pigment production is no longer subject to patent protection. At Namakwa Sands, we rely on intellectual property for our smelting technology, which was granted to us in perpetuity by Anglo American South Africa Limited for use on a worldwide basis, pursuant to a non-exclusive license. Our Alkali business has long been a leader in new technology development; having patented the leading process for producing dense soda ash from trona in the 1960&#8217;s and for producing soda ash from solution feeds in the 1990&#8217;s. Much of the core intellectual property used today for production of natural soda ash is no longer subject to patent protection. Accordingly, we hold many of our proprietary process improvements in longwall mining, solution mining, and solution feed processing as trade secrets to protect our technological leadership.

&#160;

We protect the trademarks that we use in connection with the products we manufacture and sell, and have developed value in connection with our long-term use of our trademarks; however, there can be no assurance that the trademark registrations will provide meaningful protection against the use of similar trademarks by competitors, or that the value of our trademarks will not be diluted. The same can be said for our patents and patent applications, which may in the future be the subject of a challenge regarding validity as well as ownership, requiring a defense of the patent/application through legal proceedings which inherently introduce a degree of business uncertainty and risk. We also use and rely upon unpatented proprietary knowledge, continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position. We conduct research activities and protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets through reasonable measures, including confidentiality agreements and security procedures. While certain patents held for our products and production processes are important to our long-term success, more important is the operational knowledge we possess.

&#160;

Employees

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, Tronox had approximately 4,400 employees worldwide, of which 1,700 are located in the United States, 600 in Australia, 1,800 in South Africa, and 300 in the Netherlands and other international locations. Our TiO 2 segment employees in the United States are not represented by a union or collective bargaining agreement. Nearly 66% of the employees at the Alkali segment&#8217;s mining and manufacturing facility in Green River, Wyoming are members of a union and subject to a collective bargaining agreement. In South Africa, over 70% of our workforce belongs to a union. In Australia, most employees are not currently represented by a union, but approximately 50% are represented by a collective bargaining agreement. In the Netherlands, approximately 50% of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement and 30% are members of a union. We consider relations with our employees and labor organizations to be good.

&#160;

Environmental, Health and Safety Authorizations

&#160;

Mining

&#160;

Our facilities and operations are subject to extensive general and industry-specific environmental, health and safety regulations in the United States, South Africa and Australia. These regulations include those relating to mine rehabilitation, liability provision, water management, the handling and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous materials, and occupational health and safety. The various legislation and regulations are subject to a number of internal and external audits. We believe our mineral sands operations are in compliance, in all material respects, with existing health, safety and environmental legislation and regulations.

&#160;

Regulation of the Mining Industry in the United States

&#160;

We have the right to mine soda ash through leases we hold from the U.S. Federal government, the State of Wyoming and an affiliate of Anadarko Petroleum (&#8220;Anadarko&#8221;). Our leases with the U.S. government are issued under the provisions of the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 (30 U.S.C. 18 et. Seq.) and are administered by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (&#8220;BLM&#8221;) and our leases with the state of Wyoming are issued under Wyoming Statutes 36-6-101 et. seq. Anadarko is the successor to rights originally granted to the Union Pacific Railroad in connection with the construction of the first transcontinental railroad in North America. For more information please see discussion of Mining and Mineral Tenure in &#8220;Part I, Item 2 Properties&#8221;.

&#160;

We pay royalties to the BLM, the State of Wyoming and Anadarko. These royalties are calculated based upon the gross value of soda ash and related products at a certain stage in the mining process. We are obligated to pay minimum royalties or annual rentals to our lessors regardless of actual sales and in the case of Anadarko to pay royalties in advance based on a formula based on the amount of trona produced and sold in the previous year which is then credited against production &#160; royalties owed. The royalty rates we pay to our lessors and licensor may change upon our renewal of such leases; however, we anticipate being able to renew all material leases at the appropriate time. In the past, the U.S. Congress has passed legislation to cap royalties collected by BLM at a rate lower than the rate stated in our federal leases.

&#160;

Our mining operations in Wyoming are subject to several mine permits issued by the Land Quality Division of the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality (&#8220;WDEQ&#8221;). WDEQ imposes detailed reclamation obligations on us as a holder of mine permits. WDEQ has permitted us to &#8220;self-bond&#8221; our reclamation obligations as long as our Alkali Wyoming subsidiary maintains a minimum net worth. As of December 31, 2015, the amount of the self-bond was approximately $80 million. The amount of the bond is subject to change based upon periodic re-evaluation by WDEQ . 

&#160;

The health and safety of our employees working underground and on the surface are subject to detailed regulation. The safety of our operations at Westvaco are regulated the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration (&#8220;MSHA&#8221;) and our Granger Facility by the Wyoming Occupational Safety and Health Administration (&#8220;Wyoming OSHA&#8221;). &#160; MSHA administers the provisions of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 and enforces compliance with that statute&#8217;s mandatory safety and health standards. As part of MSHA&#8217;s oversight, representatives perform at least four unannounced inspections (approximately once quarterly) each year at Westvaco. Wyoming OSHA regulates the health and safety of non-mining operations under a plan approved by the U.S. Occupational Health and Safety Administration. When our Granger facility was restarted in 2009 on solution mine feed (i.e. without any miners working underground). Wyoming OSHA assumed responsibility for the facility.

&#160;

Regulation of the Mining Industry in South Africa

&#160;

There are numerous mining-related laws and regulatory authorizations that may impact the performance of our business. These include but are not limited to: the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Royalty Act, which imposes a royalty on refined and unrefined minerals payable to the South African government; the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development ACT (the &#8220;MPRDA&#8221;), which governs the acquisition, use and disposal of mineral rights; the South African Minerals Act, which requires each new mine to prepare an Environmental Management Program Report for approval by the South African Department of Mineral Reserves; the Revised South African Mining Charter, effective September 2010, which requires, among other conditions, that mining entities achieve a 26% historically disadvantaged persons ownership of mining assets and the Black Economic Empowerment (&#8220;BEE&#8221;) legislation in South Africa.

&#160;

Regulation of the Mining Industry in Australia

&#160;

Mining operations in Western Australia are subject to a variety of environmental protection regulations including but not limited to: the Environmental Protection Act, the primary source of environmental regulation in Western Australia, and, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth), which established the federal environment protection regime and prohibits the carrying out of a &#8220;controlled action&#8221; that may have a significant impact on a &#8220;matter of national environmental significance.&#8221;

&#160;

Prescriptive legislation regulates health and safety at mining workplaces in Western Australia. The principal general occupational health and safety legislation and regulations are the Occupational Safety and Health Act 1984 (WA), the Occupational Health and Safety Regulations 1996 (WA) and the guidelines. The Mines Safety and Inspection Act 1994 (WA) and Mines Safety and Inspection Regulations 1995 (WA) and guidelines provide the relevant legislation for mining operations in Western Australia. The Dangerous Goods Act 2004 (WA) applies to the safe storage, handling and transport of dangerous goods.

&#160;

Each Australian state and territory has its own legislation regulating the exploration for and mining of minerals. Our operations are principally regulated by the Western Australian Mining Act 1978 (WA) and the Mining Regulations 1981 (WA).

&#160;

State Agreements are contracts between the State of Western Australia and the proponents of major resources projects, and are intended to foster resource development and related infrastructure investments. These agreements are approved and ratified by the Parliament of Western Australia. The State Agreement relevant to our Australian operations and our production of mineral sands is the agreement authorized by the Mineral Sands (Cooljarloo) Mining and Processing Agreement Act 1988 (WA). State Agreements may only be amended by mutual consent, which reduces the sovereign risk and increases the security of tenure, however Parliament may enact legislation that overrules or amends the particular State Agreement.

&#160;

&#160; Regulation of Finished Product Manufacturing 

&#160;

Our business is subject to extensive regulation by federal, state, local and foreign governments. Governmental authorities regulate the generation and treatment of waste and air emissions at our operations and facilities. At many of our operations, we also comply with worldwide, voluntary standards developed by the International Organization for Standardization (&#8220;ISO&#8221;), a nongovernmental organization that promotes the development of standards and serves as a bridging organization for quality and environmental standards, such as ISO 9002 for quality management and ISO 14001 for environmental management.

&#160;

Our Alkali business is subject to extensive regulation by federal, state, local and foreign governments. U.S. Federal and Wyoming state authorities regulate the generation and treatment of waste and air emissions at our operations and facilities. Several of Alkali&#8217;s production operations are subject to regulation by the U.S. FDA. Our sodium bicarbonate plant is a registered facility for the production of food and pharmaceutical grade ingredients and we comply with strict CGMP requirements in our operations. The U.S. Food Safety Modernization Act will require that parts of our facility that produce animal nutrition products comply with new more rigorous manufacturing standards. We have a program in place to comply with these requirements in 2016. We also comply with industry standards developed by various private organizations such as U.S. Pharmacopeia, Organic Materials Review Institute and the Orthodox Union. Alkali has also sought and received certification of its Wyoming facilities under ISO 9002.

&#160;

Chemical Registration

&#160;

The European Union adopted a regulatory framework for chemicals in 2006 known as Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals (&#8220;REACH&#8221;). Manufacturers and importers of chemical substances must register information regarding the properties of their existing chemical substances with the European Chemicals Agency. The timeline for existing chemical substances to be registered is based on volume and toxicity. The first group of chemical substances was required to be registered in 2010, with additional registrations due in 2013 and 2018. We registered those products requiring registration by the 2010 and 2013 deadlines. The REACH regulations also require chemical substances which are newly imported or manufactured in the European Union to be registered before being placed on the market. We are now focused on the authorization phase of the REACH process, and are making efforts to address &#8220;Substances of Very High Concern&#8221; and evaluating potential business implications. As a chemical manufacturer with global operations, we are also actively monitoring and addressing analogous regulatory regimes being considered or implemented outside of the EU, for example, in Korea and Taiwan. We do not expect the costs of REACH compliance to be material to our operations at this time.

&#160;

We registered soda ash as a foreign manufacturer under REACH prior to the 2010 deadline and will register our sodium bicarbonate and sodium sesquicarbonate prior the 2018 deadline if we plan to sell such products in the EU. None of our Alkali production operations are located in the EU. None of our Alkali products are listed as a &#8220;Substance of Very High Concern.&#8221;

&#160;

Greenhouse Gas Regulation

&#160;

Globally, our operations are subject to regulations that seek to reduce emissions of &#8220;greenhouse gases&#8221; (&#8220;GHGs&#8221;). We currently report and manage GHG emissions as required by law for sites located in areas requiring such managing and reporting (European Union/Australia). While the United States has not adopted any federal climate change legislation, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;) has introduced some GHG programs. For example, under the EPA&#8217;s GHG &#8220;Tailoring Rule,&#8221; expansions or new construction could be subject to the Clean Air Act&#8217;s Prevention of Significant Deterioration requirements. Some of our facilities are currently subject to GHG emissions monitoring and reporting. We have sought and obtained a GHG emissions permit to cover a planned expansion of our Granger soda ash facility in Wyoming. Changes or additional requirements due to GHG regulations could impact our capital and operating costs; however, it is not possible at the present time to estimate any financial impact to these U.S. operating sites. Also, some in the scientific community believe that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the atmosphere may result in climatic changes. Depending on the severity of climatic changes, our operations could be adversely affected.
