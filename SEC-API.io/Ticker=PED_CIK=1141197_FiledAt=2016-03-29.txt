 ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 

&#160; 

History 

&#160; 

We were originally incorporated in September 2000 as Rocker &#38; Spike Entertainment, Inc. In January 2001 we changed our name to Reconstruction Data Group, Inc., and in April 2003 we changed our name to Verdisys, Inc. and were engaged in the business of providing satellite services to agribusiness. In June 2005, we changed our name to Blast Energy Services, Inc. (&#8220; Blast &#8221;) to reflect our new focus on the energy services business, and in 2010 we changed the direction of the Company to focus on the acquisition of oil and gas producing properties. 

On July 27, 2012, we acquired through a reverse acquisition, Pacific Energy Development Corp., a privately held Nevada corporation, which we refer to as Pacific Energy Development. As described below, pursuant to the acquisition, the shareholders of Pacific Energy Development gained control of approximately 95% of the voting securities of our company. Since the transaction resulted in a change of control, Pacific Energy Development was the acquirer for accounting purposes. In connection with the merger, which we refer to as the Pacific Energy Development merger, Pacific Energy Development became our wholly-owned subsidiary and we changed our name from Blast Energy Services, Inc. to PEDEVCO Corp. Following the merger, we refocused our business plan on the acquisition, exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas resources in the United States, with a primary focus on oil and natural gas shale plays and a secondary focus on conventional oil and natural gas plays. 

&#160; 

Business Operations 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

We are an energy company engaged primarily in the acquisition, exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas shale plays in the Denver-Julesberg Basin (&#8220; D-J Basin &#8221;) in Colorado, which contains hydrocarbon bearing deposits in several formations, including the Niobrara, Codell, Greenhorn, Shannon, J-Sand, and D-Sand. As of December 31, 2015, we held approximately 16,158 net D-J Basin acres located in Weld and Morgan Counties, Colorado through our wholly-owned subsidiary Red Hawk Petroleum, LLC (&#8220; Red Hawk &#8221;), which acreage is located in the Wattenberg and Wattenberg Extension areas of the D-J Basin, which we refer to as our &#8220; D-J Basin Asset .&#8221; As of December 31, 2015, we hold interests in 53 gross (15.6 net) wells in our D-J Basin Asset, of which 14 gross (12.5 net) wells are operated by Red Hawk and are currently producing, 17 gross (3.1 net) wells are non-operated, and 22 wells have an after-payout interest. The Company currently produces approximately 357 gross (287 net) barrels of oil equivalent per day (&#8220; Boepd &#8221;) from our D-J Basin Asset. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

In February 2015, the Company sold to MIE Jurassic Energy Corp. (&#8220; MIEJ &#8221;), its then 80% partner in Condor Energy Technology LLC (&#8220; Condor &#8221;), the Company's (i) 20% interest in Condor, and (ii) approximately 972 net acres and interests in three wells located in the Company&#8217;s legacy, non-core Niobrara acreage located in Weld County, Colorado, that were directly held by the Company in Condor-operated wells. The assets sold included working interests in five Condor-operated wells that produced approximately 26 barrels of oil per day, net to the Company's interest, as of February 2015, as well as approximately 2,300 net acres to the Company's interest in non-core Niobrara areas. The Company and MIEJ also agreed to aggregate and restructure all liabilities owed by the Company to MIEJ and Condor, reducing our debt outstanding with MIEJ and Condor from approximately $9.4 million to $4.925 million, revising and extending the terms of the outstanding debt due to MIEJ, and reducing our senior debt by $500,000 through MIEJ&#8217;s direct repayment of principal due to our senior lenders. See greater details regarding this transaction below in &#8220; Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Liquidity and Capital Resources &#8211; Amendment to PEDCO-MIEJ Note and Condor-MIEJ Note .&#8221; 

Also in February 2015, we expanded our D-J Basin position through the acquisition of additional acreage from Golden Globe Energy (US), LLC (&#8220; GGE &#8221;), which acquisition we refer to as the GGE Acquisition, which included approximately 12,977 additional net acres in the D-J Basin located almost entirely within Weld County, Colorado, including acreage located in the prolific Wattenberg core area, and interests in 53 gross wells with an estimated then-current net daily production of approximately 500 Boepd as of February 7, 2015. The majority of these assets were originally conveyed to GGE&#8217;s predecessor-in-interest, RJ Resources Corp., by us in March 2014 in connection with our acquisition of substantially all of the acreage, well interests and operations of Continental Resources, Inc. located in the D-J Basin (the &#8220; Continental Acquisition &#8221;), and are now included in our D-J Basin Asset. As partial consideration paid by the Company to GGE in the GGE Acquisition, the Company provided GGE with a one-year option to acquire all of the Company&#8217;s interests in Caspian Energy Inc., an Ontario, Canada company listed on the NEX board of the TSX Venture Exchange that holds exploration and production assets in Kazakhstan (&#8220; Caspian Energy &#8221;), comprised of 23,182,880 shares of common stock of Caspian Energy, for an option exercise price of $100,000. The option provided to GGE was not exercised and has expired. 

In May 2015, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (as amended to date, the &#8220; Reorganization Agreement &#8221;) with PEDEVCO Acquisition Subsidiary, Inc., a newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (&#8220; Exchange Sub &#8221;), Dome Energy AB (&#8220; Dome AB &#8221;), and Dome Energy, Inc. a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dome AB (&#8220; Dome US &#8221;, and collectively with Dome AB, &#8220; Dome Energy &#8221;), which contemplated the Company&#8217;s acquisition of all of Dome Energy&#8217;s U.S. oil and gas assets in exchange for capital stock of the Company. On December 29, 2015, the Company and Dome Energy mutually agreed to terminate the Reorganization Agreement due to the continued downturn in oil prices and the challenging market environment. The Company has no further obligations or termination liabilities due or owing to Dome Energy as a result of the mutual termination. 

Immediately following the termination of the Reorganization Agreement, on December 29, 2015, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (as amended to date, the &#8220; GOM Merger Agreement &#8221;) with White Hawk Energy, LLC (&#8220; White Hawk &#8221;) and GOM Holdings, LLC (&#8220; GOM &#8221;), a Delaware limited liability company. The GOM Merger Agreement provides for the Company&#8217;s acquisition of GOM through an exchange of certain of the shares of the Company&#8217;s common and preferred stock (the &#8220; Consideration Shares &#8221;), as described in greater detail in the Notes, for 100% of the limited liability company membership units of GOM (the &#8220; GOM Units &#8221;), with the GOM Units being received by White Hawk and GOM receiving the Consideration Shares, as described in greater detail in the Notes from the Company (the &#8220; GOM Merger &#8221;). On February 29, 2016, the parties entered into an amendment to the GOM Merger Agreement, which amended the merger agreement in order to provide GOM additional time to meet certain closing conditions contemplated by the GOM Merger Agreement. The parties entered into the Amendment to extend the deadline for closing the merger and the date after which either party could terminate the GOM Merger Agreement if the merger had not yet been consummated, from February 29, 2016 to no later than April 15, 2016. 

We have listed below the total production volumes and total revenue, net to the Company, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 attributable to our D-J Basin Asset, including the calculated production volumes and revenues for our D-J Basin Asset held indirectly through Condor that would be net to our interest if reported on a consolidated basis.

Business Strategy 

&#160; 

We believe that the D-J Basin shale play represents among the most promising unconventional oil and natural gas plays in the U.S. We plan to opportunistically seek additional acreage proximate to our currently held core acreage located in the Wattenberg and Wattenberg Extension areas of Weld County, Colorado. Our strategy is to be the operator, directly or through our subsidiaries and joint ventures, in the majority of our acreage so we can dictate the pace of development in order to execute our business plan. The majority of our capital expenditure budget for the next 12 calendar months will be focused on the development of our D-J Basin Asset. We plan to deploy approximately $35.6 million in capital expenditures in order to drill and complete, participate in the drilling and completion of, and/or acquire approximately 8.5 net wells in our D-J Basin Asset for the period from January 2016 to December 2016. We plan to fund our operations and business plan by utilizing projected cash flow from operations, the approximately $13.5 million gross ($11.0 million net, after origination-related fees and expenses, as further described in Part II, Item 7, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.&#8221;) available under our current senior debt facility, a $25 million debt facility we are seeking to close in April or May 2016, our cash on hand and proceeds from future potential debt and/or equity financings, which may include drilling partnerships. The availability of additional borrowings under the senior debt facility is subject to the Company providing matching funds for all amounts borrowed, which additional borrowed funds may only be used to fund development costs. 

During 2015, the Company has focused on growth opportunities, while addressing the expected liquidity requirements arising from a significant decrease in oil and gas prices. The Company had the following significant events: 

&#160;

&#160; &#9679; Acquired oil and gas assets from GGE, which increased the value of our assets by approximately $45,000,000, and our debt obligations by approximately $9,000,000, essentially doubling our proved reserves and net acreage held. In connection with the acquisition, we issued 3,375,000 shares of restricted common stock and 66,625 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, which are convertible on a 1,000:1 basis into common stock subject to a 9.9% ownership limitation. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Sold our ownership in Condor and working interests in the related oil and gas assets to MIEJ, recognizing a gain of approximately $275,000 and a net reduction in debt of approximately $2,000,000. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Entered into an agreement to merge with GOM, which, if consummated, is expected to result in significant additional proved reserves production, and provide greater resources to raise capital. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Restructured various debt obligations, to subordinate and defer until note maturity, approximately $4.5 million of principal and interest payments until April 2016, reducing current total cash pay requirements under the notes by approximately $500,000 to zero per month. In connection with the deferral, we issued 3 year warrants to purchase 1.55 million shares of common stock at exercise prices ranging from $0.75 to $1.50 per share. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Implemented general and administrative cost savings strategies (excluding non-cash items) which resulted in reducing annual G&#38;A costs approximately $1,000,000 due to reduced legal fees and lower professional fees. 

&#160;

Management is continually reviewing the recoverability of its oil and gas assets given the reduction of crude oil and natural gas prices during the year. Over the course of the year, we have identified acreage that we believe has a low probability of development in the near future and have not renewed such leases where appropriate and impaired the values as necessary. We believe that a significant portion of the effects of lower crude oil prices are now being offset by the continuing reduction of drilling and completion, collection, selling and LOE costs. We believe the leases we currently plan to develop in our 2016 development plan continue to be economic due to our estimates of total recoverable reserves, expected production rates and the continued reduction in development and operational costs through this year. The recoverability of our oil and gas assets is dependent on our ability to secure sufficient funds to develop our properties. If we are unable to have access to our credit facilities or alternative financing transactions, and crude oil prices stay at their current prices or go lower or if the new development and operational costs do not hold or such costs return to higher levels, Company management may deem it appropriate in the future to impair certain of our oil and gas properties in the event we determine we will not be able to fully develop our drilling program.

&#160; 

&#160;

Competition 

&#160; 

The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive. We compete and will continue to compete with major and independent oil and natural gas companies for exploration opportunities, acreage and property acquisitions. We also compete for drilling rig contracts and other equipment and labor required to drill, operate and develop our properties. Most of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources, staffs, facilities and other resources than we have. In addition, larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of any changes in federal, state and local laws and regulations more easily than we can, which would adversely affect our competitive position. These competitors may be able to pay more for drilling rigs or exploratory prospects and productive oil and natural gas properties and may be able to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than we can. Our competitors may also be able to afford to purchase and operate their own drilling rigs. 

&#160; 

Our ability to drill and explore for oil and natural gas and to acquire properties will depend upon our ability to conduct operations, to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in this highly competitive environment. Many of our competitors have a longer history of operations than we have, and most of them have also demonstrated the ability to operate through industry cycles. 

&#160; 

Competitive Strengths 

&#160; 

We believe we are well positioned to successfully execute our business strategies and achieve our business objectives because of the following competitive strengths: 

&#160; 

Management . We have assembled a management team at our Company with extensive experience in the fields of international and domestic business development, petroleum engineering, geology, petroleum field development and production, petroleum operations and finance. Several members of the team developed and ran what we believe were successful energy ventures that were commercialized at Texaco, Erin Energy Inc. (formerly CAMAC Energy Inc.), and Rosetta Resources. We believe that our management team is highly qualified to identify, acquire and exploit energy resources in the U.S. and abroad. 

&#160; 

Our management team is headed by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Frank C. Ingriselli, an international oil and gas industry veteran with over 37 years of experience in the energy industry, including as the President of Texaco International Operations Inc., President and Chief Executive Officer of Timan Pechora Company, President of Texaco Technology Ventures, and President, Chief Executive Officer and founder of Erin Energy Inc. (formerly CAMAC Energy Inc.). Our management team also includes President and Chief Financial Officer, Michael L. Peterson, who brings extensive experience in the energy, corporate finance and securities sectors, including as a Vice President of Goldman Sachs &#38; Co., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Nevo Energy, Inc. (formerly Solargen Energy, Inc.), and a former director of Aemetis, Inc. (formerly AE Biofuels Inc.). In addition, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel, Clark R. Moore, has 10 years of energy industry experience, and formerly served as acting general counsel of Erin Energy Inc. (formerly CAMAC Energy Inc.). 

Key Advisors . Our key advisors include South Texas Reservoir Alliance, LLC, which we refer to as STXRA, and other industry veterans. According to STXRA, the STXRA team has experience in drilling and completing horizontal wells, including over 100 horizontal wells with lengths exceeding 4,000 feet from 2010 to 2015, as well as experience in both slick water and hybrid multi-stage hydraulic fracturing technologies and in the operation of shale wells and fields. We believe that our relationship with STXRA, both directly and through our jointly-owned services company, Pacific Energy Technology Services, LLC, will supplement the core competencies of our management team and provide us with petroleum and reservoir engineering, petrophysical, and operational competencies that will help us to evaluate, acquire, develop, and operate petroleum resources into the future. 

&#160; 

Significant acreage positions and drilling potential . We have accumulated interests in a total of approximately 16,158 net acres in our core D-J Basin Asset operating area, which we believe represents a significant unconventional resource play. The majority of our interests are in or near areas of considerable activity by both major and independent operators, although such activity may not be indicative of our future operations. Based on our current acreage position, we conservatively estimate there could be up to 202 potential gross drilling locations in our D-J Basin Asset acreage, on which we anticipate drilling and completing, and participating in the drilling and completion of, and/or acquiring approximately 16 additional total wells (equivalent to approximately 8.5 net wells to us) in our D-J Basin Asset through the end of 2016, leaving us a substantial drilling inventory for future years. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Marketing 

&#160; 

The prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production fluctuate widely. The recent collapse in oil prices is among the most severe on record. The daily NYMEX WTI oil spot price went from a high of $107.62 per Bbl in 2014 to low of $34.73 per Bbl in 2015. The drop in crude oil pricing is due in large part to increased production levels, crude oil inventories and recessed global economic growth. Oil prices are also impacted by real or perceived geopolitical risks in oil producing regions, the relative strength of the U.S. dollar, weather and the global economy. Gas prices have been under downward pressure during 2015 due to excess supply leading to higher levels of gas in storage when compared to the 5-year average. We expect that depressed oil prices will lead to cuts in the exploration and production budgets to reduce incremental oil supply, which should ultimately restore equilibrium to the world oil market and rebalance oil prices. Decreases in these commodity prices adversely affect the carrying value of our proved reserves and our revenues, profitability and cash flows. Short-term disruptions of our oil and natural gas production occur from time to time due to downstream pipeline system failure, capacity issues and scheduled maintenance, as well as maintenance and repairs involving our own well operations. These situations can curtail our production capabilities and ability to maintain a steady source of revenue for our company. In addition, demand for natural gas has historically been seasonal in nature, with peak demand and typically higher prices during the colder winter months. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; below. 

&#160; 

Oil . Our crude oil is generally sold under short-term, extendable and cancellable agreements with unaffiliated purchasers. As a consequence, the prices we receive for crude oil move up and down in direct correlation with the oil market as it reacts to supply and demand factors. Transportation costs related to moving crude oil are also deducted from the price received for crude oil. 

&#160; 

We are a party to a 12-month crude oil purchase contract with a third party buyer, pursuant to which the buyer purchases the crude oil produced from our 14 operated wells in our D-J Basin Asset, at a price per barrel equal to the average of the New York Mercantile Exchange&#8217;s (NYMEX) daily settle quoted price for Cushing/WTI for trade days only during a calendar month, applicable to product delivered during any such calendar month, less a per barrel differential of $4.75. The crude oil is purchased at the wellhead, and we do not bear any incremental transportation costs. 

&#160; 

Natural Gas . Our natural gas is sold under both long-term and short-term natural gas purchase agreements. Natural gas produced by us is sold at various delivery points at or near producing wells to both unaffiliated independent marketing companies and unaffiliated mid-stream companies. We receive proceeds from prices that are based on various pipeline indices less any associated fees for processing, location or transportation differentials. 

&#160; 

In connection with our Continental Acquisition in March 2014, we became a party to a Gas Purchase Contract, dated December 1, 2011, with DCP, pursuant to which we have agreed to sell, and DCP has agreed to purchase, all gas produced from six (6) of our D-J Basin Asset operated wells and surrounding lands located in Weld County, Colorado, at a purchase price equal to 83% of the net weighted average value for gas attributable to us that is received by DCP at its facilities sold during the month, less a $0.06/gallon local fractionation fee, for a period of ten years, terminating December 1, 2021. 

In connection with our Continental Acquisition in March 2014, we also became a party to a Gas Purchase Agreement, dated April 1, 2012, as amended, with Sterling Energy Investments LLC, which we refer to as Sterling, pursuant to which we have agreed to sell, and Sterling has agreed to purchase, all gas produced from eight (8) of our D-J Basin Asset wells and surrounding lands located in Weld County, Colorado, at a purchase price equal to 85% of the revenue received by Sterling from the sale of gas after processing at Sterling&#8217;s plant that is attributable to us during the month, less a $0.50/Mcf gathering fee, subject to escalation, for a period of twenty years, terminating April 1, 2032. 

&#160; 

We endeavor to ensure that title to our properties is in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and natural gas industry. Some of our acreage may be obtained through farmout agreements, term assignments and other contractual arrangements with third parties, the terms of which often will require the drilling of wells or the undertaking of other exploratory or development activities in order to retain our interests in the acreage. Our title to these contractual interests will be contingent upon our satisfactory fulfillment of these obligations. Our properties are also subject to customary royalty interests, liens incident to financing arrangements, operating agreements, taxes and other burdens that we believe will not materially interfere with the use and operation of or affect the value of these properties. We intend to maintain our leasehold interests by making lease rental payments or by producing wells in paying quantities prior to expiration of various time periods to avoid lease termination. 

&#160; &#160; 

Oil and Gas Properties 

&#160; 

&#160; We believe that the Wattenberg and Niobrara Shale plays represent among the most promising unconventional oil and natural gas plays in the U.S. We plan to continue to opportunistically seek additional acreage proximate to our currently held core acreage. Our strategy is to be the operator, directly or through our subsidiaries and joint ventures, in the majority of our acreage so we can dictate the pace of development in order to execute our business plan. The majority of our capital expenditure budget for the period from January 2016 to December 2016 will be focused on the development of these formations. However, if t he Company consummates its merger with GOM, the Company will work with GOM to prepare a projected drilling and completion schedule and budget, with the final schedule and budget anticipated to be disclosed by the Company if the GOM Merger is consummated and once they are available , which could impact our current 2016 drilling and completion plans. &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Unless otherwise noted, the following table presents summary data for our leasehold acreage in our core D-J Basin Asset as of December 31, 2015 and our drilling capital budget with respect to this acreage from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016. If commodity prices do not increase significantly, we may delay drilling activities. The ultimate amount of capital we will expend may fluctuate materially based on, among other things, market conditions, commodity prices, asset monetizations, the success of our drilling results as the year progresses, availability of capital and whether we consummate the GOM Merger. In the event the GOM Merger is consummated, the Company plans to expand this development plan to incorporate development of assets held by GOM, with the final schedule and budget anticipated to be disclosed by the Company once they are available.

Potential gross drilling locations are conservatively calculated using 80 acre spacing, and not taking into account additional wells that could be drilled as a result of forced pooling in the Niobrara. Colorado, where the D-J Basin Asset is located, which allows for forced pooling, and which may create more potential gross drilling locations than acre spacing alone would otherwise indicate.

Costs per well are gross costs while capital costs presented are net to the Company&#8217;s working interests. 

&#160; 

D-J Basin Asset 

We directly hold all of our interests in the D-J Basin Asset through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Red Hawk. These interests are located in Weld County, Colorado. Red Hawk is currently the operator of 14 gross (12.5 net) wells located in our D-J Basin Asset. Our D-J Basin Asset acreage is shown in the map below.

Non-Core Assets 

&#160; 

We own 23,182,880 shares of common stock of Caspian Energy, a Canadian publicly-traded company, representing approximately 5% of its common stock. Caspian Energy holds a 100% working interest in production and exploration licenses covering an approximate 380,000 acre oil and gas producing asset located in the Pre-Caspian Basin in Kazakhstan. As partial consideration paid by the Company to GGE in the GGE Acquisition, the Company provided GGE with a one-year option to acquire all of the Company&#8217;s interests in Caspian Energy for an option exercise price of $100,000. The option provided to GGE was not exercised and has expired, resulting in the retention of the 5% ownership described above.

Strategic Alliances 

&#160; 

Golden Globe 

On March 7, 2014, in connection with the Continental Acquisition, we entered into a $50 million 3-year term debt facility (the &#8220; Senior Notes &#8221;) with various investors including RJ Credit LLC, a subsidiary of a New York-based investment management group with more than $1 billion in assets under management specializing in resource investments. As part of the transaction, GGE (formerly Golden Globe Energy Corp.) (an affiliate of RJ Credit LLC) acquired an equal 13,995 net acre position in the assets we acquired from Continental (the &#8220; GGE Assets &#8221;), thereby making GGE an equal working interest partner with us in the development of these newly acquired assets, and allowing us to undertake a more aggressive drilling and development program. On February 23, 2015, we completed the acquisition of the GGE Assets from GGE in the GGE Acquisition, thereby reunifying the assets we originally acquired in the Continental Acquisition, and we assumed approximately $8.35 million of junior subordinated debt from GGE that GGE incurred to develop the GGE Assets subsequent to GGE&#8217;s acquisition of them from us in March 2014 and owed to RJ Credit LLC. GGE also currently holds approximately 9.9% of our issued and outstanding common stock, all of our issued and outstanding Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (which is convertible into 66.6 million shares of our common stock, subject to certain restrictions), and has the right to appoint two (2) designees to our Board of Directors, one of which must be an independent director as defined by applicable rules, and one of which directors, David Steinberg, was appointed to the Board of Directors in July 2015, as one GGE&#8217;s designees. 

STXRA 

&#160; 

On October 4, 2012, we established a technical services subsidiary, Pacific Energy Technology Services, LLC, which is 70% owned by us and 30% owned by South Texas Reservoir Alliance, LLC, which we refer to as STXRA, through which we plan to provide acquisition, engineering, and oil drilling and completion technology services in joint cooperation with STXRA in the United States. Pacific Energy Technology Services, LLC currently has no operations, only nominal assets and liabilities and limited capitalization. 

&#160; 

STXRA is a consulting firm specializing in the delivery of petroleum resource acquisition services and practical engineering solutions to clients engaged in the acquisition, exploration and development of petroleum resources. In April 2011, we entered into an agreement of joint cooperation with STXRA in an effort to identify suitable energy ventures for acquisition by us, with a focus on plays in shale oil and natural gas bearing regions in the United States. According to information provided by STXRA, the STXRA team has experience in their collective careers of drilling and completing horizontal wells, including over 100 horizontal wells with lengths exceeding 4,000 feet from 2010 to 2015, as well as experience in both slick water and hybrid multi-stage hydraulic fracturing technologies and in the operation of shale wells and fields. We believe that our relationship with STXRA, both directly and through our jointly-owned Pacific Energy Technology Services LLC services company, will supplement the core competencies of our management team and provide us with petroleum and reservoir engineering, petrophysical, and operational competencies that will help us to evaluate, acquire, develop and operate petroleum resources in the future. 

Our Core Areas 

&#160; 

The majority of our capital expenditure budget for the period from January 2016 to December 2016 will be focused on the development of our core oil and natural gas properties located in the D-J Basin Asset. For additional information, see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.&#8221; 

&#160; 

D-J Basin Asset 

As a result of the GGE Acquisition and the divestiture of legacy non-core Niobrara assets to MIEJ, as of December 31, 2015 we held 16,158 net acres in oil and natural gas properties related to our D-J Basin Asset. We currently own direct interests in 53 gross (15.6 net) wells in our D-J Basin Asset, of which 14 gross (12.5 net) wells are operated by Red Hawk and currently producing, 17 gross (3.1net) wells are non-operated and 22 wells have an after-payout interest. 

&#160; 

We plan to deploy approximately $35.6 million in capital expenditures in order to drill and complete, participate in the drilling and completion of, and/or acquire approximately 8.5 net wells in our D-J Basin Asset for the period from January 2016 to December 2016. We plan to utilize the approximately $23.9 million new drilling facility with the $13.5 million drilling facility provided by GGE, a $25 million debt facility we are seeking to close in April or May 2016, cash on hand, proceeds from future equity offerings, internally generated cash flow, and future debt financings to develop this asset. 

Based on publicly available information and information we have received from our oilfield service vendors, average drilling and completion costs for wells in our core area have significantly dropped during 2015 from between $4.3 million and $8.3 million per well in late 2014 and early 2015 to between $2.5 million and $5.0 million per well currently, with these wells having average estimated ultimate recoveries, or EURs, of 300,000 to 850,000 Boe per well and initial 30-day average production of 450 to 850 Boe per day per well in our areas of expected 2016 drilling development. The costs incurred, EURs and initial production rates achieved by others may not be indicative of the well costs we will incur or the results we will achieve from our wells. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Our Non-Core Areas 

As described above, we hold an approximate 5% interest in Caspian Energy, which holds a 100% working interest in production and exploration licenses covering an approximate 380,000 acre oil and gas producing asset located in the Pre-Caspian Basin in Kazakhstan. In connection with our GGE Acquisition, we provided GGE a one-year option to acquire our interest in Caspian Energy for $100,000, described in greater detail below under &#8220;Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence&#8211; Golden Globe Energy (US), LLC.&#8221; The option provided to GGE was not exercised and has expired, resulting in the Company retaining its ownership of the 5% interest in Caspian Energy.

Recent Developments 

Debt Restructuring 

On April 24, 2015, certain of our investors under our senior secured promissory notes issued to Senior Health Insurance Company of Pennsylvania (as successor-in-interest to BRe BCLIC Primary), BRe BCLIC Sub, BRe WINIC 2013 LTC Primary, BRe WNIC 2013 LTC Sub, HEARTLAND Bank, and RJ Credit LLC (&#8220; RJC &#8221;) (the &#8220; PEDEVCO Senior Loan Investors &#8221;), and BAM Administrative Services LLC, as agent for the investors, and any related collateral documents (collectively, the &#8220; PEDEVCO Senior Loan &#8221;), agreed to defer certain mandatory principal repayments and interest payments that would otherwise be payable by us to them in the months of May and June 2015, with such deferred amounts to be used by us solely to renew, extend, re-lease or otherwise acquire leases which will then become additional collateral under the PEDEVCO Senior Loan. The aggregate principal and interest that was deferred was approximately $524,000, which amount has been capitalized and added to the principal due under the PEDEVCO Senior Loan as of July 31, 2015 and is due upon maturity. The Company was also charged a one-time deferral fee of $354,000 which was added to the principal and due upon maturity. As consideration for the deferral, on September 10, 2015, we granted warrants exercisable for an aggregate of 349,111 shares of our common stock to the Senior Loan Investors with a fair value of approximately $40,000. Each warrant has a 3 year term and is exercisable on a cashless basis at an exercise price of $1.50 per share. 

&#160; 

Subject to amendment on January 29, 2016 and March 7, 2016, on August 28, 2015, the Company initially entered into agreements with the holders of the Senior Notes to (i) defer until the maturity date of the Senior Notes the mandatory principal payments that would otherwise be due and payable by the Company on payment dates occurring during the six month period of August 1, 2015 through January 31, 2016, (ii) HEARTLAND Bank agreed to change the frequency of payment of accrued interest and mandatory principal repayments from monthly to semi-annually, with the next interest payment due February 1, 2016 and the next mandatory principal repayment due August 3, 2016, and with the Company agreeing to place an amount equal to 1/6th of the semi-annual principal and interest payments due into a sinking fund which the Company shall pay to HEARTLAND Bank every six months when due and owing, (iii) RJC agreed to defer all interest payments otherwise due and payable by the Company to RJC during the period commencing on August 1, 2015 through January 31, 2016 (the &#8220;Waiver Period&#8221;), which deferred interest is added to principal each month during the Waiver Period, (iv) certain other owners agreed to (a) defer until the maturity date of their Senior Notes 12/17ths of the interest payments that would otherwise be due and payable by the Company to them on payment dates occurring during the six month period of August 1, 2015 through January 31, 2016; and (b) have the Company pay in cash 5/17ths of such interest payments per month, with all deferred interest being added to principal each month until the maturity date of the Senior Notes, and (v) SHIP, BRe BCLIC Sub, BRe WINIC 2013 LTC Primary, BRe WNIC 2013 LTC Sub and RJC increased the interest rate under their Senior Notes from 15% to 17% per annum on all outstanding principal under the Senior Notes during the Waiver Period. These deferrals agreed upon with Investors (the &#8220; August-January Deferrals &#8221;) reduced the Company&#8217;s monthly cash interest payments and mandatory principal repayments from approximately $600,000 per month prior to these agreements, to approximately $100,000 per month during the Waiver Period after giving effect to the changes agreed upon under these agreements, thereby providing the Company with an estimated $500,000 per month in reduced cash flow requirements during the Waiver Period. 

&#160; 

The purpose of these deferrals was to provide the Company with temporary relief from cash requirements to fully-focus and execute upon the contemplated merger with Dome, or another alternative transaction in the event the Company did not consummate the transaction with Dome. 

As additional consideration for these agreements and related note amendments and deferrals, on September 10, 2015, the Company issued warrants exercisable on a cash-only basis for an aggregate of 1,201,004 shares of common stock to certain of the deferring Investors, proportionately based on their individual principal with a fair value of approximately $120,000. The warrants have a three year term and are exercisable on a cash-only basis at a price of $0.75 per share. In addition, in the event the aggregate total of principal and interest deferred exceeds $900,000 over the Waiver Period, within thirty days of February 1, 2016, and subject to NYSE MKT additional listing approval, the Company agreed to proportionately grant additional warrants such that the total aggregate number of shares of Company common stock exercisable under all warrants granted shall equal (x) the total principal and interest deferred by such Investors divided by (y) $0.75, provided that such obligations have been extended as discussed below. The Company estimates that up to an aggregate of approximately $4.5 million in total interest and principal payments may be deferred pursuant to these agreements through March 2016, in which event warrants exercisable solely on a cash basis for approximately an additional 4.8 million shares of Company common stock at an exercise price of $0.75 per share will be granted pro rata to the Investors (other than to HEARTLAND Bank) in May 2016. Through March 1, 2016, $4,051,000 of interest has been deferred. As of December 31, 2015, the amount of deferred interest and deferred principal was $2,527,000 and $519,000, respectively. The number of warrant shares to be issued as of December 31, 2015 is approximately 3.1 million. As the warrant value is minimal as of this date, no liability was accrued on the books. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

In addition, the Company agreed to prepare and deliver to RJC a monthly budget in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to RJC, and such financial statements as RJC may reasonably request. The monthly budget is required to include a cash flow forecast and detail of all anticipated non-recurring expenses and non-cash budget items, and the Company is required to comply with the budgeted expenses set forth therein in all material respects, provided, however, that a variance of less than 10% with respect to the expenses, on an aggregate basis, is permitted. 

On January 29, 2016, we entered into a Letter Agreement (the &#8220; Letter Agreement &#8221;) with the Investors and the Agent. The Letter Agreement extends by one (1) month, through February 29, 2016, the deferral of the payment of interest and principal due under the Notes (the &#8220; Deferral Extension &#8221;). The purpose of the Deferral Extension is to provide the Company with the financial resources and runaway it believes it needs to fully-focus upon and consummate the merger with GOM. Specifically, pursuant to the Letter Agreement, (i) all Investors agreed to further defer until the maturity date of their Notes the mandatory principal payments that would otherwise be due and payable by the Company to them on payment dates occurring through February 29, 2016, (ii) HEARTLAND Bank agreed to change the next scheduled semi-annual interest payment due from February 1, 2016 to March 1, 2016 (with interest due and payable thereafter on a semi-annual basis) and to change the next mandatory principal repayment due date to September 3, 2016, and the Company agreed to place an amount equal to 1/6th of the semi-annual principal and interest payments due into a sinking fund which the Company shall pay to HEARTLAND Bank every six months when due and owing, and (iii) Senior Health Insurance Company of Pennsylvania (&#8220; SHIP &#8221;) (as successor-in-interest to BRe BCLIC Primary), BRe BCLIC Sub, BRe WINIC 2013 LTC Primary, BRe WNIC 2013 LTC Sub, and RJC agreed to (a) defer until the maturity date of their Notes and the junior note held by RJC (the &#8220; RJC Junior Note &#8221;) all of the interest payments that would otherwise be due and payable by the Company to them in February 2016; (b) return the interest rate under each of their Notes to 15% per annum, and the interest rate under the RJC Junior Note to 12% cash pay per annum, effective January 31, 2016; and (c) delay the issuance of any &#8220;Subsequent Warrants&#8221; issuable pursuant thereto to within 30 days of March 1, 2016, subject to NYSE MKT additional listing approval. 

In addition, on the Monday of each week commencing on February 1, 2016 and thereafter, the Company agreed to deliver to the Agent: (a) an accounts receivable and accounts payable listing as of the close of business of the preceding week; (b) collection reports for the preceding week; (c) a compliance report with respect to the Budget which includes a comparison of all categories in the Budget with actual levels of expenditures and revenues generated for the preceding week together with an explanation of all variances from the Budget; and (d) a listing of all the Company&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; (collectively, the &#8220; PEDEVCO Group Companies &#8221;) checks outstanding as of the end of the preceding week. For purposes of the Letter Agreement, the term, &#8220; Budget &#8221; means the PEDEVCO Group Companies&#8217; budget for the ten (10) week period covered thereby in a form and substance satisfactory to the Agent, as such Budget may be modified, from time to time so long as such modifications have been agreed to by the Company and the Investors in their reasonable discretion. Furthermore, the Company agreed that at no time shall the PEDEVCO Group Companies&#8217; disbursements exceed by more than 5% those amounts set forth in the Budget, and the Company agreed further to provide to the Agent a copy of (i) any selling memoranda (and any other similar marketing materials) for or relating to the sale of all or any equity or asset of any PEDEVCO Group Company (such sale, a &#8220; PEDEVCO Sale &#8221;), (ii) any loan memoranda (and any other similar marketing materials) for or relating to the borrowing of money by any PEDEVCO Group Company (such borrowing transaction, an &#8220; Additional PEDEVCO Loan &#8221;) or (iii) any executed letter of intent, purchase agreement, merger agreement or similar agreement relating to any PEDEVCO Sale or Additional PEDEVCO Loan, in each case within two (2) business days after (x) in the case of preceding clause (i) or (ii), the final preparation thereof or (y) in the case of preceding clause (iii), execution thereof by the parties thereto. 

On March 7, 2016, the Company entered into a Letter Agreement, dated March 1, 2016 (the &#8220;March Letter Agreement&#8221;), with SHIP, BRe BCLIC Sub, BRe WINIC 2013 LTC Primary, BRe WNIC 2013 LTC Sub, and RJC (collectively, the &#8220; Original Lenders&#8221;), and the Agent, which extends the Deferral Extension by one (1) month, through March 31, 2016. Pursuant to the March Letter Agreement, the Original Lenders agreed to (i) further defer until the maturity date of their Senior Notes the mandatory principal payments that would otherwise be due and payable by the Company to them on payment dates occurring through March 31, 2016, (ii) defer until the maturity date of their Senior Notes and the RJC Junior Note all of the interest payments that would otherwise be due and payable by the Company to them in March 2016, with all interest amounts deferred being added to principal on the first business day of the month following the month in which such deferred interest is accrued; and (iii) delay the issuance of any &#8220;Subsequent Warrants&#8221; issuable pursuant thereto to within 30 days of April 1, 2016, subject to NYSE MKT additional listing approval. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

The Company estimates that up to an aggregate of approximately $4.5 million in total interest and principal payments may be deferred pursuant to these agreements through March 2016, in which event warrants exercisable solely on a cash basis for approximately an additional 4.8 million shares of Company common stock at an exercise price of $0.75 per share will be granted pro rata to the Investors (other than to HEARTLAND Bank) in May 2016. 

Wellbore Assignments to Dome Energy 

On November 19, 2015, the Company entered into a Letter Agreement with Dome Energy pursuant to which Dome Energy agreed to fully fund the Company&#8217;s proportionate share of all working interest owner expenses with respect to eight (8) horizontal wells recently drilled and completed by a third party operator in the Wattenberg Area of Weld County, Colorado (the &#8220; Wattenberg Wells &#8221;). The Company assigned its interests in these Wattenberg Wells to Dome Energy effective November 19, 2015, which wells Dome Energy is now required to fully fund. This transaction was done in contemplation of the Company&#8217;s planned combination with Dome Energy (the &#8220; Reorganization &#8221;) pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Reorganization entered into by and among PEDEVCO Corp., PEDEVCO Acquisition Subsidiary, Inc., Dome AB and Dome US on May 21, 2015, as amended to date (the &#8220; Reorganization Agreement &#8221;). Upon the closing of which these Wattenberg Wells would have become assets of the combined post-Reorganization company. 

&#160; 

In connection with the assignment of these well interests to Dome Energy, Dome Energy has issued a contingent promissory note to the Company, dated November 19, 2015 (the &#8220; Dome Promissory Note &#8221;), with a principal amount of $250,000, which note is now due and payable by Dome AB to the Company as a result of the December 29, 2015 termination of the Reorganization Agreement. To guarantee prompt payment of the Dome Promissory Note, Dome AB deposited $250,000 into an escrow account. 

&#160; 

Termination of Dome Merger 

On December 29, 2015, the Company and Dome Energy terminated their pending merger due to the continued downturn in oil prices and the challenging market environment. The Company has no further obligations or termination liabilities due or owing to Dome Energy under the Reorganization Agreement as a result of the mutual termination of the transactions contemplated thereunder. 

Entry into Merger Agreement with GOM Holdings, LLC 

Immediately following the termination by the Company and Dome Energy of the Plan of Reorganization and the transactions contemplated thereby, on December 29, 2015, the Company entered into the GOM Merger Agreement with White Hawk Energy, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (&#8220; Merger Sub &#8221;), and GOM. The GOM Merger Agreement provides for the Company&#8217;s acquisition of GOM through an exchange of certain of the shares of the Company&#8217;s common and preferred stock (the &#8220; Consideration Shares &#8221;), as described in greater detail below, for 100% of the limited liability company membership units of GOM (the &#8220; GOM Units &#8221;), with the GOM Units being received by Merger Sub and GOM receiving the Consideration Shares, as described in greater detail below from the Company (the &#8220; Merger &#8221;). 

The Company and GOM are currently targeting a closing date (&#8220; Closing &#8221;) no later than April 15, 2016, subject to various closing conditions as described below and as set forth in greater detail in the GOM Merger Agreement. At the Closing of the Merger, (i) GOM will transfer the GOM Units to Merger Sub, solely in exchange for the Consideration Shares, and (ii) Merger Sub will continue as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and will continue to carry on the business of GOM. In exchange for the transfer of GOM Units to Merger Sub, the Company will issue to the members of GOM, the Consideration Shares as follows: (x) an aggregate of 1,551,552 shares of the Company&#8217;s restricted common stock (the &#8220; Common Stock &#8221;) and 698,448 restricted shares of the Company&#8217;s to-be-designated Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (the &#8220; Series B Preferred &#8221; (described in greater detail below)), and (y) will assume approximately $125 million of subordinated debt from GOM&#8217;s existing lenders and a $30 million undrawn letter of credit backing certain offshore asset retirement obligations (the &#8220; GOM Debt &#8221;), which GOM Debt is anticipated to be restructured on terms and conditions mutually acceptable to the Company and GOM prior to the Closing of the Merger. 

At or prior to Closing, we will file and cause to be effective a new Certificate of Designations of PEDEVCO Corp. Establishing the Designations, Preferences, Limitations, and Relative Rights of its Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (the &#8220; Certificate of Designation &#8221;), which will create 698,448 shares of newly-designated Series B Preferred, all of which will be issued to the members of GOM at Closing pro rata with their ownership of GOM. The Series B Preferred will (i) have a liquidation preference senior to all of the Company&#8217;s common stock and Series A Convertible Preferred Stock equal to $250 per share (the &#8220; Liquidation Preference &#8221;), (ii) accrue an annual dividend equal to 10% of the Liquidation Preference, payable annually from the date of issuance (the &#8220; Dividend &#8221;), (iii) vote together with the common stock on all shareholder matters, with each share having one (1) vote, and (iv) not be convertible into common stock of the Company until both the Shareholder Approval and NYSE MKT Approval are received (each as defined below). Upon the Company&#8217;s receipt of the Shareholder Approval and NYSE MKT Approval, (x) the Series B Preferred will automatically cease accruing Dividends and all accrued and unpaid Dividends will be automatically forfeited and forgiven in their entirety, (y) the Liquidation Preference of the Series B Preferred will be reduced to $0.001 per share from $250 per share, and (z) each share of Series B Preferred will be convertible into common stock on a 1,000:1 basis (the &#8220; Series B Conversion &#8221;), either (A) automatically upon the determination of the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors in its sole discretion (&#8220; Company Conversion &#8221;), or (B) at the option of the holder at any time (&#8220; Holder Conversion &#8221;), provided that no Holder Conversion is allowed to the extent the holder thereof would beneficially own more than 9.9% of the Company&#8217;s Common Stock or voting stock. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

The Board of Directors of the Company and the Board of Managers of GOM have adopted and declared advisable the GOM Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the GOM Merger Agreement, including the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the GOM Merger Agreement; and the Board of Directors has determined that the GOM Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the GOM Merger Agreement are fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders.

The approval of the shareholders of the Company is not required under applicable law for the closing of the Merger, nor is it a required condition to closing the Merger, and the Company does not intend to seek shareholder approval for the closing of the Merger, only for the Shareholder Approval, after the closing of the Merger, as described above. 

The Merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including (1) approval of the agreement by the Board of Directors of the Company, the sole Manager and member of Merger Sub, the Board of Managers of GOM, and the members of GOM, (2) receipt of required regulatory approvals, (3) the absence of any law or order prohibiting the consummation of the Merger, (4) approval of the NYSE MKT for the issuance of the common stock and shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series B Preferred to the members of GOM at Closing, and (5) the effectiveness of the Certificate of Designation.

In addition, each of the Company and GOM agreed to pay all costs and expenses incurred by them in connection with the GOM Merger Agreement. 

The GOM Merger Agreement also includes customary termination provisions for both the Company and GOM. Specifically, and subject to the terms of the GOM Merger Agreement, the agreement can be terminated by either party in the event the Closing has not occurred by April 15, 2016, or if any representation or warranty of the other party contained in the GOM Merger Agreement shall not be true in all material respects, subject to a right to cure by the breaching party. 

The parties intend, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, that the Merger will qualify as a &#8220; reorganization &#8221; within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

GOM is majority owned and controlled by Platinum Partners, an affiliate of Platinum Management (NY) LLC (&#8220; PM LLC &#8221;), a New York based investment firm which is the employer of Mr. David Z. Steinberg, who serves as one of the members of the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors. PM LLC is also an advisor to the entity which owns RJ Credit LLC (&#8220; RJC &#8221;), who has loaned the Company approximately $5.9 million to date in principal in connection with the Company&#8217;s March 2014 senior note funding. In connection with the March 2014 funding the Company also has the right, from time to time, subject to the terms and conditions of the Note Purchase Agreement relating to the March 2014 senior funding, to request additional loans from RJC, of up to an additional $13.5 million in funding. 

&#160;

PM LLC is also an advisor to the entity that owns GGE, a greater than 5% stockholder of the Company, from whom the Company acquired approximately 12,977 net acres of oil and gas properties and interests in 53 gross wells located in the Denver-Julesburg Basin, Colorado in February 2015, in connection with which the Company assumed approximately $8.35 million of subordinated notes payable owed by GGE to RJC, issued to GGE 3,375,000 restricted shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock (representing approximately 9.9% of our then outstanding shares of common stock), and issued to GGE 66,625 restricted shares of the Company&#8217;s then newly-designated Amended and Restated Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the &#8220; Series A Preferred &#8221;), which can be converted into shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock on a 1,000:1 basis, subject to a 9.9% ownership blocker. GGE, as the sole holder of the Company&#8217;s Series A Preferred, has the right to appoint two designees to the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors for as long as GGE continues to hold 15,000 shares of Series A Preferred designated as &#8220;Tranche One Shares&#8221; under the Company&#8217;s Amended and Restated Certificate of Designations of PEDEVCO Corp. Establishing the Designations, Preferences, Limitations, and Relative Rights of its Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. Mr. Steinberg is one of the Series A Preferred shareholder designees to the Board of Directors in connection with such right, provided that GGE has not designated any further members of the Board of Directors at this time. 

&#160; 

Vesting Agreements 

In connection with the Company&#8217;s entry into the GOM Merger Agreement, on December 29, 2015, as amended on January 6, 2016, each of Messrs. Ingriselli, Peterson and Moore entered into Vesting Agreements with the Company (as amended, the &#8220; Vesting Agreements &#8221;), pursuant to which they each individually agreed that the future vesting of restricted common stock held by such officers from January 1, 2016 through June 1, 2016 (the &#8220; Delay Period &#8221;), including all restricted common stock that was subject to vesting on January 7, 2016 pursuant to the terms of prior vesting agreements entered into by such officers on May 21, 2015, shall be delayed until the 2nd trading day following the Company&#8217;s public announcement of the &#8220;Vesting Event,&#8221; defined as the later to occur of the receipt of (x) the Shareholder Approval and (y) the NYSE MKT Approval, upon which Vesting Event all vesting with respect to such shares shall be accelerated and all such shares shall be fully vested (the &#8220; Acceleration &#8221;). The aggregate number of shares of restricted common stock subject to the Delay Period is 1,354,000 shares, 519,000 of which are held by Mr. Ingriselli, 481,000 of which are held by Mr. Peterson, and 354,000 of which are held by Mr. Moore (collectively, the &#8220; Subject Shares &#8221;). The Acceleration will occur even if the executives are not then employees or directors of the Company on such date. Notwithstanding the above, in the event the GOM Merger Agreement is terminated or the Merger is not consummated by June 1, 2016 (unless otherwise agreed upon in writing by the parties to the GOM Merger Agreement), all the Subject Shares will vest on the 2nd trading day following the Company&#8217;s public disclosure of the termination of the Merger (in the event the GOM Merger Agreement is terminated prior to June 1, 2016), or, in the event the Merger is not terminated by, or consummated by, June 1, 2016, on June 1, 2016, and the original vesting terms for all future unvested stock will be reinstated to the terms in effect prior to the parties&#8217; entry into the Vesting Agreements. Notwithstanding the above, nothing in the Vesting Agreements amends or waives any acceleration of vesting of unvested restricted stock or options currently provided under any executive officer&#8217;s current employment agreement with the Company, which provides for acceleration upon termination of such executive&#8217;s employment under certain circumstances detailed therein. 

&#160; 

Amendment to the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan 

At the Company&#8217;s Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on October 7, 2015 (the &#8220; Annual Meeting &#8221;), the Company&#8217;s stockholders approved an amendment to the Company&#8217;s 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (the &#8220; Plan &#8221;) to increase by 3,000,000, the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the Plan to a total of 10,000,000 shares. 

Approval of Conversion Rights of Series A Preferred Stock 

At the Company&#8217;s Annual Meeting, the Company&#8217;s stockholders approved the issuance of up to 66,625,000 shares of common stock to GGE (and its assigns) upon conversion of the Company&#8217;s outstanding shares of Series A Preferred stock. As a result, (i) the Series A Preferred has ceased accruing dividends and all accrued and unpaid dividends have been automatically forfeited and forgiven; and (ii) the liquidation preference of the Series A Preferred has been reduced to $0.001 per share from $400 per share. 

Shale Oil and Natural Gas Overview 

&#160; 

The relatively recent surge of oil and natural gas production from underground shale rock formations has had a dramatic impact on the oil and natural gas market in the U.S., where the practice was first developed, and globally. Shale oil production is facilitated by the combination of a set of technologies that had been applied separately to other hydrocarbon reservoir types for many decades. In combination these technologies and techniques have enabled large volumes of oil to be produced from deposits with characteristics that would not otherwise permit oil to flow at rates sufficient to justify its exploitation. The application of horizontal drilling, hydraulic fracturing and advanced reservoir assessment tools to these reservoirs is unlocking a global resource of shale and other unconventional oil and natural gas that the International Energy Agency estimates could eventually double recoverable global oil reserves. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

In 2008, U.S. natural gas production was in a decline, and the U.S. was on its way to becoming a significant importer of liquefied natural gas (LNG). By 2009, U.S.-marketed natural gas production was 14% higher than in 2005, and in 2010 it surpassed the previous annual production record set in 1973. Since 2010 alone, the U.S. production of tight oil has increased from less than 1 million barrels per day (MMBbl/d) in 2010, to more than 3 MMBbl/d in the second half of 2013. This turnaround is mainly attributable to shale oil and natural gas output that has more than tripled since 2007. Knowledge is expanding rapidly concerning the shale oil reservoirs that are already being exploited and others that appear suitable for development with current technology. In its 2015 Annual Energy Outlook, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (&#8220; EIA &#8221;) estimated in its high resource case that domestic crude oil production would increase to nearly 17 MMBbl/d before 2040, approximately 13 MMBbl/d of which would come from tight oil production, with net U.S. oil imports declining through 2029 and remaining at approximately 4 MMBbl/d from 2030 through 2040. 

&#160; 

Oil and natural gas produced from shale is considered an unconventional resource. Commercial oil and natural gas production from unconventional sources requires special techniques in order to achieve attractive oil and natural gas flow rates. Unlike conventional oil and natural gas, which is typically generated in deeper source rock and subsequently migrates into a sandstone structure with an overlying impermeable layer forming a &#8220;trap,&#8221; shale oil and natural gas is generated from organic material contained within the shale and retained by the rock&#8217;s inherent low permeability. Permeability is a measure of the ease with which natural gas, oil or other fluids can flow through the material. The same low permeability that secures large volumes of natural gas and liquids in place within the shale strata makes it much more difficult to extract them, even with a large pressure difference between the reservoir and the surface. The location and potential of many of today&#8217;s productive shale reservoirs were known for many years, but until the development of current shale oil and natural gas techniques these deposits were considered noncommercial or inaccessible. 

&#160; 

The main challenge of shale oil and natural gas drilling is to overcome the low permeability of the shale reservoirs. A conventional vertical oil or natural gas well drilled into one of these reservoirs might achieve production, though at reduced rates and for a limited duration before the oil or natural gas volume in proximity to the wellbore is exhausted. That often renders such an approach impractical and uneconomic for exploiting shale oil and natural gas. The two main technologies associated with U.S. shale oil and natural gas production are horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, or &#8220;hydrofracking.&#8221; They are employed to overcome these constraints by greatly increasing the exposure of each well to the shale stratum and enabling oil and natural gas located farther from the well to flow through the rock and replace the nearby oil and natural gas that has been extracted to the surface. 

&#160; 

Instead of drilling a simple vertical well through the shale and then perforating the well within the zone where it is in contact with the shale, the drilling company drills a directional well vertically to within proximity of the shale and then executes a 90-degree turn in order to intersect the shale and then travel for a significant horizontal distance through it. A typical North American shale well has a horizontal extent of 1,000 feet to 5,000 feet or more. 

Once the lateral portion of the well has reached the desired extent, the other main technique of shale oil and natural gas drilling is deployed. After the well has been completed, the farthest section of the lateral is perforated, opening up holes through which fluid can flow. This portion of the reservoir is then hydrofracked by injecting fluid into the well under high pressure to fracture the exposed shale rock and open up pathways through which oil and natural gas can flow. The &#8220;fracking fluid&#8221; consists mainly of water with a variety of chemical additives intended to reduce friction and dissolve minerals, among other purposes, along with sand or sand-like material to prop open the new pathways created by hydrofracking. This process is then repeated at intervals along the well&#8217;s horizontal extent, successively perforating and hydrofracking each section in turn. This process creates a producing well that emulates the effect of a vertical well drilled into a conventional oil and natural gas reservoir by substituting multiple horizontal &#8220;pay zones&#8221; in the shale stratum for the thinner but more prolific vertical pay zone in a more permeable reservoir. Compared to conventional oil and natural gas drilling, the production of oil and natural gas from shale reservoirs thus entails more drilling, on average, and requires a substantial supply of water. 

&#160; 

Shale oil and natural gas are currently being produced from a number of reservoirs in the U.S. Among these are the Bakken Shale in Montana and North Dakota, the Niobrara Shale in northeastern Colorado and parts of adjacent Wyoming, Nebraska, and Kansas, the Eagle Ford Shale in southern Texas, the Mississippian Lime in Kansas and Oklahoma, and the Marcellus Shale spanning several states in the northeastern U.S. According to the EIA&#8217;s September 2015 assessment, the total technically recoverable world resources of shale oil and gas are estimated at 418.9 billion barrels (oil) and 7,576.6 trillion cubic feet (gas), with an estimated 78.2 billion barrels (oil) and 622.5 trillion cubic feet (gas) being concentrated in the U.S. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Beginning in 2014, the oil and natural gas industry began to experience a sharp decline in commodity prices, with the daily NYMEX WTI oil spot price falling from a high of $107.62 per Bbl in 2014 to low of $34.73 per Bbl in 2015. This recent decline in oil prices has resulted in a slowing of the pace of U.S. shale oil production, with Baker Hughes&#8217; rig count data showing a decrease in the number of oil rigs operating in the DJ-Niobrara from 42 rigs at the end of December 2014 to 23 rigs at the end of December 2015. However, average drilling and completion costs for wells in the DJ-Niobrara have significantly dropped from between $4.3 million (short-lateral) and $8.3 million (long lateral) per well in early 2015 to between $2.7 million and $5.0 million per well currently, which reduced costs partially offset the decline in commodity prices, resulting in new shale oil wells drilled in more thermally mature formations of the DJ-Niobrara expected to continue to yield positive economic returns. 

&#160; 

Regulation 

&#160; 

Oil and Natural Gas Regulation 

&#160; 

Our oil and natural gas exploration, development, production and related operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations. Failure to comply with these laws, rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties. The regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business and affects our profitability. Because these rules and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted and new rules and regulations are promulgated, we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with the laws, rules and regulations to which we are, or will become, subject. Our competitors in the oil and natural gas industry are generally subject to the same regulatory requirements and restrictions that affect our operations. We cannot predict the impact of future government regulation on our properties or operations. 

&#160; 

All of our current operations are in the state of Colorado. Colorado and many other states require permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations and impose other requirements relating to the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas. Many states also have statutes or regulations addressing conservation of oil and natural gas matters, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties, the establishment of maximum rates of production from wells, the regulation of well spacing, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, the sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling and completion process and the plugging and abandonment of these wells. Many states restrict production to the market demand for oil and natural gas. Some states have enacted statutes prescribing ceiling prices for natural gas sold within their boundaries. Additionally, some regulatory agencies have, from time to time, imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow of oil and natural gas wells below natural production capacity in order to conserve supplies of oil and natural gas. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids within its jurisdiction. 

Some of our oil and natural gas leases are issued by agencies of the federal government, as well as agencies of the states in which we operate. These leases contain various restrictions on access and development and other requirements that may impede our ability to conduct operations on the acreage represented by these leases. 

&#160; 

Some examples of U.S. federal agencies with regulatory authority over our exploration for, and production and sale of, crude oil, natural gas and NGLs include: 

&#160;

&#160; &#9679; the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), which under laws such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Occupational Safety and Health Act have certain authority over environmental, health and safety matters affecting our operations; 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; the US Fish and Wildlife Service, which under the Endangered Species Act (the ESA) have authority over activities that may result in the loss of any endangered or threatened species or its habitat; 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), which under laws such as the Energy Policy Act of 2005 has certain authority over the marketing and transportation of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs we produce; and 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; the Department of Transportation (DOT), which has certain authority over the transportation of products, equipment and personnel necessary to our operations. 

&#160;

Other U.S. federal agencies with certain authority over our business include the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the SEC. In addition, we are governed by the rules and regulations of the NYSE MKT, upon which shares of our common stock are traded. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Our sales of natural gas, as well as the revenues we receive from our sales, are affected by the availability, terms and costs of transportation. The rates, terms and conditions applicable to the interstate transportation of natural gas by pipelines are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) under the Natural Gas Act, as well as under Section 311 of the Natural Gas Policy Act. Since 1985, FERC has implemented regulations intended to increase competition within the natural gas industry by making natural gas transportation more accessible to natural gas buyers and sellers on an open-access, non-discriminatory basis. The natural gas industry has historically, however, been heavily regulated and we can give no assurance that the current less stringent regulatory approach of FERC will continue. 

&#160; 

In 2005, Congress enacted the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The Energy Policy Act, among other things, amended the Natural Gas Act to prohibit market manipulation by any entity, to direct FERC to facilitate market transparency in the market for sale or transportation of physical natural gas in interstate commerce, and to significantly increase the penalties for violations of the Natural Gas Act, the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, or FERC rules, regulations or orders thereunder. FERC has promulgated regulations to implement the Energy Policy Act. Should we violate the anti-market manipulation laws and related regulations, in addition to FERC-imposed penalties, we may also be subject to third-party damage claims. 

&#160; 

Intrastate natural gas transportation is subject to regulation by state regulatory agencies. The basis for intrastate regulation of natural gas transportation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate natural gas pipeline rates and services varies from state to state. Because these regulations will apply to all intrastate natural gas shippers within the same state on a comparable basis, we believe that the regulation in any states in which we operate will not affect our operations in any way that is materially different from our competitors that are similarly situated. 

&#160; 

The price we receive from the sale of oil and natural gas liquids will be affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation of the products to market. Under rules adopted by FERC, interstate oil pipelines can change rates based on an inflation index, though other rate mechanisms may be used in specific circumstances. Intrastate oil pipeline transportation rates are subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions, which varies from state to state. We are not able to predict with certainty the effects, if any, of these regulations on our operations. 

In 2007, the Energy Independence &#38; Security Act of 2007 (the &#8220; EISA &#8221;), went into effect. The EISA, among other things, prohibits market manipulation by any person in connection with the purchase or sale of crude oil, gasoline or petroleum distillates at wholesale in contravention of such rules and regulations that the Federal Trade Commission may prescribe, directs the Federal Trade Commission to enforce the regulations and establishes penalties for violations thereunder. We cannot predict any future regulations or their impact. 

&#160; 

U.S. Federal and State Taxation 

&#160; 

The federal, state and local governments in the areas in which we operate impose taxes on the oil and natural gas products we sell and, for many of our wells, sales and use taxes on significant portions of our drilling and operating costs. In the past, there has been a significant amount of discussion by legislators and presidential administrations concerning a variety of energy tax proposals. President Obama has recently proposed sweeping changes in federal laws on the income taxation of small oil and natural gas exploration and production companies such as us. President Obama has proposed to eliminate allowing small U.S. oil and natural gas companies to deduct intangible U.S. drilling costs as incurred and percentage depletion. Many states have raised state taxes on energy sources, and additional increases may occur. Changes to tax laws could adversely affect our business and our financial results. 

&#160; 

Environmental Regulation 

&#160; 

The exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas, including the operation of saltwater injection and disposal wells, are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations can increase the costs of planning, designing, installing and operating oil and natural gas wells. Our activities are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations, including but not limited to the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90), the Clean Water Act (CWA), the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the Clean Air Act (CAA), the Safe Drinking Water Act (the SDWA), the Endangered Species Act (ESA), and the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA), as well as comparable state statutes and regulations. We are also subject to regulations governing the handling, transportation, storage and disposal of wastes generated by our activities and naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM) that may result from our oil and natural gas operations. Civil and criminal fines and penalties may be imposed for noncompliance with these environmental laws and regulations. Additionally, these laws and regulations require the acquisition of permits or other governmental authorizations before undertaking some activities, limit or prohibit other activities because of protected wetlands, areas or species and require investigation and cleanup of pollution. We intend to remain in compliance in all material respects with currently applicable environmental laws and regulations. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

OPA 90 and its regulations impose requirements on &#8220;responsible parties&#8221; related to the prevention of crude oil spills and liability for damages resulting from oil spills into or upon navigable waters, adjoining shorelines or in the exclusive economic zone of the U.S. A &#8220;responsible party&#8221; under OPA 90 may include the owner or operator of an onshore facility. OPA 90 subjects responsible parties to strict joint and several financial liability for removal costs and other damages, including natural resource damages, caused by an oil spill that is covered by the statute. It also imposes other requirements on responsible parties, such as the preparation of an oil spill contingency plan. Failure to comply with OPA 90 may subject a responsible party to civil or criminal enforcement action. We may conduct operations on acreage located near, or that affects navigable waters subject to OPA 90. 

&#160; 

The CWA imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of produced waters and other wastes into navigable waters. These controls have become more stringent over the years, and it is possible that additional restrictions will be imposed in the future. Permits are required to discharge pollutants into state and federal waters and to conduct construction activities in waters and wetlands. Certain state regulations and the general permits issued under the federal National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program prohibit the discharge of produced water, produced sand, drilling fluids, drill cuttings and certain other substances related to the oil and natural gas industry into certain coastal and offshore waters. Furthermore, the EPA has adopted regulations requiring certain oil and natural gas exploration and production facilities to obtain permits for storm water discharges. Costs may be associated with the treatment of wastewater or developing and implementing storm water pollution prevention plans. The CWA and comparable state statutes provide for civil, criminal and administrative penalties for any unauthorized discharges of oil and other pollutants and impose liability for the costs of removal or remediation of contamination resulting from such discharges. In furtherance of the CWA, the EPA promulgated the Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure (SPCC) regulations, which require certain oil-storing facilities to prepare plans and meet construction and operating standards. 

&#160; 

CERCLA, also known as the &#8220;Superfund&#8221; law, and comparable state statutes impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on various classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a &#8220;hazardous substance&#8221; into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the disposal site where the release occurred and companies that disposed of, or arranged for the disposal of, the hazardous substances found at the site. Persons who are responsible for releases of hazardous substances under CERCLA may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances and for damages to natural resources. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances released into the environment. Our operations may, and in all likelihood will, involve the use or handling of materials that may be classified as hazardous substances under CERCLA. Furthermore, we may acquire or operate properties that unknown to us have been subjected to, or have caused or contributed to, prior releases of hazardous wastes. 

&#160; 

RCRA and comparable state and local statutes govern the management, including treatment, storage and disposal, of both hazardous and nonhazardous solid wastes. We generate hazardous and nonhazardous solid waste in connection with our routine operations. At present, RCRA includes a statutory exemption that allows many wastes associated with crude oil and natural gas exploration and production to be classified as nonhazardous waste. A similar exemption is contained in many of the state counterparts to RCRA. At various times in the past, proposals have been made to amend RCRA to eliminate the exemption applicable to crude oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes. Repeal or modifications of this exemption by administrative, legislative or judicial process, or through changes in applicable state statutes, would increase the volume of hazardous waste we are required to manage and dispose of and would cause us, as well as our competitors, to incur increased operating expenses. Hazardous wastes are subject to more stringent and costly disposal requirements than are nonhazardous wastes. 

&#160; 

The CAA and comparable state laws restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources, including oil and natural gas production. The CAA contains provisions that may result in the gradual imposition of certain pollution control requirements with respect to air emissions from our operations. The EPA and states continue the development of regulations to implement these requirements. We may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the next several years for air pollution control equipment in connection with maintaining or obtaining operating permits and approvals addressing other air emission-related issues. Greenhouse gas record keeping and reporting requirements of the CAA became effective in 2011 and will continue into the future with increased costs for administration and implementation of controls. Federal New Source Performance Standards regarding oil and gas operations (NSPS) became effective in 2012, with more amendments becoming effective in 2013 and 2014, all of which have added administrative and operational costs. In addition, as part of its comprehensive strategy to further reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector, EPA proposed amendments to NSPS in 2015 that would impose additional control and other requirements to reduce such emissions. A final rule is expected in the summer of 2016. Colorado adopted new regulations to meet the requirements of NSPS and promulgated significant new rules in February 2014 relating specifically to crude oil and natural gas operations that are more stringent than NSPS and directly regulate methane emissions from affected facilities. In October 2015, the EPA strengthened the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (&#8220;NAAQS&#8221;) for ground level ozone to 70 parts per billion (&#8220;ppb&#8221;) from 75 ppb. In addition, the EPA extended the ozone monitoring season for 32 states, including Colorado. By October 2016, states are expected to have revised state implementation plans and proposed regulations to meet the new standard. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

The ESA restricts activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats. Some of our operations may be located in areas that are or may be designated as habitats for endangered or threatened species. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in May 2014 proposed a rule to alter how it identifies critical habitat for endangered and threatened species. It is unclear when this rule will be finalized. 

&#160; 

Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements or operating requirements could materially adversely affect our operations and financial position, as well as those of the oil and natural gas industry in general. For instance, recent scientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases, commonly referred to as &#8220;greenhouse gases,&#8221; and including carbon dioxide and methane, may be contributing to the warming of the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere. As a result, there have been attempts to pass comprehensive greenhouse gas legislation. To date, such legislation has not been enacted. Any future federal laws or implementing regulations that may be adopted to address greenhouse gas emissions could, and in all likelihood would, require us to incur increased operating costs adversely affecting our profits and could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas we produce depressing the prices we receive for oil and natural gas. 

&#160; 

On December 15, 2009, the EPA published its finding that emissions of greenhouse gases presented an endangerment to human health and the environment. These findings by the EPA allow the agency to proceed with the adoption and implementation of regulations that would restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the CAA. Subsequently, the EPA proposed and adopted two sets of regulations, one of which requires a reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases from motor vehicles and the other of which regulated emissions of greenhouse gases from certain large stationary sources. In addition, on October 30, 2009, the EPA published a rule requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified sources in the U.S. beginning in 2011 for emissions occurring in 2010. On November 30, 2010, the EPA released a rule that expands its final rule on greenhouse gas emissions reporting to include owners and operators of onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production, onshore natural gas processing, natural gas storage, natural gas transmission and natural gas distribution facilities. Reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from such onshore production became required on an annual basis beginning in 2012 for emissions occurring in 2011. The adoption and implementation of any regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of greenhouse gases from, our equipment and operations could, and in all likelihood will, require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases associated with our operations adversely affecting our profits or could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas we produce depressing the prices we receive for oil and natural gas. 

&#160; 

Some states have begun taking actions to control and/or reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and/or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs. Although most of the state-level initiatives have to date focused on significant sources of greenhouse gas emissions, such as coal-fired electric plants, it is possible that less significant sources of emissions could become subject to greenhouse gas emission limitations or emissions allowance purchase requirements in the future. Any one of these climate change regulatory and legislative initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

&#160; 

Underground injection is the subsurface placement of fluid through a well, such as the reinjection of brine produced and separated from oil and natural gas production. In our industry, underground injection not only allows us to economically dispose of produced water, but if injected into an oil bearing zone, it can increase the oil production from such zone. The SDWA establishes a regulatory framework for underground injection, the primary objective of which is to ensure the mechanical integrity of the injection apparatus and to prevent migration of fluids from the injection zone into underground sources of drinking water. The disposal of hazardous waste by underground injection is subject to stricter requirements than the disposal of produced water. We currently do not own or operate any underground injection wells, but may do so in the future. Failure to obtain, or abide by the requirements for the issuance of necessary permits could subject us to civil and/or criminal enforcement actions and penalties. 

&#160; 

Oil and natural gas exploration and production, operations and other activities have been conducted at some of our properties by previous owners and operators. Materials from these operations remain on some of the properties, and, in some instances, may require remediation. In addition, we occasionally must agree to indemnify sellers of producing properties from whom we acquire reserves against some of the liability for environmental claims associated with these properties. We cannot assure you that the costs we incur for compliance with environmental regulations and remediating previously or currently owned or operated properties will not result in material expenditures that adversely affect our profitability. 

&#160; 

Additionally, in the course of our routine oil and natural gas operations, surface spills and leaks, including casing leaks, of oil or other materials will occur, and we will incur costs for waste handling and environmental compliance. It is also possible that our oil and natural gas operations may require us to manage NORM. NORM is present in varying concentrations in sub-surface formations, including hydrocarbon reservoirs, and may become concentrated in scale, film and sludge in equipment that comes in contact with crude oil and natural gas production and processing streams. Some states, including Texas, have enacted regulations governing the handling, treatment, storage and disposal of NORM. Moreover, we will be able to control directly the operations of only those wells for which we act as the operator. Despite our lack of control over wells owned by us but operated by others, the failure of the operator to comply with the applicable environmental regulations may, in certain circumstances, be attributable to us. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

We are subject to the requirements of OSHA and comparable state statutes. The OSHA Hazard Communication Standard, the &#8220;community right-to-know&#8221; regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act and similar state statutes require us to organize information about hazardous materials used, released or produced in our operations. Certain of this information must be provided to employees, state and local governmental authorities and local citizens. We are also subject to the requirements and reporting set forth in OSHA workplace standards. 

In addition to federal regulations to which we are subject, the State of Colorado has separate authority to regulate operational and environmental matters. An example of such regulation on the operational side include the Greater Wattenberg Area Special Well Location Rule 318A (Rule 318A), which was adopted by the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (the &#8220; COGCC &#8221;) to address oil and gas well drilling, production, commingling and spacing in Wattenberg (located in the D-J Basin). On August 9, 2011, the COGCC approved amendments to Rule 318A. The amendments, which became effective on October 1, 2011, remove the limit on the number of wells which can produce from a particular formation, allowing wellbore spacing units and permitting wells to cross section lines. The amendments also address areas such as infill drilling, water sampling and waste management plans. In addition, in February 2013, the COGCC approved new setback rules for crude oil and natural gas wells and production facilities located in close proximity to occupied buildings. Previously, the COGCC allowed setback distances of 150 feet in rural areas and 350 feet in high density urban areas. These have been increased to a uniform 500 feet statewide setback from occupied buildings and 1,000 feet from high occupancy building units. The new setback rules also require operators to utilize increased mitigation measures to limit potential drilling impacts to surface owners and the owners of occupied building units. In addition, the new rules require advance notice to surface owners, the owners of occupied buildings and local governments prior to the filing of an Application for Permit to Drill or Oil and Gas Location Assessment as well as expanded outreach and communication efforts by an operator. The COGCC also approved two new rules making Colorado the first state to require sampling of groundwater for hydrocarbons and other indicator compounds both before and after drilling. Those new statewide rules require sampling of up to four water wells within a half mile radius of a new crude oil and natural gas well before drilling, between six and 12 months after completion, and between five and six years after completion. For the Greater Wattenberg Area, the rule requires operators to sample only one water well per quarter governmental section before drilling and between six to 12 months after completion. Further, the COGCC has adopted rules increasing the maximum penalty for violations of its requirements. 

&#160; 

The state environmental agency, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, likewise has adopted measures to regulate air emissions, water protection, and waste handling and disposal relating to our crude oil and natural gas exploration and production. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment has extended the EPA&#8217;s emissions standards for crude oil and natural gas operations to directly control methane. 

&#160; 

In addition, a few localities in Colorado have prohibited and/or restricted certain exploration and production activities, particularly use of hydraulic fracturing within their boundaries. See &#8220;Hydraulic Fracturing Regulation&#8221;, below. In 2014, Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper created the Task Force on State and Local Regulation of and Gas Operations, comprised of 21 members representing various interests, and charged with crafting recommendations to help minimize land use conflicts relating to the location of oil and gas facilities. Recommendations of the task force regarding new or amended legislation, appropriations or other action were submitted to the Governor in February 2015. In 2015 and into 2016, the COGCC conducted a rulemaking to implement two of these task force recommendations related to the permitting of large-scale facilities in urban mitigation areas and municipality notice provisions. Both rulemakings were finalized in January 2016 and new rules will become effective in spring 2016. In addition, depending on the outcome of the task force process and any related legislative or administrative activity, ballot initiatives, like those proposed in December 2015 and again in January 2016, affecting our operations may be proposed and adopted by the voters in future elections. 

&#160; 

More stringent laws and regulations protecting the environment may be adopted in the future and we may incur material expenses in connection with environmental laws and regulations in the future. The clear trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment and, thus, any changes in environmental laws and regulations or re-interpretation of enforcement policies that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position. We may be unable to pass on such increased compliance costs to our customers. Moreover, accidental releases or spills may occur in the course of our operations, and we cannot assure you that we will not incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of such releases or spills, including any third party claims for damage to property, natural resources or persons. 

&#160; 

We maintain insurance against some, but not all, potential risks and losses associated with our industry and operations. We do not currently carry business interruption insurance. For some risks, we may not obtain insurance if we believe the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. If a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by insurance, it could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Hydraulic Fracturing Regulation 

&#160; 

We use hydraulic fracturing as a means to maximize the productivity of our oil and natural gas wells in most wells that we drill and complete. Although average drilling and completion costs for each area will vary, as will the cost of each well within a given area, on average approximately 60% of the drilling and completion costs for our horizontal wells are associated with hydraulic fracturing activities. These costs are treated in the same way that all other costs of drilling and completion of our wells are treated and are built into and funded through our normal capital expenditures budget. 

&#160; 

Hydraulic fracturing technology, which has been used by the oil and natural gas industry for more than 60 years and is constantly being enhanced, enables companies to produce crude oil and natural gas that would otherwise not be recovered. Specifically, hydraulic fracturing is a process in which pressurized fluid is pumped into underground formations to create tiny fractures or spaces that allow crude oil and natural gas to flow from the reservoir into the well so that it can be brought to the surface. The makeup of the fluid used in the hydraulic fracturing process is typically more than 99% water and sand, and less than 1% highly diluted chemical additives. While the majority of the sand remains underground to hold open the fractures, a significant percentage of the water and chemical additives flow back and are then either recycled or safely disposed of at sites that are approved and permitted by the appropriate regulatory authorities. Hydraulic fracturing generally takes place thousands of feet underground, a considerable distance below any drinking water aquifers, and there are impermeable layers of rock between the area fractured and the water aquifers. 

Recently, there has been increasing regulatory scrutiny of hydraulic fracturing, which is generally exempted from regulation as underground injection on the federal level pursuant to the SDWA. However, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain fracturing activities involving diesel fuel under the federal SDWA and issued draft guidance related to this asserted regulatory authority in February 2014. From time to time, Congress has considered legislation that would provide for broader federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. 

The White House Council on Environmental Quality continues to coordinate an administration-wide review of hydraulic fracturing. The EPA continues its study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater and issued a draft assessment in June 2015, with a final, peer-reviewed report expected in 2016. In addition, the U.S. Department of Energy has investigated practices the agency could recommend to better protect the environment from drilling using hydraulic fracturing completion methods. These ongoing studies, depending on their degree of development and nature of results obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA or other regulatory mechanisms. The U.S. Department of the Interior, through the Bureau of Land Management (the BLM), also finalized a rule in 2015 requiring the disclosure of chemicals used, mandating well integrity measures, and imposing other requirements relating to hydraulic fracturing on federal lands. The rule is currently stayed and not effective pending ongoing litigation. 

In addition, at the federal level and in some states, there has been a push to place additional regulatory burdens upon hydraulic fracturing activities. Certain bills have been introduced in the Senate and the House of Representatives that, if adopted, could increase the possibility of litigation and establish an additional level of regulation at the federal level that could lead to operational delays or increased operating costs and could, and in all likelihood would, result in additional regulatory burdens, making it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing operations and increasing our costs of compliance. 

In 2012, several local communities in Colorado became interested in increasing regulatory requirements on oil and gas development. The most notable situations occurred in the City of Longmont, Colorado in 2012 where voters chose to ban hydraulic fracturing activities within city limits, and in Fort Collins, Colorado which passed a five-year moratorium on hydraulic fracturing activities within city limits. In the Colorado 2013 general election, the municipalities of Boulder, Broomfield, Fort Collins and Lafayette, Colorado, each passed similar ballot measures supporting restrictions or bans on the practice of hydraulic fracturing within their boundaries. To date, court challenges to several of these ordinances have been successful. Another measure to ban hydraulic fracturing was on the ballot in the City of Loveland in northern Colorado in June of 2014, but the oil and gas industry worked with the community to defeat that initiative. Likewise, in January 2015, the Board of Trustees for the Town of Erie, Colorado voted not to impose a moratorium on new crude oil and natural gas wells. See &#8220; Item 1A, Risk Factors &#8221;, for a more detailed discussion of these bans. 

None of our core operated D-J Basin acreage is located in the municipalities that have attempted to prevent oil and gas operations to date; therefore, we do not expect our operations to be materially impacted by these developments. However, in the future, should additional statewide or local Colorado initiatives be undertaken to regulate, limit or ban hydraulic fracturing or other facets of crude oil and natural gas exploration, development or operations, our business could be adversely impacted, resulting in delay or inability to develop oil and gas reserves, reducing our long-term reserves, production and cash flow growth, all of which would potentially have a negative impact on our stock price. We will continue to monitor proposed and new legislation and regulations in all operating jurisdictions to assess the potential impact on our company. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

In addition, in December 2011, the COGCC adopted hydraulic fracturing fluid ingredient regulations requiring disclosure of all chemicals and establishing ways to protect proprietary information. The regulations allow disclosure through the national fracturing chemical registry at FracFocus web site. We are currently providing disclosure information on FracFocus.org for all our D-J Basin operations. See further discussion in &#8220; Item 1A, Risk Factors &#8221; . 

During 2014, the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Act was amended to increase the potential sanctions for violating the Act or its implementing regulations, orders, or permits. These amendments increase the maximum penalty per violation per day from $1,000 to $15,000; eliminate a $10,000 maximum penalty for violations that do not result in significant waste of oil and gas resources, damage to correlative rights, or adverse impact to public health, safety, or welfare; require the COGCC to assess a penalty for each day there is evidence of a violation; and authorize the COGCC to prohibit the issuance of new permits and suspend certificates of clearance for egregious violations resulting from gross negligence or knowing and willful misconduct. In December 2014, the COGCC convened a hearing and adopted proposed amendments to its regulations to implement this new legislation and address certain other issues. Among other things, the amendments create a new process for calculating penalties, new standards for determining days of violation and penalty amounts, new restrictions on the use of informal enforcement procedures and penalty reductions for voluntary disclosures. Following the adoption of this new penalty scheme, Colorado operators have experienced increased penalties for violations within COGCC&#8217;s jurisdiction. 

In 2015, the COGCC convened hearings on regulations for large facilities located in urban mitigation areas. These new rules, which are anticipated to be effective in March 2016, require best available technology and include required mitigations for emissions, flaring, fire, fluid leak detection, repair, reporting, automated well shut-in, storage tank pressure control and proppant dust control. During these hearings, COGCC staff reported there would also be site-specific mitigation requirements for noise, ground and surface water protection, visual impacts and remote stimulation. After debate, the rule did not include duration limits despite an opinion from the State Attorney General Office that the COGCC possessed authority to impose duration limits under current and existing statutes. 

We are not able to predict the timing, scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws or regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing, but the direct and indirect costs of such laws and regulations (if enacted) could materially and adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations. See further discussion in &#8220; Item 1A, Risk Factors &#8221; . 

Insurance 

&#160; 

Our oil and gas properties are subject to hazards inherent in the oil and gas industry, such as accidents, blowouts, explosions, implosions, fires and oil spills. These conditions can cause: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; damage to or destruction of property, equipment and the environment; 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; personal injury or loss of life; and, 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; suspension of operations. 

&#160; 

We maintain insurance coverage that we believe to be customary in the industry against these types of hazards. However, we may not be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable. In addition, our insurance is subject to coverage limits and some policies exclude coverage for damages resulting from environmental contamination. The occurrence of a significant event or adverse claim in excess of the insurance coverage that we maintain or that is not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015, we employed 11 people and also utilize the services of independent contractors to perform various field and other services. Our future success will depend partially on our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements and have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages. We consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory.

&#160; 

Farmin or farmout . An agreement under which the owner of a working interest in an oil or natural gas lease assigns the working interest or a portion of the working interest to another party who desires to drill on the leased acreage. Generally, the assignee is required to drill one or more wells in order to earn its interest in the acreage. The assignor usually retains a royalty or reversionary interest in the lease. The interest received by an assignee is a &#8220;farmin&#8221; while the interest transferred by the assignor is a &#8220;farmout.&#8221;

Play . A set of known or postulated oil and/or natural gas accumulations sharing similar geologic, geographic and temporal properties, such as source rock, migration pathways, timing, trapping mechanism and hydrocarbon type. 

&#160; 

Possible reserves . Additional reserves that are less certain to be recognized than probable reserves. 

&#160; 

Probable reserves . Additional reserves that are less certain to be recognized than proved reserves but which, in sum with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered. 

&#160; 

Producing well, production well or productive well . A well that is found to be capable of producing hydrocarbons in sufficient quantities such that proceeds from the sale of the well&#8217;s production exceed production-related expenses and taxes. 

&#160; 

Properties . Natural gas and oil wells, production and related equipment and facilities and natural gas, oil or other mineral fee, leasehold and related interests.

&#160; 

Royalty interest . An interest in an oil and natural gas lease that gives the owner of the interest the right to receive a portion of the production from the leased acreage (or of the proceeds of the sale thereof), but generally does not require the owner to pay any portion of the costs of drilling or operating the wells on the leased acreage. Royalties may be either landowner&#8217;s royalties, which are reserved by the owner of the leased acreage at the time the lease is granted, or overriding royalties, which are usually reserved by an owner of the leasehold in connection with a transfer to a subsequent owner. 

2-D seismic . The method by which a cross-section of the earth&#8217;s subsurface is created through the interpretation of reflecting seismic data collected along a single source profile. 

&#160; 

3-D seismic . The method by which a three-dimensional image of the earth&#8217;s subsurface is created through the interpretation of reflection seismic data collected over a surface grid. 3-D seismic surveys allow for a more detailed understanding of the subsurface than do 2-D seismic surveys and contribute significantly to field appraisal, exploitation and production. 

&#160; 

Trend . A region of oil and/or natural gas production, the geographic limits of which have not been fully defined, having geological characteristics that have been ascertained through supporting geological, geophysical or other data to contain the potential for oil and/or natural gas reserves in a particular formation or series of formations.

Unconventional resource play . A set of known or postulated oil and or natural gas resources or reserves warranting further exploration which are extracted from (a) low-permeability sandstone and shale formations and (b) coalbed methane. These plays require the application of advanced technology to extract the oil and natural gas resources. 

&#160; 

Undeveloped acreage . Lease acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and natural gas, regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves. Undeveloped acreage is usually considered to be all acreage that is not allocated or assignable to productive wells.

&#160; 

Vertical well . A hole drilled vertically into the earth from which oil, natural gas or water flows is pumped. 

&#160; 

Volumetric reserve analysis . A technique used to estimate the amount of recoverable oil and natural gas. It involves calculating the volume of reservoir rock and adjusting that volume for the rock porosity, hydrocarbon saturation, formation volume factor and recovery factor. 

&#160; 

Wellbore . The hole made by a well. 

&#160; 

Working interest . The operating interest that gives the owner the right to drill, produce and conduct operating activities on the property and receive a share of production. 

&#160;
