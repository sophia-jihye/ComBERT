 Item 1. BUSINESS GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS 

Description of the Company 

We are the leading U.S. manufacturer and supplier of residential impact-resistant windows and doors and pioneered the U.S. impact-resistant window and door industry. Our PGT impact-resistant products, which are marketed under the WinGuard &#174; , PremierVue &#153;, PGT Architectural Systems and PGT Commercial Storefront System brand names, combine heavy-duty aluminum or vinyl frames with laminated glass to provide protection from hurricane-force winds and wind-borne debris by maintaining their structural integrity and preventing penetration by impacting objects. Impact-resistant windows and doors satisfy stringent building codes in hurricane-prone coastal states and provide an attractive alternative to shutters and other &#147;active&#148; forms of hurricane protection that require installation and removal before and after each storm. Combining the impact resistance of WinGuard, PremierVue &#153; , PGT Architectural Systems, and PGT Commercial Storefront System with our insulating glass creates energy efficient windows that can significantly reduce cooling and heating costs. We also manufacture non-impact resistant products in both aluminum and vinyl frames including our SpectraGuard &#153; line of products. Our current market share in Florida, which is the largest U.S. impact-resistant window and door market, is significantly greater than that of any of our competitors. 

At our manufacturing facilities in North Venice, Florida, where we have nearly 2,000 employees, we produce fully-customized windows and doors. We are vertically integrated with glass insulating, tempering and laminating facilities, which provide us with a consistent source of impact-resistant laminated and insulating glass, shorter lead times, and lower costs relative to third-party sourcing. 

On September 22, 2014, we completed the acquisition of CGI Windows and Doors Holdings, Inc. (CGI) which became a wholly-owned subsidiary of PGT Industries, Inc. CGI was established in 1992 and has consistently built a reputation based on designing and manufacturing quality impact resistant products that meet or exceed the stringent Miami-Dade County impact standards. CGI has over 300 employees at its manufacturing plant in Miami, Florida. Today, CGI continues to lead as an innovator in product craftsmanship, strength and style, and its brands are highly recognized and respected by the architectural community. CGI product lines include the Estate Collection, Sentinel by CGI, Estate Entrances, Commercial Series and Targa by CGI. 

On February 16, 2016, we completed the acquisition of WinDoor, Incorporated (WinDoor), a provider of high-performance, impact-resistant windows and doors for five-star resorts, luxury high-rise condominiums, hotels and custom residential homes. WinDoor is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of PGT Industries, Inc. With approximately 200 employees at its manufacturing and administrative facilities in Orlando, Florida, WinDoor manufactures high-end-high quality aluminum and thermally-broken aluminum and vinyl products, featuring windows, sliding glass doors, and terrace doors. 

The geographic regions in which we currently conduct business include the Southeastern U.S., Gulf Coast, Coastal mid-Atlantic, the Caribbean, Central America, and Canada. We distribute our products through multiple channels, including approximately 1,200 window distributors, building supply distributors, window replacement dealers and enclosure contractors. This broad distribution network provides us with the flexibility to meet demand as it shifts between the residential new construction and repair and remodeling end markets. 

History 

Our subsidiary, PGT Industries, Inc., a Florida Corporation, was founded in 1980 as Vinyl Tech, Inc. The PGT brand was established in 1987, and we introduced our WinGuard branded product line in the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew in 1992. CGI became a wholly-owned subsidiary of PGT Industries, Inc. on September 22, 2014. WinDoor became a wholly-owned subsidiary of PGT Industries, Inc. on February 16, 2016. 

PGT, Inc. is a Delaware corporation formed on December 16, 2003, and on June 27, 2006, we became a publicly listed company on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol &#147;PGTI&#148;.

Window and door products 

Impact window and door products 

WinGuard. WinGuard is an impact-resistant product line and combines heavy-duty aluminum or vinyl frames with laminated glass to provide protection from hurricane-force winds and wind-borne debris that satisfy increasingly stringent building codes and primarily target hurricane-prone coastal states in the U.S., as well as the Caribbean and Central America. Combining the impact resistance of WinGuard with our insulating glass creates energy efficient windows that can significantly reduce cooling and heating costs. In the first quarter of 2015, we announced the launch of our new WinGuard Vinyl line of windows and doors, our all-new impact-resistant vinyl window designed to offer some of the highest design pressures available on impact-resistant windows and doors and in an attractive modern profile, with larger sizes capable of handling the toughest hurricane codes in the country. It also protects against flying debris, intruders, outside noise and UV rays making it a top choice for customers seeking an impact-resistant window. 

PremierVue . PremierVue is a complete line of impact-resistant vinyl window and door products that are tailored for the mid- to high-end of the replacement market, primarily targeting single and multi-family homes and low to mid-rise condominiums in Florida and other coastal regions of the Southeastern U.S. Combining structural strength and energy efficiency, these products are designed for flexibility in today&#146;s market, offering both laminated and ENERGY STAR&#174; rated laminated-insulated impact-resistant glass 

Architectural Systems. Similar to WinGuard, Architectural Systems products are impact-resistant, offering protection from hurricane-force winds and wind-borne debris for mid- and high-rise buildings rather than single family homes. 

Estate Collection. Our Estate Collection of windows and doors is CGI&#146;s premium, high-end aluminum impact-resistant product line. These windows and doors can be found in elegant homes, prestigious resorts, hotels, schools and office buildings. Our Estate Collection combines best-in-class performance against hurricane force damage with architectural-grade quality, handcrafted details and superior engineering. Similar to WinGuard, Estate windows and doors protect and insulate against every imaginable external event, from hurricanes to UV protection, outside noise and forced entry. Estate&#146;s aluminum frames are up to 100% thicker than many of our competitors making it an excellent choice for any coastal area prone to hurricanes. 

Sentinel. Sentinel is a complete line of aluminum impact-resistant windows and doors from CGI that provide exceptional quality, craftsmanship, energy efficiency and durability at an affordable price. Sentinel windows and doors are manufactured to enhance the aesthetics of the home while delivering protection from the most extreme coastal conditions. Sentinel is custom manufactured to exact sizes within our wide range of design parameters, therefore, reducing on-site construction costs. In addition, Sentinel&#146;s frame depth is designed for both new construction and replacement applications resulting in faster, less intrusive installations. 

Targa. Targa is CGI&#146;s line of vinyl energy-efficient, impact-resistant windows designed specifically to exceed the Florida impact codes, the most stringent impact standards in the U.S. Targa windows enhance the aesthetics of a home and are low maintenance windows with long-term durability, and environmental compatibility.

Other window and door products 

EnergyVue. EnergyVue is our all new non-impact vinyl window featuring energy-efficient insulating glass and multi-chambered frames that meet or exceed ENERGY STAR &#174; standards in all climate zones to help save consumers on energy costs. The new design has a refined modern profile combined with robust construction to make larger sizes and higher design pressures an unparalleled offering. We rounded out the line with one of the industry&#146;s most extensive selection of frame colors and a variety of hardware finishes, glass tints, grid styles and patterns for our customers. We announced the launch of EnergyVue in the first quarter of 2015. 

Aluminum. We offer a complete line of fully customizable, non-impact-resistant aluminum frame windows and doors. These products primarily target regions with warmer climates, where aluminum is often preferred due to its ability to withstand higher structural loads. Adding our insulating glass creates energy-efficient windows that can significantly reduce cooling and heating costs. 

Eze-Breeze. Eze-Breeze non-glass vertical and horizontal sliding panels for porch enclosures are vinyl-glazed, aluminum-framed products used for enclosing screened-in porches that provide protection from inclement weather. This line was completed with the addition of a cabana door. 

PGT Commercial Storefront System. PGT&#146;s Commercial Storefront window system and entry doors, launched in 2013, are engineered to provide a flexible yet economical solution for a variety of applications. Our system provides easy fabrication and assembly, while also reducing installation time and challenges. 

Sales and Marketing 

Our sales strategy primarily focuses on attracting and retaining distributors and dealers by consistently providing exceptional customer service, leading product designs and quality, and competitive pricing all using our advanced knowledge of building code requirements and technical expertise. 

Our marketing strategy is designed to reinforce the high quality of our products and focuses on both coastal and inland markets. We support our markets through print and web-based advertising, consumer, dealer, and builder promotions, and selling and collateral materials. We also work with our dealers and distributors to educate architects, building officials, consumers and homebuilders on the advantages of using impact-resistant and energy-efficient products. We market our products based on quality, building code compliance, outstanding service, shorter lead times, and on-time delivery using our fleet of trucks and trailers. 

Our Customers 

We have a highly diversified customer base that is comprised of approximately 1,200 window distributors, building supply distributors, window replacement dealers and enclosure contractors. Our largest customer accounts for approximately 4% of net sales and our top ten customers account for approximately 18% of net sales. Our sales are comprised of residential new construction and home repair and remodeling end markets, which represented approximately 41% and 59% of our sales, respectively, during 2015. This compares to 38% and 62%, respectively, in 2014. 

We do not supply our products directly to homebuilders, but believe demand for our products is also a function of our strong relationships with a number of national homebuilders.

Materials and Supplier Relationships 

Our primary manufacturing materials include aluminum and vinyl extrusions, glass, ionoplast, and polyvinyl butyral. Although in many instances we have agreements with our suppliers, these agreements are generally terminable by either party on limited notice. All of our materials are typically readily available from other sources. Aluminum and vinyl extrusions accounted for approximately 37% of our material purchases during fiscal year 2015. Sheet glass, which is sourced from two major national suppliers, accounted for approximately 14% of our material purchases during fiscal year 2015. Sheet glass that we purchase comes in various sizes, tints, and thermal properties. From the sheet glass purchased, we produce most of our own laminated glass needs. However, in 2015 due to some temporary capacity constraints, we did purchase some of our laminated glass needs from one major national supplier. This finished laminated glass made up approximately 13% of our material purchases in fiscal year 2015. Polyvinyl butyral and ionoplast, which are both used as inner layer in laminated glass, accounted for approximately 11% of our material purchases during fiscal year 2015. 

Backlog 

As of January 2, 2016, our backlog was $31.6 million. As of January 3, 2015, our backlog was $28.0 million. Our backlog consists of orders that we have received from customers that have not yet shipped, and we expect that substantially all of our current backlog will be recognized as sales in the first quarter of 2016, due in part to our lead times which range from one to five weeks. 

Intellectual Property 

We own and have registered trademarks in the United States. In addition, we own several patents and patent applications concerning various aspects of window assembly and related processes. We are not aware of any circumstances that would have a material adverse effect on our ability to use our trademarks and patents. As long as we continue to renew our trademarks when necessary, the trademark protection provided by them is perpetual. 

Manufacturing 

Our manufacturing facilities are located in Florida where we produce fully-customized products. The manufacturing process typically begins in our glass plant where we cut, temper, laminate, and insulate sheet glass to meet specific requirements of our customers&#146; orders. 

Glass is transported to our window and door assembly lines in a make-to-order sequence where it is combined with an aluminum or vinyl frame. These frames are also fabricated to order. We start with a piece of extruded material which is cut and shaped into a frame that fits the customers&#146; specifications. Once complete, product is immediately staged for delivery and generally shipped on our trucking fleet within 48 hours of completion. 

Competition 

The window and door industry is highly fragmented, and the competitive landscape is based on geographic scope. The competition falls into the following categories. 

Local and Regional Window and Door Manufacturers: This group of competitors consists of numerous local job shops and small manufacturing facilities that tend to focus on selling products to local or regional dealers and wholesalers. Competitors in this group typically lack marketing support and the service levels and quality controls demanded by larger distributors, as well as the ability to offer a full complement of products. 

National Window and Door Manufacturers: This group of competitors tends to focus on selling branded products nationally to dealers and wholesalers and has multiple locations. 

Active Protection: This group of competitors consists of manufactures that produce shutters and plywood, both of which are used to actively protect openings. Our impact windows and doors represent passive protection, meaning, once installed, no activity is required to protect a home from storm related hazards. 

The principal methods of competition in the window and door industry are the development of long-term relationships with window and door dealers and distributors, and the retention of customers by delivering a full range of high-quality products on time while offering competitive pricing and flexibility in transaction processing. Trade professionals such as contractors, homebuilders, architects and engineers also engage in direct interaction and look to the manufacturer for training and education of product and code. Although some of our competitors may have greater geographic scope and access to greater resources and economies of scale than do we, our leading position in the U.S. impact-resistant window and door market, and the award winning designs and high quality of our products, position us well to meet the needs of our customers.

Environmental Considerations 

Although our business and facilities are subject to federal, state, and local environmental regulation, environmental regulation does not have a material impact on our operations, and we believe that our facilities are in material compliance with such laws and regulations. 

Employees 

As of the end of 2015, we employed approximately 2,300 people, including approximately 310 people at CGI, none of whom were represented by a collective bargaining unit. We believe we have good relations with our employees.
