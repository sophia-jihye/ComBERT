Overview 

&#160;

Legalization of recreational marijuana initially in Colorado and Washington and the growing number of jurisdictions with medical marijuana laws spawned a new industry in America in 2014. Under Voter approved Amendment 64, the State of Colorado became the first state to legalize the use of recreational marijuana. Colorado residents, who are at least 21 years of age with photo identification, may legally purchase as much as one ounce of marijuana in a single transaction. Non-Colorado residents, bearing the same identification, may purchase as much as one-quarter ounce. Marijuana cannot be consumed in any public space, including the shops where it was purchased. In 2015, Oregon, Alaska and the District of Columbia legalized marijuana for recreational use; however, sales currently remain banned in the District of Columbia. Additionally, 23 states have legalized marijuana for medical purposes.

&#160;

Grow Solutions Holdings, Inc. provides products and services to the regulated legal cannabis industry. At this time, the Company currently focuses its operations in the following areas:

&#160;

Retail Grow Stores and Distribution 

&#160;

Our business model is based on the aggressive consolidation of what we believe to be the &#8220;best of breed&#8221; operations for the retail sale and distribution of indoor and outdoor garden supplies and grow equipment, including for the legal growing of cannabis, throughout the United States, and eventually world-wide, through aggressive acquisition and consolidation of smaller businesses and organic growth of the existing business. Our growth strategy and continued success depends largely on our ability to (i) properly service our customers; (ii) acquire cash flowing, profitable companies; (iii) successfully integrate our acquisitions and eliminate operational inefficiencies; (iv) increase sales; and (v) establish and sell branded growing mediums and nutrients.

&#160;

We plan to leverage our strengths in industry knowledge and operational experience to identify and systematically integrate a network of standalone retail grow stores. The Company&#8217;s management believes retail grow stores in the legal cannabis industry are ripe for successful consolidation. We have experience in the legal cannabis industry and we have developed a strategic plan for identifying potential acquisition targets. Management of the Company is recognized in the industry, which we believe will enable the Company to efficiently identify, negotiate and close acquisitions. We believe the consolidation of these companies will allow the consolidated group to achieve significant savings throughout the value chain due to synergies and economies of scale.

&#160;

As a larger entity, we believe we will be able to access growth capital more easily than we would be as a single, early stage company, and we project that the synergy of multiple business units leveraging shared marketing and sales functions will further increase revenue and accelerate growth, while simultaneously reducing the cost of customer acquisition. We believe this will allow the collective group to attain an improved market share more quickly and allow capital investors to invest in a larger pool of business units, representing a greater opportunity to further seize market share.

&#160;

One Love Garden Supply LLC 

&#160; 

Effective May 13, 2015 (the &#8220;Closing Date&#8221;), the Company entered into an Acquisition Agreement and Plan of Merger (the &#8220;OneLove Agreement&#8217;) with Grow Solutions Acquisition LLC, a Colorado limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (&#8220;Grow Solutions Acquisition&#8221;), One Love Garden Supply LLC, a Colorado limited liability company (&#8220;OneLove&#8221;), and all of the members of OneLove (the &#8220;Members&#8221;). On the Closing Date, OneLove merged with Grow Solutions Acquisition and became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.

&#160;

One Love Garden Supply LLC located in Boulder, Colorado provides indoor and outdoor gardening supplies for all gardening needs. OneLove was started by two veteran gardeners who are experts in designing productive grow rooms. The business started in 2010 and has grown to be one of Colorado's trusted sources for accurate and effective answers to grower&#8217;s questions. OneLove has one of the largest selection of quality plant nutrients in the Boulder, Colorado area. OneLove also carries &#8220;in store&#8221; extensive grow room building supplies and indoor gardening equipment. Additionally, OneLove provides a full time grow room design consultant available to its customers at no cost.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The staff at OneLove focuses on indoor and outdoor gardening and is available to consult for all gardening needs including:

&#160;

&#160; &#9679; Teaching beginning gardeners what we believe is the most important basics necessary to succeed, we design simple user friendly systems for new gardeners that we believe will outperform many &#8220;advanced gardeners&#8221; gardens, crop after crop. &#160;

&#160; &#9679; Teaching the intermediate gardener ways to systemize and simplify their gardening tasks, cutting back on work time, providing consistency for your plants, automation of your environment, and how to set up environmental safety features in the event you have equipment failures that will result in crop failure, poor quality, and low yields. &#160;

&#160; &#9679; Talking with expert gardeners about their style of growing, type of system in place, products used, room design, and environmental control and manipulation. By doing this we can help the professional maximize efficiency and yield by streamlining consumable product, equipment and utility costs to maximize efficiency and yield. &#160;

At this time, OneLove is planning to build a new six thousand square foot building, increasing the size of our demo rooms, making the shop flow better, and improving our customers overall shopping experience.

&#160;

Real Estate Leasing 

&#160;

We plan for our real estate business to primarily include the acquisition and leasing of cultivation space and related facilities to agricultural retail stores, licensed marijuana growers and dispensary owners for their operations. We expect these facilities will range in size from 3,000 to 35,000 square feet. These facilities will only be leased to tenants that possess the requisite state licenses to operate cultivation facilities. We plan for the leases with the tenants to provide certain requirements that permit the Company to continually evaluate its tenants&#8217; compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

&#160;

We have identified properties that are currently under review for purchase and leaseback to licensed legal cannabis cultivators in Colorado. These projects include the purchase and leaseback of existing, currently operating facilities, as well as proposed new construction projects. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to complete any of these transactions.

&#160;

Additionally, we plan to acquire commercial real estate and lease office space to non-regulated participants in the legal cannabis industry. These participants include media, internet, packaging, lighting, cultivation supplies, and financial services. In exchange for certain services that may be provided to these tenants, we expect to receive rental income in the form of cash. In certain cases, we may acquire equity interests or provide debt capital to these non-regulated businesses.

&#160;

Job Posting Platform 

&#160;

On June 29, 2015, the Company and Jasper Group Holdings, Inc. entered into a Joint Marketing Agreement (the &#8220;Joint Marketing Agreement&#8221;) to provide services related to website creation for a legal cannabis job posting platform. We plan for the website to include an employee leasing program and allow employers, recruiters and potential employees to communicate through its platform for a fee. All potential employees will be screened with background checks by independent third parties and provided the necessary applications and related materials for individuals to become licensed in the legal cannabis industry on a state by state basis. In accordance with the terms of the Joint Marketing Agreement, Jasper Group Holdings, Inc. shall invest all funds necessary to form the website. At this time, the website has been initiated and is still under construction.

Consulting and Advisory 

&#160; 

The Company delivers comprehensive consulting services that includes design and construction to approved and licensed legal cannabis operators, as well as assistance with licensure and related applications for potential legal cannabis operators. The Company&#8217;s business plan is based on the future growth of the regulated legal cannabis market in the United States. The Company will provide general advisory services for business development, facilities design and construction, cultivation and retail operations, marketing and the improvement and expansion of existing operations.

&#160;

Marketing 

&#160;

Our marketing approach is focused on working with industry participants to create awareness of the services and products we provide. Word-of-mouth has proven to be our most valuable form of marketing. 

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

All of the Company&#8217;s planned retail and online distribution channels will compete for customers and sales with many different companies and products that are competitive today and likely to be even more competitive in the future. Accordingly, we believe it is essential that the Company and its verticals continue to develop, improve, and refine the value propositions that are offered to its customers.

&#160;

Competition in the legal cannabis industry is significant, as competing companies and retail grow stores continually open. With regard to competition in the California, Colorado and Washington market, there are numerous retail indoor and outdoor gardening stores that we believe will compete with the Company for business.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s size relative to its competition is difficult to gauge as most of our competition is privately held and does not publicly report their earnings. We do know of several competitors who own and operate more retail indoor and outdoor gardening stores than we currently do, but they are privately held and, therefore, we are unable to determine their size in terms of annual revenue.

&#160;

We also face competition from other public companies that offer equipment and expendables. Moreover, as the negative stigma associated with some types of urban gardening such as legal cannabis plants diminishes, it is very possible that other better capitalized public and private companies may enter the market and may effectively challenge the value proposition offered by the Company. These competitors may be able to attract customers more easily because of their financial resources. Our larger competitors can also devote substantially more resources to business development and may adopt more aggressive pricing policies. We plan to compete on the strength of our multiple business verticals, product offerings, and management.

&#160;

While our management believes that we have the opportunity to be successful in the legal cannabis industry, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in accomplishing our business initiatives, or that we will be able to maintain significant levels of revenues, or recognize net income, from the sale of our products and services.

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

We do not currently hold the rights to any intellectual property.

&#160;

Regulations 

&#160;

Marijuana is a Schedule-I controlled substance and is illegal under federal law. Even in those states in which the use of marijuana has been legalized, its use remains a violation of federal law.

&#160;

A Schedule I controlled substance is defined as a substance that has no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of safety for use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse. The Department of Justice defines Schedule I controlled substances as &#8220;the most dangerous drugs of all the drug schedules with potentially severe psychological or physical dependence.&#8221; If the federal government decides to enforce the Controlled Substances Act in the states which have legalized marijuana for recreational or medical use, persons that are charged with distributing, possessing with intent to distribute, or growing marijuana could be subject to fines and terms of imprisonment, the maximum being life imprisonment and a $50 million fine.

&#160;

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

As of April 30, 2015, 23 states and the District of Columbia allow their citizens to use medical marijuana. Additionally, cannabis has been legalized for recreational use in Washington D.C., Oregon, Washington, Colorado and Alaska. The state laws are in conflict with the federal Controlled Substances Act, which makes marijuana use and possession illegal on a national level. The Obama administration has effectively stated that it is not an efficient use of resources to direct federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by state-designated laws allowing the use and distribution of medical marijuana. However, there is no guarantee that the administration will not change its stated policy regarding the low-priority enforcement of such federal laws. Additionally, any new administration that follows could change this policy and decide to enforce the federal laws strongly. Any such change in the federal government&#8217;s enforcement of such current federal laws could cause significant financial damage to the Company and its shareholders. While the Company does not intend to harvest, distribute or sell cannabis, the Company may be irreparably harmed by a change in enforcement by the federal or state governments or the enactment of new and more restrictive laws.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160; 

As of March 30, 2016, the Company has 15 full time employees and 5 part time employees. 

&#160;

Facilities 

&#160; 

Our principal office is located at 535 5th Avenue, 24th Floor, New York, NY 10017. Our retail location and wholly owned subsidiary One Love Garden Supply LLC is located at 3620 Walnut Street, Boulder, Colorado 80301.

&#160; 

Litigation &#160;

&#160;

There are no material pending legal or governmental proceedings relating to our company or properties to which we are a party, and to our knowledge there are no material proceedings to which any of our directors, executive officers or affiliates are a party adverse to us or which have a material interest adverse to us.
