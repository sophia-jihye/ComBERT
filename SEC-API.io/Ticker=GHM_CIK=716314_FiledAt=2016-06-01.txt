Our principal customers include end users of our products in their manufacturing, refining and power generation processes, large engineering companies that build installations for companies in such industries, and the original equipment manufacturers, who combine our products with their equipment prior to its sale to end users. 

&#160;

Our products are sold by a team of sales engineers we employ directly as well as by independent sales representatives located worldwide. There may be short periods of time, a fiscal year for example, where one customer may make up greater than 10% of our business. However, if this occurs in multiple years, it is usually not the same customer or project over such a multi-year period.

&#160;

Over a business cycle, our domestic sales will generally range between 35% and 60% of total sales. The mix of domestic and international sales can vary from year to year. 

&#160;

Our Strengths

&#160;

Our core strengths include:

&#160;

&#183; 

We have a value-enhancing sales and development platform. Our customer-facing platform of sales, project estimating and application engineering are competitive advantages. We have tools and capabilities to iterate quickly and comprehensively as customers evaluate how best to integrate our equipment into their facilities. We find our early and deep involvement adds significant value to the process and is an important competitive differentiator in the long sales cycle industries we serve. Customers need our engineering and fabrication expertise early in project life cycle to understand how best to specify our equipment. 

&#160;

&#183; 

We are renowned for our strong capabilities to handle complex, custom orders . The orders we receive are extremely complex and the order management platforms in our businesses provide a second competitive differentiator for our company. Typically there is intense interaction between our project management teams and the end user or its engineering firm as product design and quality requirements are finalized after an order is placed. We have built strong capabilities to successfully execute high quality, engineered-to-order and build-to-spec process-critical equipment. In our markets, order administration, risk management, cost containment, quality and engineering documentation are as important as the equipment itself. Supplier selection process begins with assessing whether a supplier can manage all aspects of an order. 

&#160;

&#183; 

We maintain a responsive, flexible production environment. The operations platform in our businesses is adept at handling low volume, high mix orders that are highly customized fabrications. Our production environment is much different from a highly engineered standard products business. While equipment within product may look similar, rarely are two alike. Also, during production it is not uncommon for customer-driven engineering changes to occur that alter the configuration of what had been initially released into production. The markets that we serve demand this flexible operating model. 

&#160;

&#183; 

We provide robust after-the-sale technical support. Our engineering and service personnel go to customer sites to audit the performance of our equipment, provide operator training and troubleshoot performance issues. Technical service after a sale is important to our customer as their focus is always on leveraging to maximize equipment capabilities. 

&#160;

&#183; 

We have a highly trained workforce . &#160; We maintain a long-tenured, highly skilled and extremely flexible workforce. 

&#160;

&#183; 

We have a strong balance sheet. We maintain significant cash and investments on hand, and no bank debt, which we believe provides us with the flexibility to pursue our business strategy, including growth by acquisition. 

&#160;

&#183; 

We have a high quality credit facility . Our credit facilities provide us with a $30,000 borrowing capacity that is expandable at our option to provide us with up to a total of $55,000 in borrowing capacity. 

Our Strategy

We intend to strategically leverage and deploy our assets, including but not limited to, financial, technical, manufacturing and know-how, in order to capture expanded market share within the geographies and industries we serve, expand revenue opportunities in adjacent and countercyclical markets and continually improve our results of operations in order to:

&#160;

&#183; Generate sustainable earnings growth; 

&#160;

&#183; Reduce earnings volatility; 

&#160;

&#183; Improve our operating performance; 

&#160;

&#183; Generate strong cash flow from operations; 

&#160;

&#183; Meet or exceed our customers&#8217; expectations; 

&#160;

&#183; Improve the value we provide to our customers; and 

&#160;

&#183; Provide an acceptable return to our shareholders 

&#160;

To accomplish our objectives and maintain strategic focus, we believe that we must:

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Successfully deploy corporate assets to expand our market share in the industries we currently serve, access and develop a stronger presence in industries where we do not have a historically strong presence, and pursue acquisitions, partnerships and/or other business combinations in order to enter new geographic or industrial markets, new product lines or expand our coverage in existing markets. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Identify organic growth opportunities and consummate acquisitions where we believe the strength of the Graham and Energy Steel brands will provide us with the ability to expand and complement our core businesses. We intend to extend our existing product lines, move into complementary product lines and expand our global sales presence in order to further broaden our existing markets and reach additional markets. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Expand our market penetration in the domestic nuclear power industry. We also intend to identify additional domestic and international opportunities to serve the commercial nuclear power industry. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Expand our market presence in the U.S. Navy's Nuclear Propulsion Program. We plan to demonstrate our proficiency by successfully executing the complex Nuclear Propulsion Program orders that are currently in our backlog by controlling both cost and risk, providing high-quality custom fabrication to exacting military quality control requirements and through disciplined project management. We intend to become a preferred supplier of equipment to the U.S. Navy&#8217;s Nuclear Propulsion Program for both surface and submarine vessels. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Continue to invest in people and capital equipment to meet the anticipated long-term growth in demand for our products in the oil refining, petrochemical processing and power generation industries, especially in emerging markets. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Continue to deliver the highest quality products and solutions that enable our customers to achieve their operating objectives. We believe that our high quality and technical expertise differentiates us from our competitors and allows us to win new orders based on value. 

In order to effectively implement our strategy, we also believe that we must continually invest in and leverage our unique customer value enhancing differentiators, the keys of which are listed below:

&#160;

&#183; 

Invest in engineering resources and technology in order to advance our vacuum and heat transfer technology market penetration. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Enhance our engineering capacity and capability, especially in connection with product design, in order to more quickly respond to existing and future customer demands. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Invest in our manufacturing operations to improve productivity where needed and identify out-sourced capacity to complement our growth strategies. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Accelerate our ability to quickly and efficiently bid on available projects through our ongoing implementation of front-end bid automation and design processes. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Expand our capabilities and penetrate the existing sales channel and customer base in the nuclear market. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Invest in resources to further serve the U.S. Navy in our core competency areas of engineering and manufacturing, where our commercial capabilities meet U.S. Navy requirements. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Implement and expand upon our operational efficiencies through ongoing refinement of our flexible manufacturing flow model as well as achievement of other cost efficiencies. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Focus on improving quality to eliminate errors and rework, thereby reducing lead time. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Develop a cross-trained, flexible workforce able to adjust to variable product demand by our customers.
