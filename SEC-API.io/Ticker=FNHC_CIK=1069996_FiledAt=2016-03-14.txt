 ITEM 1 BUSINESS 

GENERAL

Federated National Holding Company (&#8220;FNHC&#8221;, &#8220;Company&#8221;, &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221;), is an insurance holding company that controls substantially all steps in the insurance underwriting, distribution and claims processes through our subsidiaries and our contractual relationships with our independent agents and general agents. We are authorized to underwrite, and/or place through our wholly owned subsidiaries, homeowners&#8217; multi-peril (&#8220;homeowners&#8221;), commercial general liability, federal flood, personal auto and other lines of insurance in Florida and other states. We market, distribute and service our own and third-party insurers&#8217; products and our other services through a network of independent agents.

Our wholly owned insurance subsidiary is Federated National Insurance Company (&#8220;FNIC&#8221;), which is licensed as an admitted carrier in Florida, Alabama, Louisiana and South Carolina. We also serve as managing general agent for Monarch National Insurance Company (&#8220;MNIC&#8221;), which was founded in 2015 through the joint venture, described below, and is licensed as an admitted carrier in Florida. An admitted carrier is an insurance company that has received a license from the state department of insurance giving the company the authority to write specific lines of insurance in that state. These companies are also bound by rate and form regulations, and are strictly regulated to protect policyholders from a variety of illegal and unethical practices, including fraud. Admitted carriers are also required to financially contribute to the state guarantee fund, which is used to pay for losses if an insurance carrier becomes insolvent or unable to pay the losses due their policyholders.

Monarch National Insurance Company Joint Venture

On March 19, 2015, the Company entered into a joint venture to organize MNIC, which received its certificate of authority to write homeowners&#8217; property and casualty insurance in Florida from the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation (the &#8220;Florida OIR&#8221;). The Company&#8217;s joint venture partners are a majority-owned limited partnership of Crosswinds Holdings Inc., a publicly traded Canadian private equity firm and asset manager (&#8220;Crosswinds&#8221;); and Transatlantic Reinsurance Company (&#8220;TransRe&#8221;).

The Company and Crosswinds each invested $14.0 million in Monarch Delaware Holdings, LLC (&#8220;Monarch Delaware&#8221;), the indirect parent company of MNIC, for a 42.4% interest in Monarch Delaware (each holding 50% of the voting interests in Monarch Delaware). TransRe invested $5.0 million in debt evidenced by a six-year promissory note bearing 6% annual interest payable by Monarch National Holding Company (&#8220;MNHC&#8221;), a wholly owned subsidiary of Monarch Delaware and the direct parent company of MNIC.

&#160;

In connection with the organization of MNIC, the parties entered into the following agreements dated as of March 17, 2015:

&#183; MNIC entered into a Managing General Agent and Claims Administration Agreement (the &#8220;Monarch MGA Agreement&#8221;) with FedNat Underwriters, Inc. (&#8220;FNU&#8221;), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, pursuant to which FNU provides underwriting, accounting, reinsurance placement and claims administration services to Monarch. For its services under the Monarch MGA Agreement, FNU will receive 4% of Monarch&#8217;s total written annual premium, excluding acquisition expenses payable to agents, for FNU&#8217;s managing general agent services; 3.6% of Monarch&#8217;s total earned annual premium for FNU&#8217;s claims administration services; and a per-policy administrative fee of $25 for each policy underwritten for Monarch. The Company will also receive an annual expense reimbursement for accounting and related services. 

&#183; MNIC, MNHC and Monarch Delaware (collectively, the &#8220;Monarch Entities&#8221;) entered into an Investment Management Agreement (the &#8220;Monarch Investment Agreement&#8221;) with Crosswinds AUM LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Crosswinds (&#8220;Crosswinds AUM&#8221;), pursuant to which Crosswinds AUM will manage the investment portfolios of the Monarch Entities. The management fee, on an annual basis, is 0.75% of assets under management up to $100 million; 0.50% of assets under management of more than $100 million but less than $200 million; and 0.30% of assets under management of more than $200 million. 

&#183; MNIC also entered into a Reinsurance Capacity Right of First Refusal Agreement with TransRe, pursuant to which TransRe has a right of first refusal for all quota share and excess of loss reinsurance that Monarch Insurance deems necessary in its sole discretion for so long as TransRe remains a member of Monarch Delaware or the MNHC debt remains outstanding. Pursuant to this agreement, TransRe has the right to provide, at market rates and terms, a maximum of 15% of any reinsurance coverage obtained by Monarch Delaware in any individual reinsurance contract. 

&#183; The Company&#8217;s CEO and CFO hold their respective positions with Monarch Entities while they remain employed by the Company. 

Monarch Entities are consolidated as a variable interest entity (&#8220;VIE&#8221;) in the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report. Refer to notes 1 and 14 set forth in Part II, Item 8 &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplemental Data&#8221; of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding the accounting and consolidation of the joint venture.

INSURANCE OPERATIONS AND RELATED SERVICES

Business Strategy

We expect that in 2016 we will capitalize on our operational efficiencies and business practices through:

&#183; improved property analytical qualities such as a broader geographical dispersion of risks throughout the southeast United States and avoiding risks that do not yield an underwriting profit; 

&#183; continued expansion of our homeowners&#8217; and private passenger automobile insurance products into additional states; 

&#183; employing our business practices developed and used in Florida in our expansion to other states; 

&#160;

&#183; maintaining a commitment to provide high quality customer service to our agents and insureds; 

&#183; expansion of our marketing efforts by retaining key personnel and implementing direct marketing technologies; 

&#183; offering attractive incentives to our agents to place a high volume of quality business with our companies; 

&#183; cede our insurance risk through reinsurance treaties; and 

&#183; additional strategies that may include possible mergers, acquisitions and joint ventures or dispositions of assets (such as the MNIC joint venture). 

MNIC expands our ability to provide insurance policies in Florida. Additionally, it strengthens our relationships with our partner agents.

Overview of Insurance Lines of Business

Homeowners&#8217; Property and Casualty Insurance

FNIC and MNIC underwrite homeowners&#8217; insurance in Florida and FNIC also underwrites insurance in Alabama, Louisiana and South Carolina. Homeowners&#8217; insurance generally protects an owner of real and personal property against covered causes of loss to that property. The homeowners&#8217; policies in-force totaled approximately 254,105 and 182,557 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Our homeowners&#8217; insurance products provide maximum dwelling coverage in the amount of approximately $3.8 million, with the aggregate maximum policy limit being approximately $6.5 million. We currently offer dwelling coverage &#8220;A&#8221; up to $4.0 million with an aggregate total insured value of $6.5 million. We continually subject these limits to review; during 2015, coverage &#8220;A&#8221; was increased by $1.0 million and total insured value increased by $1.5 million. The approximate average premium on the policies currently in-force is $1,758, as compared with $1,840 for 2014. The typical deductible is either $2,500 or $1,000 for non-hurricane-related claims and generally 2% of the coverage amount for the structure for hurricane-related claims.

Premium rates charged to our homeowners&#8217; insurance policyholders are continually evaluated to assure that they meet the expectation that they are actuarially sound and produce a reasonable level of profit (neither excessive, inadequate or discriminatory). Premium rates in Florida and other states are regulated and approved by the respective states&#8217; office of insurance regulation. In 2015, there were no rate increases or decreases in our voluntary property book of homeowners&#8217; business in FNIC or MNIC. As of the date of this Report, the Company has applied with the Florida OIR for a rate increase of 5.6% for FNIC and a rate decrease of 12% for MNIC for Florida homeowners&#8217; insurance policies only. These rate changes are currently awaiting approval from the Florida OIR.

&#160;

Other Lines of Business

Commercial General Liability : We underwrite for approximately 380 classes of skilled craft workers (excluding home-builders and developers) and mercantile trades (such as owners, landlords and tenants). The limits of liability range from $100,000 per occurrence with a $200,000 policy aggregate to $1.0 million per occurrence with a $2.0 million policy aggregate. We market the commercial general liability insurance products through independent agents and a limited number of general agencies unaffiliated with the Company.

Personal Automobile: Nonstandard personal automobile insurance is principally provided to insureds that are unable to obtain standard insurance coverage because of their driving record, age, vehicle type or other factors, including market conditions. We market this through licensed general agents in their respective territories.

Flood: FNIC writes flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance Program (&#8220;NFIP&#8221;). We write the policy for the NFIP, which assumes 100% of the flood risk while we retain a commission for our service.

&#160;

MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION

Our independent agents and general agents have the authority to sell and bind insurance coverage in accordance with procedures established by FNU. FNU reviews all coverage bound by the agents promptly and generally accepts all coverage that falls within stated underwriting criteria. For all policies issued, FNU also has the right, within a period that varies by state between 60 days and 120 days from a policy&#8217;s inception, to cancel any policy, upon an advanced notice provided in accordance with statutory specific guidelines, even if the risk falls within our underwriting criteria. We are focusing our marketing efforts on continuing to expand our distribution network while maintaining our commitment to long-term relationships. We market our products and services throughout Florida and in other states by establishing relationships with additional independent agents and general agents. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to obtain the required regulatory approvals to offer additional insurance products or expand into other states.

We believe that our integrated computer systems, which allow for rapid automated premium quotation and policy issuance by our agents, are key elements in providing quality service to both our agents and insureds for various lines of our business.

LIABILITY FOR LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES

We are directly liable for loss and loss adjustment expense reserves (&#8220;LAE&#8221;) payments under the terms of the insurance policies that are underwritten by our insurance companies. In many cases, there may be a time lag between the occurrence and reporting of an insured loss and our payment of that loss. As required by insurance regulations and accounting rules, we reflect the liability for the ultimate payment of all incurred losses and LAE&#8217;s by establishing a liability for those unpaid losses and LAE&#8217;s for both reported and unreported claims, which represent estimates of future amounts needed to pay claims and related expenses.

When a claim involving a probable loss is reported, we establish a liability for the estimated amount of our ultimate losses and LAE payments. The estimate of the amount of the ultimate loss is based upon such factors as the type of loss, jurisdiction of the occurrence, knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the claim, severity of injury or damage, potential for ultimate exposure, estimate of liability on the part of the insured, past experience with similar claims and the applicable policy provisions.

In addition, management provides for a liability on an aggregate basis to provide for incurred but not yet reported (&#8220;IBNR&#8221;). The estimates of the liability for loss and LAE reserves are subject to the effect of trends in claims severity and frequency and are continually reviewed. As part of this process, we review historical data and consider various factors, including known and anticipated legal developments, inflation and economic conditions. As experience develops and other data become available, these estimates are revised, as required, resulting in increases or decreases to the existing liability for loss and LAE reserves. Adjustments are reflected in results of operations in the period in which they are made and the liabilities may deviate substantially from prior estimates.

Among our classes of insurance, the automobile and homeowners&#8217; liability claims historically tend to have longer time lapses between the occurrence of the event, the reporting of the claim and the final settlement, than do automobile physical damage and homeowners&#8217; property claims. These liability claims often involve parties filing suit and therefore may result in litigation. By comparison, property damage claims tend to be reported in a relatively shorter period of time and settled in a shorter time frame with less occurrence of litigation.

&#160;

The following table presents the liability for loss and LAE reserves for the years ended December 31, 2006 through 2015 and do not distinguish between catastrophic and non-catastrophic events. &#160; The top line of the table shows the estimated liability for loss and LAE reserves at the balance sheet date for each of the periods indicated. These figures represent the estimated amount of loss and LAE reserves for claims arising in all prior years that were unpaid at the balance sheet date, including losses that had been IBNR. The portion of the table labeled &#8220;Cumulative amount of net liability paid as of&#8221; shows the cumulative payments for losses and LAE&#8217;s made in succeeding years for losses incurred prior to the balance sheet date. The lower portion of the table shows the re-estimated amount of the previously recorded liability based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year.

The cumulative redundancy or deficiency represents the aggregate change in the estimates over all prior years. A deficiency indicates that the latest estimate of the liability for loss and LAE reserves is higher than the liability that was originally estimated and a redundancy indicates that such estimate is lower. It should be emphasized that the table presents a run-off of balance sheet liability for the periods indicated rather than accident or policy loss development for those periods. Therefore, each amount in the table includes the cumulative effects of changes in liability for all prior periods. Conditions and trends that have affected liabilities in the past may not necessarily occur in the future.

&#160;

The net cumulative redundancies (deficiency) since 2007 primarily reflect favorable casualty reserve development, with the exception of 2014. At December 31, 2015, we had $89.8 million of net loss and loss adjustment expense reserves, which include $51.0 million in IBNR reserves, $30.4 million in case-reserves, and $8.4 million in adjusting and other reserves. As reflected in the table, we experienced an unfavorable net reserve development of $6.3 million on reserves at December 31, 2014, which increased our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for prior accident periods and increased our loss and loss adjustment reserve expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015. The unfavorable loss development was primarily related to commercial general liability and personal private automobile claims occurring in accident years 2014 and prior.

&#160;

REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS

Reinsurance is used primarily to manage overall capital adequacy and mitigate the insurance loss exposure related to certain events such as natural and man-made catastrophes.

FNIC operates primarily by underwriting and accepting risks for their direct account on a gross basis and reinsuring a portion of the exposure on either an individual risk or an aggregate basis to the extent those exceed the desired retention level. We continually evaluate the relative attractiveness of different forms of reinsurance contracts and different markets that may be used to achieve our risk and profitability objectives. MNIC does not have any material reinsurance contracts as of December 31, 2015.

Reinsurance markets include:

&#183; Traditional local and global reinsurance markets including those in the United States, Bermuda, London and Europe, accessed directly and through reinsurance intermediaries; 

&#183; Capital markets through insurance-linked securities and collateralized reinsurance transactions, such as catastrophe bonds, sidecars and similar vehicles; and 

&#183; Other insurers that engage in both direct and assumed reinsurance 

The form of reinsurance that we may choose from time to time will generally depend on whether we are seeking:

&#183; Proportional reinsurance, whereby we cede a specified percentage of premium and losses to reinsurers; 

&#183; Non-proportional or excess of loss reinsurance, whereby we cede all or a specified portion of losses in excess of a specified amount on a per risk, per occurrence (including catastrophe reinsurance) or aggregate basis; or 

&#183; Facultative contracts that reinsure individual policies 

All of our reinsurance contracts do not relieve FNIC from their direct obligations to insured. While it is not always possible to reinsure every known (cost too much) and unknown risk to the company, an effective reinsurance program substantially mitigates our exposure to potentially significant losses. There is a credit risk exposure with respect to ceded losses to the extent that any reinsurer is unable or unwilling to meet the obligations assumed under the reinsurance contracts. The collectability of reinsurance is subject to the solvency of the reinsurers, interpretation of contract language and other factors. The availability and amount of ceded premiums and losses associated with the acquisition of reinsurance will vary year to year. Our reinsurance program is subject to approval primarily by the Florida OIR and other regulators in states where we do business, and is subject to review by Demotech, Inc. (&#8220;Demotech&#8221;), in connection with Demotech&#8217;s rating of FNIC. Demotech provides financial stability ratings for property and casualty insurance companies.

The Company&#8217;s reinsurance program, which generally runs from July 1 to June 30 of the following year, consists of excess of loss, Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund (&#8220;FHCF&#8221;) and quota share, which is a form of proportional reinsurance, treaties which insure the homeowners&#8217; property lines from catastrophes in Florida and other states. The excess of loss and FHCF treaties, which became effective on July 1, 2015, insures for approximately $1.82 billion of aggregate catastrophic losses and LAE with a maximum single event coverage totaling approximately $1.26 billion, with the Company retaining the first $12.9 million in Florida and $5.0 million in Louisiana, Alabama and South Carolina for losses and LAE from each event. The FHCF treaty only affords coverage for losses sustained in Florida and represents only a portion of the reinsurance coverage in Florida.

The Company&#8217;s quota share treaties, which are included in the reinsurance program, runs from July 1 to June 30 of the following year. The quota share treaties consist of two different treaties, one for 30% which became effective July 1, 2014 and the other for 10% which became effective July 1, 2015. The combined treaties provide a 40% quota share reinsurance treaty on the first $100 million of covered losses for the homeowners&#8217; insurance program in Florida.

We are selective in choosing reinsurers and consider numerous factors, the most important of which are the financial stability of the reinsurer or capital specifically pledged to uphold the contract, its history of responding to claims and its overall reputation. In an effort to minimize our exposure to the insolvency of a reinsurer, we evaluate the acceptability and review the financial condition of the reinsurer at least annually. As of December 31, 2015, we have over 65 reinsurance companies in our program that are required to have at least an &#8220;A-&#8221; or better rating by A.M. Best Company (&#8220;A.M. Best&#8221;) or the agreement would need to be fully collateralized.

&#160;

EMPLOYEES

As of December 31, 2015, we had 297 employees, including two executive officers. &#160; We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreement and we have not experienced work stoppages or strikes as a result of labor disputes. We consider relations with our employees to be satisfactory. 

COMPETITION

We operate in highly competitive markets and face competition from national, regional and residual market insurance companies in the homeowners&#8217;, commercial general liability, and automobile markets. Our competitors include companies that market their products through agents, as well as companies that sell insurance directly to their customers. Large national writers may have certain competitive advantages over agency writers, including increased name recognition, increased loyalty of their customer base and reduced policy acquisition costs. We compete based on underwriting criteria, our distribution network and superior service to our agents and insureds. Although our pricing is inevitably influenced to some degree by that of our competitors, we believe that it is generally not in our best interest to compete solely on price.

In Florida, more than 50 companies compete with us in the homeowners&#8217; insurance market. Three of our larger competitors are Citizens Property Insurance Corporation (&#8220;Citizens&#8221;), Universal Property and Casualty Insurance Company and Security Insurance Company. In Florida, more than one dozen companies compete with us in the commercial general liability insurance market.

Significant competition also emerged because of fundamental changes made to the property and casualty insurance business in Florida in recent years which resulted in a multi-pronged approach to address the cost of residential property insurance in Florida. First, the law increased the capacity of reinsurance that stabilized the reinsurance market to the benefit of the insurance companies writing properties lines in Florida. Secondly, the law provided for rate relief to all policyholders. The law also authorized the state-owned insurance company, Citizens, which is free of many of the restraints on private carriers such as surplus, ratios, income taxes and reinsurance expense, to reduce its premium rates and begin competing against private insurers in the residential property insurance market and expands the authority of Citizens to write commercial insurance.

REGULATION

Overview

Our insurance operations are subject to the laws and regulations of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Nevada, South Carolina and Texas. We are also subject to employment regulations in Florida as well as California, North Carolina and Nevada, and regulations of any other states in which we seek to conduct business in the future. The regulations cover all aspects of our business and are generally designed to protect the interests of insurance policyholders, as opposed to the interests of shareholders. Such regulations relate to authorized lines of business, capital and surplus requirements, allowable rates and forms, investment parameters, underwriting limitations, transactions with affiliates, dividend limitations, changes in control, market conduct, maximum amount allowable for premium financing service charges and a variety of other financial and non-financial components of our business. Our failure to comply with certain provisions of applicable insurance laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, any changes in such laws and regulations, including the adoption of consumer initiatives regarding rates charged for coverage, could materially and adversely affect our operations or our ability to expand.

Most states&#8217; laws restrict an insurer&#8217;s underwriting discretion, such as the ability to terminate policies, terminate agents or reject insurance coverage applications, and many state regulators have the power to reduce, or to disallow, increases in premium rates. In addition, state laws generally require that rate schedules and other information be filed with the state&#8217;s insurance regulatory authority, either directly or through a rating organization with which the insurer is affiliated. The regulatory authority may disapprove a rate filing if it finds that the rates are inadequate, excessive or unfairly discriminatory. Rates, which are not necessarily uniform for all insurers, vary by class of business, hazard covered, and size of risk. Certain states, including Florida, as discussed above, have adopted laws or are considering proposed legislation which, among other things, limit the ability of insurance companies to effect rate increases or to cancel, reduce or non-renew insurance coverage with respect to existing policies, particularly personal automobile insurance.

Most states require licensure or regulatory approval prior to the marketing of new insurance products. Typically, licensure review is comprehensive and includes a review of a company&#8217;s business plan, solvency, reinsurance, character of its officers and directors, rates, forms and other financial and non-financial aspects of a company. The regulatory authorities may prohibit entry into a new market by not granting a license or by withholding approval.

&#160;

All insurance companies must file quarterly and annual statements with certain regulatory agencies and are subject to regular and special examinations by those agencies. We may be the subject of additional special examinations or analysis. These examinations or analysis may result in one or more corrective orders being issued by the Florida OIR. The most recent balance sheet audit of FNIC by the Florida OIR occurred as of December 31, 2010. There were no material findings by the Florida OIR in connection with this examination. FNIC also experienced a regularly scheduled statutory examination by the Florida OIR which occurred during 2010 for the five years ended December 31, 2010. There were no material findings in connection with this examination.

&#160; In some instances, various states routinely require deposits of assets for the protection of policyholders either in those states or for all policyholders. As of December 31, 2015, FNIC and MNIC held investment securities with a fair value of approximately $2.3 million, as a deposit with the State of Florida. 

Consent Order

On October 21, 2015, the Florida OIR approved the filing made by FNIC to comply with their cease and desist order dated May 19, 2015 which enabled them to review and approve FNIC&#8217;s underwriting analytic models. Upon its approval of the filing, the Florida OIR rescinded the cease and desist order. FNIC was required to pay a nominal administration fee.

&#160;

As of September 30, 2014, we have satisfied all applicable conditions of the consent order we entered into in January 2011 with the Florida OIR in connection of American Vehicle Insurance Company into FNIC. As of the date of this Report, the only operational restriction that remains in effect is a requirement to obtain Florida OIR approval prior to writing commercial multi-peril business or any new commercial property business, including condo associations, under any other line of business for which FNIC is authorized.

Insurance Holding Company Regulation

We, the parent company, are subject to laws governing insurance holding companies in Florida where FNIC is domiciled. These laws, among other things, (i) require us to file periodic information with the Florida OIR, including information concerning our capital structure, ownership, financial condition and general business operations, (ii) regulate certain transactions between us and our affiliates, including the amount of dividends and other distributions, the terms of surplus notes and amounts that our affiliates can charge the holding company for services such as management fees or commissions, (iii) restrict the ability of any one person to acquire certain levels of our voting securities without prior regulatory approval. Any purchaser of 5% or more of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock will be presumed to have acquired control of FNIC unless the Florida OIR, upon application, determines otherwise.

Restrictions in Payments of Dividends by Domestic Insurance Companies

Under Florida law, a domestic insurer may not pay any dividend or distribute cash or other property to its shareholders except out of that part of its available and accumulated capital surplus funds which is derived from realized net operating profits on its business and net realized capital gains. A Florida domestic insurer may not make dividend payments or distributions to shareholders without prior approval of the Florida OIR if the dividend or distribution would exceed the larger of (i) the lesser of (a) 10.0% of its capital surplus or (b) net income, not including realized capital gains, plus a two-year carryforward, (ii) 10.0% of capital surplus with dividends payable constrained to unassigned funds minus 25.0% of unrealized capital gains or (iii) the lesser of (a) 10.0% of capital surplus or (b) net investment income plus a three-year carryforward with dividends payable constrained to unassigned funds minus 25.0% of unrealized capital gains.

Alternatively, a Florida domestic insurer may pay a dividend or distribution without the prior written approval of the Florida OIR (i) if the dividend is equal to or less than the greater of (a) 10.0% of the insurer&#8217;s capital surplus as regards policyholders derived from realized net operating profits on its business and net realized capital gains or (b) the insurer&#8217;s entire net operating profits and realized net capital gains derived during the immediately preceding calendar year, (ii) the insurer will have policy holder capital surplus equal to or exceeding 115.0% of the minimum required statutory capital surplus after the dividend or distribution, (iii) the insurer files a notice of the dividend or distribution with the Florida OIR at least ten business days prior to the dividend payment or distribution and (iv) the notice includes a certification by an officer of the insurer attesting that, after the payment of the dividend or distribution, the insurer will have at least 115.0% of required statutory capital surplus as to policyholders. Except as provided above, a Florida domiciled insurer may only pay a dividend or make a distribution (i) subject to prior approval by the Florida OIR or (ii) 30 days after the Florida OIR has received notice of such dividend or distribution and has not disapproved it within such time.

&#160;

No dividends were paid by FNIC in 2015, &#160; 2014 and 2013, and none are anticipated in 2016. Also, no dividends were paid by MNIC since inception in 2015 and none are anticipated in 2016. &#160; Although we believe that amounts required to meet our financial and operating obligations will be available from sources other than dividends from our insurance subsidiaries, there can be no assurance in this regard. Further, there can be no assurance that, if requested, the Florida OIR will allow any dividends to be paid by FNIC to us, the parent company, in the future. The maximum dividends permitted by state law are not necessarily indicative of an insurer&#8217;s actual ability to pay dividends or other distributions to a parent company, which also may be constrained by business and regulatory considerations, such as the impact of dividends on capital surplus, which could affect an insurer&#8217;s competitive position, the amount of premiums that can be written and the ability to pay future dividends. Further, state insurance laws and regulations require that the statutory capital surplus of an insurance company following any dividend or distribution by it be reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate for its financial needs. 

While the non-insurance company subsidiaries (FNU and any other affiliate) are not subject directly to the dividend and other distribution limitations, insurance holding company regulations govern the amount that any affiliate within the holding company structure may charge any of the insurance companies for service (e.g., management fees and commissions).

Underwriting and Marketing Restrictions

During the past several years, various regulatory and legislative bodies have adopted or proposed new laws or regulations to address the cyclical nature of the insurance industry, catastrophic events and insurance capacity and pricing. These regulations include (i) the creation of &#8220;market assistance plans&#8221; under which insurers are induced to provide certain coverages, (ii) restrictions on the ability of insurers to rescind or otherwise cancel certain policies in mid-term, (iii) advance notice requirements or limitations imposed for certain policy non-renewals and (iv) limitations upon or decreases in rates permitted to be charged.

National Association of Insurance Commissioners (&#8220;NAIC&#8221;) Risk-Based Capital Requirements

In order to enhance the regulation of insurer solvency, NAIC established risk-based capital requirements for insurance companies that are designed to assess capital adequacy and to raise the level of protection that statutory surplus provides for policy holders. These requirements measure three major areas of risk facing property and casualty insurers: (i) underwriting risks, which encompass the risk of adverse loss developments and inadequate pricing; (ii) declines in asset values arising from credit risk; and (iii) other business risks from investments. Insurers having less statutory surplus than required will be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action, depending on the level of capital inadequacy. The Florida OIR, which follows these requirements, could require FNIC to cease operations in the event they fail to maintain the required statutory capital.

Based upon the 2015 and 2014 statutory financial statements for FNIC and MNIC, statutory surplus exceeded the regulatory action levels established by the NAIC&#8217;s risk-based capital requirements.

Based on risk-based capital requirements, the extent of regulatory intervention and action increases as the ratio of an insurer&#8217;s statutory surplus to its Authorized Control Level (&#8220;ACL&#8221;), as calculated under the NAIC&#8217;s requirements, decreases. &#160; The first action level, the Company Action Level, requires an insurer to submit a plan of corrective actions to the insurance regulators if statutory surplus falls below 200.0% of the ACL amount. &#160; The second action level, the Regulatory Action Level, requires an insurer to submit a plan containing corrective actions and permits the insurance regulators to perform an examination or other analysis and issue a corrective order if statutory surplus falls below 150.0% of the ACL amount. The third action level, ACL, allows the regulators to rehabilitate or liquidate an insurer in addition to the aforementioned actions if statutory surplus falls below the ACL amount. The fourth action level is the Mandatory Control Level, which requires the regulators to rehabilitate or liquidate the insurer if statutory surplus falls below 70.0% of the ACL amount. FNIC&#8217;s ratio of statutory surplus to its ACL was 439.3%, 534.0% and 312.1% at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 

Industry Ratings Services

Third-party rating agencies assess and rate the ability of insurers to pay their claims. These financial strength ratings are used by the insurance industry to assess the financial strength and quality of insurers. These ratings are based on criteria established by the rating agencies and reflect evaluations of each insurer&#8217;s profitability, debt and cash levels, customer base, adequacy and soundness of reinsurance, quality and estimated market value of assets, adequacy of reserves and management. Ratings are based upon factors of concern to agents, reinsurers and policyholders and are not directed toward the protection of investors, such as purchasers of our common stock.

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, FNIC and MNIC are rated by Demotech as &#8220;A&#8221; (&#8220;Exceptional&#8221;), which is the third of seven ratings, and defined as &#8220;Regardless of the severity of a general economic downturn or deterioration in the insurance cycle, insurers earning a Financial Stability Rating (&#8220;FSR&#8221;) of &#8220;A&#8221; possess &#8220;Exceptional&#8221; financial stability related to maintaining surplus as regards to policyholders&#8221;. Demotech&#8217;s ratings are based upon factors of concern to agents, reinsurers and policyholders and are not primarily directed toward the protection of investors. Our Demotech rating could be jeopardized by factors including adverse development and various surplus related ratio exceptions. On November 24, 2015, Demotech reaffirmed FNIC&#8217;s FSR of &#8220;A&#8221; (&#8220;Exceptional&#8221;) and MNIC has maintained its same FSR of &#8220;A&#8221; (&#8220;Exceptional&#8221;) since its 2015 inception.
