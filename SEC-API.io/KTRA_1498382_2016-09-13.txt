Background 

&#160; 

DelMar Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is a clinical stage drug development company with a focus on the treatment of cancer. We are conducting clinical trials in the United States with our product candidate, VAL-083, as a potential new treatment for glioblastoma multiforme (&#8220;GBM&#8221;), the most common and aggressive form of brain cancer. Our mission is to benefit patients and create shareholder value by rapidly developing and commercializing anti-cancer therapies in orphan cancer indications where patients have failed, or are unlikely to respond to, modern therapy. We have presented interim data from our clinical trial at peer reviewed scientific meetings demonstrating that VAL-083 can shrink or halt the growth of tumors in some brain cancer patients who have failed other approved treatments. Currently, there is no approved therapy for these patients. 

&#160; 

In addition to our clinical development activities in the United States, we have obtained certain exclusive commercial rights to VAL-083 in China where it is approved as a chemotherapy for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (&#8220;CML&#8221;) and lung cancer. We have entered into a collaboration agreement with the only manufacturer presently licensed by the China Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;CFDA&#8221;) to produce the product for the China market. This agreement potentially positions us to generate future royalty revenue through product sales or royalties for its approved indications in China while we seek global approval in new indications. 

&#160; 

We have filed a broad portfolio of patent applications to protect our intellectual property. Our patent applications claim compositions and methods of use of VAL-083 and related compounds, synthetic methods and quality controls for the manufacturing process of VAL-083. We believe that our portfolio of intellectual property rights provides a defensible market position for the commercialization of VAL-083. In addition, VAL-083 has been granted protection under the Orphan Drug Act by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;) and the European Medicines Agency (&#8220;EMA&#8221;) for the treatment of glioma, including GBM. In 2016, the FDA also granted Orphan Drug protection to VAL-083 for the treatment of medulloblastoma and ovarian cancer. 

&#160; 

Our drug discovery research focuses on identifying well-validated clinical and commercial-stage compounds and establishing a scientific rationale for development in modern orphan drug indications. Through our relationship with Valent Technologies, LLC (&#8220;Valent&#8221;), a company owned by Dr. Dennis Brown, our Chief Scientific Officer, we are able to utilize Valent&#8217;s proprietary ChemEstate bioinformatics tools which are used to screen and identify potential candidates. Promising candidates are further researched through our network of consultants and contract research organizations. This approach allows us to rapidly identify and advance potential drug candidates without significant investment in &#8220;wet lab&#8221; infrastructure. Based on this strategy, we acquired the initial VAL-083 intellectual property and prototype drug product from Valent and have identified additional drug candidates that we may have the opportunity to license or acquire in the future. 

&#160; 

We also believe the experience of our clinical development team will position us to be able to acquire, or license, additional product candidates in order to establish a pipeline of product opportunities. We plan to seek marketing partnerships to supplement our own commercialization efforts and potentially generate future royalty revenue. 

&#160; 

Recent Highlights 

&#160; 

&#9679; In the quarter ended June 30, 2016, we raised gross proceeds of approximately $7.2 million in a private placement from the sale of convertible preferred stock. &#160; 

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#9679; On July 12, 2016 our common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Markets under the symbol &#8220;DMPI&#8221;. &#160; 

&#9679; We entered into a collaboration research agreement with Accurexa, Inc. to explore local delivery of VAL-083 as a potential combination therapy for the treatment of brain tumors. &#160; 

&#9679; In the spring of 2016, the FDA Office of Orphan Products Development (&#8220;OOPD&#8221;) granted orphan drug designations to VAL-083 for the treatment of ovarian cancer and medulloblastoma. We have previously been granted an orphan drug designation for VAL-083 in glioma in the USA and Europe. &#160; 

&#9679; At the American Association for Cancer Research (&#8220;AACR&#8221;) and the American Association of Clinical Oncology (&#8220;ASCO&#8221;) respective annual meetings, we announced the completion of our Phase I/II clinical trial of VAL-083 in refractory GBM. Specifically, we reported: &#160; 

o A well-tolerated VAL-083 dosing regimen of 40 mg/m 2 /daily every 3 days in a 21-day cycle has been selected for advancement into a Phase III refractory GBM study; &#160;

o Median survival of patients receiving an assumed therapeutic dose of VAL-083 (&#8805;20mg/m 2 ) was 8.35 months following bevacizumab (Avastin&#174;) failure suggesting that VAL-083 may offer improved survival for GBM patients in comparison to currently available salvage therapy; and. &#160;

o A successful completion of an &#8216;End of Phase II&#8217; meeting with the USFDA and plans to advance VAL-083 into a pivotal Phase III clinical trial for refractory GBM as soon as practicable. &#160;

&#9679; At AACR, we presented additional data demonstrating that VAL-083 exhibits a distinct mode of action from other chemotherapies widely used in the treatment of cancer. &#160; 

&#9679; We announced a collaboration with the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (&#8220;MD Anderson&#8221;) to accelerate the clinical development of VAL-083 for the treatment of GBM. As part of the collaboration, MD Anderson will initiate a new Phase II clinical study with VAL-083 in patients with GBM at first recurrence/progression, prior to Avastin&#174; exposure. &#160; 

&#9679; At the AACR &#8211; Advances in Pediatric Research: From Mechanisms and Models to Treatment and Survivorship Conference, we presented data indicating that VAL-083 offers potential therapeutic alternatives in difficult-to-treat pediatric brain tumors. &#160; 

&#9679; At the AACR &#8211; Advances in Ovarian Cancer Research: Exploiting Vulnerabilities Conference, we presented data supporting the effectiveness of VAL-083 against cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancers and raised the potential for VAL-083 as a treatment for ovarian cancers as a single-agent against platinum-resistant tumors or in combination with platinum-based chemotherapeutic regimens. &#160; 

&#9679; We presented new non-clinical data supporting the differentiation of VAL-083 in the treatment of lung cancer at the AACR annual meeting and at the 16 th World Congress on Lung Cancer. &#160; 

&#9679; We continued to strengthen our intellectual property portfolio. DelMar now holds six issued US patents and seven issued patents outside of the US. We have thirteen patent families in various stages of prosecution, and over 100 patent filings in total. &#160; 

VAL-083 

&#160; 

Our product candidate, VAL-083, represents a &#8220;first-in-class&#8221; small molecule chemotherapeutic which means that the molecular structure of VAL-083 is not an analogue or derivative of other small molecule chemotherapeutics approved for the treatment of cancer. VAL-083 was originally discovered in the 1960&#8217;s and has been assessed in 42 Phase I and Phase II clinical trials sponsored by the National Cancer Institute (&#8220;NCI&#8221;) in the United States as a treatment against various cancers including lung, brain, cervical, ovarian tumors and leukemia. Published pre-clinical and clinical data suggest that VAL-083 may be active against a range of tumor types. VAL-083 is approved as a cancer chemotherapeutic in China for the treatment of CML and lung cancer. VAL-083 has not been approved for any indications outside of China. 

&#160; 

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Upon obtaining regulatory approval, we intend to commercialize VAL-083 for the treatment of orphan and other cancer indications where patients have failed other therapies or have limited medical options. Orphan diseases are defined in the United States under the Rare Disease Act of 2002 as &#8220;any disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 persons in the United States&#8221;. The Orphan Drug Act of 1983 is a federal law that provides financial and other incentives including a seven-year period of market exclusivity in the United States to encourage the development of new treatments for orphan diseases. 

&#160; 

We research the mechanism of action of potential product candidates to determine the clinical indications best suited for therapy and seek to rapidly advance into human clinical trials and toward commercialization. The mechanism of action of VAL-083 is understood to be a bi-functional alkylating agent. Alkylating agents are a commonly used class of chemotherapy drugs. They exhibit anti-cancer effects by binding to DNA and interfering with normal processes within the cancer cell, which prevents the cell from making the proteins needed to grow and survive. After exposure to alkylating agents, the cancer cell becomes dysfunctional and dies. There are a number of alkylating agents on the market that are used by physicians to treat different types of cancer. 

&#160; 

VAL-083 attacks cancer cells via a unique mechanism of action which is distinct from other chemotherapies used in the treatment of cancer. Based on published research and our own data, the cytotoxic functional groups and the mechanism of action of VAL-083 are understood to be functionally different from alkylating agents commonly used in the treatment of cancer. VAL-083 has previously demonstrated activity in cell-lines that are resistant to other types of chemotherapy. No evidence of cross-resistance has been reported in published clinical studies. Therefore, we believe that VAL-083 may be effective in treating tumors that have failed or become resistant to other chemotherapies. 

&#160; 

VAL-083 readily crosses the blood brain barrier where it maintains a long half-life in comparison to the plasma. Published pre-clinical and clinical research demonstrate that VAL-083 is selective for brain tumor tissue. 

&#160; 

The main dose-limiting toxicity (&#8220;DLT&#8221;) related to the administration of VAL-083 in previous NCI-sponsored clinical studies was myelosuppression. Myelosuppression is the decrease in cells responsible for providing immunity, carrying oxygen, and those responsible for normal blood clotting. Myelosuppression is a common side effect of chemotherapy. There is no evidence of lung, liver or kidney toxicity even with prolonged treatment by VAL-083. Commercial data from the Chinese market where the drug has been approved for more than 15 years supports the safety findings of the NCI studies. 

&#160; 

Modern medicine allows for better management of myelosuppressive side effects. We believe this offers the potential opportunity to improve upon the drug&#8217;s already established efficacy profile by substantially increasing the dose of VAL-083 that can be safely administered to GBM patients. 

&#160; 

Background on GBM 

&#160; 

Worldwide, there are an estimated 240,000 new cases of brain and central nervous system (&#8220;CNS&#8221;) tumors each year. Gliomas are a type of CNS tumor that arises from glial cells in the brain or spine. Glial cells are the cells surrounding nerves. Their primary function is to provide support and protection for neurons in the CNS. 

&#160; 

Glioblastoma Multiforme (&#8220;GBM&#8221;), also known as Grade IV astrocytoma, is the most common and the most lethal form of glioma. According to the World Health Organization, GBM occurs with an incidence of 3.17 per 100,000 person-years. Approximately 15,000 new cases of GBM are expected to be diagnosed in the United States during 2016. 

&#160; 

GBM progresses quickly and patients deteriorate rapidly. Common symptoms include headaches, seizures, nausea, weakness, paralysis and personality or cognitive changes such as loss of speech or difficulty in thinking clearly. The majority of GBM patients do not survive for more than two years following diagnosis, and the median survival in newly diagnosed patients with best available treatments is less than 15 months. 

&#160; 

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Standard treatment following diagnosis includes surgical resection to remove as much of the tumor as possible (&#8220;debulking&#8221;) followed by radiotherapy with concomitant and adjuvant chemotherapy with Temodar&#174; (temozolomide &#8220;TMZ&#8221;). Nearly all patients diagnosed with GBM will relapse following first-line treatment, with a 1-year survival rate of approximately 25% following failure of front-line therapy, with an average 5-year survival rate less than 3%. 

&#160; 

Avastin&#174; (bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF antibody) is approved as a single agent for patients with recurrent GBM following prior therapy as an alternative to corticosteroids to relieve disease symptoms in the US, Canada, Australia and Japan. Avastin&#174; carries a &#8220;black-box warning&#8221; related to severe, sometimes fatal, side effects such as gastrointestinal perforations, wound healing complications and hemorrhage. There are no data demonstrating an improvement in disease-related symptoms or increased survival in refractory GBM with Avastin&#174;. 

&#160; 

TMZ and the nitrosoureas, including carmustine, lomustine, and nimustine, are alkylating agents that readily cross the blood-brain-barrier (&#8220;BBB&#8221;) and are used in the treatment of CNS cancers, including GBM. Alkylating agents are among the oldest type of cancer chemotherapies in use today. Alkylating agents bind to DNA to cause damage to cancer cells. Their anti-tumor mechanism is via alkylation of DNA resulting in base-pair mismatch or strand-mediated cross links between base pairs. The DNA damage caused by alkylating agents mimics naturally occurring errors, resulting in apoptosis and tumor cell death. 

&#160; 

The primary anti-cancer mechanism of TMZ and the nitrosoureas is to attack the tumor&#8217;s DNA via alkylation of the O 6 -position of the DNA base residue, guanine. TMZ treatment causes DNA damage mainly by methylation at the O 6 -position of guanine resulting in guanine-thymine base pair mismatches during replication. Nitrosoureas mediate their cytotoxic effect by ethylation at the O 6 -position of guanine which produces a cross-link to cytosine residues resulting in double-strand DNA breaks during mitosis. 

&#160; 

A majority of GBM patients&#8217; tumors are resistant to TMZ or nitrosourea therapy due to high expression of a naturally occurring enzyme called O 6 -DNA methylguanine methyl-transferase (&#8220;MGMT&#8221;) enzyme which repairs O 6 -guanine lesions. MGMT repair in turn inhibits the activity of TMZ and nitrosoureas and allows a patients&#8217; GBM tumor to continue to grow in spite of treatment. 

&#160; 

Consistent with the importance of its repair activity, high expression of MGMT is strongly correlated with poor patient outcomes. Several clinical studies have established that MGMT is an important prognostic indicator of response to TMZ and patient survival. 

&#160; 

We have demonstrated that VAL-083 forms inter-strand DNA cross-links at the N 7 position of guanine &#8211; a building block of DNA. VAL-083 is active independent of O 6 -methylguanin-DNA-methyltransferase (&#8220;MGMT&#8221;), a DNA repair enzyme which is highly expressed in approximately 2/3 of GBM patients and correlated with resistance to temozolomide, the current front-line chemotherapy in the treatment of GBM. Of patients tested in the DelMar trial, 84% exhibited high MGMT.

VAL-083 in GBM 

&#160; 

VAL-083 is an alkylating agent which readily crosses the BBB. Its primary cytotoxic mechanism, epoxide derived DNA cross-links at the N 7 position of guanine, is distinct from TMZ or the nitrosoureas. 

&#160; 

Our research demonstrates that VAL-083&#8217;s unique cytotoxic mechanism forms DNA cross-links at the N 7 position of guanine and retains cytotoxic activity independent of MGMT expression in vitro. We have presented research at peer-reviewed scientific meetings demonstrating that VAL-083 is active in patient-derived tumor cell lines and cancer stem cells that are resistant to other chemotherapies. Of particular importance is resistance to Temodar&#174; due to activity of the repair enzyme known as MGMT, which results in chemoresistance in many GBM patients. We have presented data demonstrating that VAL-083 is active independent of MGMT resistance in laboratory studies. VAL-083 has more potent activity against brain tumor cells in comparison to TMZ and overcome resistance associated with MGMT suggesting the potential to surpass the current standard-of-care in the treatment of GBM. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

In addition, historical NCI clinical trial data and our own research support the activity of VAL-083 as a potentiator of radiotherapy. Radiotherapy in combination with temozolomide is the current standard of care in the treatment of glioblastoma. Our research demonstrates that temozolomide and radiotherapy are ineffective against GBM cells exhibiting a high expression of MGMT, whereas VAL-083 potentiates the tumor-killing effect of radiation in these cells. Furthermore, the combination of VAL-083 and radiation has been demonstrated active against GBM tumor stem cells in vitro. Tumor stem cells are often resistant to chemotherapy and form the basis for tumor recurrence and metastasis. 

&#160;

&#160; 

VAL-083&#8217;s more potent activity against brain tumor cells in comparison to TMZ, the ability to overcome MGMT-mediated resistance and activity against GBM cancer stem cells suggests the potential of VAL-083 to surpass the current standard-of-care in the treatment of GBM. We believe these data support a potential paradigm shift in the treatment of GBM where VAL-083 would be the chemotherapy of choice in the treatment of the majority of GBM patients whose tumors are known to express MGMT and other factors correlated with resistance to temozolomide or whose tumors become resistant to temozolomide over time. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

VAL-083&#8217;s activity in GBM has been established in historical NCI-sponsored clinical studies as chemotherapy in the treatment of newly diagnosed and recurrent brain tumors and other cancers. In general, tumor regression in brain cancer was achieved following therapy in greater than 40% of patients treated and stabilization was achieved in an additional 20% to 30%. In published clinical studies VAL-083 has previously been shown to have a statistically significant impact on median survival in high grade glioma brain tumors when combined with radiation versus radiation alone with results similar or superior to other chemotherapies approved for use in GBM. 

&#160;

and Other Therapies in the Treatment of GBM 

&#160; 

&#160; &#160; Comparative Therapy &#160; Median Survival Benefit Chemotherapy &#160; Radiation (XRT) &#160; Radiation + Chemotherapy &#160; vs. XRT alone Temodar &#160; 12.1 months &#160; 58 weeks (14.6 months) &#160; 2.5 months VAL-083 &#160; 8.8 months &#160; 67 weeks (16.8 months) &#160; 8.0 months Lomustine &#160; &#160; &#160; 52 weeks &#160; &#160; Carmustine &#160; &#160; &#160; 40-50 weeks &#160; &#160; Semustine &#160; &#160; &#160; 35 weeks &#160; &#160; Avastin &#160; n.a. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

Additional support for the differentiated profile of VAL-083 and TMZ comes from the results of studies with GBM cancer stem cells (&#8220;CSCs&#8221;). GBM CSCs display strong resistance to TMZ, even where MGMT expression is low. However, our data demonstrates that GBM CSCs are susceptible to VAL-083 independent of MGMT expression. 

&#160; 

Based on historical data and our own research, we believe that VAL-083 has the potential to offer physicians and patients a new paradigm in the treatment of GBM that will address significant unmet medical needs. In addition, the profile of VAL-083 offers the potential of additive or synergistic benefit as a future combination therapy with existing chemotherapeutic agents or novel vaccines or immunotherapy approaches currently under investigation. 

&#160; 

Interim Phase I/II Results in Refractory GBM 

&#160; 

We filed an investigational new drug (&#8220;IND&#8221;) application with the FDA and initiated human clinical trials with VAL-083 as a potential treatment for refractory GBM in 2011. Details of the study are available at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01478178?term=VAL-083&#38;rank=1) 

&#160; 

Our clinical trial was a Phase I/II, open-label, single arm dose-escalation study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and anti-cancer activity of VAL-083 in patients with refractory GBM. To be eligible for our clinical trial, patients must have been previously treated for GBM with surgery and/or radiation, if appropriate, and must have failed both bevacizumab (Avastin&#174;) and temozolomide (Temodar&#174;), unless either or both are contra-indicated. Response to treatment with VAL-083 was measured prior to each treatment cycle. 

&#160; 

The overall goal of our Phase I/II clinical trial is to determine a modernized dosing regimen for advancement into a registration directed clinical trial. The Phase I portion of the study involved dose escalation cohorts until a maximum tolerated dose (&#8220;MTD&#8221;) was established in the context of modern care. A further 14-patient Phase II expansion was then enrolled at the MTD to gather further safety data at our chosen therapeutic dose and to further explore the outcomes in this patient population. 

&#160; 

To date, 48 GBM patients have been enrolled in our Phase I/II clinical trial at five centers: the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, the Brain Tumor Center at University of California, San Francisco, the Sarah Cannon Cancer Research Center in Nashville, Tennessee, Denver, Colorado, and the SCRI affiliate site at the Florida Cancer Specialist Research Institute in Sarasota, Florida. 

&#160; 

&#160; 9 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

In summary, at doses tested to date, our interim clinical data is as follows. 

&#160; 

Pharmacokinetics 

&#160; 

Pharmacokinetic (&#8220;PK&#8221;) analyses showed dose-dependent linear systemic exposure with a short (1-2h) plasma terminal half-life; average Cmax at 40 mg/m 2 /day was 781 ng/mL (5.3&#181;M). The observed PK profile is comparable to published literature. Prior NCI-sponsored studies demonstrated that VAL-083 readily crosses the blood brain barrier and has a long (&#62;20 hour) half-life in the central nervous system (&#8220;CNS&#8221;). 

&#160; 

We believe that this PK profile is optimal for the treatment of brain tumors: A long CNS half-life is expected to maximize exposure of the drug in the brain increasing the likelihood of successful treatment outcomes, while a short plasma half-life is desirable to minimize systemic side effects. 

&#160; 

Observed pharmacokinetics from VAL-083 Phase 1 clinical trial dose vs. AUC 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Based on observed and previously published pharmacokinetics, DelMar believes that therapeutic doses equal to, or above, 20 mg/m 2 daily on days 1, 2 and 3 of a 21-day cycle should deliver sufficient levels of VAL-083 to brain tumors to achieve a therapeutic benefit. 

&#160; 

&#160; 10 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Safety and Tolerability 

&#160; 

In the Phase I dose escalation regimen, no serious adverse events (&#8220;SAE&#8221;) related to VAL-083 were encountered at doses up to 40 mg/m 2 /day. 

&#160; 

Increasing frequency of, and higher grade, hematologic toxicities were observed at doses above 40 mg/m 2 /day. Consistent with the published literature, the observed dose limiting toxicity for VAL-083 is primarily thrombocytopenia (low platelets). Observed platelet nadir occurred at approximately day 18, and recovery was rapid and spontaneous following treatment. 

&#160; 

Based on Phase I observations, fourteen additional patients were enrolled in a Phase II expansion cohort at 40mg/m 2 , which was established at the MTD. The purpose of the Phase II expansion cohort was to gather further safety data at our chosen therapeutic dose and to further explore the outcomes in this patient population. 

&#160; 

Consistent with Phase I, the dose of VAL-083 of 40 mg/m 2 on days 1, 2 and 3 of a 21-day cycle was generally well tolerated in Phase II. At this dose, one subject previously treated with CCNU, a nitrosourea agent, reported severe (Grade 4) thrombocytopenia. As a result of this observation, the protocol inclusion criterion for platelet count was increased from 100,000/undefinedL to 150,000/undefinedL for patients receiving prior nitrosoureas within 12 weeks preceding enrollment. No other dose limiting toxicities were observed in Phase II.

&#160; 

Based on these data, we believe that the 40mg dose is the optimal dose to advance into registration-directed Phase III clinical trials as it maximizes the amount of drug that can be delivered to the tumor while minimizing untoward toxicity.

Doses Achieved 

&#160; 

We confirmed that we achieved doses of VAL-083 that are substantially higher than were utilized in the original published NCI-sponsored clinical trials. A summary in comparison to the NCI&#8217;s historical regimen is as follows:

Daily x 5 q 5wks refers to a dosing regimen of once per day for five consecutive days every five weeks (35-day cycle); while daily x 3 q 3wks refers to a dosing regimen of once per day for three consecutive days every three weeks (21-day cycle) . 

&#160;

Our optimized dosing regimen increases the amount of VAL-083 delivered to the CNS by 60% over historical regimens without increased toxicity. Thus, the DelMar regimen achieves both a higher maximum concentration and higher overall exposure, which we believe may increase the likelihood of successful treatment outcomes in glioblastoma and other brain tumors.

GBM patients in our Phase I/II clinical trial were not re-resected prior to treatment with VAL-083 and therefore had a growing recurrent GBM tumor at the time of enrollment. Patients were monitored for tumor response by MRI. 

&#160; 

Consistent with un-resected refractory GBM, median progression free survival (&#8220;PFS&#8221;) was short at 1.2 months (range: 0.2 &#8211; 20.1 months). Five GBM patients treated with VAL-083 were reported to have stable disease as their best response following treatment; the remainder reported progressive disease. 

&#160; 

Disease progression is typical in a refractory GBM population with non-resected tumors. However, we believe that that slowed progression may provide meaningful clinical benefit in this patient population through prolonged overall survival and improved quality of life. 

&#160; 

Ad-hoc subgroup analysis of the Phase I dose-escalation data indicated a dose response trend. Increased survival was observed following initiation of treatment in a high dose (30 and 40mg/m 2 ) sub-group vs. a low dose (&#8804;5mg/m 2 ) sub-group. 

&#160;

&#160;

Observed Survival Based on Sub-Group Analysis 

&#160; 

&#160; 

According to published literature, GBM patients failing bevacizumab have a poor prognosis with expected survival under five months. To date, more than half of patients receiving an assumed therapeutic dose of VAL-083 (&#8805;20mg/m 2 ) have survived more than six months following bevacizumab failure; more than 40% have survived for nine months or are currently alive, and more than 20% have survived for twelve months or are currently alive with median survival of 8.35 months following bevacizumab failure.

While recognizing that our data are representative of a relatively small, non-controlled Phase I/II clinical trial, we believe these outcomes support the potential of VAL-083 to offer meaningful clinical benefit to GBM patients who have failed bevacizumab, compared to currently available therapy. 

&#160; 

MGMT &#38; IDH1 

&#160; 

High expression of DNA repair protein O6-methylguanin-DNA-methyltransferase (&#8220;MGMT&#8221;) and wild-type form of the enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase (&#8220;IDH1&#8221;) have been correlated with poor outcomes in GBM. 

&#160; 

The methylation status of the MGMT promoter was characterized by PCR and/or ELISA for nineteen GBM patients enrolled in DelMar&#8217;s trial: IDH1 status was reported in eleven patients; both MGMT and IDH1 status were reported in four patients. Of patients tested, 84% exhibited high MGMT and 90% were wild-type IDH1. All patients whose samples were tested for both markers were MGMT unmethylated by PCR and wild-type IDH1, a genotype that is correlated with particularly poor prognosis. 

&#160; 

&#160; 13 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

MGMT and IDH-1 have been previously shown to be diagnostic markers that correlate with resistance to currently available therapies (e.g. temozolomide) and GBM patient outcomes. Measurement of these biomarkers has become routine in clinical practice. While the science behind their importance in the disease pathway and their ultimate predictive value are still being explored, we believe we will ultimately be able to use these markers in a prognostic fashion to select the patients most likely to respond to treatment as we expand the clinical development of VAL-083. 

&#160; 

For example, we have previously demonstrated that VAL-083&#8217;s anti-tumor mechanism is active independent from the MGMT status in vitro. We can therefore utilize the measurement of MGMT to identify newly diagnosed GBM patients who are least likely to respond to temozolomide. We believe that employing this strategy will allow us to focus our development and commercialization efforts on GBM patients with the greatest unmet medical need. 

&#160; 

Additional Planned Clinical Trials in GBM 

&#160; 

Registration-directed Phase III Trial in Refractory GBM 

&#160; 

In May 2016 we held an end of Phase II meeting with the FDA where design of a registration-directed clinical program for VAL-083 in refractory GBM was discussed. Based on input from the FDA, the FDA confirmed that it would consider the totality of data available, including data obtained from DelMar's other planned clinical trials in related GBM populations, when assessing the New Drug Application (&#8220;NDA&#8221;). The FDA also noted that DelMar can rely on prior NCI studies and historical literature to support non-clinical data required for an NDA filing and that DelMar will have the option to file under a 505(b)(2) strategy which allows a sponsor to rely on already established safety and efficacy data in support of an NDA. 

&#160; 

DelMar's advanced development program will feature a single, randomized Phase III study measuring survival outcomes compared to a &#34;physicians' choice&#34; control, which, if successful, would serve as the basis for an NDA submission for VAL-083. The control arm will consist of a limited number of salvage chemotherapies currently utilized in the treatment of Avastin&#174;-failed GBM. The final pivotal trial design will be confirmed with the FDA following further discussions with the Company's clinical advisors. 

&#160; 

Based on historical development of other products in GBM, we believe that the FDA may grant Breakthrough Therapy, Fast Track, Accelerated Approval and/or Priority Review status to VAL-083 for the treatment of refractory GBM. Breakthrough Therapy, Fast Track, Accelerated Approval and Priority Review are expedited drug development designations established by the FDA that are intended to make therapeutically important drugs available at an earlier time. Receiving such a designation would not only highlight the importance of VAL-083 to GBM patients but could also optimize its regulatory timeline and commercial availability. 

&#160; 

Data from our planned registration-directed Phase III trial will form the basis of our application for FDA approval. Based on our current financial resources, initiation of the registration-directed trial will require additional funding to support the expanded clinical operations necessary to conduct and manage the study. We plan to initiate, subject to guidance from the FDA, and availability of funding, registration-directed Phase III studies as soon as practicable. 

&#160; 

Phase II Trial in Newly Diagnosed GBM 

&#160; 

Based on our data supporting a unique cytotoxic mechanism for VAL-083, we believe that VAL-083 may be a potentially superior alternative to currently approved chemotherapies used in the treatment of newly diagnosed GBM patients whose tumors express features, such as high expression of MGMT, that make them unlikely to respond to currently available chemotherapy such as temozolomide. 

&#160; 

We plan to conduct a single arm open-label Phase II study in newly diagnosed GBM patients whose tumors exhibit high-expression of MGMT. In this study, VAL-083 will be combined with radiotherapy as a potential replacement for temozolomide in patients with high expression of MGMT. The main goal of the trial will be to confirm the safety of DelMar&#8217;s optimized dosing regimen in combination of radiotherapy and to investigate outcomes of the combination therapy in GBM patients with high expression of MGMT. The trial will be conducted at Sun Yat Sen University in Guangzhou China in collaboration with our partner in China, Guangxi Wuzhou Pharmaceutical Group Co. Ltd. (Guangxi Wuzhou Pharma), who will provide funding for the trial. Sun Yat Sen University has completed scientific review and our protocol has been approved by its independent ethics committee. Subject to finalization of contractual obligations between DelMar, Guangxi Wuzhou Pharma and Sun Yat Sen University we expect to begin this study in the second half of calendar 2016. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Phase II Study in First Recurrence of GBM in Collaboration with University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center 

&#160; 

In January 2016, we entered into a collaboration with MD Anderson to accelerate the clinical development of VAL-083 for the treatment of GBM. As part of the collaboration, MD Anderson will initiate a Phase II clinical study with VAL-083 in patients with GBM at first recurrence/progression, prior to Avastin&#174; (bevacizumab) exposure. MGMT promoter methylation status will be used as a validated biomarker for enrollment and tumors must exhibit an un-methylated MGMT promoter for patients to be eligible for the trial and patients eligible for the study will have recurrent GBM characterized by a high expression of MGMT. 

&#160; 

The primary endpoint of this trial with be overall survival in comparison to historical data. The protocol has received Institutional Review Board (&#8220;IRB&#8221;) approval, and the study is expected to begin in the second half of 2016. 

&#160; 

Accurexa Collaboration 

&#160; 

The Company has entered into a collaboration agreement with Accurexa, Inc. (&#8220;Accurexa&#8221;). Accurexa is a biotechnology company focused on developing novel neurological therapies to be directly delivered into specific regions of the brain. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company and Accurexa will undertake collaborative research activities for the purpose of evaluating formulations of VAL-083 and one or more of temozolomide and BCNU for local delivery. Under the terms of the agreement, DelMar will supply VAL-083 and Accurexa will conduct experiments related to the development and validation of a novel formulation for the combined local delivery of VAL-083 and temozolomide. DelMar has been granted an exclusive right to license or acquire any product candidates and related intellectual property that results from research conducted under the agreement for further development and commercialization on an exclusive world-wide basis, or other terms that may be agreed upon between DelMar and Accurexa. The initial financial commitment by DelMar will not be significant. 

&#160; 

Other Indications for VAL-083 

&#160; 

Central Nervous System Metastases of Solid Tumors 

&#160; 

In June 2013, we announced a plan to split our ongoing Phase I/II clinical trial protocol into two separate studies: one focusing solely on refractory GBM and the other focusing on secondary brain cancers caused by other tumors that have spread to the brain. The successful management of systemic tumors by modern targeted therapies has led to increased incidence of mortality due to CNS metastases of lung cancer and other solid tumors. 

&#160; 

Based on historical clinical activity and our own research, we believe that VAL-083 may be suitable for the treatment of patients with CNS metastases who currently have limited treatment options. Subject to the availability of financial and operating resources, we plan to develop a separate protocol for the continued exploration of VAL-083 in patients with secondary brain cancer caused by a solid tumor spreading to the brain. 

&#160; 

VAL-083 in Lung Cancer 

&#160; 

Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality around the world and effective treatment for lung cancer remains a significant global unmet need despite advances in therapy. In general, prognosis for lung cancer patients remains poor, with a 5-year survival rate of less than 14% among males and less than 18% among females in most countries. Globally, the market for lung cancer treatment may exceed $7 billion by 2019 according to a report published by Transparency Market research. 

&#160; 

Non-small cell lung cancer (&#8220;NSCLC&#8221;) is the most common type of lung cancer. There are three common forms of NSCLC: adenocarcinomas are often found in an outer area of the lung; squamous cell carcinomas are usually found in the center of the lung next to an air tube (bronchus); and large cell carcinomas, which can occur in any part of the lung and tend to grow and spread faster than adenocarcinoma. NSCLC accounts for 85% of all lung cancer cases in the United States and approximately 90% of lung cancer cases diagnosed in China. 

&#160; 

&#160; 15 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Smoking is the most important risk factor in the development of lung cancer. According to the World Cancer Report (2008), 21% of cancer deaths are related to smoking, especially lung cancer. Additionally, high levels of air pollution have been implicated as significant causes of lung cancer. Incidence of lung cancer in the United States is approximately 59 per 100,000 with the majority (52:100,000) being NSCLC. 

&#160; 

According to The Nationwide Nutrition and Health Survey (2002), China has the world&#8217;s largest smoking population, with a smoking rate of 24.0% on average (50.2% for men and 2.8% for women), and a total number of 350 million smokers. The World Health Organization reports that the incidence of lung cancer in China is 34 per 100,000 population. However, some estimates are much higher exceeding 120 per 100,000 population for males aged 55-60 in urban areas. 

&#160; 

According to a survey conducted by the Chinese Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Science and Technology, smoking, poor diet, water pollution and environmental problems have caused the nation's cancer death rate to rise 80 percent in the past 30 years and cancer is now accountable for 25 percent of all urban deaths and 21 percent of all rural deaths. Based on these trends, the World Health Organization projects that the incidence of lung cancer in China is expected to exceed one million (1,000,000) new cases per year by 2025. 

&#160; 

The activity of VAL-083 against solid tumors, including lung cancer, has been established in both pre-clinical and human clinical trials conducted by the NCI. VAL-083 has been approved by the CFDA for the treatment of lung cancer. However, sales of VAL-083 in China have been limited by a lack of modern data, poor distribution, and preference for targeted therapies such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors (&#8220;TKIs&#8221;) in the modern era. 

&#160; 

The current standard of care for newly diagnosed NSCLC is platinum-based combination therapy or TKI therapy for patients whose cancer exhibits epidermal growth factor receptor (&#8220;EGFR&#8221;) mutations. Patients exhibiting EGFR mutations have shown an initial response rate to TKIs which exceeds the response rate for conventional chemotherapy. However, TKI resistance has emerged as an important unmet medical need. 

&#160; 

We believe VAL-083&#8217;s unique bi-functional alkylating mechanism of action could make it a valuable drug of choice in NSCLC patients who are or become resistant to TKI therapy. In addition, VAL-083 readily crosses the blood brain barrier suggesting that it may be possible for VAL-083 to treat patients whose lung cancer has spread to the brain. 

&#160; 

Based on these beliefs, we have acquired certain commercial rights to VAL-083 in China where it is approved for the treatment of lung cancer. We have begun to establish a strong scientific and clinical rationale to support the development of VAL-083 as a potential treatment for NSCLC. 

&#160; 

We plan to work with leading oncologists to develop new clinical and non-clinical data which will demonstrate the clinical utility of VAL-083 in NSCLC patients who are resistant to TKIs. We believe this strategy will result in sales growth for VAL-083 in China and generate future revenue for the Company through sales and marketing partnerships as well as position VAL-083 for global development in lung cancer. 

&#160; 

We have announced results of pre-clinical studies designed to evaluate the activity of VAL-083 in in vivo models of drug-resistant NSCLC in comparison to cisplatin. In an established murine xenograft model of NSCLC, the activity of VAL-083 was compared to standard platinum-based therapy with cisplatin against human NSCLC cell lines A549 (TKI-sensitive) and H1975 (TKI-resistant). In the study, VAL-083 demonstrated superior efficacy and safety in the treatment of TKI-susceptible (A549) tumors and in TKI-resistant (H1975) tumors. Specifically, 

&#160; 

&#9679; Treatment of TKI-sensitive (A549) NSCLC with 3 mg/kg of VAL-083 resulted in tumor growth delay of 26 days compared to untreated controls. Cisplatin (5 mg/kg) resulted in tumor growth delay of just four days. In addition, mean tumor volume on day 68 was significantly reduced in animals treated with 3 mg/kg VAL-083 (p=0.001) compared to untreated controls, and &#160; 

&#160; 16 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#9679; Treatment of TKI-resistant (H1975) NSCLC with 4 mg/kg of VAL-083 resulted in a statistically significant reduction in tumor volume (p=0.01) versus untreated control after 27 days. In the same model, treatment with 5 mg/kg of cisplatin failed to achieve statistically significant reduction in tumor volume (p=0.23) versus untreated control after 27 days. Longer-term safety assessments are ongoing in this model. &#160; 

In April 2016, we presented new non-clinical data at the AACR annual meeting. We reported that VAL-083: 

&#160; 

&#9679; induces apoptosis independent of p53 status, and appears to have a distinct mode of action from platinum-based chemotherapies widely used in the treatment of NSCLC and ovarian cancer; &#160; 

&#9679; demonstrated an ability to circumvent cisplatin-resistance in all ovarian cell lines tested; &#160; 

&#9679; was active against NSCLC tumors harboring T790M, p53 and/or KRAS mutations, known to confer resistance to currently available therapies; and &#160; 

&#9679; demonstrated super-additivity or synergy in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy. &#160; 

These data demonstrated that VAL-083&#8217;s mechanism is distinct from platinum-based chemotherapy, the current standard of care for NSCLC. VAL-083 retains its high level of anti-cancer activity in p53 mutated NSCLC cell lines compared to cisplatin or oxaliplatin. 

&#160; 

The p53 gene plays a central role in the protection of the human body from cancer and is responsible for initiating the process of programmed cell death, or apoptosis, which directs a cell to commit suicide if it becomes damaged or cancerous. The p53 pathway is also integral to the activity of many chemotherapy drugs. p53 is frequently mutated in NSCLC and p53 mutations are highly correlated with resistance to chemotherapy and poor patient outcomes in NSCLC. 

&#160; 

In November 2015 at the AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics we presented data on the benefit of VAL-083 in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy regimens in the treatment of NSCLC. The results of the study presented provide support for VAL-083 as a viable treatment option for NSCLC patients who fail to respond to standard-of-care platinum-based therapy or TKI therapy, and also support potential therapeutic benefits of a VAL-083 along with platinum combination regimens in newly diagnosed patients. We demonstrated that the combination of VAL-083 with either cisplatin or oxaliplatin demonstrated a superadditive (synergistic) effect against NSCLC cell lines, including those resistant to TKI therapy in vitro. 

&#160; 

These results may have immediate implications in the treatment of NSCLC in China where VAL-083 is approved as a chemotherapy for the treatment of lung cancer. The data also support exploring future clinical development of VAL-083 as a lung cancer therapy in the rest of the world thereby providing DelMar with a potential opportunity to expand our clinical development focus beyond glioblastoma. 

&#160; 

As a next step in the investigation of VAL-083 as a potential treatment for NSCLC, we have developed a protocol for a post-market clinical study to be conducted by a leading cancer clinician in the context of the current approval in China. 

&#160; 

We plan to conduct this trial in collaboration with Guangxi Wuzhou Pharmaceutical Group Co. Ltd. (Guangxi Wuzhou Pharma). Under the terms of our collaboration agreement with Guangxi Wuzhou Pharma, we are responsible for establishing protocols for and conducting clinical trials and Guangxi Wuzhou Pharma is responsible for the costs associated with clinical trials conducted in China. Our goal is to initiate this clinical trial as soon as practicable with the aim of developing new data to support product growth in China and to establish clinical proof of concept to expand our drug development efforts with VAL-083. 

&#160; 

&#160; 17 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Conducting this clinical trial in China under our collaboration agreement with Guangxi Wuzhou Pharma will allow us to enhance the potential value of VAL-083 without significantly increasing our own planned cash expenditures. We also believe that these new data will support the potential to establish global partnerships and collaborations with larger pharmaceutical companies who have the resources and commercial infrastructure to effectively develop and commercialize VAL-083 as a treatment for NSCLC on a world-wide basis. 

&#160; 

VAL-083 in Pediatric Brain Cancers 

&#160; 

In November 2015 at AACR&#8217;s - Advances in Pediatric Research: From Mechanisms and Models to Treatment and Survivorship we presented data indicating that VAL-083 offers potential therapeutic alternatives in the treatment of pediatric brain tumors. In March 2016 the FDA Office of Orphan Products Development (OOPD) granted orphan drug designation for VAL-083 in the treatment of medulloblastoma. 

&#160; 

VAL-083 in Ovarian Cancers 

&#160; 

We have been researching the potential of VAL-083 as a treatment for ovarian cancer in collaboration with researchers at MD Anderson Cancer Center. In October 2015 at the AACR&#8217;s Advances in Ovarian Cancer Research: Exploiting Vulnerabilities Conference and in September 2016, we presented additional data at the 11 th Biennial Ovarian Cancer Research Symposium on this collaboration. These data demonstrate the effectiveness of VAL-083 against cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancers and raise the potential for VAL-083 as a treatment for ovarian cancers as a single-agent against platinum-resistant tumors or in combination with platinum-based chemotherapeutic regimens or in combination with PARP inhibitors. In April 2016 the FDA OOPD also granted orphan drug designation for VAL-083 in the treatment of ovarian cancer.

&#160;

We plan to work with our advisors to develop a strategy to advance VAL-083 into clinical trials for the treatment of ovarian cancer, either as a single-agent or as in combination with other approved agents.

&#160; 

Additional Indications 

&#160; 

In historical studies sponsored by the NCI in the United States, VAL-083 exhibited clinical activity against a range of tumor types including central nervous system tumors, solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. VAL-083 is approved in China for the treatment of CML and lung cancer. We have established new non-clinical data supporting the activity of VAL-083 in different types of cancer that are resistant to modern targeted therapies and we believe that the unique cytotoxic mechanism of VAL-083 may provide benefit to patients in a range of indications. We intend to continue to research these opportunities, and if appropriate, expand our clinical development efforts to include additional indications. 

&#160; 

VAL-083 Target Markets 

&#160; 

2014 world -wide revenues Non-small cell lung cancer &#160; $6.8 B &#160; &#160; &#160; Glioma &#160; $1.0 B &#160; &#160; &#160; Ovarian cancer &#160; &#62;$500 M &#160; &#160; &#160; Pediatric medulloblastoma &#160; orphan &#160; &#160; &#160; Source: Evaluate Pharma &#160;

We are targeting cancer indications which we believe represent market opportunities in the hundreds of millions of dollars in North America and potentially in the billions of dollars worldwide. The pharmaceutical industry, in general, is a highly profitable, highly innovative industry. According to a report published by Statistic, the global pharmaceutical industry generated nearly one trillion dollars in revenue during 2013. 

&#160; 

Glioblastoma Multiforme 

&#160; 

Newly diagnosed patients suffering from GBM are initially treated through invasive brain surgery, although disease progression following surgical resection is nearly 100%. Temozolomide (Temodar &#174; ) in combination with radiation is the front-line therapy for GBM following surgery. Temodar &#174; currently generates more than $950 million annually in global revenues even though most patients fail to gain long-term therapeutic benefits. Approximately 60% of GBM patients treated with Temodar &#174; experience tumor progression within one year. 

&#160; 

&#160; 18 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Bevacizumab (Avastin &#174; ) has been approved for the treatment of GBM in patients failing Temodar &#174; . In clinical studies, only about 20% of patients failing Temodar &#174; respond to Avastin &#174; therapy. In spite of these low efficacy results, treatment of GBM in North America alone is projected to add $200 million annually to the revenues of Avastin &#174; with projected growth in GBM to $650 million by 2016. 

&#160; 

Approximately 48% of patients who are diagnosed with GBM will fail both front-line therapy and Avastin &#174; . Based on disease incidence, we believe the market for treating GBM patients the post-Avastin &#174; failure exceeds $200 million annually in North America. Subject to successfully completing clinical trials and obtaining approval by the FDA and other applicable regulatory agencies globally, we also believe that VAL-083 could potentially generate sales in excess of $1 billion worldwide as a potential front-line therapy for GBM. 

&#160; 

Lung Cancer &#160; 

&#160; 

The potential of VAL-083 in the treatment of NSLSC has been established in both human clinical trials conducted by the NCI and by the drug&#8217;s commercial approval in China. Lung cancer is the most common cancer in the world with 1.8 million cases in 2012, representing 13% of all cancers according to a report published by the World Cancer Research Fund International. Lung cancer has a higher mortality rate than the next top three cancers combined and it is responsible for 1.6 million deaths annually, representing 19% of all cancer deaths. NSCLC represents approximately 90% of newly diagnosed lung cancers. A report published by Transparency Market Research states that the global NSCLC drug market will increase from $4.3 billion in 2009 to $6.9 billion in 2019 and the market is growing with a CAGR of 4.84% during 2009 to 2019. 

&#160; 

Ovarian Cancer 

&#160; 

According to Evaluate Pharma, the annual market for ovarian cancer therapies is expected to reach approximately $570 million in 2016, and is projected grow to more than $3.5 billion in 2022. The American Cancer Society estimates that approximately 22,000 women will receive a new diagnosis of ovarian cancer and approximately 14,000 women will die from ovarian cancer in the United States each year. Ovarian cancer ranks fifth in cancer deaths among women, accounting for more deaths than any other cancer of the female reproductive system. 

&#160; 

The potential of VAL-083 in the treatment of ovarian cancer has been established in prior NCI-sponsored clinical trials and by our recent research. Ovarian cancers are commonly treated with a platinum-based chemotherapy regimen. Initial tumor response rates are relatively high. However, up to 75% of ovarian cancer patients who respond to initial treatment will relapse within approximately 18 months after completing first-line therapy. In published studies, median survival in platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer patients ranged from six to nine months. Our research suggests that the VAL-083 may offer a potential treatment option for ovarian cancer patients are resistant to platinum-based chemotherapy and as a potential combination therapy with other agents. The US FDA Office of Orphan Products Division has granted orphan drug status VAL-083 a potential treatment for ovarian cancer. 

&#160; 

Leukemia &#160; 

&#160; 

The potential of VAL-083 in the treatment of CML has been established in both human clinical trials conducted by the NCI and by the drug&#8217;s commercial approval in China. The Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Gleevec &#174; is currently used as front-line therapy in the treatment of CML achieved global revenue in excess of $4.7 billion annually in 2012. We believe that VAL-083 has potential to capture a portion of the CML market through demonstration of activity in TKI-resistant CML patients. We also believe that VAL-083 may offer significant commercial opportunities through the treatment of other types of blood cancer such as AML or ALL. 

&#160;

VAL-083 Manufacturing 

&#160; 

VAL-083 is currently manufactured for our research and early-stage clinical trials in accordance with CFDA and Chinese Pharmacopoeia guidelines to ensure drug quality control, drug use safety, and drug efficacy. Approval by the FDA will require VAL-083 and other products developed by us to be manufactured in accordance with United States Pharmacopeia (&#8220;USP&#8221;) in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practices (&#8220;cGMP&#8221;) regulations. We plan to use an established cGMP manufacturer for our Phase III clinical trial. cGMP provides for systems that assure proper design, monitoring, and control of manufacturing processes and facilities. Adherence to the cGMP regulations assures the identity, strength, quality, and purity of drug products by requiring that manufacturers of medications adequately control manufacturing operations. 

&#160; 

We have established an exclusive purchasing relationship with a Chinese manufacturer that has enabled us to obtain drug product for human clinical trials in the United States and certain commercial rights in China. The Chinese manufacturer has established a commercial-scale manufacturing process based on the North American process originally developed for the NCI. 

&#160; 

Ensuring a viable long-term supply of the VAL-083 drug product suitable for registration and commercialization in North America and Europe will require investment in improved manufacturing and quality controls. We will seek to build upon our expertise and our intellectual property related to the existing manufacturing processes for VAL-083 in collaboration with the current manufacturer to allow compliance with cGMP. In addition, we have identified third party contract manufacturers with the capabilities to establish the processes, procedures and quality systems necessary to meet U.S., Canadian, E.U. and other international cGMP manufacturing requirements. Such requirements include strong quality management systems, obtaining appropriate quality raw materials, establishing robust operating procedures, detecting and investigating product quality deviations, and maintaining reliable testing laboratories. 

&#160; 

We plan to use an established third party manufacturer for our Phase III clinical trial.

Pursuant to a memorandum of understanding and collaboration agreement, dated October 25, 2012, we have established a strategic collaboration with Guangxi Wuzhou Pharmaceutical Company (&#8220;Guangxi Wuzhou Pharmaceuticals&#8221;), a subsidiary of publicly traded Guangxi Wuzhou Zhongheng Group Co., Ltd. (SHG: 600252) (the &#8220;Guangxi Agreement&#8221;). VAL-083 is approved for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (&#8220;CML&#8221;) and lung cancer in China and Guangxi Wuzhou Pharmaceuticals is the only manufacturer licensed by the CFDA to produce the product for the China market. Through the Guangxi Agreement, we have obtained drug product for our VAL-083 clinical trials in the United States and we have also secured certain commercial rights in China. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the Guangxi Agreement, we granted to Guangxi Wuzhou Pharmaceuticals a royalty-free license to certain of our intellectual property, as it relates to quality control and drug production methods for VAL-083, and we agreed that Guangxi Wuzhou Pharmaceuticals will be our exclusive supplier of VAL-083 for clinical trials and commercial sales, subject to Guangxi Wuzhou Pharmaceuticals obtaining and maintaining cGMP certification by the FDA, EMA or other applicable regulatory agencies, and Guangxi Wuzhou Pharmaceuticals being able to meet volumes ordered by us. The Company and Guangxi Wuzhou Pharmaceuticals will work together to ensure the product specifications meet global standards in order to accelerate international development and regulatory approval. Guangxi Wuzhou Pharmaceuticals will be our exclusive supplier of VAL-083 for clinical development and commercial sales, subject to its meeting and maintaining required regulatory certification. In accordance with this agreement, we plan to contract an established third party manufacturer for our Phase III clinical trials. We will continue to work with Guangxi Wuzhou Pharmaceuticals to work towards FDA compliance in order to potentially have them as our future supplier for global sales of VAL-083. 

&#160; 

This Guangxi Agreement also provides us with certain exclusive commercial rights related to drug supply. Specifically, the Guangxi Agreement establishes an exclusive supply relationship between us and Guangxi Wuzhou Pharmaceuticals for the Chinese market and all markets outside China. Guangxi Wuzhou Pharmaceuticals agreed that it may not sell VAL-083 for markets outside of China to any other purchaser other than us. In addition, Guangxi Wuzhou Pharmaceuticals granted us a pre-emptive right in China (subject to our acceptance of proposed sales volume and prices) to purchase VAL-083 produced by Guangxi Wuzhou Pharmaceuticals. 

&#160; 

&#160; 20 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Our collaboration with Guangxi Wuzhou Pharmaceuticals positions us with the potential to generate future revenue through product sales or royalties for its approved indications in China while we seek global approval in new indications. 

&#160; 

Our strategy in China is to work in collaboration with Guangxi Wuzhou Pharmaceuticals and globally recognized clinical investigators to develop new clinical and non-clinical data in collaboration with leading cancer researchers. We believe these data, if favorable, will allow the repositioning and sales growth of VAL-083 in the China market under its approved indications and provide us with clinical proof-of-concept to support global development of VAL-083 for the treatment of hematologic cancers and lung cancer. 

&#160; 

We and Guangxi Wuzhou Pharmaceuticals have formed a clinical advisory board to oversee clinical studies conducted in China. Under the terms of the Guangxi Agreement, Guangxi Wuzhou Pharmaceuticals will provide funding support for clinical trials conducted in China and we are responsible for development and commercialization. We anticipate establishing sales channels in China through a third-party marketing partner in collaboration with Guangxi Wuzhou Pharmaceuticals in order to obtain sales or royalty revenue from that market. 

&#160; 

The term of the Guangxi Agreement (except as it relates to the exclusive rights in the China market) is indefinite, subject to termination upon written agreement of all parties, or if either party breaches any material term and fails to remedy such breach within 30 days of receipt of notice of the breach, or if any action to be taken thereunder is not agreed to by both parties, provided that such matter is referred to the chief executive officer of both parties, and they are unable to resolve such matter within 90 days. No payments have been made to date under the Guangxi Agreement. 

&#160; 

The protection of intellectual property rights in China (where VAL-083 is manufactured pursuant to the Guangxi Agreement with the only manufacturer presently licensed by the CFDA to produce the product for the China market, and where VAL-083 is approved for the treatment of CML and lung cancer) is relatively weak compared to the United States, which may negatively affect our ability to generate revenue from VAL-083 

&#160; 

Patents and Proprietary Rights 

&#160; 

Our success will depend in part on our ability to protect our existing product candidate and the products we acquire or license by obtaining and maintaining a strong proprietary position. To develop and maintain our position, we intend to continue relying upon patent protection, orphan drug status, Hatch-Waxman exclusivity, trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities. 

&#160; 

We have filed patent applications claiming the use of, and improvements related to VAL-083. Our patent filings also include proposed treatment regimens, improvements to the manufacturing process, formulation and composition of the active pharmaceutical ingredient, and finished dosage forms of VAL-083. We are prosecuting our patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions which we deem important for the potential commercial success of VAL-083.

&#160; 24 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#9679; Series IX is generally directed to the use of VAL-083 to treat non-small-cell lung cancer. &#160; 

Patent or Patent Application No. &#160; Title &#160; Expiry PCT Patent Application Serial No. PCT/US2015/059814 &#160; Use of Dianhydrogalactitol and Analogs or Derivatives Thereof, Together With Radiation, to Treat Non Small-Cell Carcinoma of the Lung and Glioblastoma Multiforme and Suppress Proliferation of Cancer Stem Cells &#160; 2035 &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Series X-XIII &#8211;Provisional U.S. patent applications &#160; 

Patent or Patent Application No. &#160; Title &#160; Expiry &#160; &#160; Four provisional U.S. patent applications have been filed &#160; &#160; &#160; 

One of the inventors listed in our Series IX applications is an employee of the University of California, San Francisco. If a patent issues from that provisional application with a claim that the University of California employee conceived of, in whole or in part, then the Regents of the University of California will share ownership of any such patent with us. Our research agreements with the University of California address this issue by providing the Company with an exclusive option, for a limited period of time, to negotiate a royalty-bearing exclusive license for commercialization of the invention covered by that patent. 

&#160; 

In addition to patent protection, we may also seek orphan drug status whenever it is available. If a product which has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first regulatory approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan exclusivity, meaning that the applicable regulatory authority may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for a period of seven years in the U.S. and Canada, and 10 years in the E.U. Orphan drug designation does not prevent competitors from developing or marketing different drugs for the same indication or the same drug for a different clinical indication. 

&#160; 

In February 2012, we announced that the FDA had granted orphan drug status to VAL-083 for the treatment of glioma. In January 2013, the EMA also granted orphan drug protection to VAL-083 for the treatment of glioma. In the spring of 2016, the FDA Office of Orphan Products Development granted orphan drug designations to VAL-083 for the treatment of ovarian cancer and medulloblastoma. 

&#160; 

Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, newly approved drugs and indications benefit from a statutory period of non-patent marketing exclusivity. These amendments provide five-year data exclusivity to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity, meaning that the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active ingredient. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments prohibit the submission of an abbreviated new drug application, also known as an ANDA or generic drug application, during the five-year exclusive period if no patent is listed. If there is a patent listed and the ANDA applicant certifies that the NDA holder&#8217;s listed patent for the product is invalid or will not be infringed, the ANDA can be submitted four years after NDA approval. Protection under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments will not prevent the filing or approval of another full NDA; however, the applicant would be required to conduct its own pre-clinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments also provide three years of data exclusivity for the approval of NDAs with new clinical trials for previously approved drugs and supplemental NDAs, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug, if new clinical investigations were conducted by or on behalf of the sponsor and were essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity covers only the new changes associated with the supplemental NDA and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active ingredient. We intend to rely on the Hatch-Waxman Amendments for five years of data exclusivity for VAL-083. 

&#160; 

We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. We believe that the substantial costs and resources required to develop technological innovations, such as the manufacturing processes associated with VAL-083, will help us to protect the competitive advantage of our product candidate. 

&#160; 

&#160; 25 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The protection of intellectual property rights in China (where our clinical product candidate, VAL-083, is manufactured pursuant to a collaboration agreement with the only manufacturer presently licensed by the CFDA to produce the product for the China market, and where VAL-03 is approved for the treatment of CML and lung cancer) is relatively weak compared to the United States, which may negatively affect our ability to generate revenue from VAL-083 in China. 

&#160; 

Our policy is to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual&#8217;s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual shall be our exclusive property. 

&#160; 

Government Regulation and Product Approval 

&#160; 

Regulation by governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries is a significant factor, affecting the cost and time of our research and product development activities, and will be a significant factor in the manufacture and marketing of any approved products. All of our products require regulatory approval by governmental agencies prior to commercialization. In particular, our products are subject to rigorous pre-clinical and clinical testing and other approval requirements by the FDA and similar regulatory authorities in other countries. Various statutes and regulations also govern or influence the manufacturing, safety, reporting, labeling, transport and storage, record keeping and marketing of our products. The lengthy process of seeking these approvals, and the subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial resources. Any failure by us to obtain, or any delay in obtaining, the necessary regulatory approvals could harm our business. 

&#160; 

The regulatory requirements relating to the testing, manufacturing and marketing of our products may change from time to time and this may impact our ability to conduct clinical trials and the ability of independent investigators to conduct their own research with support from us. 

&#160; 

The clinical development, manufacturing and marketing of our products are subject to regulation by various authorities in the U.S., the E.U. and other countries, including, in the U.S., the FDA, in Canada, Health Canada, and, in the E.U., the EMA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act in the U.S. and numerous directives, regulations, local laws and guidelines in Canada and the E.U. govern the testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of our products. Product development and approval within these regulatory frameworks takes a number of years and involves the expenditure of substantial resources. 

&#160; 

Regulatory approval will be required in all the major markets in which we seek to develop our products. At a minimum, approval requires the generation and evaluation of data relating to the quality, safety, and efficacy of an investigational product for its proposed use. The specific types of data required and the regulations relating to this data will differ depending on the territory, the drug involved, the proposed indication and the stage of development. 

&#160; 

In general, new chemical entities are tested in animals until adequate evidence of safety is established to support the proposed clinical study protocol designs. Clinical trials for new products are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap. In Phase I, the initial introduction of the pharmaceutical into either healthy human volunteers or patients with the disease (20 to 50 subjects), the emphasis is on testing for safety (adverse effects), dosage tolerance, metabolism, distribution, excretion and clinical pharmacology. Phase II involves studies in a limited patient population (50 to 200 patients) to determine the initial efficacy of the pharmaceutical for specific targeted indications, to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Once a compound shows preliminary evidence of some effectiveness and is found to have an acceptable safety profile in Phase II evaluations, Phase III trials are undertaken to more fully evaluate clinical outcomes in a larger patient population in adequate and well-controlled studies designed to yield statistically sufficient clinical data to demonstrate efficacy and safety. 

&#160; 

&#160; 26 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

In the U.S., specific pre-clinical data, manufacturing and chemical data, as described above, need to be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND application, which, unless the FDA objects, will become effective 30 days following receipt by the FDA. Phase I studies in human volunteers may commence only after the application becomes effective. Prior regulatory approval for human healthy volunteer studies is also required in member states of the E.U. Currently, in each member state of the E.U., following successful completion of Phase I studies, data are submitted in summarized format to the applicable regulatory authority in the member state in respect of applications for the conduct of later Phase II studies. The regulatory authorities in the E.U. typically have between one and three months in which to raise any objections to the proposed study, and they often have the right to extend this review period at their discretion. In the U.S., following completion of Phase I studies, further submissions to regulatory authorities are necessary in relation to Phase II and III studies to update the existing IND. Authorities may require additional data before allowing the studies to commence and could demand that the studies be discontinued at any time if there are significant safety issues. In addition to the regulatory review, a study involving human subjects has to be approved by an independent body. The exact composition and responsibilities of this body will differ from country to country. In the U.S., for example, each study will be conducted under the auspices of an independent institutional review board at each institution at which the study is conducted. This board considers among other things, the design of the study, ethical factors, the privacy of protected health information as defined under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the safety of the human subjects and the possible liability risk for the institution. Equivalent rules to protect subjects&#8217; rights and welfare apply in each member state of the E.U. where one or more independent ethics committees, which typically operate similarly to an institutional review board, will review the ethics of conducting the proposed research. Other regulatory authorities around the rest of the world have slightly differing requirements involving both the execution of clinical trials and the import/export of pharmaceutical products. It is our responsibility to ensure we conduct our business in accordance with the regulations of each relevant territory. 

&#160; 

By leveraging existing pre-clinical and clinical data, we are seeking build upon an existing pre-clinical and clinical safety and efficacy database to accelerate our research. In addition, our focus on end-stage population which has no current treatment options, commercialization may be achieved in an accelerated manner. Approval by the FDA in this category generally has been based on objective response rates and duration of responses rather than demonstration of survival benefit. As a result, trials of drugs to treat end-stage refractory cancer indications have historically involved fewer patients and generally have been faster to complete than trials of drugs for other indications. We are aware that the FDA and other similar agencies are regularly reviewing the use of objective endpoints for commercial approval and that policy changes may impact the size of trials required for approval, timelines and expenditures significantly. 

&#160; 

In order to gain marketing approval, we must submit a dossier to the relevant authority for review, which is known in the U.S. as an NDA and in the E.U. as a marketing authorization application, or MAA. The format is usually specific and laid out by each authority, although in general it will include information on the quality of the chemistry, manufacturing and pharmaceutical aspects of the product as well as the non-clinical and clinical data. Once the submitted NDA is accepted for filing by the FDA, it undertakes the review process that takes 10 months, unless an expedited priority review is granted which takes six months to complete. Approval can take several months to several years, if multiple 10-month review cycles are needed before final approval is obtained, if at all. 

&#160; 

The approval process can be affected by a number of factors. The NDA may be approvable requiring additional pre-clinical, manufacturing data or clinical trials which may be requested at the end of the 10 month NDA review cycle, thereby delaying marketing approval until the additional data are submitted and may involve substantial unbudgeted costs. The regulatory authorities usually will conduct an inspection of relevant manufacturing facilities, and review manufacturing procedures, operating systems and personnel qualifications. In addition to obtaining approval for each product, in many cases each drug manufacturing facility must be approved. Further inspections may occur over the life of the product. An inspection of the clinical investigation sites by a competent authority may be required as part of the regulatory approval procedure. As a condition of marketing approval, the regulatory agency may require post-marketing surveillance to monitor for adverse effects or other additional studies as deemed appropriate. After approval for the initial indication, further clinical studies are usually necessary to gain approval for any additional indications. The terms of any approval, including labeling content, may be more restrictive than expected and could affect the marketability of a product. 

&#160; 

The FDA offers a number of regulatory mechanisms that provide expedited or accelerated approval procedures for selected drugs in the indications on which we are focusing our efforts. These include accelerated approval under Subpart H of the agency&#8217;s NDA approval regulations, fast track drug development procedures and priority review. At this time, we have not determined whether any of these approval procedures will apply to our current drug candidate. 

&#160; 

&#160; 27 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The U.S., E.U. and other jurisdictions may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a &#8220;rare disease or condition,&#8221; which, in the U.S., is generally a disease or condition that affects no more than 200,000 individuals. In the E.U., orphan drug designation can be granted if: the disease is life threatening or chronically debilitating and affects no more than 50 in 100,000 persons in the E.U.; without incentive it is unlikely that the drug would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment; and no satisfactory method of treatment for the condition exists or, if it does, the new drug will provide a significant benefit to those affected by the condition. If a product that has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first regulatory approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan exclusivity, meaning that the applicable regulatory authority may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for a period of seven years in the U.S. and 10 years in the E.U. Orphan drug designation does not prevent competitors from developing or marketing different drugs for the same indication or the same drug for different indications. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or MAA. After orphan drug designation is granted, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are publicly disclosed. Orphan drug designation does not convey an advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the review and approval process. However, this designation provides an exemption from marketing and authorization (NDA) fees. 

&#160; 

We are also subject to numerous environmental and safety laws and regulations, including those governing the use and disposal of hazardous materials. The cost of compliance with and any violation of these regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations, accidental contamination or injury from these materials may occur. Compliance with laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures or our competitive position. However, we are not able to predict the extent of government regulation, and the cost and effect thereof on our competitive position, which might result from any legislative or administrative action pertaining to environmental or safety matters. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The development and commercialization of new drugs is highly competitive and we may face competition from established pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as from academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions worldwide. 

&#160; 

Various products currently are marketed for the treatment of GBM and other cancers that we may target with our product candidate and a number of companies are developing new treatments. Companies also developing products for GBM include but are not limited to Celgene Corp., Celldex Therapeutics, Northwest Biotherapeutics, Inc., Immunocellular Therapeutics Ltd., and many major pharmaceutical companies. Our success will be based in part on our ability to build and actively manage a portfolio of drugs that addresses unmet medical needs and create value in patient therapy. 

&#160; 

Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, pre-clinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. Our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer side effects or are less expensive than products that we may develop. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies and technology licenses complementary to our programs or advantageous to our business. 

&#160; 

We expect that our ability to compete effectively will depend upon our ability to: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; successfully and rapidly complete adequate and well-controlled clinical trials that demonstrate statistically significant safety and efficacy and to obtain all requisite regulatory approvals in a cost-effective manner; &#160; 

&#160; 28 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; maintain a proprietary position for our manufacturing processes and other technology; &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; produce our products in accordance with United States FDA and international regulatory guidelines; &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; attract and retain key personnel; and &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; build an adequate sales and marketing infrastructure for any approved products. &#160; 

Failure to do one or more of these activities could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Corporate History 

&#160; 

DelMar Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is a Nevada corporation formed on June 24, 2009 under the name Berry Only Inc. Prior to the Reverse Acquisition (discussed below), Berry did not have any significant assets or operations. On January 21, 2013, the Company changed its name to DelMar Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 

&#160; 

On January 25, 2013 (the &#8220;Closing Date&#8221;), the Company entered into and closed an exchange agreement (the &#8220;Exchange Agreement&#8221;), with DelMar (BC), 0959454 B.C. Ltd., a British Columbia corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (&#8220;Callco&#8221;), 0959456 B.C. Ltd., a British Columbia corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (&#8220;Exchangeco&#8221;), and securityholders of DelMar (BC). Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, (i) the Company issued 1,085,104 shares of common stock (the &#8220;Parent Shares&#8221;) to the shareholders of DelMar (BC) who are United States residents (the &#8220;U.S. Holders&#8221;) in exchange for the transfer to Exchangeco of all 1,085,104 outstanding common shares of DelMar (BC) held by the U.S. Holders, (ii) the shareholders of DelMar (BC) who are Canadian residents (the &#8220;Canadian Holders&#8221;) received, in exchange for the transfer to Exchangeco of all 2,182,396 outstanding common shares of DelMar (BC) held by the Canadian Holders, 2,182,396 exchangeable shares (the &#8220;Exchangeable Shares&#8221;) of Exchangeco, and (iii) outstanding warrants to purchase 3,360,000 common shares of DelMar (BC) and outstanding options to purchase 1,020,000 common shares of DelMar (BC) were deemed to be amended such that, rather than entitling the holder to acquire common shares of DelMar (BC), such options and warrants (as amended, the &#8220;Exchange Agreement Warrants&#8221;) will entitle the holders to acquire shares of common stock of the Company. The Canadian Holders will be entitled to require Exchangeco to redeem (or, at the option of the Company or Callco, to have the Company or Callco purchase) the Exchangeable Shares, and upon such redemption or purchase to receive an equal number of shares of common stock of the Company. 

&#160; 

Effective on the Closing Date, pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, DelMar (BC) became (indirectly through Exchangeco) a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The acquisition of DelMar (BC) is treated as a reverse acquisition (the &#8220;Reverse Acquisition&#8221;), and the business of DelMar (BC) became the business of the Company. At the time of the Reverse Acquisition, Berry was not engaged in any active business 

&#160; 

On May 20, 2016, the Company effected a 1-for-4 reverse split of its common stock. All share amounts in this report give effect to the reverse split unless otherwise indicated. 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

During the year ended June 30, 2016, we recognized $3,360,878 in research and development expenses. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

We have four full-time employees and retain the services of approximately 15 persons on an independent contractor/consultant and contract-employment basis. As such, we currently operate in a &#8220;virtual&#8221; corporate structure in order to minimize fixed personnel costs. Over time, we plan to establish a base of full time employees and corporate infrastructure.
