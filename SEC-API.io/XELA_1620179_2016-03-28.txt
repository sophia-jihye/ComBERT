 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160;

Quinpario Acquisition Corp. 2 (the &#8220;Company&#8221; or &#8220;we&#8221;) is a blank check company formed on July 15, 2014 for the purpose of entering into a merger, stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities. The Company&#8217;s efforts in identifying a prospective target business is not limited to a particular industry or geographic region, although we are currently focusing our search for target businesses that operate in the specialty chemicals and performance materials industries. 

&#160;

On January 22, 2015, we closed our initial public offering of 35,000,000 units, with each unit consisting of one share of common stock, par value $.0001 per share (&#8220;Common Stock&#8221;), and one warrant (&#8220;Warrant&#8221;) entitling the holder to purchase one-half of one share of common stock at a price of $5.75 per half share commencing 30 days after the completion of an initial business combination. Simultaneous with the consummation of the initial public offering, we consummated the private placement of 18,000,000 warrants (&#8220;Private Placement Warrants&#8221;) at a price of $0.50 per Private Placement Warrant, generating total proceeds of $9,000,000. The Private Placement Warrants were purchased by our sponsor, Quinpario Partners 2, LLC.

&#160;

Business Strategy 

&#160;

Our management team is focusing on acquiring companies that will increase stockholder value by growing revenue (through organic growth and acquisitions) and improving the efficiency of business operations of the acquired company. We are currently focusing primarily on acquiring companies valued between $700 million and $2 billion of enterprise value. We believe that the acquisition and operation of an established business will provide a foundation from which to build a diversified business platform. Consistent with this strategy, we believe the following general criteria and guidelines are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter into a business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines.

&#160;

&#160; &#9679; Opportunities for Platform Growth : We intend to acquire one or more businesses or assets that we can grow both organically and through acquisitions. Particularly in regard to the specialty chemicals and performance materials industries, we may consider those sectors that complement our management team&#8217;s background, such as composites and carbon fibers, filtration and biomaterials, alternative energy and storage, specialty films and packaging, ceramics and inorganics, plastics and compounds, electronic chemicals and materials, specialty resins and plastics, chemicals and additives, and specialty fluids and lubricants. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; History of and Potential for Strong Free Cash Flow Generation : We intend to acquire one or more businesses that have the potential to generate strong free cash flow (i.e., companies that typically generate cash in excess of that required to maintain or expand the business&#8217; asset base). We are focusing on businesses that have recurring revenue streams and low working capital and capital expenditure requirements. We may also seek to prudently leverage this cash flow in order to enhance stockholder value. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Established Companies with Proven Track Records : We are seeking to acquire established companies, particularly those focused on industries connected to the specialty chemicals and performance materials industries with sound historical financial performance. We typically focus on companies with a history of strong operating and financial results. Although we are not restricted from doing so, we do not currently intend to acquire start-up companies. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Experienced and Motivated Management Teams : We are seeking to acquire businesses that have strong, experienced management teams with a substantial personal economic stake in the performance of the acquired business. We are currently focusing on management teams with a proven track record of driving revenue growth, enhancing profitability and generating strong free cash flow. We also intend to focus on companies where we expect that the operating expertise of our officers and directors will complement the target&#8217;s management team. &#160;

&#160; 2 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#9679; Strong Competitive Industry Position : We are seeking to acquire businesses focused on the specialty chemicals and performance materials industries that have strong fundamentals, although we may acquire businesses in other industries. The factors we may consider include growth prospects, competitive dynamics and position, level of consolidation, need for capital investment, potential for improvement and barriers to entry. We focus on companies that have a leading or niche market position. We will likely analyze the strengths and weaknesses of target businesses relative to their competitors, focusing on technology, global positioning, product quality and services, customer loyalty, cost impediments associated with customers switching to competitors, intellectual property protection and brand positioning. We also intend seek to acquire one or more businesses that demonstrate advantages or have the potential to become advantaged when compared to their competitors, which may help to protect their market position and profitability. &#160;

These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant.

&#160;

Competitive Advantages

&#160;

We believe our competitive strengths to be the following: 

&#160;

Status as a Public Company 

&#160;

We believe our structure will make us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination. In this situation, the owners of the target business would exchange their shares in the target business for our shares or for a combination of shares and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. We believe target businesses might find this method a more certain and cost effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. In a typical initial public offering, there are additional expenses incurred in marketing, roadshow and public reporting efforts that will likely not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us. Furthermore, once the business combination is consummated, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters&#8217; ability to complete the offering as well as general market conditions that could prevent the offering from occurring. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with stockholders&#8217; interests than it would have as a privately-held company. It can offer further benefits by augmenting a company&#8217;s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees. 

&#160;

While we believe that our status as a public company will make us an attractive business partner, some potential target businesses may view the inherent limitations in our status as a blank check company as a deterrent and may prefer to effect a business combination with a more established entity or with a private company. 

&#160;

Financial position 

&#160;

With funds held in trust available for our initial business combination of approximately $350,000,000 (including $12,250,000 of deferred underwriting commissions), we offer a target business a variety of options. Having these funds could allow us to structure a business combination where a portion of the consideration payable to owners of a target business is paid in cash. Such funds could also provide capital for the potential growth and expansion of our target&#8217;s operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt burden. Because we are able to consummate our initial business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires.

&#160;

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Management Operating and Investing Experience 

&#160;

Our executive officers all have deep knowledge of the chemicals and performance materials industries, experience in managing global businesses, and experience operating in a public-company environment. Moreover, they have experience with mergers and acquisitions and raising debt and equity capital, including business and financial analysis, negotiations, structuring and execution. A majority of our management team served as executive officers and/or directors of Quinpario Acquisition Corp., or Quinpario 1, which consummated its business combination in June 2014. Additionally, a majority of our executive officers are partners in Quinpario Partners LLC, which is a privately owned investment and operating company founded by our Chairman of the Board, Jeffry N. Quinn, and focused on the specialty chemicals and performance materials sector. Mr. Quinn and his partners formed Quinpario after leaving Solutia Inc. (formerly NYSE: SOA), a global specialty chemical and performance materials company, following its sale to Eastman Chemical Company (NYSE: EMN). All of our executive officers have corporate management experience, extensive operational expertise and significant transactional experience.

&#160;

Effecting a Business Combination 

&#160;

General 

&#160;

We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any substantive commercial business for an indefinite period of time. We intend to utilize cash derived from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the private placement of Private Placement Warrants, our capital stock, debt or a combination of these in effecting our initial business combination. Although substantially all of the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the private placement of Private Placement Warrants are intended to be applied generally toward effecting a business combination as described in this annual report on Form 10-K, or Form 10-K, the proceeds are not otherwise being designated for any more specific purposes. Our initial business combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares, while avoiding what it may deem to be adverse consequences of undertaking a public offering itself. These include time delays, significant expense, loss of voting control and compliance with various Federal and state securities laws. In the alternative, we may seek to consummate a business combination with a company that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth. While we may seek to effect simultaneous business combinations with more than one target business, we will probably have the ability, as a result of our limited resources, to effect only a single business combination.

&#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Sources of Target Businesses 

&#160;

Target business candidates have been, and will be, brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers, venture capital funds, private equity funds, leveraged buyout funds, management buyout funds and other members of the financial community. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read the prospectus for our initial public offering and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as their affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. We may determine to engage the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions on any formal basis, in which event we may pay a finder&#8217;s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm&#8217;s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. 

&#160;

Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of a Business Combination 

&#160;

Subject to the limitation that a target business have a fair market value of at least 80% of the balance in the trust account at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination, as described below in more detail, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting a prospective target business. Except for the general criteria and guidelines set forth above under the caption &#8220; Business Strategy ,&#8221; we have not established any specific attributes or criteria (financial or otherwise) for prospective target businesses. Furthermore, we do not have any specific requirements with respect to the value of a prospective target business as compared to our net assets or the funds held in the trust account. 

&#160;

Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular business combination will be based, to the extent relevant, on the above factors as well as other considerations deemed relevant by our management in effecting a business combination consistent with our business objective. In evaluating a prospective target business, we will conduct an extensive due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and inspection of facilities, as well as review of financial and other information which is made available to us. This due diligence review will be conducted either by our management or by unaffiliated third parties we may engage. 

&#160;

The time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination remain to be determined. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which a business combination is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to us and reduce the amount of capital available to otherwise complete a business combination. 

&#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Fair Market Value of Target Business 

&#160;

Pursuant to Nasdaq listing rules, the target business or businesses that we acquire must collectively have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance of the funds in the trust account (excluding deferred underwriting fees and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination, although we may acquire a target business whose fair market value significantly exceeds 80% of the trust account balance. We currently anticipate structuring a business combination to acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure a business combination where we merge directly with the target business or where we acquire less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, only the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% fair market value test. In order to consummate such an acquisition, we may issue a significant amount of our debt or equity securities to the sellers of such businesses and/or seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities. Since we have no specific business combination under consideration, we have not entered into any such fund raising arrangement and have no current intention of doing so. The fair market value of the target will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community (such as actual and potential sales, earnings, cash flow and/or book value). If our board is not able to independently determine that the target business has a sufficient fair market value, we will obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated, independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions on the type of target business we are seeking to acquire, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We will not be required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions on the type of target business we are seeking to acquire, as to the fair market value if our board of directors independently determines that the target business complies with the 80% threshold. 

&#160;

Lack of Business Diversification 

&#160;

We expect to complete only a single business combination, although this process may entail the simultaneous acquisitions of several operating businesses. Therefore, at least initially, the prospects for our success may be entirely dependent upon the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities which may have the resources to complete several business combinations of entities operating in multiple industries or multiple areas of a single industry, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses. By consummating a business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may: 

&#160;

&#160; &#9679; subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to a business combination, and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; result in our dependency upon the performance of a single operating business or the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services. &#160;

If we determine to simultaneously acquire several businesses and such businesses are owned by different sellers, we will need for each of such sellers to agree that our purchase of its business is contingent on the simultaneous closings of the other acquisitions, which may make it more difficult for us, and delay our ability, to complete the business combination. With multiple acquisitions, we could also face additional risks, including additional burdens and costs with respect to possible multiple negotiations and due diligence investigations (if there are multiple sellers) and the additional risks associated with the subsequent assimilation of the operations and services or products of the acquired companies in a single operating business. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target Business&#8217; Management 

&#160; 

Although we intend to scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting a business combination, we cannot assure you that our assessment of the target business&#8217; management will prove to be correct. In addition, we cannot assure you that the future management will have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of our officers and directors, if any, in the target business following a business combination cannot presently be stated with any certainty. While it is possible that some of our key personnel will remain associated in senior management or advisory positions with us following a business combination, it is unlikely that they will devote their full time efforts to our affairs subsequent to a business combination. Moreover, they would only be able to remain with the company after the consummation of a business combination if they are able to negotiate employment or consulting agreements in connection with the business combination. Such negotiations would take place simultaneously with the negotiation of the business combination and could provide for them to receive compensation in the form of cash payments and/or our securities for services they would render to the company after the consummation of the business combination. Additionally, our officers and directors may not have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business. 

&#160;

Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that any such additional managers we do recruit will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management. 

&#160;

Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve an Initial Business Combination 

&#160;

In connection with any proposed business combination, we will either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), or (2) provide our stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein. If we determine to engage in a tender offer, such tender offer will be structured so that each stockholder may tender all of his, her or its shares rather than some pro rata portion of his, her or its shares. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or will allow stockholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek stockholder approval. Unlike other blank check companies which require stockholder votes and conduct proxy solicitations in conjunction with their initial business combinations and related conversions of public shares for cash upon consummation of such initial business combination even when a vote is not required by law, we will have the flexibility to avoid such stockholder vote and allow our stockholders to sell their shares pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act which regulate issuer tender offers. In that case, we will file tender offer documents with the SEC which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination as is required under the SEC&#8217;s proxy rules. We will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, solely if we seek stockholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination. 

&#160;

We chose our net tangible asset threshold of $5,000,001 to ensure that we would avoid being subject to Rule 419 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. However, if we seek to consummate an initial business combination with a target business that imposes any type of working capital closing condition or requires us to have a minimum amount of funds available from the trust account upon consummation of such initial business combination, our net tangible asset threshold may limit our ability to consummate such initial business combination (as we may be required to have a lesser number of shares converted or sold to us) and may force us to seek third party financing which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. As a result, we may not be able to consummate such initial business combination and we may not be able to locate another suitable target within the applicable time period, if at all. Public shareholders may therefore have to wait until January 22, 2017 in order to be able to receive a pro rata share of the trust account. 

&#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Our sponsor and our officers and directors have agreed (1) to vote any shares of common stock owned by them in favor of any proposed business combination, (2) not to convert any shares of common stock in connection with a stockholder vote to approve a proposed initial business combination and (3) not sell any shares of common stock in any tender in connection with a proposed initial business combination. 

&#160;

None of our officers, directors, sponsor or their affiliates has indicated any intention to purchase units or shares of common stock from persons in the open market or in private transactions. However, if we hold a meeting to approve a proposed business combination and a significant number of stockholders vote, or indicate an intention to vote, against such proposed business combination, our officers, directors, sponsor or their affiliates could make such purchases in the open market or in private transactions in order to influence the vote. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our officers, directors, sponsor and their affiliates will not make purchases of shares of common stock if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act, which are rules designed to stop potential manipulation of a company&#8217;s stock. 

&#160;

Conversion Rights 

&#160;

At any meeting called to approve an initial business combination, any public stockholder, whether voting for or against such proposed business combination, will be entitled to demand that his shares of common stock be converted for a full pro rata portion of the amount then in the trust account (initially $10.00 per share, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes). Alternatively, we may provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares of our common stock to us through a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account. 

&#160;

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of his or any other person with whom he is acting in concert or as a &#8220;group&#8221; (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) will be restricted from seeking conversion rights with respect to 15% or more of the shares of common stock sold in our initial public offering. Accordingly, if you purchase more than 15% of the shares of common stock sold in our initial public offering and our proposed business combination is approved, you will not be able to seek conversion rights with respect to the full amount of your shares and may be forced to hold such additional shares of common stock or sell them in the open market. Such a public stockholder would still be entitled to vote against a proposed business combination with respect to all shares of common stock owned by him or his affiliates. We believe this restriction will prevent stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares before the vote held to approve a proposed business combination and attempt to use the conversion right as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a substantial premium to the then current market price. 

&#160;

Our sponsor, as well as our officers and directors, will not have conversion rights with respect to any shares of common stock owned by them, directly or indirectly. 

&#160;

We may also require public stockholders who wish to convert, whether they are a record holder or hold their shares in &#8220;street name,&#8221; to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent at any time through the vote on the business combination or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Company&#8217;s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder&#8217;s option. 

&#160;

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced delivery process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $45.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders to deliver their shares prior to the vote on the business combination in order to exercise conversion rights. This is because a holder would need to deliver shares to exercise conversion rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. However, in the event we require stockholders to exercise conversion rights prior to the consummation of the proposed business combination and the proposed business combination is not consummated, this may result in an increased cost to stockholders. 

&#160;

Any request to convert such shares once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the vote on the proposed business combination. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share of common stock delivered his certificate in connection with an election of their conversion and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, he may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). 

&#160;

If the initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their conversion rights would not be entitled to convert their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any shares delivered by public holders. 

&#160;

Liquidation if No Business Combination 

&#160;

If we do not complete a business combination by January 22, 2017, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including any interest but net of franchise taxes and income taxes payable with respect to interest earned on the trust account, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption as part of a single integrated transaction, dissolve and liquidate, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors (who have contractually agreed to take such actions to effectuate such dissolution and liquidation), subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. 

&#160;

Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of 100% of our outstanding public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period may be considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the Delaware General Corporation Law intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder&#8217;s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. 

&#160;

Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of 100% of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period is not considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidation distribution. If we are unable to complete a business combination within the prescribed time frame, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders&#8217; rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following our January 22, 2017 deadline and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date. 

&#160;

&#160; 9 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Because we will not be complying with Section 280 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, Section 281(b) of the Delaware General Corporation Law requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent 10 years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. 

&#160;

We will seek to have all third parties (including any vendors or other entities we engage after our initial public offering) and any prospective target businesses enter into valid and enforceable agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account. As a result, the claims that could be made against us will be limited, thereby lessening the likelihood that any claim would result in any liability extending to the trust. We therefore believe that any necessary provision for creditors will be reduced and should not have a significant impact on our ability to distribute the funds in the trust account to our public stockholders. Nevertheless, there is no guarantee that vendors, service providers and prospective target businesses will execute such agreements. In the event that a potential contracted party was to refuse to execute such a waiver, we will execute an agreement with that entity only if our management first determines that we would be unable to obtain, on a reasonable basis, substantially similar services or opportunities from another entity willing to execute such a waiver. Examples of instances where we may engage a third party that refused to execute a waiver would be the engagement of a third party consultant who cannot sign such an agreement due to regulatory restrictions, such as our auditors who are unable to sign due to independence requirements, or whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or a situation in which management does not believe it would be able to find a provider of required services willing to provide the waiver. There is also no guarantee that, even if they execute such agreements with us, they will not seek recourse against the trust account. Quinpario Partners LLC and Mr. Quinn have agreed that they will be liable to pay debts and obligations to target businesses or vendors or other entities that are owed money by us for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to us. However, they may not be able to satisfy their indemnification obligations as we have not required them to retain any assets to provide for their indemnification obligations, nor have we taken any further steps to ensure that they will be able to satisfy any indemnification obligations that arise. Additionally the agreement entered into by Quinpario Partners LLC and Mr. Quinn specifically provides that they will have no liability as to any claimed amounts owed to a target business or vendor or other entity who has executed an agreement with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account. Moreover, they will not be liable to our public stockholders and instead will only have liability to us. As a result, if we liquidate, the per-share distribution from the trust account could be less than $10.00 due to claims or potential claims of creditors. We will distribute to all of our public stockholders, in proportion to their respective equity interests, an aggregate sum equal to the amount then held in the trust account, inclusive of any interest not previously released to us, plus any remaining net assets (subject to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors as described below).

&#160;

We anticipate notifying the trustee of the trust account to begin liquidating such assets promptly after such date and anticipate it will take no more than 10 business days to effectuate such distribution. Our initial stockholders have waived their rights to participate in any liquidation distribution with respect to their shares held prior to the initial public offering, or insider shares. We will pay the costs of any subsequent liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account. If such funds are insufficient, Quinpario Partners LLC has agreed to pay the funds necessary to complete such liquidation (currently anticipated to be no more than approximately $15,000) and has agreed not to seek repayment of such expenses. 

&#160;

&#160; 10 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Our public stockholders shall be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only in the event of our failure to complete our initial business combination in the required time period or if the stockholders seek to have us convert their respective shares of common stock upon a business combination which is actually completed by us or upon an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation relating to stockholders&#8217; rights or pre-business combination activity (including the time within which we have to complete a business combination). In no other circumstances shall a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. 

&#160;

If we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we may not be able to return to our public stockholders at least $10.00 per share. 

&#160;

If we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a &#8220;preferential transfer&#8221; or a &#8220;fraudulent conveyance.&#8221; As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, because we intend to distribute the proceeds held in the trust account to our public stockholders promptly after January 22, 2017, this may be viewed or interpreted as giving preference to our public stockholders over any potential creditors with respect to access to or distributions from our assets. Furthermore, our board may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. Claims may be brought against us for these reasons. 

&#160;

Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation 

&#160;

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains certain requirements and restrictions that will apply to us until the consummation of our initial business combination. If we seek to amend any provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation relating to stockholder&#8217;s rights or pre-business combination activity, we will provide dissenting public stockholders with the opportunity to convert their public shares in connection with any such vote. Our sponsor and officers and directors have agreed to waive any conversion rights with respect to any insider shares and any public shares they may hold in connection with any vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. Specifically, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides, among other things, that:

&#160;

&#160; &#9679; we shall either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), or (2) provide our stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; we will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, solely if we seek stockholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination; &#160;

&#160; 11 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#9679; if our initial business combination is not consummated by January 22, 2017, then our existence will terminate and we will distribute all amounts in the trust account and any net assets remaining outside the trust account on a pro rata basis to all of our public holders of shares of common stock; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; upon the consummation of the initial public offering, $350,000,000 was placed into the trust account; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; we may not consummate any other business combination, merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar transaction prior to our initial business combination; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; prior to our initial business combination, we may not issue (i) any shares of common stock or any securities convertible into common stock, or (ii) any securities that participate in any manner in the proceeds of the trust account, or that vote as a class with the common stock sold in our initial public offering on our initial business combination. &#160;

Competition

&#160;

In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when compared with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there may be numerous potential target businesses that we could acquire with the net proceeds of our initial public offering, our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses may be limited by our available financial resources. 

&#160;

The following also may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses: 

&#160;

&#160; &#9679; our obligation to seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination or engage in a tender offer may delay the completion of a transaction; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; our obligation to convert shares of common stock held by our public stockholders may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; our outstanding warrants, and the potential future dilution they represent; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; our obligation to either repay or issue securities upon conversion of up to $1,500,000 of working capital loans that may be made to us by our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; our obligation to register the resale of the insider shares, as well as the Private Placement Warrants (and underlying securities) and any securities issued to our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates upon conversion of working capital loans. &#160;

Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating our initial business combination. Our management believes, however, that our status as a public entity and potential access to the United States public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privately-held entities having a similar business objective as ours in acquiring a target business with significant growth potential on favorable terms. 

&#160;

If we succeed in effecting a business combination, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target business. Subsequent to our initial business combination, we may not have the resources or ability to compete effectively. 

&#160;

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

We have four executive officers, none of whom is paid a salary by us. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters and intend to devote only as much time as they deem necessary to our affairs. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for the business combination and the stage of the business combination process the company is in. Accordingly, once a suitable target business to acquire has been located, management will spend more time investigating such target business and negotiating and processing the business combination (and consequently spend more time on our affairs) than had been spent prior to locating a suitable target business. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of our initial business combination.
