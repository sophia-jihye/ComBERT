 Item 1. Business &#160;

Business Overview 

&#160;

We are a leading national provider of freestanding, fixed-site outpatient diagnostic imaging services in the United States based on number of locations and annual imaging revenue. At December 31, 2015, we operated directly or indirectly through joint ventures with hospitals, 300 centers located in California, Delaware, Florida, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, and Rhode Island. Our centers provide physicians with imaging capabilities to facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of diseases and disorders and may reduce unnecessary invasive procedures, often reducing the cost and amount of care for patients. Our services include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET), nuclear medicine, mammography, ultrasound, diagnostic radiology (X-ray), fluoroscopy and other related procedures. The vast majority of our centers offer multi-modality imaging services, a key point of differentiation from our competitors. Our multi-modality strategy diversifies revenue streams, reduces exposure to reimbursement changes and provides patients and referring physicians one location to serve the needs of multiple procedures.

&#160;

We seek to develop leading positions in regional markets in order to leverage operational efficiencies. Our scale and density within selected geographies provide close, long-term relationships with key payors, radiology groups and referring physicians. Each of our center-level and regional operations teams is responsible for managing relationships with local physicians and payors, meeting our standards of patient service and maintaining profitability. We provide training programs, standardized policies and procedures and sharing of best practices among the physicians in our regional networks.

&#160;

In addition to our imaging services, one of our subsidiaries, eRAD, Inc., develops and sells computerized systems for the imaging industry, including Picture Archiving Communications Systems (&#8220;PACS&#8221;). Another one of our subsidiaries, Imaging On Call LLC, provides teleradiology services for remote interpretation of images on behalf of radiology groups, hospitals and imaging center customers. Teleradiology is the process of transmitting radiological patient images, such as X-rays, CTs, and MRIs, from one location to another for the purposes of interpretation and/or consultation. Teleradiology allows radiologists to provide services without actually having to be at the location of the patient and allows trained specialists to be available 24/7. In addition to providing alternative revenue sources for us, the capabilities of both eRAD and Imaging On Call are designed to make the RadNet imaging center operations more efficient and cost effective.

&#160;

In December 2015 we entered into a multi-year strategic relationship with Imaging Advantage LLC. We will collaborate to develop business models to deliver radiology services. In addition, the State of Qatar selected RadNet to help direct Screen for Life, a public-private partnership with the Qatari government to provide screening services as part its national health strategy.

&#160;

We derive substantially all of our revenue from fees charged for the diagnostic imaging services performed at our facilities. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we performed 5,638,979, 4,828,488, and 4,525,490 diagnostic imaging procedures and generated net revenue of $809.6 million, $717.6 million, and $703.0 million, respectively. Additional information concerning RadNet, Inc., including our consolidated subsidiaries, for each of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 is included in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in this annual report.

&#160;

We typically experience some seasonality to our business. During the first quarter of each year we generally experience the lowest volumes of procedures and the lowest level of revenue for any quarter during the year. This is primarily the result of two factors. First, our volumes and revenue are typically impacted by winter weather conditions in our northeastern operations. It is common for snowstorms and other inclement weather to result in patient appointment cancellations and, in some cases, imaging center closures. Second, in recent years, we have provided care to an increased number of patients participating in high deductible health plans. The patient deductible amount resents each January resulting in initially greater patient out of pocket expenditures until deductible limits are met. During this initial period of typically two to three months patients may defer medical service

&#160;

History of our Business 

&#160;

We became incorporated in Delaware in 2008 and have been in business since 1985.

&#160;

We develop our medical imaging business through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions. For a discussion of acquisitions, see Item 7 - &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis and Results of Operations&#8212;Recent Developments and Facility Acquisitions&#8221; below.

&#160;

&#160; 1 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

In addition to our imaging business, our eRAD, Inc. subsidiary is a provider of PACS and related workflow solutions to the radiology industry. Over 250 hospitals, teleradiology businesses, imaging centers and specialty physician groups use eRAD&#8217;s technology to distribute, display, store and retrieve digital images taken from all diagnostic imaging modalities. eRAD has approximately 56 employees, including a research and development team of 19 software engineers in Budapest, Hungary.

&#160;

We have also assembled an industry leading team of software developers, based out of Prince Edward Island, Canada, to create radiology workflow solutions known as Radiology Information Systems (&#8220;RIS&#8221;) focused exclusively on RadNet&#8217;s internal use. All 22 members of this Canadian based team have significant software development expertise in radiology, and together with eRAD and its PACS technology, are creating fully integrated solutions to manage all aspects of RadNet&#8217;s internal information needs.

&#160;

In January 2011, we entered into a new line of business with the acquisition of Imaging On Call, LLC, a provider of teleradiology services to radiology groups, hospitals and imaging centers located in Poughkeepsie, New York. Through our teleradiology business, we provide interpretation services to approximately 50 hospitals and hospital-based radiology groups.

&#160;

Industry Overview 

&#160;

&#160; Diagnostic imaging involves the use of non-invasive procedures to generate representations of internal anatomy and function that can be recorded on film or digitized for display on a video monitor. Diagnostic imaging procedures facilitate the early diagnosis and treatment of diseases and disorders and may reduce unnecessary invasive procedures, often minimizing the cost and amount of care for patients. Diagnostic imaging procedures include MRI, CT, PET, nuclear medicine, ultrasound, mammography, X-ray and fluoroscopy. We estimate that the national imaging market in the United States is $100 billion annually and we project mid-single digit growth for MRI, CT and PET/CT over the next several years, driven by the aging of the U.S. population, wider physician and payor acceptance for imaging technologies, and greater consumer and physician awareness of diagnostic screening capabilities.

&#160;

While X-ray remains the most commonly performed diagnostic imaging procedure, the fastest growing and higher margin procedures are MRI, CT and PET. The rapid growth in PET scans is attributable to the increasing recognition of the efficacy of PET scans in the diagnosis and monitoring of cancer. The number of MRI and CT scans performed annually in the United States continues to grow due to their wider acceptance by physicians and payors, an increasing number of applications for their use and a general increase in demand due to the aging population.

&#160;

Diagnostic Imaging Settings 

&#160;

Diagnostic imaging services are typically provided in one of the following settings:

&#160;

Fixed-site, freestanding outpatient diagnostic facilities 

&#160;

These facilities range from single-modality to multi-modality facilities and are generally not owned by hospitals or clinics. These facilities depend upon physician referrals for their patients and generally do not maintain dedicated, contractual relationships with hospitals or clinics. In fact, these facilities may compete with hospitals or clinics that have their own imaging systems to provide services to these patients. These facilities bill third-party payors, such as managed care organizations, insurance companies, Medicare or Medicaid. All of our facilities are in this category.

&#160;

Hospitals 

&#160;

Many hospitals provide both inpatient and outpatient diagnostic imaging services, typically on site. These inpatient and outpatient centers are owned and operated by the hospital or clinic, or jointly by both, and are primarily used by patients of the hospital or clinic. The hospital or clinic bills third-party payors, such as managed care organizations, insurance companies, Medicare or Medicaid.

&#160;

&#160; 2 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Mobile Imaging 

&#160;

While many hospitals own or lease their own equipment, certain hospitals provide diagnostic imaging services by contracting with providers of mobile imaging services. Using specially designed trailers, mobile imaging service providers transport imaging equipment and provide services to hospitals and clinics on a part-time or full-time basis, thus allowing small to mid-size hospitals and clinics that do not have the patient demand to justify fixed on-site access to advanced diagnostic imaging technology. Diagnostic imaging providers contract directly with the hospital or clinic and are typically reimbursed directly by them.

&#160;

Diagnostic Imaging Modalities 

&#160;

The principal diagnostic imaging modalities we use at our facilities are:

&#160;

MRI 

&#160;

MRI has become widely accepted as the standard diagnostic tool for a wide and fast-growing variety of clinical applications for soft tissue anatomy, such as those found in the brain, spinal cord, abdomen, heart and interior ligaments of body joints such as the knee. MRI uses a strong magnetic field in conjunction with low energy electromagnetic waves that are processed by a computer to produce high-resolution, three-dimensional, cross-sectional images of body tissue. A typical MRI examination takes from 20 to 45 minutes. MRI systems are designed as either open or closed and have magnetic field strength of 0.2 Tesla to 3.0 Tesla and are priced in the range of $0.6 million to $2.5 million. As of December 31, 2015, we had 231 MRI systems in operation.

&#160;

CT 

&#160;

CT provides higher resolution images than conventional X-rays, but generally not as well defined as those produced by MRI. CT uses a computer to direct the movement of an X-ray tube to produce multiple cross-sectional images of a particular organ or area of the body. CT is used to detect tumors and other conditions affecting bones and internal organs. It is also used to detect the occurrence of strokes, hemorrhages and infections. A typical CT examination takes from 15 to 45 minutes. CT systems are priced in the range of $0.3 million to $1.2 million. As of December 31, 2015, we had 144 CT systems in operation.

&#160; 

PET 

&#160;

PET scanning involves the administration of a radiopharmaceutical agent with a positron-emitting isotope and the measurement of the distribution of that isotope to create images for diagnostic purposes. PET scans provide the capability to determine how metabolic activity impacts other aspects of physiology in the disease process by correlating the reading for the PET with other tools such as CT or MRI. PET technology has been found highly effective and appropriate in certain clinical circumstances for the detection and assessment of tumors throughout the body, the evaluation of some cardiac conditions and the assessment of epilepsy seizure sites. The information provided by PET technology often obviates the need to perform further highly invasive or diagnostic surgical procedures. PET systems are priced in the range of $0.8 million to $2.5 million. In addition, we employ combined PET/CT systems that blend the PET and CT imaging modalities into one scanner. These combined systems are priced in the range of $1.1 million to $2.8 million. As of December 31, 2015, we had 46 PET or combination PET/CT systems in operation.

&#160;

Nuclear Medicine 

&#160;

Nuclear medicine uses short-lived radioactive isotopes that release small amounts of radiation that can be recorded by a gamma camera and processed by a computer to produce an image of various anatomical structures or to assess the function of various organs such as the heart, kidneys, thyroid and bones. Nuclear medicine is used primarily to study anatomic and metabolic functions. Nuclear medicine systems are priced in the range of $300,000 to $400,000. As of December 31, 2015, we had 49 nuclear medicine systems in operation.

&#160;

X-ray 

&#160;

X-rays use roentgen rays to penetrate the body and record images of organs and structures on film. Digital X-ray systems add computer image processing capability to traditional X-ray images, which provides faster transmission of images with a higher resolution and the capability to store images more cost-effectively. X-ray systems are priced in the range of $95,000 to $440,000. As of December 31, 2015, we had 393 X-ray systems in operation. 

&#160; 

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Ultrasound 

&#160;

Ultrasound imaging uses sound waves and their echoes to visualize and locate internal organs. It is particularly useful in viewing soft tissues that do not X-ray well. Ultrasound is used in pregnancy to avoid X-ray exposure as well as in gynecological, urologic, vascular, cardiac and breast applications. Ultrasound systems are priced in the range of $90,000 to $250,000. As of December 31, 2015, we had 498 ultrasound systems in operation.

&#160;

Mammography 

&#160;

Mammography is a specialized form of radiology using low dosage X-rays to visualize breast tissue and is the primary screening tool for breast cancer. Mammography procedures and related services assist in the diagnosis of and treatment planning for breast cancer. Analog mammography systems are priced in the range of $70,000 to $100,000, and digital mammography systems are priced in the range of $250,000 to $400,000. As of December 31, 2015, we had 260 mammography systems in operation.

&#160;

Fluoroscopy 

&#160;

Fluoroscopy uses ionizing radiation combined with a video viewing system for real time monitoring of organs. Fluoroscopy systems are priced in the range of $100,000 to $400,000. As of December 31, 2015, we had 105 fluoroscopy systems in operation.

&#160;

Industry Trends 

&#160;

We believe the diagnostic imaging services industry will continue to grow as a result of a number of factors, including the following:

&#160;

Escalating Demand for Healthcare Services from an Aging Population 

&#160;

Persons over the age of 65 comprise one of the fastest growing segments of the population in the United States. According to the United States Census Bureau, this group is expected to increase as much as 39% from 2010 to 2020. Because diagnostic imaging use tends to increase as a person ages, we believe the aging population will generate more demand for diagnostic imaging procedures . 

&#160;

New Effective Applications for Diagnostic Imaging Technology 

&#160;

New technological developments are expected to extend the clinical uses of diagnostic imaging technology and increase the number of scans performed. Recent technological advancements include:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; MRI spectroscopy, which can differentiate malignant from benign lesions; &#160;

&#160; &#183; MRI angiography, which can produce three-dimensional images of body parts and assess the status of blood vessels; &#160;

&#160; &#183; enhancements in teleradiology systems, which permit the digital transmission of radiological images from one location to another for interpretation by radiologists at remote locations; and &#160;

&#160; &#183; the development of combined PET/CT scanners, which combine the technology from PET and CT to create a powerful diagnostic imaging system. &#160;

Additional improvements in imaging technologies, contrast agents and scan capabilities are leading to new non-invasive diagnostic imaging application, including methods of diagnosing blockages in the heart&#8217;s vital coronary arteries, liver metastases, pelvic diseases and vascular abnormalities without exploratory surgery. We believe that the use of the diagnostic capabilities of MRI and other imaging services will continue to increase because they are cost-effective, time-efficient and non-invasive, as compared to alternative procedures, including surgery, and that newer technologies and future technological advancements will further increase the use of imaging services. At the same time, the industry has increasingly used upgrades to existing equipment to expand applications, extend the useful life of existing equipment, improve image quality, reduce image acquisition time and increase the volume of scans that can be performed. We believe the use of equipment upgrades rather than equipment replacements will continue, as we do not foresee new imaging technologies on the near-term horizon that will displace MRI, CT or PET as the principal advanced diagnostic imaging modalities.

&#160;

Wider Physician and Payor Acceptance of the Use of Imaging 

&#160;

During the last 30 years, there has been a major effort undertaken by the medical and scientific communities to develop higher quality, cost-effective diagnostic imaging technologies and to minimize the risks associated with the application of these technologies. The thrust of product development during this period has largely been to reduce the hazards associated with conventional X-ray and nuclear medicine techniques and to develop new, less harmful imaging technologies. As a result, the use of advanced diagnostic imaging modalities, such as MRI, CT and PET, which provide superior image quality compared to other diagnostic imaging technologies, has increased rapidly in recent years. These advanced modalities allow physicians to diagnose a wide variety of diseases and injuries quickly and accurately without exploratory surgery or other surgical or invasive procedures, which are usually more expensive, involve greater risk to patients and result in longer rehabilitation time. Because advanced imaging systems are increasingly seen as a tool for reducing long-term healthcare costs, they are gaining wider acceptance among payors.

&#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Greater Consumer Awareness of and Demand for Preventive Diagnostic Screening 

&#160;

Diagnostic imaging, such as elective full-body scans, is increasingly being used as a screening tool for preventive care procedures. Consumer awareness of diagnostic imaging as a less invasive and preventive screening method has added to the growth in diagnostic imaging procedures. We believe that further technological advancements allowing for early diagnosis of diseases and disorders using less invasive procedures will create additional demand for diagnostic imaging.

&#160;

Expansion of Teleradiology Services 

&#160; 

As hiring radiologists has become more difficult, the use of teleradiology is expected to continue to expand to provide patients better, more specialized care and 24/7 services.

&#160;

Our Competitive Strengths 

&#160;

Our Scale and Position as the Largest Provider of Freestanding, Fixed-site Outpatient Diagnostic Imaging Services in the United States, Based on Number of Centers and Revenue 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, we operated 300 centers in California, Delaware, Florida, Maryland, New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island. Our size and scale allow us to achieve operating, sourcing and administrative efficiencies, including equipment and medical supply sourcing savings and favorable maintenance contracts from equipment manufacturers and other suppliers. Our specific knowledge of our geographic markets drives strong relationships with key payors, radiology groups and referring physicians within our markets.

&#160;

Our Comprehensive &#34;Multi-Modality&#34; Diagnostic Imaging Offering 

&#160;

The vast majority of our centers offer multiple types of imaging procedures, driving strong relationships with referring physicians and payors in our markets and a diversified revenue base. At each of our multi-modality facilities, we offer patients and referring physicians one location to serve their needs for multiple procedures. This prevents multiple patient visits or unnecessary travel between facilities, thereby increasing patient throughput and decreasing costs and time delays. Our revenue is generated by a broad mix of modalities. We believe our multi-modality strategy lessens our exposure to reimbursement changes in any specific modality.

&#160;

Our Competitive Pricing 

&#160;

We believe our fees are generally lower than hospital fees for the services we provide.

&#160;

Our Facility Density in Many Highly Populated Areas of the United States 

&#160;

The strategic organization of our diagnostic imaging facilities into regional networks concentrated in major population centers in seven states offers unique benefits to our patients, our referring physicians, our payors and us. We are able to increase the convenience of our services to patients by implementing scheduling systems within geographic regions, where practical. For example, many of our diagnostic imaging facilities within a particular region can access the patient appointment calendars of other facilities within the same regional network to efficiently allocate time available and to meet a patient's appointment, date, time, or location preferences. The grouping of our facilities within regional networks enables us to easily move technologists and other personnel, as well as equipment, from under-utilized to over-utilized facilities on an as-needed basis, and drive referrals. Our organization of referral networks results in increased patient throughput, greater operating efficiencies, better equipment utilization rates and improved response time for our patients. We believe our networks of facilities and tailored service offerings for geographic areas drives local physician referrals, makes us an attractive candidate for selection as a preferred provider by third-party payors, creates economies of scale and provides barriers to entry by competitors in our markets.

&#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Our Strong Relationships with Payors and Diversified Payor Mix 

&#160;

Our revenue is derived from a diverse mix of payors, including private payors, managed care capitated payors and government payors, which should mitigate our exposure to possible unfavorable reimbursement trends within any one payor class. In addition, our experience with capitation arrangements has provided us with the expertise to manage utilization and pricing effectively, resulting in a predictable and recurring stream of revenue. We believe that third-party payors representing large groups of patients often prefer to enter into managed care contracts with providers that offer a broad array of diagnostic imaging services at convenient locations throughout a geographic area. In 2015, we received approximately 57% of our payments from commercial insurance payors, 12% from managed care capitated payors, 20% from Medicare and 3% from Medicaid. With the exception of Blue Cross/Blue Shield, which are managed by different entities in each of the states in which we operate, and Medicare, no single payor accounted for more than 5% of our net revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015.

&#160;

Our Strong Relationships with Experienced and Highly Regarded Radiologists 

&#160;

Our contracted radiologists have outstanding credentials, strong relationships with referring physicians, and a broad mix of sub-specialties. The collective experience and expertise of these radiologists translates into more accurate and efficient service to patients. Our close relationship with Howard G. Berger, M.D., our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Beverly Radiology Medical Group (&#8220;BRMG&#8221;) in California and our long-term arrangements with radiologists outside of California enable us to better ensure that medical service provided at our facilities is consistent with the needs and expectations of our referring physicians, patients and payors.

&#160; 

Our Experienced and Committed Management Team 

&#160;

Our senior management group has more than 100 years of combined healthcare management experience. Our executive management team has created our differentiated approach based on their comprehensive understanding of the diagnostic imaging industry and the dynamics of our regional markets. We have a track record of successful acquisitions and integration of acquired businesses into RadNet, and have managed the business through a variety of economic and reimbursement cycles.

&#160; 

Our Technologically Advanced Imaging Systems 

&#160;

In late 2010 and early 2011 we expanded our offering of imaging related services with our acquisition of eRad (development and sale of computerized imaging systems for the imaging industry) and Imaging On Call (teleradiology services for interpretation of images for radiology groups, hospitals and others after business hours, for overflow and specialty work). In addition, we have assembled an industry leading team of software developers to create radiology workflow solutions for our internal use.

&#160;

Business Strategy 

&#160;

Maximize Performance at Our Existing Facilities 

&#160;

We intend to enhance our operations and increase scan volume and revenue at our existing facilities by expanding physician relationships and increasing the procedure offerings. 

&#160; 

Expansion Into Related Businesses 

&#160; 

With our acquisition of eRad we entered the business of the development and sale of software systems essential to the imaging industry. Similarly, with our acquisition of Imaging On Call, we entered the teleradiology business. We intend to regularly evaluate potential acquisitions of other businesses to the extent they complement our imaging business.

&#160;

Focus on Profitable Contracting 

&#160;

&#160; We regularly evaluate our contracts with third-party payors, industry vendors and radiology groups, as well as our equipment and real property leases, to determine how we may improve the terms to increase our revenues and reduce our expenses. Because many of our contracts with third party payors are short-term in nature, we can regularly renegotiate these contracts, if necessary. We believe our position as a leading provider of diagnostic imaging services and our long-term relationships with physician groups in our markets enable us to obtain more favorable contract terms than would be available to smaller or less experienced imaging services providers.

&#160;

Optimize Operating Efficiencies 

&#160;

We try to maximize our equipment utilization by adding, upgrading and re-deploying equipment where we experience excess demand. We will continue to trim excess operating and general and administrative costs where it is feasible to do so. We may also continue to use, where appropriate, highly trained radiology physician assistants to perform, under appropriate supervision of radiologists, basic services traditionally performed by radiologists. We will continue to upgrade our advanced information technology system to create cost reductions for our facilities in areas such as image storage, support personnel and financial management.

&#160; 

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Expand Our Networks 

&#160;

We intend to continue to expand the number of our facilities both organically and through targeted acquisitions, using a disciplined approach for evaluating and entering new areas, including consideration of whether we have adequate financial resources to expand. Our current plans are to strengthen our market presence in geographic areas where we currently have existing operations and to expand into neighboring and other areas where we believe we can compete effectively. We perform extensive due diligence before developing a new facility or acquiring an existing facility or entering into a joint venture with a hospital to manage a facility, including surveying local referral sources and radiologists, as well as examining the demographics, reimbursement environment, competitive landscape and intrinsic demand of the geographic market. We generally will only enter new markets where:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; there is sufficient patient demand for outpatient diagnostic imaging services; &#160;

&#160; &#183; we believe we can gain significant market share; &#160;

&#160; &#183; we can build key referral relationships or we have already established such relationships; and &#160;

&#160; &#183; payors are receptive to our entry into the market. &#160;

Our Services 

&#160;

We offer a comprehensive set of imaging services including MRI, CT, PET, nuclear medicine, X-ray, ultrasound, mammography, fluoroscopy and other related procedures. We focus on providing standardized high quality imaging services, regardless of location, to ensure patients, physicians and payors consistency in service and quality. To ensure the high quality of our services, we monitor patient satisfaction, timeliness of services to patients and reports to physicians.

&#160;

The key features of our services include:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; patient-friendly, non-clinical environments; &#160;

&#160; &#183; a 24-hour turnaround on routine examinations; &#160;

&#160; &#183; interpretations within one to two hours, if needed; &#160;

&#160; &#183; flexible patient scheduling, including same-day appointments; &#160;

&#160; &#183; extended operating hours, including weekends; &#160;

&#160; &#183; reports delivered by courier, facsimile or email; &#160;

&#160; &#183; availability of second opinions and consultations; &#160;

&#160; &#183; availability of sub-specialty interpretations at no additional charge; and &#160;

&#160; &#183; standardized fee schedules by region. &#160;

Radiology Professionals 

&#160;

In the states in which we provide services (except Florida), a lay person or any entity other than a professional corporation or similar professional organization is not allowed to practice medicine, including by employing professional persons or by having any ownership interest or profit participation in or control over any medical professional practice. This doctrine is commonly referred to as the prohibition on the &#8220;corporate practice&#8221; of medicine. In order to comply with this prohibition, we contract with radiologists to provide professional medical services in our facilities, including the supervision and interpretation of diagnostic imaging procedures. The radiology practice maintains full control over the physicians it employs. Pursuant to each management contract, we make available the imaging facility and all of the furniture and medical equipment at the facility for use by the radiology practice, and the practice is responsible for staffing the facility with qualified professional medical personnel. In addition, we provide management services and administration of the non-medical functions relating to the professional medical practice at the facility, including among other functions, provision of clerical and administrative personnel, bookkeeping and accounting services, billing and collection, provision of medical and office supplies, secretarial, reception and transcription services, maintenance of medical records, and advertising, marketing and promotional activities. As compensation for the services furnished under contracts with radiologists, we generally receive an agreed percentage of the medical practice billings for, or collections from, services provided at the facility, typically varying between 75% to 85% of global net service fee revenue or collections after deduction of the professional component of the medical practice billings.

&#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

At all but 13 of our California facilities, we contract for the provision of professional medical services directly with BRMG, or indirectly through BRMG with other radiology groups.

&#160;

Many states have also enacted laws prohibiting a licensed professional from splitting fees derived from the practice of medicine with an unlicensed person or business entity. We do not believe that the management, administrative, technical and other non-medical services we provide to each of our contracted radiology groups violate the corporate practice of medicine prohibition or that the fees we charge for such services violate the fee splitting prohibition. However, the enforcement and interpretation of these laws by regulatory authorities and state courts vary from state to state. If our arrangements with our independent contractor radiology groups are found to violate state laws prohibiting the practice of medicine by general business corporations or fee splitting, our business, financial condition and ability to operate in those states could be adversely affected.

&#160;

BRMG and New York Groups 

&#160;

BRMG, owned 99% indirectly by Dr. Berger, our President and CEO provides, directly or indirectly, all of the professional medical services at nearly all of our facilities located in California under a management agreement with us, and employs physicians or contracts with various independent physicians and physician groups to provide the professional medical services at most of our California facilities. We generally obtain professional medical services from BRMG in California, rather than provide such services directly or through subsidiaries, in order to comply with California&#8217;s prohibition against the corporate practice of medicine. However, as a result of our close relationship with Dr. Berger and BRMG, we believe that we are able to better ensure that medical service is provided at our California facilities in a manner consistent with our needs and expectations and those of our referring physicians, patients and payors than if we obtained these services from unaffiliated physician groups. BRMG is a partnership of ProNet Imaging Medical Group, Inc., Breastlink Medical Group, Inc. and Beverly Radiology Medical Group, Inc..

&#160;

We believe that physicians are drawn to BRMG and the other radiologist groups with whom we contract by the opportunity to work with the state-of-the-art equipment we make available to them, as well as the opportunity to receive specialized training through our fellowship programs, and engage in clinical research programs, which generally are available only in university settings and major hospitals.

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, BRMG employed or contracted for 209 full-time and 20 part-time radiologists. Under our management agreement with BRMG, we are paid a percentage of the amounts collected for the professional services BRMG physicians render as compensation for our services and for the use of our facilities and equipment. For the year ended December 31, 2015, this percentage was 78%. The percentage may be adjusted, if necessary, to ensure that the parties receive the fair value for the services they render. The following are the other principal terms of our management agreement with BRMG:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; The agreement expires on January 1, 2024. The agreement automatically renews for consecutive 10-year periods, unless either party delivers a notice of non-renewal to the other party no later than six months prior to the scheduled expiration date. Either party may terminate the agreement if the other party defaults under its obligations, after notice and an opportunity to cure. We may terminate the agreement if Dr. Berger no longer owns at least 60% of the equity of BRMG; as of December 31, 2015, he owned indirectly 99% of the equity of BRMG. &#160;

&#160; &#183; At its expense, BRMG employs or contracts with an adequate number of physicians necessary to provide all professional medical services at all of our California facilities, except for 13 facilities for which we contract with separate medical groups. &#160;

&#160; &#183; At our expense, we provide all furniture, furnishings and medical equipment located at the facilities and we manage and administer all non-medical functions at, and provide all nurses and other non-physician personnel required for the operation of, the facilities. &#160;

&#160; &#183; If BRMG wants to open a new facility, we have the right of first refusal to provide the space and services for the facility under the same terms and conditions set forth in the management agreement. &#160;

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#183; If we want to open a new facility in California, BRMG must use its best efforts to provide medical personnel under the same terms and conditions set forth in the management agreement. If BRMG cannot provide such personnel, we have the right to contract with other physicians to provide services at the facility. &#160;

&#160; &#183; BRMG must maintain medical malpractice insurance for each of its physicians with coverage limits not less than $1 million per incident and $3 million in the aggregate per year. BRMG also has agreed to indemnify us for any losses we suffer that arise out of the acts or omissions of BRMG and its employees, contractors and agents. &#160;

We contract with eight medical groups which provide professional medical services at all of our facilities in Manhattan and Brooklyn, New York, the &#8220;New York Groups&#8221;. These contracts are similar to our contract with BRMG. Four of these groups are owned by John V Crues, III, M.D., Radnet&#8217;s Medical Director, a member of our Board of Directors, and a 1% owner of BRMG. Dr Berger owns a controlling interest in two of these medical groups which provide professional medical services at one of our Manhattan facilities.

&#160;

Non-BRMG and New York Groups entity locations 

&#160;

At the 13 centers in California where BRMG does not provide professional medical services, and at all of the centers which are located outside of California, with the exception of centers located in the New York, New York area, we have entered into long-term contracts with prominent third-party radiology groups in the area to provide physician services at those facilities. These arrangements also allow us to comply with the prohibition against the &#8220;corporate practice&#8221; of medicine in other states in which we operate (except in Florida which does not have an equivalent statute prohibiting the corporate practice of medicine).

&#160;

These third-party radiology practice groups provide professional services, including supervision and interpretation of diagnostic imaging procedures, in our diagnostic imaging centers. The radiology practices maintain full control over the provision of professional services. The contracted radiology practices have outstanding physician and practice credentials and reputations; strong competitive market positions; a broad sub-specialty mix of physicians; a history of growth and potential for continued growth. In these facilities we have entered into long-term agreements (typically 10-40 years in length) under which, in addition to obtaining technical fees for the use of our diagnostic imaging equipment and the provision of technical services, we provide management services and receive a fee based on the practice group&#8217;s professional revenue. We typically receive 100% of the technical reimbursements associated with imaging procedures plus certain fees paid to us for providing additional management services. The radiology practice groups retain the professional reimbursements associated with imaging procedures after deducting management service fees paid to us.

&#160;

Additionally, we perform certain management services for a portion of the professional groups with whom we contract who provide professional radiology services at local hospitals. For performing these management services, which include billing, collecting, transcription and medical coding, we receive management fees.

&#160;

Payors 

&#160;

The fees charged for diagnostic imaging services performed at our facilities are paid by a diverse mix of payors, as illustrated for the following periods presented in the table below:

&#160; 

&#160; &#160; % of Net Revenue &#160; &#160; &#160; Year Ended December 31, 2015 &#160; &#160; Year Ended December 31, 2014 &#160; &#160; Year Ended December 31, 2013 &#160; Commercial Insurance (1)(2) &#160; &#160; 57% &#160; &#160; &#160; 56% &#160; &#160; &#160; 55% &#160; Managed Care Capitated Payors &#160; &#160; 12% &#160; &#160; &#160; 13% &#160; &#160; &#160; 13% &#160; Medicare&#38; Medicaid &#160; &#160; 23% &#160; &#160; &#160; 24% &#160; &#160; &#160; 24% &#160; &#160;

(1) Includes Blue Cross/Blue Shield plans, which represented 20% of our net service fee revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013.

&#160;

(2) Includes co-payments, direct patient payments and payments through contracts with physician groups and other non-insurance company payors.

&#160;

We have described below the types of reimbursement arrangements we have with third-party payors.

&#160;

Commercial Insurance 

&#160;

Generally, insurance companies reimburse us, directly or indirectly, including through BRMG in California or through the contracted radiology groups elsewhere, on the basis of agreed upon rates. These rates are negotiated and may differ materially with rates set forth in the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule for the particular service. The patients may be responsible for certain co-payments or deductibles.

&#160;

&#160; 9 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Managed Care Capitation Agreements 

&#160;

Under these agreements, which are generally between BRMG in California and outside of California between the contracted radiology group (typically an independent physician group or other medical group) and the payor (which in most cases are large medical groups or Independent Practice Associations), the payor pays a pre-determined amount per-member per-month in exchange for the radiology group providing all necessary covered services to the managed care members included in the agreement. These contracts pass much of the financial risk of providing outpatient diagnostic imaging services, including the risk of over-use, from the payor to the radiology group and, as a result of our management agreement with the radiology group, to us.

&#160;

We believe that through our comprehensive utilization management, or UM, program we have become highly skilled at assessing and moderating the risks associated with the capitation agreements, so that these agreements are profitable for us. Our UM program is managed by our UM department, which consists of administrative and nursing staff as well as BRMG medical staff who are actively involved with the referring physicians and payor management in both prospective and retrospective review programs. Our UM program includes the following features, all of which are designed to manage our costs while ensuring that patients receive appropriate care:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; Physician Education &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; At the inception of a new capitation agreement, we provide the new referring physicians with binders of educational material comprised of proprietary information that we have prepared and third-party information we have compiled, which are designed to address diagnostic strategies for common diseases. We distribute additional material according to the referral practices of the group as determined in the retrospective analysis described below. &#160;

&#160; &#183; Prospective Review &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Referring physicians are required to submit authorization requests for non-emergency high-intensity services: MRI, CT, special procedures and nuclear medicine studies. The UM medical staff, according to accepted practice guidelines, considers the necessity and appropriateness of each request. Notification is then sent to the imaging facility, referring physician and medical group. Appeals for cases not approved are directed to us. The capitated payor has the final authority to uphold or deny our recommendation. &#160;

&#160; &#183; Retrospective Review &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; We collect and sort encounter activity by payor, place of service, referring physician, exam type and date of service. The data is then presented in quantitative and analytical form to facilitate understanding of utilization activity and to provide a comparison between fee-for-service and Medicare equivalents. Our Medical Director prepares a quarterly report for each payor and referring physician. When we find that a referring physician is over utilizing services, we work with the physician to modify referral patterns. &#160;

Medicare/Medicaid 

&#160;

Medicare is the federal health insurance program for people age 65 or older and people under age 65 with certain disabilities. Medicaid, funded by both the federal government and states, is a state-administered health insurance program for qualifying low-income and medically needy persons. For services for which we bill Medicare directly or indirectly, including through contracted radiologists, we are paid under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule. Under the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, Congress introduced a new quality incentive program that, effective January 1, 2016, reduces Medicare payments for certain CT services reimbursed through the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule that are furnished using equipment that does not meet certain dose optimization and management standards. Medicare patients usually pay a 20% co-payment unless they have secondary insurance. Medicaid rates are set by the individual states for each state program and Medicaid patients may be responsible for a modest co-payment.

&#160;

Contracts with Physician Groups and Other Non-Insurance Company Payors 

&#160;

For some of our contracts with physician groups and other providers, we do not bill payors, but instead accept agreed upon rates for our radiology services. These rates are typically at or below the rates set forth in the current Medicare Fee Schedule for the particular service. However, we often agree to a specified rate for MRI and CT procedures that is not tied to the Medicare Fee Schedule.

&#160;

&#160; 10 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Facilities 

&#160;

We operate 139 fixed-site, freestanding outpatient diagnostic imaging facilities in California, 12 in Delaware, 3 in Florida, 54 in Maryland, 19 in New Jersey, 23 in the Rochester and Hudson Valley areas of New York, 45 in New York Cityas well as 5 in Rhode Island. We lease the premises at which these facilities are located.

&#160;

Our facilities are primarily located in geographic networks that we refer to as regions. The majority of our facilities are multi-modality sites, offering various combinations of MRI, CT, PET, nuclear medicine, ultrasound, X-ray, fluoroscopy services and other related procedures. A portion of our facilities are single-modality sites, offering either X-ray or MRI services. Consistent with our regional network strategy, we locate our single-modality facilities near multi-modality facilities, to help accommodate overflow in targeted demographic areas.

&#160;

The following table sets forth the number of our facilities for each year during the five-year period ended December 31, 2015:

&#160;

Diagnostic Imaging Equipment 

&#160;

The following table indicates, as of December 31, 2015, the quantity of principal diagnostic equipment available at our facilities, by region:

&#160;

&#160; &#160; MRI &#160; &#160; Open/MRI &#160; CT &#160; &#160; PET/CT &#160; &#160; Mammo &#160; &#160; Ultrasound &#160; &#160; X-ray &#160; &#160; NucMed &#160; &#160; Fluoroscopy &#160; &#160; Total &#160; California &#160; &#160; 65 &#160; &#160; &#160; 25 &#160; &#160; &#160; 49 &#160; &#160; &#160; 21 &#160; &#160; &#160; 92 &#160; &#160; &#160; 209 &#160; &#160; &#160; 125 &#160; &#160; &#160; 19 &#160; &#160; &#160; 54 &#160; &#160; &#160; 659 &#160; Florida &#160; &#160; 2 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1 &#160; &#160; &#160; 3 &#160; &#160; &#160; 5 &#160; &#160; &#160; 3 &#160; &#160; &#160; 4 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2 &#160; &#160; &#160; 23 &#160; Delaware &#160; &#160; 6 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8211; &#160; &#160; &#160; 6 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8211; &#160; &#160; &#160; 5 &#160; &#160; &#160; 14 &#160; &#160; &#160; 20 &#160; &#160; &#160; 3 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2 &#160; &#160; &#160; 56 &#160; New Jersey &#160; &#160; 18 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1 &#160; &#160; &#160; 14 &#160; &#160; &#160; 3 &#160; &#160; &#160; 17 &#160; &#160; &#160; 29 &#160; &#160; &#160; 25 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2 &#160; &#160; &#160; 10 &#160; &#160; &#160; 119 &#160; New York &#160; &#160; 48 &#160; &#160; &#160; 3 &#160; &#160; &#160; 34 &#160; &#160; &#160; 7 &#160; &#160; &#160; 75 &#160; &#160; &#160; 125 &#160; &#160; &#160; 105 &#160; &#160; &#160; 6 &#160; &#160; &#160; 13 &#160; &#160; &#160; 416 &#160; Maryland &#160; &#160; 53 &#160; &#160; &#160; 6 &#160; &#160; &#160; 36 &#160; &#160; &#160; 14 &#160; &#160; &#160; 66 &#160; &#160; &#160; 112 &#160; &#160; &#160; 111 &#160; &#160; &#160; 15 &#160; &#160; &#160; 24 &#160; &#160; &#160; 437 &#160; Rhode Island &#160; &#160; 3 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8211; &#160; &#160; &#160; 3 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8211; &#160; &#160; &#160; 2 &#160; &#160; &#160; 4 &#160; &#160; &#160; 4 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8211; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8211; &#160; &#160; &#160; 16 &#160; Total &#160; &#160; 195 &#160; &#160; &#160; 36 &#160; &#160; &#160; 144 &#160; &#160; &#160; 46 &#160; &#160; &#160; 260 &#160; &#160; &#160; 498 &#160; &#160; &#160; 393 &#160; &#160; &#160; 49 &#160; &#160; &#160; 105 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,726 &#160; 

&#160;

The average age of our MRI and CT units is less than six years, and the average age of our PET units is less than four years. The useful life of our MRI, CT and PET units is typically ten years.

&#160;

Facility Acquisitions 

&#160;

Information regarding our facility acquisitions can be found within Item 7 - &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221;, as well as Notes 4 and 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.

&#160;

Information Technology 

&#160;

Our corporate headquarters and many of our facilities are interconnected through a state-of-the-art information technology system. This system, which is compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, is comprised of a number of integrated applications and provides a single operating platform for billing and collections, electronic medical records, practice management and image management.

&#160;

&#160; 11 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

This technology has created cost reductions for our facilities in areas such as image storage, support personnel and financial management and has further allowed us to optimize the productivity of all aspects of our business by enabling us to:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; capture patient demographic, history and billing information at point-of-service; &#160;

&#160; &#183; automatically generate bills and electronically file claims with third-party payors; &#160;

&#160; &#183; record and store diagnostic report images in digital format; &#160;

&#160; &#183; digitally transmit in real-time diagnostic images from one location to another, thus enabling networked radiologists to cover larger geographic markets by using the specialized training of other networked radiologists; &#160;

&#160; &#183; perform claims, rejection and collection analysis; and &#160;

&#160; &#183; perform sophisticated financial analysis, such as analyzing cost and profitability, volume, charges, current activity and patient case mix, with respect to each of our managed care contracts. &#160;

Diagnostic reports and images are currently accessible via the Internet by our California referring providers. We have worked with some of the larger medical groups in California with whom we have contracts to provide access to this content through their web portals. We are in the process of making such services available outside of California.

&#160;

We have historically utilized third-party software for our front desk patient tracking system, which we refer to as a Radiology Information System, or RIS. We have developed our own RIS through our team of software development engineers and began running this internally developed system in the first quarter of 2015.

&#160;

Personnel 

&#160;

At December 31, 2015, we had a total of 5,265 full-time, 815 part-time and 1,304 per diem employees, including those employed by BRMG. These numbers include 209 full-time and 20 part-time physicians and 1,230 full-time, 469 part-time and 664 per-diem technologists.

&#160;

We employ site managers who are responsible for overseeing day-to-day and routine operations at each of our facilities, including staffing, modality and schedule coordination, referring physician and patient relations and purchasing of materials. These site managers report to regional managers and directors, who are responsible for oversight of the operations of all facilities within their region, including sales, marketing and contracting. The regional managers and directors, along with our directors of contracting, marketing, facilities, management/purchasing and human resources report to our chief operating officers. These officers, our chief financial officer, our director of information services and our medical director report to our chief executive officer.

&#160;

None of our employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement nor have we experienced any work stoppages. We believe our relationship with our employees is good.

&#160;

Sales and Marketing 

&#160;

At December 31, 2015, our California sales and marketing team consisted of one director of marketing and 47 customer service representatives, while our eastern marketing team consisted of one director of marketing and 116 customer sales representatives. Our sales and marketing team employs a multi-pronged approach to marketing, including physician, payor and sports marketing programs.

&#160;

Physician Marketing 

&#160;

Each customer service representative on our physician marketing team is responsible for marketing activity on behalf of one or more facilities. The representatives act as a liaison between the facility and referring physicians, holding meetings periodically and on an as-needed basis with them and their staff to present educational programs on new applications and uses of our systems and to address particular patient service issues that have arisen. In our experience, consistent hands-on contact with a referring physician and his or her staff generates goodwill and increases referrals to our facilities. The representatives also continually seek to establish referral relationships with new physicians and physician groups. In addition to a base salary, each representative receives a bonus based upon success.

&#160;

&#160; 12 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Payor Marketing 

&#160;

Our marketing team regularly meets with managed care organizations and insurance companies to solicit contracts and meet with existing contracting payors to solidify those relationships. The comprehensiveness of our services, the geographic location of our facilities and the reputation of the physicians with whom we contract all serve as tools for obtaining new or repeat business from payors.

&#160;

Sports Marketing Program 

&#160;

RadNet Inc. has a sports marketing division. We provide diagnostic digital X-ray services for the Los Angeles Lakers, Clippers, Kings and Sparks at the Staples Center. X-ray is performed at the Coliseum for the University of California football team. In exchange for these services, each team provides RadNet with season tickets, parking and advertising space in the program book. RadNet also provides radiology services at many of our imaging centers for the Los Angeles Angels, Anaheim Ducks, Oakland Athletics and Los Angeles Kiss Arena Football.

&#160;

In December 2013 we entered into a three year sponsorship agreement with the Baltimore Ravens of the National Football League which permits us to state &#8220;Proud Imaging Provider of the Baltimore Ravens&#8221;.

&#160;

Suppliers 

&#160;

Historically, we have acquired our diagnostic imaging equipment from large suppliers such as GE Medical Systems, Inc., Hologic, Phillips, Hitachi, Carestream and others, and we purchase medical supplies from various national vendors. We believe that we have excellent working relationships with all of our major vendors. There are several comparable vendors for our supplies that would be available to us if one of our current vendors becomes unavailable.

&#160;

We primarily acquire our equipment with cash or through various financing arrangements with equipment vendors and third party equipment finance companies involving the use of capital leases with purchase options at minimal prices at the end of the lease term. At December 31, 2015, capital lease obligations, excluding interest, totaled approximately $16.4 million through 2021, including current installments totaling approximately $10.0 million. If we open or acquire additional imaging facilities, we may have to incur material capital lease obligations.

&#160;

Timely, effective maintenance is essential for achieving high utilization rates of our imaging equipment. We have an arrangement with GE Medical Systems, Inc. under which it has agreed to be responsible for the maintenance and repair of a majority of our equipment for a fee that is based upon a percentage of our revenue, subject to a minimum payment.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The market for outpatient diagnostic imaging services is highly competitive. We compete locally for patients with groups of radiologists, established hospitals, clinics and other independent organizations that own and operate imaging equipment. Our competitors include Alliance Healthcare Services, Inc., to the extent it sells diagnostic services directly to outpatients, Diagnostic Imaging Group and several smaller regional competitors. In addition, some physician practices have established their own diagnostic imaging facilities within their group practices to compete with us. We experience additional competition as a result of those activities.

&#160;

We compete principally on the basis of our reputation, our ability to provide multiple modalities at many of our facilities, the location of our facilities, the quality of our diagnostic imaging services and technologists and the ability to establish and maintain relationships with healthcare providers and referring physicians. See &#8220;Competitive Strengths&#8221; above. Some of our competitors may now or in the future have access to greater financial resources than we do and may have access to newer, more advanced equipment

&#160;

Each of the non-BRMG contracted radiology practices has entered into agreements with its physician shareholders and full-time employed radiologists that generally prohibit those shareholders and radiologists from competing for a period of two years within defined geographic regions after they cease to be owners or employees, as applicable. In certain states, like California, a covenant not to compete is enforced in limited circumstances involving the sale of a business. In other states, a covenant not to compete will be enforced only:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; to the extent it is necessary to protect a legitimate business interest of the party seeking enforcement; &#160;

&#160; &#183; if it does not unreasonably restrain the party against whom enforcement is sought; and &#160;

&#160; &#183; if it is not contrary to public interest. &#160;

Enforceability of a non-compete covenant is determined by a court based on all of the facts and circumstances of the specific case at the time enforcement is sought. For this reason, it is not possible to predict whether or to what extent a court will enforce the contracted radiology practices&#8217; covenants. The inability of the contracted radiology practices or us to enforce radiologist&#8217;s non-compete covenants could result in increased competition from individuals who are knowledgeable about our business strategies and operations.

&#160;

&#160;

Liability Insurance 

&#160;

We maintain insurance policies with coverage we believe is appropriate in light of the risks attendant to our business and consistent with industry practice. However, adequate liability insurance may not be available to us in the future at acceptable costs or at all. We maintain general liability insurance and professional liability insurance in commercially reasonable amounts. Additionally, we maintain workers&#8217; compensation insurance on all of our employees. Coverage is placed on a statutory basis and corresponds to individual state&#8217;s requirements.

&#160;

Pursuant to our agreements with physician groups with whom we contract, including BRMG, each group must maintain medical malpractice insurance for each physician in the group, having coverage limits of not less than $1.0 million per incident and $3.0 million in the aggregate per year.

&#160;

California&#8217;s medical malpractice cap further reduces our exposure. California places a $250,000 limit on non-economic damages for medical malpractice cases. Non-economic damages are defined as compensation for pain, suffering, inconvenience, physical impairment, disfigurement and other non-pecuniary injury. The cap applies whether the case is for injury or death, and it allows only one $250,000 recovery in a wrongful death case. No cap applies to economic damages. Other states in which we now operate do not have similar limitations and in those states we believe our insurance coverage to be sufficient.

&#160;

Regulation 

&#160;

General 

&#160;

The healthcare industry is highly regulated, and we can give no assurance that the regulatory environment in which we operate will not change significantly in the future. Our ability to operate profitably will depend in part upon us, and the contracted radiology practices and their affiliated physicians obtaining and maintaining all necessary licenses and other approvals, and operating in compliance with applicable healthcare regulations. We believe that healthcare regulations will continue to change. Therefore, we monitor developments in healthcare law and modify our operations from time to time as the business and regulatory environment changes.

&#160;

Licensing and Certification Laws 

&#160;

Ownership, construction, operation, expansion and acquisition of diagnostic imaging facilities are subject to various federal and state laws, regulations and approvals concerning licensing of facilities and personnel. In addition, free-standing diagnostic imaging facilities that provide services not performed as part of a physician office must meet Medicare requirements to be certified as an independent diagnostic testing facility before it can be authorized to bill the Medicare program. We have experienced a slowdown in the credentialing of our physicians over the last several years which has lengthened our billing and collection cycle.

&#160;

Corporate Practice of Medicine 

&#160;

In the states in which we operate, other than Florida, a lay person or any entity other than a professional corporation or other similar professional organization is not allowed to practice medicine, including by employing professional persons or by having any ownership interest or profit participation in or control over any medical professional practice. The laws of such states also prohibit a lay person or a non-professional entity from exercising control over the medical judgments or decisions of physicians and from engaging in certain financial arrangements, such as splitting professional fees with physicians. We structure our relationships with the radiology practices, including the purchase of diagnostic imaging facilities, in a manner that we believe keeps us from engaging in the practice of medicine, exercising control over the medical judgments or decisions of the radiology practices or their physicians, or violating the prohibitions against fee-splitting.

&#160;

Medicare and Medicaid Fraud and Abuse &#8211; Federal Anti-kickback Statute 

&#160;

During the year ended December 31, 2015, approximately 20% of our revenue generated at our diagnostic imaging centers was derived from federal government sponsored healthcare programs (Medicare) and 3% from state sponsored programs (Medicaid).

&#160;

Federal law known as the Anti-kickback Statute prohibits the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for, or to induce, (i) the referral of a person, (ii) the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of items or services reimbursable under the Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs or (iii) the purchase, lease or order or arranging or recommending purchasing, leasing or ordering of any item or service reimbursable under the Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs. Enforcement of this anti-kickback law is a high priority for the federal government, which has substantially increased enforcement resources and is scheduled to continue increasing such resources. Noncompliance with the federal Anti-kickback Statute can result in exclusion from the Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs and civil and criminal penalties.

&#160;

&#160; 14 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The Anti-kickback Statute is broad, and it prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. Recognizing that the Anti-kickback Statute is broad and may technically prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements within the healthcare industry, the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued regulations in July of 1991, which the Department has referred to as &#8220;safe harbors.&#8221; These safe harbor regulations set forth certain provisions which, if met in form and substance, will assure healthcare providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the federal Anti-kickback Statute. Additional safe harbor provisions providing similar protections have been published intermittently since 1991. Our arrangements with physicians, physician practice groups, hospitals and other persons or entities who are in a position to refer may not fully meet the stringent criteria specified in the various safe harbors. Although full compliance with these provisions ensures against prosecution under the federal Anti-kickback Statute, the failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit within a specific safe harbor does not necessarily mean that the transaction or arrangement is illegal or that prosecution under the federal Anti-kickback Statute will be pursued.

&#160;

Although some of our arrangements may not fall within a safe harbor, we believe that such business arrangements do not violate the Anti-kickback Statute because we are careful to structure them to reflect fair value and ensure that the reasons underlying our decision to enter into a business arrangement comport with reasonable interpretations of the Anti-kickback Statute. However, even though we continuously strive to comply with the requirements of the Anti-kickback Statute, liability under the Anti-kickback Statute may still arise because of the intentions or actions of the parties with whom we do business. While we are not aware of any such intentions or actions, we have only limited knowledge regarding the intentions or actions underlying those arrangements. Conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy one of these safe harbor provisions may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities such as the Office of the Inspector General.

&#160;

Medicare and Medicaid Fraud and Abuse &#8211; Stark Law 

&#160;

Congress has placed significant legal prohibitions against physician referrals including the Ethics in Patient Referral Act of 1989 which is commonly known as the Stark Law. The Stark Law prohibits a physician from referring Medicare patients to an entity providing designated health services, as defined under the Stark Law, including, without limitation, radiology services, in which the physician (or immediate family member) has an ownership or investment interest or with which the physician (or immediate family member) has entered into a compensation arrangement. The Stark Law also prohibits the entity from billing for any such prohibited referral. The penalties for violating the Stark Law include a prohibition on payment by these governmental programs and civil penalties of as much as $15,000 for each violation referral and $100,000 for participation in a circumvention scheme. We believe that, although we receive fees under our service agreements for management and administrative services, we are not in a position to make or influence referrals of patients.

&#160;

Under the Stark Law, radiology and certain other imaging services and radiation therapy services and supplies are services included in the designated health services subject to the self-referral prohibition. Such services include the professional and technical components of any diagnostic test or procedure using X-rays, ultrasound or other imaging services, CT, MRI, radiation therapy and diagnostic mammography services (but not screening mammography services). PET and nuclear medicine procedures are also included as designated health services under the Stark Law. The Stark Law, however, excludes from designated health services: (i) X-ray, fluoroscopy or ultrasound procedures that require the insertion of a needle, catheter, tube or probe through the skin or into a body orifice; (ii) radiology procedures that are integral to the performance of, and performed during, non-radiological medical procedures; and (iii) invasive or interventional radiology, because the radiology services in these procedures are merely incidental or secondary to another procedure that the physician has ordered.

&#160;

The Stark Law provides that a request by a radiologist for diagnostic radiology services or a request by a radiation oncologist for radiation therapy, if such services are furnished by or under the supervision of such radiologist or radiation oncologist pursuant to a consultation requested by another physician, does not constitute a referral by a referring physician. If such requirements are met, the Stark Law self-referral prohibition would not apply to such services. The effect of the Stark Law on the radiology practices, therefore, will depend on the precise scope of services furnished by each such practice&#8217;s radiologists and whether such services derive from consultations or are self-generated.

&#160;

We believe that, other than self-referred patients, all of the services covered by the Stark Law provided by the contracted radiology practices derive from requests for consultation by non-affiliated physicians. Therefore, we believe that the Stark Law is not implicated by the financial relationships between our operations and the contracted radiology practices. In addition, we believe that we have structured our acquisitions of the assets of existing practices, and we intend to structure any future acquisitions, so as not to violate the Anti-kickback Statute and Stark Law and regulations. Specifically, we believe the consideration paid by us to physicians to acquire the tangible and intangible assets associated with their practices is consistent with fair value in arms&#8217; length transactions and is not intended to induce the referral of patients or other business generated by such physicians. Should any such practice be deemed to constitute an arrangement designed to induce the referral of Medicare or Medicaid patients, then our acquisitions could be viewed as possibly violating anti-kickback and anti-referral laws and regulations. A determination of liability under any such laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

&#160;

&#160;

Medicare and Medicaid Fraud and Abuse &#8211; General 

&#160;

The federal government embarked on an initiative to audit all Medicare carriers, which are the companies that adjudicate and pay Medicare claims. These audits are expected to intensify governmental scrutiny of individual providers. An unsatisfactory audit of any of our diagnostic imaging facilities or contracted radiology practices could result in any or all of the following: significant repayment obligations, exclusion from the Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs, and civil and criminal penalties.

&#160;

Federal regulatory and law enforcement authorities have increased enforcement activities with respect to Medicare, Medicaid fraud and abuse regulations and other reimbursement laws and rules, including laws and regulations that govern our activities and the activities of the radiology practices. The federal government also has increased funding to fight healthcare fraud and is coordinating its enforcement efforts among various agencies, such as the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, and state Medicaid fraud control units. The government may investigate our or the radiology practices&#8217; activities, claims may be made against us or the radiology practices and these increased enforcement activities may directly or indirectly have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

&#160;

State Anti-kickback and Physician Self-referral Laws 

&#160;

Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-kickback Statute. Some of these state prohibitions apply to referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Although we believe that we comply with both federal and state Anti-kickback laws, any finding of a violation of these laws could subject us to criminal and civil penalties or possible exclusion from federal or state healthcare programs. Such penalties would adversely affect our financial performance and our ability to operate our business.

&#160;

Federal False Claims Act 

&#160;

The federal False Claims Act provides, in part, that the federal government may bring a lawsuit against any person who it believes has knowingly presented, or caused to be presented, a false or fraudulent request for payment from the federal government, or who has made a false statement or used a false record to get a claim approved. The federal False Claims Act further provides that a lawsuit thereunder may be initiated in the name of the United States by an individual, a &#8220;whistleblower,&#8221; who is an original source of the allegations. The government has taken the position that claims presented in violation of the federal anti-kickback law or Stark Law may be considered a violation of the federal False Claims Act. Penalties include civil penalties of not less than $5,500 and not more than $11,000 for each false claim, plus three times the amount of damages that the federal government sustained because of the act of that person.

&#160;

Further, on May 20, 2009, President Obama signed into law the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 (FERA), which greatly expanded the types of entities and conduct subject to the False Claims Act. Also, various states are considering or have enacted laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act. Under the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, or DRA, states are being encouraged to adopt false claims acts similar to the federal False Claims Act, which establish liability for submission of fraudulent claims to the State Medicaid program and contain whistleblower provisions. Even in instances when a whistleblower action is dismissed with no judgment or settlement, we may incur substantial legal fees and other costs relating to an investigation. Future actions under the False Claims Act may result in significant fines and legal fees, which would adversely affect our financial performance and our ability to operate our business.

&#160;

We believe that we are in compliance with the rules and regulations that apply to the federal False Claims Act as well as its state counterparts.

&#160;

Healthcare Reform Legislation 

&#160;

Healthcare reform legislation enacted in the first quarter of 2010 by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or PPACA, specifically requires the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, in computing physician practice expense relative value units, to increase the equipment utilization factor for advanced diagnostic imaging services (such as MRI, CT and PET) from a presumed utilization rate of 50% to 65% for 2010 through 2012, 70% in 2013, and 75% thereafter. Excluded from the adjustment are low-technology imaging modalities such as ultrasound, X-ray and fluoroscopy. The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (H.R. 4872) or Reconciliation Act, which was passed by the Senate and approved by the President on March 30, 2010, amends the provision for higher presumed utilization of advanced diagnostic imaging services to a presumed rate of 75%. The higher utilization rate was fully implemented in the beginning of 2011 and replaced the phase-in approach provided in the PPACA. This utilization rate was further increased to 90% by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (&#8220;ATRA&#8221;), effective as of January 1, 2014.

&#160;

&#160; 16 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The aim of increased utilization of diagnostic imaging services is to spread the cost of the equipment and services over a greater number of scans, resulting in a lower cost per scan. These changes have precipitated reductions in federal reimbursement for medical imaging and result in decreased revenue for the scans we perform for Medicare beneficiaries. Other changes in reimbursement for services rendered by Medicare Advantage plans may also reduce the revenues we receive for services rendered to Medicare Advantage enrollees.

&#160; 

Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 

&#160;

Congress enacted the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, in part, to combat healthcare fraud and to protect the privacy and security of patients&#8217; individually identifiable healthcare information. HIPAA, among other things, amends existing crimes and criminal penalties for Medicare fraud and enacts new federal healthcare fraud crimes, including actions affecting non-government healthcare benefit programs. Under HIPAA, a healthcare benefit program includes any private plan or contract affecting interstate commerce under which any medical benefit, item or service is provided. A person or entity that knowingly and willfully obtains the money or property of any healthcare benefit program by means of false or fraudulent representations in connection with the delivery of healthcare services is subject to a fine or imprisonment, or potentially both. In addition, HIPAA authorizes the imposition of civil money penalties against entities that employ or enter into contracts with excluded Medicare or Medicaid program participants if such entities provide services to federal health program beneficiaries. A finding of liability under HIPAA could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

&#160;

Further, HIPAA requires healthcare providers and their business associates to maintain the privacy and security of individually identifiable protected health information (&#8220;PHI&#8221;). HIPAA imposes federal standards for electronic transactions, for the security of electronic health information and for protecting the privacy of PHI. The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (&#8220;HITECH&#8221;), signed into law on February 17, 2009, dramatically expanded, among other things, (1) the scope of HIPAA to now apply directly to &#8220;business associates,&#8221; or independent contractors who receive or obtain PHI in connection with providing a service to a covered entity, (2) substantive security and privacy obligations, including new federal security breach notification requirements to affected individuals, DHHS and prominent media outlets, of certain breaches of unsecured PHI, (3) restrictions on marketing communications and a prohibition on covered entities or business associates from receiving remuneration in exchange for PHI, and (4) the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed for HIPAA violations, increasing the annual cap in penalties from $25,000 to $1.5 million per year.

&#160;

In addition, many states have enacted comparable privacy and security statutes or regulations that, in some cases, are more stringent than HIPAA requirements. In those cases it may be necessary to modify our operations and procedures to comply with the more stringent state laws, which may entail significant and costly changes for us. We believe that we are in compliance with such state laws and regulations. However, if we fail to comply with applicable state laws and regulations, we could be subject to additional sanctions.

&#160;

We believe that we are in compliance with the current HIPAA requirements, as amended by HITECH, and comparable state laws, but we anticipate that we may encounter certain costs associated with future compliance. Moreover, we cannot guarantee that enforcement agencies or courts will not make interpretations of the HIPAA standards that are inconsistent with ours, or the interpretations of our contracted radiology practices or their affiliated physicians. A finding of liability under the HIPAA standards may result in significant criminal and civil penalties. Noncompliance also may result in exclusion from participation in government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. These actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

&#160; 

U.S. Food and Drug Administration or FDA 

&#160;

The FDA has issued the requisite pre-market approval for all of the MRI and CT systems we use. We do not believe that any further FDA approval is required in connection with the majority of equipment currently in operation or proposed to be operated, except under regulations issued by the FDA pursuant to the Mammography Quality Standards Act of 1992, as amended by the Mammography Quality Standards Reauthorization Acts of 1998 and 2004 (collectively, the MQSA). All mammography facilities are required to meet the applicable MQSA requirements, including quality standards, be accredited by an approved accreditation body or state agency and certified by the FDA or an FDA-approved certifying state agency. Pursuant to the accreditation process, each facility providing mammography services must comply with certain standards that include, among other things, annual inspection of the facility's equipment, personnel (interpreting physicians, technologists and medical physicists) and practices.

&#160;

&#160; 17 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Compliance with these MQSA requirements and standards is required to obtain Medicare payment for services provided to beneficiaries and to avoid various sanctions, including monetary penalties, or suspension of certification. Although the Mammography Accreditation Program of the American College of Radiology is an approved accreditation body and currently accredits all of our facilities which provide mammography services, and although we anticipate continuing to meet the requirements for accreditation, if we lose such accreditation, the FDA could revoke our certification. Congress has extended Medicare benefits to include coverage of screening mammography but coverage is subject to the facility performing the mammography meeting prescribed quality standards described above. The Medicare requirements to meet the standards apply to diagnostic mammography and image quality examination as well as screening mammography.

&#160;

Radiologist Licensing 

&#160;

The radiologists providing professional medical services at our facilities are subject to licensing and related regulations by the states in which they provide services. As a result, we require BRMG and the other radiology groups with which we contract to require those radiologists to have and maintain appropriate licensure. We do not believe that such laws and regulations will either prohibit or require licensure approval of our business operations, although no assurances can be made that such laws and regulations will not be interpreted to extend such prohibitions or requirements to our operations.

&#160;

Insurance Laws and Regulation 

&#160;

States in which we operate have adopted certain laws and regulations affecting risk assumption in the healthcare industry, including those that subject any physician or physician network engaged in risk-based managed care to applicable insurance laws and regulations. These laws and regulations may require physicians and physician networks to meet minimum capital requirements and other safety and soundness requirements. Implementing additional regulations or compliance requirements could result in substantial costs to the contracted radiology practices, limiting their ability to enter into capitated or other risk-sharing managed care arrangements and indirectly affecting our revenue from the contracted practices.

&#160;

U.S. Federal Budget and Sequestration 

&#160; 

We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from direct billings to governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and private health insurance companies and/or health plans, including but not limited to those participating in the Medicare Advantage program. As a result, any negative changes in governmental capitation or fee-for-service rates or methods of reimbursement for the services we provide could have a significant adverse impact on our revenue and financial results.

&#160;

Congress has a strong interest in reducing the federal debt, which may lead to new proposals designed to achieve savings by altering payment policies. The Budget Control Act of 2011 (&#8220;BCA&#8221;) established a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, which had the goal of achieving a reduction in the federal debt level of at least $1.2 trillion. As a result of the Joint Select Committee&#8217;s failure to draft a proposal by the BCA&#8217;s deadline, automatic cuts in various federal programs (excluding cuts to Medicaid but including cuts to Medicare provider reimbursement in an amount not to exceed 2%) were scheduled to commence on January 1, 2013. However, as a result of the enactment of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, on January 2, 2013, any such cuts were delayed until March 1, 2013 so as to allow the Congress sworn in on January 3, 2013 to consider whether to allow sequestration to take place or replace it with other cuts in federal spending and/or higher taxes.

&#160;

On March 1, 2013, the new Congress did not replace automatic cuts and a 2% cut to Medicare payments began April 1, 2013, which has negatively impacted our revenues. In addition, certain Congressional members have stated that the automatic federal spending cuts under the BCA are insufficient to achieve the BCA&#8217;s goals of reducing federal spending and, in turn, the federal deficit. Such members suggested additional cuts to federal entitlement programs, such as Medicare, to achieve the targeted deficit reductions. Therefore it is not possible at this time to estimate what further impact, if any, other federal Medicare provider reimbursement cuts will have on our integrated care business or results of operations.

&#160;

Because governmental healthcare programs generally reimburse on a fee schedule basis rather than on a charge-related basis, we generally cannot increase our revenues from these programs by increasing the amount of charges for services. Moreover, if our costs increase, we may not be able to recover our increased costs from these programs. Government and private payors have taken and may continue to take steps to control the cost, eligibility for, use, and delivery of healthcare services as a result of budgetary constraints, cost containment pressures and other reasons. We believe that these trends in cost containment will continue. These cost containment measures, and other market changes in non-governmental insurance plans have generally restricted our ability to recover, or shift to non-governmental payors, any increased costs that we experience. Our integrated care business and financial operations may be materially affected by these developments.

&#160;

&#160; 18 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Environmental Matters 

&#160;

The facilities we operate or manage generate hazardous and medical waste subject to federal and state requirements regarding handling and disposal. We believe that the facilities that we operate and manage are currently in compliance in all material respects with applicable federal, state and local statutes and ordinances regulating the handling and disposal of such materials. We do not believe that we will be required to expend any material additional amounts in order to remain in compliance with these laws and regulations or that compliance will materially affect our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.

&#160;

Compliance Program 

&#160;

We maintain a program to monitor compliance with federal and state laws and regulations applicable to healthcare entities. We have a compliance officer who is charged with implementing and supervising our compliance program, which includes the adoption of (i) Standards of Conduct for our employees and affiliates and (ii) a process that specifies how employees, affiliates and others may report regulatory or ethical concerns to our compliance officer. We believe that our compliance program meets the relevant standards provided by the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services.

&#160;

An important part of our compliance program consists of conducting periodic audits of various aspects of our operations and that of the contracted radiology practices. We also conduct mandatory educational programs designed to familiarize our employees with the regulatory requirements and specific elements of our compliance program.

&#160;
