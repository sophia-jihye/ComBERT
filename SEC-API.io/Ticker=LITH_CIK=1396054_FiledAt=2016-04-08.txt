&#160;

Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements.

&#160;

Our financial statements are stated in United States Dollars (US$) and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. 

&#160;

In this annual report, unless otherwise specified, all dollar amounts are expressed in United States dollars. All references to &#8220;US$&#8221; refer to United States dollars and all references to &#8220;common stock&#8221; refer to the common shares in our capital stock.

As used in this annual report, the terms &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221;, &#8220;our&#8221; and &#8220;our company&#8221; mean Rostock Ventures Corp., unless otherwise indicated. 

&#160;

Corporate History 

&#160;

We were incorporated on November 2, 2006, under the laws of the State of Nevada. The original business plan of our company was to engage in the acquisition and exploration of mineral properties. We are currently an exploration stage company. We have since added our business focus to the operation of a technology platform designed to connect consumers with cannabis vendors. We still look to expand our business in technology and/or mineral explorations. 

&#160;

On September 30, 2015 our board of directors and a majority of our stockholders approved an increase of our authorized capital from 100,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 to 500,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001. A Certificate of Amendment to effect the increase to our authorized capital was filed and became effective with the Nevada Secretary of State on October 20, 2015. 

&#160;

Current Business 

&#160;

Effective March 12, 2014, we entered into a patent, technical information and trade mark license agreement with Windward International LLC pursuant to which our company acquired an exclusive license to use certain patents, technical information and trademarks for a term of 500 years, in exchange for 4,000,000 shares of our company&#8217;s common stock and a 2% royalty on all net sales derived from the use of the patents, technical information and trademark. 

&#160;

Under the license agreement, our company acquired an exclusive license to make, use, sell and offer for sale licensed products during the term. The licensed products include the domain names www.iWeeds.com, and www.iWeedz.com, the platform that powers iWeedz.com, the Apple Developer license, Google Play license, iWeedz trademark, self-serve ad platform and augmented reality platform. Further, our company acquired an exclusive license to use the technical information during the term to make licensed products. The technical information includes any and all unpublished research and development information, the formulation of proprietary products, method, unpatented inventions, know-how, trade secrets, and technical data in the possession of Windward at the effective date of the license agreement, or generated or developed at any time prior to the termination or expiration of the license agreement. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Additional Potential New Projects and Board Member 

&#160;

Our company is actively searching for additional projects. These new areas have been narrowed down to technology, graphite, and lithium. At this time no new project has been identified or completed. With this in mind Rostock has added an additional board member Eric Allison. Mr. Allison has over 35 years of experience in the natural resource industry working in various technical, business development and management roles. He currently provides consulting services to a variety of companies, funds, project developers and individuals on a global basis. He formerly served, from 2012-2015, as CEO and COO of Brazahav Resources, a private entity developing a brownfield gold mine project in Mato Grosso, Brazil. Prior to this, he was the Director of Research and Chief Geologist at Casimir Capital LP specializing in junior mining companies. Previously, he was a Director at Sempra Commodities from 1999-2009 where his responsibilities included Metals &#38; Concentrates and Energy. Over his career, he has also served in various roles for Cyprus Amax Minerals, Amax Energy, SPG Exploration and Texaco. Mr. Allison received a BS in Geology from Brown University (1978) and a MS in Marine Geology from the University of Georgia (1980). 

`

Our Business 

&#160;

We operate iWeedz.com, a technology platform that we acquired from Windward pursuant to the license agreement, to connect consumers with cannabis vendors and promote local marijuana commerce. We will operate our technology platform through our website located at www.iWeedz.com and through our mobile application for Apple iOS and Android operating systems. We will strive for simplicity and ease of use in our iWeedz website and mobile application, which we believe will set us apart from our competition. As of the date of this report, our website is not fully functional and our application for Apple iOS and Android operating systems has not been released. 

&#160;

iWeedz will provide a simple and quick process for consumers to find the right cannabis products to meet their needs. Consumers who wish to use iWeedz must first create an account with iWeedz. Membership for consumers is free. Once an account is created, the member will be able to use iWeedz to locate local cannabis dispensaries to shop for cannabis products and to communicate with the dispensaries. As the member uses the iWeedz website and application, the iWeedz technology will gather specific information about the member by tracking accessed content, &#8216;liked&#8217; items, purchased items and the member&#8217;s profile. iWeedz will then use this information to match the member with the right cannabis vendor or to find deals that may be of interest to the member. 

&#160;

Members who are smart phone users will be able to take advantage of iWeedz&#8217;s mobile application which will automatically register a member&#8217;s geographic location and utilize proximity advertising to notify a member of real-time offers, coupons and discounts from vendors within the member&#8217;s vicinity. Members will be able to easily redeem offers that they receive from local vendors by displaying mobile coupons from the iWeedz application at the point of purchase. Unlike other popular internet advertising sites such as Groupon or Living Social, iWeedz customers will be able to redeem coupons without having to pay for them before making a purchase.

&#160;

iWeedz for cannabis vendors will provide a cloud based solution to manage their inventory, post daily deals, attract new customers with proximity marketing via mobile phones, and engage with customers via e-mail and text messaging. With iWeedz, vendors will also be able to deploy a targeted marketing campaign to attract iWeedz members and build their customer base. For example, vendors could target local iWeedz customers by utilizing proximity advertising to offer real-time discounts on their products to iWeedz members who agree to provide their e-mail addresses and/or phone numbers. When these iWeedz members redeem the discount and make a purchase, the vendor can market future discounts and deals to the customer via sms (text messaging) or e-mail. A cannabis vendor will also be required to create an account to become a member. Membership for a vendor is free if the vendor only wishes to be listed as a dispensary on the website and application. However, if the member wants to be able to offer promotions and discounts or to interact with member consumers, they will be required to pay a monthly service fee, the amount of which has yet to be determined. We believe that our proximity marketing will attract a wide audience of consumers who are actively seeking and redeeming marijuana coupons. We further believe that the self-serve coupon feature will appeal to other cannabis vendors looking to reach local customers. 

&#160;

iWeedz will generate revenue by charging member cannabis vendors a monthly fee and by selling banner space on its website and application to these vendors. The banners will be viewable by iWeedz consumer members who are within the vendor&#8217;s geographic location and who indicate an interest in the vendor or its products, based on the member&#8217;s profile or specific user information gathered by the iWeedz technology. We believe iWeedz&#8217;s targeted market intelligence will allow us to charge a premium for ad space. As of the date of this report, we have not yet determined the cost to our vendors for banner space.

Target Market 

&#160;

Our target market includes both businesses and consumers in the local marijuana industry. iWeedz is intended for all types of cannabis consumers including those new to cannabis, medical marijuana patients, or recreational consumers, if recreational use is legally permitted in the consumer&#8217;s state of residence. iWeedz also targets both medicinal and recreational dispensaries, depending on whether the specific geographical location legally permits recreational marijuana use. 

&#160;

Our target market further includes consumers who are frequent users of the internet, mobile phones and other mobile devices to locate retailers, conduct online research and act on promotions such as daily deals, coupons or discounts. 

&#160;

Industry 

&#160;

According to CCS Insight, a provider of market information, analysis and intelligence, over 6.6 billion mobile phones will be in use by the end of 2017. 1 Two-thirds of them will be smartphones, up from less than 25 percent in 2012. 2 The mobile and media analyst firm expected 1.86 billion mobile phones to be shipped in 2013, of which 53 percent would be smartphones. 3 At the same time, sales of tablets are rising at a staggering rate. Altogether, global shipments of smart mobile devices (smartphones and tablets) will increase 2.5 times between 2012 and 2017, to reach 2.1 billion units. 4 &#160; CCS Insight predicts that by 2017 the combined number of mobile phones and tablets in use will exceed the world&#8217;s population. 5 

&#160;

According to an October 21, 2013 article from eMarketer, mobile devices played a significant part in digital couponing in 2013 - more than 28% of people who own a mobile device redeemed a coupon in 2013. Nearly 70% of mobile coupon users will access coupons via their smartphones. eMarketer expected one-third of all smartphone users ages 18 and older, or 42.1 million people, to use a coupon obtained via app, mobile internet, mobile barcode or SMS (text messaging) in 2013. The U.S. adult smartphone coupon user base was up 40.9% in 2013, following 60.6% growth in 2012. New smartphone users, as well as the growing popularity of new mobile apps, local deals, and the integration of couponing into social networks will help fuel increases. 6

&#160;

We believe that the adoption of location-based technologies will further contribute to this growth. Location-based services provide location-specific services to users whose location is ascertained through GPS or wireless networks. The market for location-based services already stands at $2.9 billion, and was expected to rise to $8.3 billion by 2014, according to market research firm Gartner 7 . Market research firm ABI was even more bullish on the sector: it predicted that location-based services would generate $14 billion in 2014. 8 

&#160;

Finally, the retail marijuana market in the U.S. is estimated at approximately $30 billion, according to a cover story in the financial publication &#8220;Barron&#8217;s&#8221; (Barron&#8217;s cover story June 3, 2013 9 ). Currently 21 states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana for medicinal use, with Colorado and Washington also approved recreational use. It is predicted that other states will soon follow these trends towards legalizing marijuana for medicinal use and recreational use. 

&#160;

Plan of Operation 

&#160;

On February 11, 2014, we soft launched our website. As of the date of this Report, our website is not fully functional and we are working to further develop the site. We are still in development for our mobile application for Apple iOS and Android operating systems. 

&#160;

To increase brand awareness and draw traffic to our website and mobile application, our company will utilize the techniques described herein under the section entitled &#8220;Marketing and Advertising.&#8221; Our company may look to hire an outside marketing firm to gain greater exposure to marijuana dispensaries, deepen our relationships with existing member vendors and attract new dispensaries. 

&#160;

Our company will strive to achieve the following objectives: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Attract consumers in local marijuana markets. 

&#183; 

Grow our base of consumers and vendors. 

&#183; 

Build the brand into a household name. 

&#183; 

Establish our company as a trusted resource for consumers and vendors. 

&#183; 

Invest in research and development to improve the features, functionality and technology of our iWeedz platform. 

&#183; 

Improve our market intelligence to further customize deals, offers and discounts on cannabis products to meet the needs of our member consumers. 

&#183; 

Expand our business nationally. 

&#160;

Marketing and Advertising 

&#160;

Our company will utilize a variety of marketing and advertising techniques to create a local, community-focused platform for cannabis businesses and consumers, and to raise awareness of the iWeedz brand. These techniques include online methods, traditional methods, and word-of-mouth advertising. Our company will also engage a marketing firm to create and develop strong relationships with marijuana dispensaries.

&#160; 

Online methods 

&#160;

&#183; 

Website: Our company will use search engine optimization to draw traffic to our website. 

&#183; 

Viral marketing: Viral marketing efforts will include cross-marketing with other websites, publishing videos on video platforms such as YouTube, and establishing a presence and posting regularly on social networking sites, including Facebook, Twitter and Google+. 

&#183; 

Proximity marketing : Proximity marketing is the localized wireless distribution of advertising content associated with a particular place. Proximity marketing provides a new path for retailers to reach their target consumers by capitalizing on the activities that consumers are already involved in. Proximity marketing provides a high level of interactivity between the consumer and the specific location market retailer. 

&#183; 

Internet advertising: Our company will use a combination of Internet advertising, including cost-per-click, Google AdWords, tags, and banner ads as appropriate. This multi-pronged effort will help generate interest in our company from the online community and general public. 

&#160;

Word of Mouth 

&#160;

&#183; 

Our company is committed to offering a superior online experience in order to generate a solid and positive reputation within the marijuana industry. It is our goal for iWeedz&#8217;s users to recommend our company&#8217;s services to their friends, family members, and professional peers. Through this simple marketing tactic, it is our hope that iWeedz will become recognized as the industry&#8217;s online marketplace leader. 

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

Primary competitors are WeedMaps and Leafly, who also compete with each other to be the most popular website and application for consumers seeking medical and recreational marijuana. WeedMaps is an online website and mobile application where marijuana consumers connect with other marijuana consumers in their geographic region to locate, discuss and review local cannabis co-operatives, dispensaries, medical doctors and delivery services. Leafly is an online website and mobile application resource that allows users to rate and review different strains of cannabis and cannabis dispensaries. Leafly helps patients determine which cannabis strain is appropriate for their particular symptoms and then directs the patients to dispensaries. Both WeedMaps and Leafly allow users to search for dispensaries and strain availability, but are branded very differently, receive search engine optimization (organic search) traffic from different keywords, and have slightly different visitor demographics. &#160; WeedMaps focuses primarily on dispensary locations, while Leafly focuses more on the strains available at dispensaries. Both companies generate revenue by charging dispensaries to upload information about their shops and strain offerings. 

&#160;

We also face significant competition from retailers, deal-based websites, cash back and loyalty websites, search engines, social networks, and comparison shopping websites. Some of these competitors include Groupon, Living Social, Citysearch, Yelp and Google, which offer daily deals from local retailers and/or provide information, reviews and guides in certain geographic areas for various industries, including the marijuana industry. 

&#160;

Many of our actual and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages over us, such as superior name recognition, substantially greater financial, technical and other resources and longer operating histories in relevant geographies. We believe that we will be able to compete on the basis of our simple and easy to use website and mobile application and our centered attention on the local marijuana industry. We hope that by focusing solely on marijuana, we will be able to become a trusted name for consumers and businesses in the marijuana industry. Further, we will build upon our following strengths: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Free membership for consumers. 

&#183; 

Social media incorporation. 

&#183; 

Complex technology made simple. 

&#183; 

Integration with mobile application. 

&#183; 

Extensive, categorical searchability. 

&#183; 

Sleek, user-friendly site design. 

&#183; 

Focus on local, individual communities. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

Our company acquired an exclusive license to use certain patents, technical information and trademarks for a term of 500 years, pursuant to the license agreement with Windward dated March 12, 2014, including the domain names www.iWeeds.com, www.iWeedz.com and the platform that powers iWeeds.com. 

&#160;

Government Regulations 

&#160;

We are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet and e-commerce. Existing and future regulations and laws could impede the growth of the Internet or other online services. These regulations and laws may involve taxation, tariffs, subscriber privacy, anti-spam, data protection, content, copyrights, distribution, electronic contracts and other communications, consumer protection, the provision of online payment services and the characteristics and quality of services. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as sales and other taxes, libel and personal privacy apply to the Internet as the vast majority of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the Internet and do not contemplate or address the unique issues raised by the Internet or e-commerce. In addition, it is possible that government entities or public interest groups may seek to censor content available on our website and application or may even attempt to completely block our emails or access to our websites. Adverse legal or regulatory developments could substantially harm our business. In particular, in the event that we are restricted, in whole or in part, from operating in certain locations, our ability to increase our customer base may be adversely affected. Currently, we believe we are in compliance with such government regulations and laws. 

&#160;

Additionally, a variety of federal and state laws and regulations govern the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of consumer data. The existing privacy-related laws and regulations are evolving and subject to potentially differing interpretations. In addition, various federal and state legislative and regulatory bodies may expand current or enact new laws regarding privacy matters. For example, recently there have been Congressional hearings and increased attention to the capture and use of location-based information relating to users of smartphones and other mobile devices. We intend to post privacy policies and practices concerning the collection, use and disclosure of member data on our website and application. Several Internet companies have incurred substantial penalties for failing to abide by the representations made in their privacy policies and practices. In addition, several states have adopted legislation that requires businesses to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices to protect sensitive personal information and to provide notice to consumers in the event of a security breach. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any data-related consent orders, Federal Trade Commission requirements or orders or other federal or state privacy or consumer protection-related laws, regulations or industry self-regulatory principles, could result in claims, proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others or other liabilities, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, a failure or perceived failure to comply with industry standards or with our own privacy policies and practices could result in a loss of consumer members or vendors and adversely affect our business. Federal and state governmental authorities also continue to evaluate the privacy implications inherent in the use of third party web &#8220;cookies&#8221; for behavioral advertising. The regulation of these &#8220;cookies&#8221; and other current online advertising practices could adversely affect our business. 

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

We have no employees. Our officers and directors provide their services to our company as independent consultants. 

&#160;

REPORTS TO SECURITY HOLDERS 

&#160;

We are required to file annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission and our filings are available to the public over the internet at the Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s website at http://www.sec.gov. The public may read and copy any materials filed by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission at the Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street N.E. Washington D.C. 20549. The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the Securities and Exchange Commission at 1-800-732-0330. The SEC also maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC, at http://www.sec.gov.
