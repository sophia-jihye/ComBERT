 Item 1. Business Overview 

We are one of the world&#146;s largest companies whose business is focused almost entirely on vacation ownership, based on number of owners, number of resorts and revenues. We are the exclusive worldwide developer, marketer, seller and manager of vacation ownership and related products under the Marriott Vacation Club and Grand Residences by Marriott brands. We are also the exclusive worldwide developer, marketer and seller of vacation ownership and related products under The Ritz-Carlton Destination Club brand, and we have the non-exclusive right to develop, market and sell whole ownership residential products under The Ritz-Carlton Residences brand. 

Our business is grouped into three reportable segments: North America, Europe and Asia Pacific. As of January 1, 2016, our portfolio consisted of 61 properties in the United States and eight other countries and territories, including two hotels that we intend to convert to vacation ownership interests. We generate most of our revenues from four primary sources: selling vacation ownership products; managing our resorts; financing consumer purchases of vacation ownership products; and renting vacation ownership inventory. 

Our strategic goal is to further strengthen our leadership position in the vacation ownership industry through initiatives to drive profitable contract sales growth, maximize cash flow and optimize our capital structure, selectively pursue compelling new business opportunities, and focus on our owners, guests and associates. We believe that we have significant competitive advantages, including our scale and global reach, the quality and strength of the Marriott and Ritz-Carlton brands, our system of high-quality resorts, our loyal and highly satisfied customer base, our long-standing track record and our experienced management team and associates. 

The Vacation Ownership Industry 

The vacation ownership industry (also known as the timeshare industry) enables customers to share ownership and use of fully-furnished vacation accommodations. Typically, a purchaser acquires an interest (known as a &#147;vacation ownership interest&#148;) that is either a real estate ownership interest (known as a &#147;timeshare estate&#148;) or a contractual right-to-use interest (known as a &#147;timeshare license&#148;) in a single resort or a collection of resort properties. In the United States, most vacation ownership products are sold as timeshare estates, which can be structured in a variety of ways including, but not limited to, a deeded interest in a specified accommodation unit, an undivided interest in a building or an entire resort, or a beneficial interest in a trust that owns one or more resort properties. By purchasing a vacation ownership interest, owners make a commitment to vacation. For many purchasers, vacation ownership provides an attractive alternative to traditional lodging accommodations (such as hotels, resorts and condominium rentals). In addition to avoiding the volatility in room rates to which traditional lodging customers are subject, vacation ownership purchasers also enjoy accommodations that are, on average, more than twice the size of traditional hotel rooms and typically have more features, such as kitchens and separate living areas. Purchasers who might otherwise buy a second home find vacation ownership a preferable alternative because it is more affordable and reduces maintenance and upkeep concerns. 

Typically, developers sell vacation ownership interests for a fixed purchase price that is paid in full at closing or financed with a loan. Many vacation ownership companies provide financing or facilitate access to third-party bank financing for customers. Vacation ownership resorts are often managed by a nonprofit property owners&#146; association of which owners of vacation ownership interests are members. Most property owners&#146; associations are governed by a board of directors that includes owners and which may include representatives of the developer. Some vacation ownership resorts are held through a trust structure in which a trustee holds title and manages the property. The board of the property owners&#146; association, or trustee, as applicable, typically delegates much of the responsibility for managing the resort to a management company, which is often affiliated with the developer. 

&#160;

After the initial purchase, most vacation ownership programs require the owner of the vacation ownership interest to pay an annual maintenance fee. This fee represents the owner&#146;s allocable share of the costs and expenses of operating and maintaining the vacation ownership property and providing program services. This fee typically covers expenses such as housekeeping, landscaping, taxes, insurance and resort labor, a property management fee payable to the management company for providing management services, and an assessment to fund a capital asset reserve account used to renovate, refurbish and replace furnishings, common areas and other assets (such as parking lots or roofs) as needed over time. Owners typically reserve their usage of vacation accommodations in advance through a reservation system (often provided by the management company or an affiliated entity), unless a vacation ownership interest specifies fixed usage dates and a particular unit every year. 

The vacation ownership industry has grown through expansion of established vacation ownership developers as well as entrance into the market of well-known lodging and entertainment companies, including Marriott International, Wyndham Worldwide Corporation, Starwood Hotels &#38; Resorts Worldwide, Inc., Hilton Hotels Corporation, Hyatt Hotels Corporation and The Walt Disney Company. The industry&#146;s growth can also be attributed to increased market acceptance of vacation ownership products, stronger consumer protection laws and the evolution of vacation ownership interests from a fixed- or floating-week product, which provides the right to use the same property every year, to membership in multi-resort vacation networks, which offer a more flexible vacation experience. These vacation networks often issue their members an annual allotment of points that can be redeemed for stays at affiliated vacation ownership resorts or for alternative vacation experiences available through the program. 

To enhance the flexibility and appeal of their products, many vacation ownership developers affiliate their projects with vacation ownership exchange service providers so that owners may exchange their rights to use the developer&#146;s resorts for accommodation at other resorts in the exchange service provider&#146;s broader network of properties. The two leading exchange service providers are Interval International, with which we are associated, and RCI. According to their websites, Interval International&#146;s and RCI&#146;s networks include more than 2,900 and nearly 4,500 affiliated resorts, respectively, as identified on each company&#146;s website. 

According to the American Resort Development Association (&#147;ARDA&#148;), a trade association representing the vacation ownership and resort development industries, as of December 31, 2014, the U.S. vacation ownership community was comprised of over 1,500 resorts, representing over 198,000 units and an estimated 8.7 million vacation ownership week equivalents. According to ARDA, sales in the U.S. market were $7.9 billion in 2014. We believe there is considerable potential for further growth in the industry both in the U.S. and globally. 

Our History 

We recently celebrated our 30-year anniversary of providing vacation memories and experiences to millions of families. Prior to the incorporation of Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corporation in Delaware in June 2011, our operations were the vacation ownership division of Marriott International. Marriott International completed the spin-off of its vacation ownership division on November 21, 2011 (the &#147;Spin-Off&#148;). Since the Spin-Off, we have been an independent public company, with our common stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol &#147;VAC&#148; and our corporate headquarters located in Orlando, Florida. 

Since 1984, when Marriott became the first major lodging company to enter the vacation ownership industry with its acquisition of American Resorts, a small vacation ownership company, we have been recognized as a leader and innovator in the vacation ownership industry. Marriott International leveraged its well-known &#147;Marriott&#148; brand to sell vacation ownership intervals, which were frequently located at resorts developed adjacent to Marriott International hotels. Over time, the company differentiated its offerings through its high-quality resorts that were purpose-built for vacation ownership, exchange opportunities available under its Marriott Rewards customer loyalty program that increased the flexibility of use of ownership, its dedication to excellent customer service and its commitment to ethical business practices. These qualities encouraged repeat business and word-of-mouth customer referrals. 

We have continuously worked with ARDA to encourage the enactment of responsible consumer-protection legislation and state regulation that enhances the reputation and respectability of the overall vacation 

&#160;

ownership industry. We believe that, over time, our vacation ownership products and services helped improve the public perception of the vacation ownership industry. A number of other major lodging companies later entered the vacation ownership business, further enhancing the industry&#146;s image and credibility. 

In connection with the Spin-Off, we entered into a License, Services, and Development Agreement (the &#147;Marriott License Agreement&#148;) with Marriott International and its subsidiary Marriott Worldwide Corporation and a License, Services, and Development Agreement (the &#147;Ritz-Carlton License Agreement&#148; and, together with the Marriott License Agreement, the &#147;License Agreements&#148;) with The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company, L.L.C. (&#147;The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company&#148;), a subsidiary of Marriott International. Under the License Agreements, we are granted the exclusive right, for the terms of the License Agreements, to use certain Marriott and Ritz-Carlton marks and intellectual property in our vacation ownership business, the exclusive right to use the Grand Residences by Marriott marks and intellectual property in our residential real estate business and the non-exclusive right to use certain Ritz-Carlton marks and intellectual property in our residential real estate business. We also entered into a Non-Competition Agreement with Marriott International (the &#147;Non-Competition Agreement&#148;), which generally prohibits Marriott International and its subsidiaries from engaging in the vacation ownership business and prohibits us and our subsidiaries from engaging in the hotel business until the earlier of November 21, 2021 or the termination of the Marriott License Agreement. 

Under the Marriott Rewards Affiliation Agreement that we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into with Marriott International and its subsidiary Marriott Rewards, LLC (the &#147;Marriott Rewards Agreement&#148;), we are allowed to continue to participate in the Marriott Rewards customer loyalty program following the Spin-Off; this participation includes the ability to purchase and use Marriott Rewards Points in connection with our Marriott-branded vacation ownership business. The Marriott Rewards Agreement is coterminous with the Marriott License Agreement. 

Our Business Strategy 

Our strategic goal is to further strengthen our leadership position in the vacation ownership industry. To achieve this goal, we are pursuing the following initiatives: 

Drive profitable contract sales growth 

We intend to continue to generate growth in vacation ownership sales by leveraging our globally recognized brand names and targeting high-quality inventory that allows us to add desirable new destinations to our system with new on-site sales locations. We expect to focus our efforts to generate growth through our two points-based ownership programs: Marriott Vacation Club Destinations TM (&#147;MVCD&#148;) and Marriott Vacation Club, Asia Pacific. We will also continue to focus on our approximately 410,000 owners around the world. In 2015, approximately 64 percent of our sales of vacation ownership products were to our existing owners. In addition, we are concentrating on growing our tour flow cost effectively as we seek to generate more first-time buyer tours and achieve our longer term goal of selling to an equal mix of new buyers and existing buyers. Our strategy includes an emphasis on new sales distributions and new marketing channels geared toward driving first-time buyer tour growth. We are also committed to maximizing development margin through efficient marketing and sales spending and managing inventory costs and development activities. 

Maximize cash flow and optimize our capital structure 

Through the use of our points-based products, we are able to more closely match inventory investment with sales pace and reduce inventory levels, thereby generating strong cash flows over time. Additionally, by limiting the amount of completed inventory on hand, we are able to reduce the maintenance fees that we pay on unsold inventory. Over the last few years, we have significantly reduced our costs, and we intend to continue to control costs as sales volumes grow. We also seek to optimize our inventory investments by targeting high-quality inventory that allows us to add desirable new destinations to our system as well as new on-site sales locations. We seek to use capital efficient deal structures that may include working with third parties to develop new inventory or convert previously built units to be sold to us close to when we need such inventory. We also 

&#160;

proactively buy back previously sold vacation ownership interests at lower costs than would be required to develop new inventory. 

We expect our modest level of debt and the use of capital efficient structures will enable us to maintain a level of liquidity that ensures financial flexibility, giving us the ability to pursue strategic growth opportunities, withstand potential future economic downturns, optimize our cost of capital, and pursue strategies for returning capital to shareholders. We intend to meet our liquidity needs through operating cash flow, the disposition of excess assets, our $200 million revolving credit facility (the &#147;Revolving Corporate Credit Facility&#148;), our $250 million non-recourse warehouse credit facility (the &#147;Warehouse Credit Facility&#148;), and continued access to the asset-backed securities (&#147;ABS&#148;) term financing market. 

Selectively pursue compelling new business opportunities 

We are positioned to explore new business opportunities, such as the continued enhancement of our exchange programs, new management affiliations and acquisitions of existing vacation ownership and related businesses. We intend to selectively pursue these types of opportunities, focusing on opportunities that drive recurring revenue and profit streams. Prior to entering into any new business opportunity, we will evaluate its strategic fit and assess whether it is complementary to our current business, has strong expected financial returns and leverages our existing competencies. 

Focus on our owners, guests and associates 

We are in the business of providing high-quality vacation experiences to our owners and guests around the world. We intend to maintain and improve their satisfaction with our products and services, particularly because our owners and guests are our most cost-effective sales channels. We intend to continue to sell our products through these very effective channels and believe that maintaining a high level of engagement across all of our customer groups is key to our success. We intend to provide innovative offerings in new destinations to meet the needs of current and future customers. We intend to develop new offerings to attract the next generation of travelers looking for a greater variety of experiences with the high quality standards expected from a brand they trust. 

Engaging our associates in the success of our business continues to be one of our long-term core strategies. We understand the connection between the engagement of our associates and the satisfaction and engagement of our owners and guests. At the heart of our culture is the belief that if we take care of our associates, they will take care of our owners and guests and the owners and guests will return again and again. 

Our Brands 

We design, build, manage and maintain our properties at upscale and luxury levels under four brands in accordance with the Marriott and Ritz-Carlton brand standards with which we must comply under the License Agreements. 

The Marriott Vacation Club brand is our signature offering in the upscale tier of the vacation ownership industry. Marriott Vacation Club resorts typically combine many of the comforts of home, such as spacious accommodations with one, two and three bedroom options, living and dining areas, in-unit kitchens and laundry facilities, with resort amenities such as large feature swimming pools, restaurants and bars, convenience stores, fitness facilities and spas, as well as sports and recreation facilities appropriate for each resort&#146;s unique location. 

Grand Residences by Marriott is an upscale tier vacation ownership and whole ownership residence brand. The accommodations for this brand are similar to those we offer under the Marriott Vacation Club brand, but the duration of the vacation ownership interest is longer, ranging between three and thirteen weeks. We also offer whole ownership residential products under the Grand Residences by Marriott brand. 

The Ritz-Carlton Destination Club is a luxury tier vacation ownership brand. The Ritz-Carlton Destination Club provides luxurious vacation experiences commensurate with the legacy of the Ritz-Carlton brand. The Ritz-Carlton Destination Club resorts typically feature two, three and four bedroom units that 

&#160;

generally include marble foyers, walk-in closets, custom kitchen cabinetry and luxury resort amenities such as large feature pools and access to full service restaurants and bars. On-site management and services, which usually include daily maid service, valet, in-residence dining, and access to fitness facilities as well as spa and sports facilities as appropriate for each destination, are provided by The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company. 

The Ritz-Carlton Residences is a luxury tier whole ownership residence brand. The Ritz-Carlton Residences includes whole ownership luxury residential condominiums co-located with The Ritz-Carlton Destination Club resorts. Owners can typically purchase condominiums that vary in size from one-bedroom apartments to spacious penthouses. Owners of The Ritz-Carlton Residences can avail themselves of the services and facilities that are associated with the co-located The Ritz-Carlton Destination Club resort on an a la carte basis. On-site management and services are provided by The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company. 

Our Products 

Our Points-Based Vacation Ownership Products 

We sell the majority of our products through two points-based ownership programs: MVCD and Marriott Vacation Club, Asia Pacific. While the structural characteristics of each of our points-based programs differ, in each program, owners receive an annual allotment of points representing owners&#146; usage rights, and owners can use these points to access vacation ownership units across multiple destinations within their program&#146;s portfolio of resort locations. Each program permits shorter or longer stays than a traditional weeks-based vacation ownership product and provides for flexibility with respect to check-in days and size of accommodations. In addition to traditional resort stays, the MVCD program enables our owners to utilize their points for the wide variety of innovative vacation experiences included in our Explorer Collection, such as cruises, guided tours, safaris and other unique vacation alternatives. Members of our points-based programs pay annual fees in exchange for the ability to participate in the program. 

The MVCD and the Marriott Vacation Club, Asia Pacific programs allow owners to bank and borrow their annual point allotments, access other Marriott Vacation Club locations through internal exchange programs that we and Interval International operate, and access Interval International&#146;s approximately 2,900 affiliated resorts. Owners can also trade their vacation ownership usage rights for Marriott Rewards Points, which can be used to access the vast majority of Marriott International&#146;s system of over 4,000 participating hotels or redeem their Marriott Rewards Points for airline miles or other merchandise offered through the Marriott Rewards customer loyalty program. MVCD owners hold an interest in real estate, owned in perpetuity. Our Marriott Vacation Club, Asia Pacific program offers usage for a term of 50 years from the program&#146;s 2006 launch date. 

Our Weeks-Based Vacation Ownership Products 

We continue to sell Marriott Vacation Club branded weeks-based vacation ownership products in select markets, including in countries where legal and tax constraints currently limit our ability to include those locations in one of our points-based programs. We offer multi-week vacation ownership interests in specific Grand Residences by Marriott and The Ritz-Carlton Destination Club resorts, but we also intend to continue placing luxury branded inventory into the MVCD program. Our Marriott Vacation Club, Grand Residences by Marriott and The Ritz-Carlton Destination Club weeks-based vacation ownership products in the United States and select Caribbean locations are typically sold as fee simple deeded real estate interests at a specific resort representing an ownership interest in perpetuity, except where restricted by leasehold or other structural limitations. We sell vacation ownership interests as a right-to-use product subject to a finite term under the Marriott Vacation Club brand in Europe and Asia Pacific and under the Grand Residences by Marriott brand in Europe. 

As part of the launch of the MVCD program in mid-2010, we offered our existing Marriott Vacation Club owners who held weeks-based products in the United States and Caribbean the opportunity to participate in the MVCD program on a voluntary basis. In mid-2012, we began offering owners who held weeks-based products in Europe the opportunity to participate in the MVCD program. All existing owners, whether or not they elected to participate in the MVCD program, retained their existing rights and privileges of vacation ownership. Owners 

&#160;

who elected to participate in the program received the ability to trade their weeks-based interval usage for vacation club points usage each year, subject to payment of an initial enrollment fee and annual fees. As of the end of 2015, over 146,000 weeks-based owners have enrolled nearly 253,000 weeks in the MVCD program since its launch. 

Our Sources of Revenue 

We generate most of our revenues from four primary sources: selling vacation ownership products; managing our resorts; financing consumer purchases of vacation ownership products; and renting vacation ownership inventory. 

Sale of Vacation Ownership Products 

Our principal source of revenue is the sale of vacation ownership interests. See &#147;&#151;Marketing and Sales Activities&#148; below for information regarding our marketing and sales activities. 

Resort Management and Other Services 

We generate revenue from fees we earn for managing each of our resorts. See &#147;&#151;Management Activities&#148; below for additional information on the terms of our management agreements. In addition, we earn revenue for providing ancillary offerings, including food and beverage, retail, and golf and spa offerings at our resorts. We also receive annual fees, club dues, settlement fees from the sale of vacation ownership products, and certain transaction-based fees from owners and other third parties, including external exchange service providers with which we are associated. 

Financing 

We earn interest income on loans that we provide to purchasers of our vacation ownership interests, as well as loan servicing and other fees. See &#147;&#151;Consumer Financing&#148; below for further information regarding our consumer financing activities. 

Rental 

We generate rental revenue from transient rentals of inventory we hold for sale as interests in our vacation ownership programs or as residences, or inventory that we control because our owners have elected alternative usage options permitted under our vacation ownership programs. 

Marketing and Sales Activities 

We sell our upscale tier vacation ownership products under the Marriott Vacation Club brand primarily through our worldwide network of resort-based sales centers and certain off-site sales locations. Marriott Vacation Club products are currently marketed for sale throughout the United States and in over 30 countries around the world, targeting customers who vacation regularly with a focus on family, relaxation and recreational activities. In 2015, approximately 85 percent of our sales originated at sales centers that are co-located with one of our resorts. We maintain a range of different off-site sales centers, including our central telesales organization based in Orlando, our network of third-party brokers in Latin America and Europe, and our city-based sales centers, such as our sales centers in Dubai and Singapore. We have over 50 global sales locations focused on the sale of Marriott Vacation Club products. We utilize a number of marketing channels to attract qualified customers to our sales locations for our Marriott Vacation Club products. 

We solicit our owners primarily while they are staying in our resorts, but also offer our owners the opportunity to make additional purchases through direct phone sales, owner events and inquiries from our central customer service center located in Salt Lake City, Utah. In 2015, approximately 64 percent of our sales of vacation ownership products were to our existing owners. In addition, we are concentrating on growing our tour flow cost effectively as we seek to generate more first-time buyer tours and achieve our longer term goal of 

&#160;

selling to an equal mix of new buyers and existing owners. Our strategy includes an emphasis on new marketing channels geared toward driving first-time buyer tour growth. 

We offer customers who are referred to us by our owners discounted stays at our resorts and conduct scheduled sales tours while they are on site. Where allowed by applicable law, we offer Marriott Rewards Points to our owners when their referral candidates tour with us or buy vacation ownership interests from us. 

We also market to existing Marriott Rewards customer loyalty program members and travelers who are staying in locations where we have resorts. We market extensively to guests in Marriott International hotels that are located near one of our sales locations and have marketing partnerships with Marriott International&#146;s North American reservation centers. In addition, we operate other local marketing venues in various high-traffic areas. A significant part of our direct marketing activities are focused on prospects in the Marriott Rewards customer loyalty program database and our in-house database of qualified prospects. We offer guests who do not buy a vacation ownership interest during their initial tour an &#147;Encore&#148; package for a future stay at our resorts. These return guests are nearly twice as likely to purchase as a first-time visitor. 

Our Marriott Vacation Club sales tours are designed to provide our guests with an overview of our company and our products, as well as a customized presentation to explain how our products and services can meet their vacationing needs. Our sales force is highly trained in a consultative sales approach designed to ensure that we meet customers&#146; needs on an individual basis. We hire our Marriott Vacation Club sales executives based on stringent selection criteria. After they are hired, they spend a minimum of four weeks in product and sales training before interacting with any customers. We manage our sales executives&#146; consistency of presentation and professionalism using a variety of sales tools and technology and through a post-presentation survey of our guests that measures many aspects of each guest&#146;s interaction with us. 

We believe consumers place a great deal of trust in the Marriott and Ritz-Carlton brands and the strength of these brands is important to our ability to attract qualified prospects in the marketplace. We maintain a prominent presence on the www.marriott.com and www.ritzcarlton.com websites. Our proprietary sites, which include www.marriottvacationsworldwide.com, www.marriottvacationclub.com and www.ritzcarltonclub.com, had over 5.6 million visits in 2015. 

Inventory and Development Activities 

We secure inventory by building additional phases at our existing resorts, repurchasing inventory in the secondary market, repurchasing inventory as a result of owner loan or maintenance fee defaults, or developing or acquiring resorts in strategic markets. We proactively buy back previously sold vacation ownership interests under our repurchase program at lower costs than would be required to develop new inventory. 

We intend to continue to selectively pursue growth opportunities in North America and Asia by targeting high-quality inventory that allows us to add desirable new destinations to our system with new on-site sales locations in ways that optimize the timing of our capital investments. These capital efficient deal structures may include working with third parties to develop new inventory or convert previously built units to be sold to us close to when we need such inventory. 

Approximately one-quarter of our vacation ownership resorts are co-located with Marriott International and Ritz-Carlton hotel properties. Co-location of our resorts with Marriott International or Ritz-Carlton branded hotels can provide several advantages from development, operations, customer experience and marketing perspectives, including sharing amenities, infrastructure and staff, integration of services, and other cost efficiencies. The larger campus of an integrated vacation ownership and hotel resort often can afford our owners more varied and elaborate amenities than those that would generally be available at a stand-alone resort. Shared infrastructure can also reduce our overall development costs for our resorts on a per unit basis. Integration of services and sharing staff and other expenses can lower overhead and operating costs for our resorts. Our on-site access to hotel customers, including Marriott Rewards customer loyalty program members, who are visiting co-located hotels also provides us with a cost-effective marketing channel for our vacation ownership products. 

&#160;

&#160;

Co-located resorts require cooperation and coordination among all parties and are subject to cost sharing and integration agreements among us, the applicable property owners&#146; association and managers and owners of the co-located hotel. Our License Agreements with Marriott International and Ritz-Carlton allow for the development of co-located properties in the future, and we intend to opportunistically pursue co-located projects with them. 

Under our points-based business model, we are able to supply many sales offices with new inventory from a small number of resort locations, which provides us with greater efficiency in the use of our capital. As a result, our risk associated with construction delays is concentrated in fewer locations than it has been in the past. Additionally, selling vacation ownership interests in a system of resorts under a points-based business model increases the risk of temporary inventory depletion. We sell vacation ownership interests denominated in points from a single trust entity in each of our North America and Asia Pacific business segments. Thus, the primary source of inventory for each segment is concentrated in its corresponding trust. To avoid the risk of temporary inventory depletion, we employ a strategy of seeking to maintain a surplus supply of completed inventory based on our forecasted sales pace. If this surplus is not sufficient, we believe that the actual risk of temporary inventory depletion is relatively minor, as there are other mitigation strategies we could employ to prevent this, such as accelerating completion of resorts under construction, acquiring vacation ownership interests on the secondary market, or reducing sales pace by adjusting prices or sales incentives. 

Owners generally can offer their vacation ownership interests for resale on the secondary market, which can create pricing pressure on the sale of developer inventory. However, owners who purchase vacation ownership interests on the secondary market typically do not receive all of the benefits that owners who purchase products directly from us receive. When an owner purchases a vacation ownership interest directly from us, the owner receives certain entitlements that are tied to the underlying vacation ownership interest, such as the right to reserve a resort unit that underlies their vacation ownership interest in order to occupy that unit or exchange its use for use of a unit at another resort through an outside exchange service provider, as well as benefits that are incidental to the purchase of the vacation ownership interest. While a purchaser on the secondary market will receive all of the entitlements that are tied to the underlying vacation ownership interest, the purchaser is not entitled to receive certain incidental benefits. For example, owners who purchase our products on the secondary market have restricted access to our internal exchange programs and are not entitled to trade their usage rights for Marriott Rewards Points. Therefore, those owners are only entitled to use the inventory that underlies the vacation ownership interests they purchased. Additionally, most of our vacation ownership interests provide us with a right of first refusal on secondary market sales. We monitor sales that occur in the secondary market and exercise our right of first refusal when it is advantageous for us to do so, whether due to pricing, desire for the particular inventory, or other factors. All owners, whether they purchase directly from us or on the secondary market, are responsible for the annual maintenance fees, property taxes and any assessments that are levied by the relevant property owners&#146; association, as well as any exchange service membership dues or service fees. 

Management Activities 

We enter into a management agreement with the property owners&#146; association or other governing body at each of our resorts and, in the event a trust holds resorts or interests in resorts, with the trust&#146;s governing body. In exchange for a management fee, we typically provide owner account management (reservations and usage selection), housekeeping, check-in, maintenance and billing and collections services. The management fee is typically based on either a percentage of the budgeted cost to operate such resorts or a fixed fee arrangement. We earn these fees regardless of usage or occupancy. We also receive revenues that represent reimbursement for certain costs we incur under our management agreements, principally payroll-related costs, at the locations where we employ the associates providing on-site services. 

The terms of our management agreements generally range from three to ten years and are generally subject to periodic renewal for one to five year terms. Many of these agreements renew automatically unless either party provides advance notice of termination before the expiration of the term. When our management agreement for a Marriott Vacation Club branded resort is not renewed or is terminated, the resort loses the ability to use the Marriott name and trademarks. The owners at such resorts also lose their ability to trade their vacation 

&#160;

ownership usage rights for Marriott Rewards Points and to access other Marriott Vacation Club resorts through our internal exchange system. 

The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company manages the on-site operations for The Ritz-Carlton Destination Club and The Ritz-Carlton Residences properties in our portfolio under separate management agreements with us. We provide property owners&#146; association governance and vacation ownership program management services for The Ritz-Carlton Destination Club and co-located The Ritz-Carlton Residences properties, including preparing association budgets, facilitating association meetings, billing and collecting maintenance fees, and supporting reservations, vacation experience planning and other off-site member services. We and The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company typically split the management fees equally for these resorts. If a management agreement for a resort expires or is terminated, the resort loses the ability to use the Ritz-Carlton name and trademarks. The owners at such resorts also lose their ability to access other usage benefits, such as access to accommodations at other The Ritz-Carlton Destination Club resorts, preferential access to Ritz-Carlton hotels worldwide and access to our internal exchange and vacation travel options. 

Each management agreement requires the property owners&#146; association or trust association to provide sufficient funds to pay for the vacation ownership program and operating costs. To satisfy this requirement, owners of vacation ownership interests pay an annual maintenance fee. This fee represents the owner&#146;s allocable share of the costs of operating and maintaining the resorts in which they hold a vacation ownership interest, including management fees and expenses, taxes (in some locations), insurance, and other related costs, and the costs of providing program services (such as reservation services). This fee includes a management fee payable to us for providing management services as well as an assessment for funds to be deposited into a capital asset reserve fund and used to renovate, refurbish and replace furnishings, common areas and other resort assets (such as parking lots or roofs) as needed over time. As the owner of completed but unsold vacation ownership inventory, we also pay maintenance fees in accordance with the legal requirements of the jurisdictions applicable to such resorts and programs. In addition, in early phases of development at a resort, we sometimes enter into subsidy agreements with the property owners&#146; associations under which we agree to pay costs that otherwise would be covered by annual maintenance fees associated with vacation ownership interests or units that have not yet been built. These subsidy arrangements help keep maintenance fees at a reasonable level for owners who purchase in the early stages of development. 

In the event of a default by an owner in payment of maintenance fees or other assessments, the property owners&#146; association typically has the right to foreclose on or revoke the defaulting owner&#146;s vacation ownership interest. We have entered into arrangements with several property owners&#146; associations to assist in reselling foreclosed or revoked vacation ownership interests in exchange for a fee, or to reacquire such foreclosed or revoked vacation ownership interests from the property owners&#146; associations. 

Consumer Financing 

We offer purchase money financing for purchasers of our vacation ownership products who meet our underwriting guidelines. By offering or eliminating financing incentives and modifying underwriting standards, we have been able to increase or decrease our financing activities depending on market conditions. We are not providing financing to buyers of our residential products. 

In our North America segment in 2015, approximately 49 percent of Marriott Vacation Club customers financed their purchase with us. The average loan for our Marriott Vacation Club products totaled approximately $22,800, which represented 88 percent of the average purchase price. Our policy is to require a minimum down payment of 10 percent of the purchase price, although down payments and interest rates are typically higher for applicants with credit scores below certain levels and for purchasers who do not have credit scores, such as non-U.S. purchasers. The average interest rate for loans for our Marriott Vacation Club products originated in 2015 was 12.59 percent and the average term was 10.4 years. Interest rates are fixed, and a loan fully amortizes over the life of the loan. The average monthly mortgage payment for a Marriott Vacation Club owner who received a loan in 2015 was $397. We do not impose any prepayment penalties. Generally, loans for The Ritz-Carlton Destination Club products have a significantly higher balance, a longer term and a lower interest rate than loans for our Marriott Vacation Club products. 

&#160;

In 2015, approximately 88 percent of our loans were used to finance U.S.-based products. In our North American business, we perform a credit investigation or other review or inquiry to determine the purchaser&#146;s credit history before originating a loan. The interest rates on the loans we provide are based primarily upon the purchaser&#146;s credit score, the size of the purchase, and the term of the loan. We base our financing terms largely on a purchaser&#146;s FICO score, which is a branded version of a consumer credit score widely used in the United States by banks and lending institutions. FICO scores range from 300 to 850 and are calculated based on information obtained from one or more of the three major U.S. credit reporting agencies that compile and report on a consumer&#146;s credit history. In 2015, the average FICO score of our customers who were U.S. citizens or residents who financed a vacation ownership purchase was 736; 71 percent had a credit score of over 700, 89 percent had a credit score of over 650 and over 97 percent had a credit score of over 600. 

We use other information to determine minimum down payments and interest rates applicable to loans made to purchasers who do not have a credit score or who do not reside within the United States, such as regional historical default rates and currency fluctuation risk. 

In the event of a default, we generally have the right to foreclose on or revoke the defaulting owner&#146;s vacation ownership interest. We typically resell interests that we reacquire through foreclosure or revocation or place such interests into the MVCD or Marriott Vacation Club, Asia Pacific programs. 

We securitize the majority of the consumer loans we originate in support of our North American business. Historically, we have sold these loans to institutional investors in the ABS market on a non-recourse basis, completing securitization transactions once or twice each year. These vacation ownership notes receivable securitizations provide funding for us at interest rates similar to those available to companies with investment grade credit ratings, and transfer the economic risks and substantially all the benefits of the consumer loans we originate to third parties. In a vacation ownership notes receivable securitization, various classes of debt securities issued by a special purpose entity are generally collateralized by a single tranche of transferred assets, which consist of vacation ownership notes receivable. We service the vacation ownership notes receivable. During 2015, we completed one securitization transaction, which is discussed in detail in Footnote No. 10, &#147;Debt,&#148; to our Financial Statements. On an ongoing basis, we have the ability to use our Warehouse Credit Facility to securitize eligible consumer loans. Those loans may later be transferred to term securitization transactions in the ABS market, which we intend to continue to complete at least once per year. Excluding amounts securitized through the Warehouse Credit Facility, since the early 1990s, we have securitized nearly $5.6 billion of loans. We retain the servicing and collection responsibilities for the loans we securitize, for which we receive a servicing fee. 

Our Competitive Advantages 

We believe that competition in the vacation ownership industry is based primarily on the quality, number and location of vacation ownership resorts, trust in the brand, pricing of product offerings and the availability of program benefits, such as exchange programs and access to affiliated hotel networks. Vacation ownership is a vacation option that is positioned and sold as an attractive alternative to vacation rentals (such as hotels, resorts and condominium rentals) and second home ownership. The various segments within the vacation ownership industry are differentiated by the quality level of the accommodations, range of services and ancillary offerings, and price. We believe that we have significant competitive advantages that support our leadership position in the vacation ownership industry. 

A leading global &#147;pure-play&#148; vacation ownership company 

We are one of the world&#146;s largest &#147;pure-play&#148; vacation ownership companies (that is, a company whose business is focused almost entirely on vacation ownership), based on number of owners, number of resorts and revenues. As a &#147;pure-play&#148; vacation ownership company, we are able to enhance our focus on the vacation ownership industry and tailor our business strategy to address our company&#146;s industry-specific goals and needs. 

We believe our scale and global reach, coupled with our renowned brands and development, marketing, sales and management expertise, help us achieve operational efficiencies and support future growth 

&#160;

opportunities. Our size allows us to provide owners with the flexibility of a wide variety of experiences within our high-quality resort portfolio, coupled with the ease and certainty of working with a single trusted provider. We also believe our size helps us obtain better financing terms from lenders, achieve cost savings in procurement and attract talented management and associates. 

The breadth and depth of our operations enables us to offer a variety of products and to continue to adapt those products to the ever changing needs and preferences of our existing and future customers. For example, in addition to traditional resort experiences, our owners can enjoy studio units in properties located in the heart of some of the most sought after global destinations. We cater to a diverse range of customers through our upscale tier Marriott-branded resorts and our luxury tier Ritz-Carlton branded resorts. 

Premier global brands 

We believe that our exclusive licenses of the Marriott and Ritz-Carlton brands for use in the vacation ownership business provide us with a meaningful competitive advantage. Marriott International is a leading lodging company with more than 4,400 properties in 87 countries and territories, including Marriott and Ritz-Carlton branded properties. Consumer confidence in these renowned brands helps us attract and retain guests and owners. In addition, we provide our customers with access to the award-winning Marriott Rewards customer loyalty program. We also utilize the Marriott and Ritz-Carlton websites, www.marriott.com and www.ritzcarlton.com, as relatively low-cost marketing tools to introduce Marriott and Ritz-Carlton guests to our products and rent available inventory. 

Loyal, highly satisfied customers 

We have a large, highly satisfied customer base. In 2015, based on over 222,000 survey responses, approximately 90 percent of respondents indicated that they were highly satisfied with our products, sales and owner services and their on-site experiences (by selecting 8, 9 or 10 on a 10-point scale). Owner satisfaction is also demonstrated by the fact that our average resort occupancy was nearly 90 percent in 2015, significantly higher than the overall vacation ownership industry average of just over 78 percent in 2014, the most recent year for which average resort occupancy data was reported by ARDA. We believe that strong customer satisfaction and brand loyalty result in more frequent use of our products and encourage owners to purchase additional products and to recommend our products to friends and family, which in turn generates higher revenues. 

Long-standing track record, experienced management and engaged associates 

We have been a pioneer in the vacation ownership industry since 1984, when Marriott International became the first company to introduce a lodging-branded vacation ownership product. Our seasoned management team is led by Stephen P. Weisz, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Weisz has served as President of our company since 1996 and has over 43 years of combined experience at Marriott International and Marriott Vacations Worldwide. William J. Shaw, the Chairman of our Board of Directors, is the former Vice Chairman, President and Chief Operating Officer of Marriott International and has nearly 37 years of experience at Marriott International. Our nine executive officers have an average of over 26 years of total combined experience at Marriott Vacations Worldwide and Marriott International, with half of such total combined experience spent leading our business. We believe our management team&#146;s extensive public company and vacation ownership industry experience has enabled us to achieve solid operating results and will enable us to continue to respond quickly and effectively to changing market conditions and consumer trends. Our management&#146;s experience in the highly regulated vacation ownership industry also provides us with a competitive advantage in expanding existing product forms and developing new ones. 

We believe that our associates provide superior customer service, which enhances our competitive position. We leverage outstanding associate engagement and strong corporate culture to deliver positive customer experiences in sales, marketing and resort operations. We survey our associates regularly through an external survey provider to understand their satisfaction and engagement, defined as how passionate employees are about the company&#146;s mission and their willingness to &#147;go the extra mile&#148; to see it succeed. We routinely rank highly compared to other companies participating in such surveys. In 2015, 83 percent of our associates indicated that 

&#160;

they were &#147;engaged,&#148; which is five points above Aon Hewitt&#146;s &#147;Global Best Employer&#148; benchmark of 78 percent. This external benchmark is based on research conducted by Aon Hewitt of more than 500 organizations that are considered to be &#147;Best Employers.&#148;

&#160; Financial information by segment and geographic area for 2015, 2014 and 2013 appears in Footnote No. 17, &#147;Business Segments,&#148; to our Financial Statements. 

We generally own the unsold vacation ownership inventory at our properties as either a deeded beneficial interest in a real estate land trust, a deeded interest at a specific resort, or a right to use interest in real estate owned or leased by a trust or other property owning or leasing vehicle (these forms of ownership are described in more detail in &#147;Business&#151;Our Products&#148;). With respect to inventory that has not yet been converted into one of these forms of vacation ownership, we generally hold a fee interest in the underlying real estate rights to the land parcel, building or units corresponding to such inventory. Further, we also own or lease other property at these resorts, including golf courses, fitness, spa and sports facilities, food and beverage outlets, resort lobbies and other common area assets. See Footnote No. 9, &#147;Contingencies and Commitments,&#148; to our Financial Statements for more information on our operating leases. Substantially all of our ownership and leasehold interests in these properties, subject to certain exceptions, are pledged as collateral for our Revolving Corporate Credit Facility. 

Our Properties 

As of January 1, 2016, our portfolio consisted of 61 properties including two operating hotels, with 12,807 vacation ownership villas (&#147;units&#148;) and we had approximately 410,000 owners. The following table shows our vacation ownership and residential properties as of January 1, 2016, and indicates the segment with which such property is associated:

&#160; (2) &#160; Represents units at The Mayflower Hotel, Autograph Collection, an operating hotel located in Washington, D.C., acquired during the third quarter of 2015. We intend to include these vacation ownership units, in their current form, in our MVCD program. &#160;

&#160; (3) &#160; Represents a 329 room operating hotel in Surfers Paradise, Australia, acquired during the third quarter of 2015, which is operated by a third party. We intend to convert a portion of this hotel into vacation ownership interests for future use in our Asia Pacific segment, and sell the remaining downsized hotel to a third party. Subsequent to January 1, 2016, we assumed management of an operating hotel in New York, New York. In addition we entered into a commitment to purchase the operating hotel for $158.5 million, in a capital efficient transaction. We expect to acquire the units in the hotel, in their current form, over time. See Footnote No. 19, &#147;Subsequent Events&#148; to our Financial Statements for additional information regarding this transaction. 

In the first quarter of 2016, we completed the acquisition of an operating hotel located in the South Beach area of Miami Beach, Florida, for approximately $23.5 million. We intend to convert this hotel into vacation ownership interests for future use in our MVCD program. 

North America Segment 

In our North America segment, we develop, market, sell and manage vacation ownership products under the Marriott Vacation Club and Grand Residences by Marriott brands in the United States and the Caribbean, and resort residential real estate located within our vacation ownership developments under the Grand Residences by Marriott brand. We also develop, market and sell vacation ownership and related products under The Ritz-Carlton Destination Club brand, as well as whole ownership residential products under The Ritz-Carlton Residences brand. 

Europe Segment 

In our Europe segment, we are focused on selling our existing projects and managing existing resorts. We do not have any current plans for new development in this segment. 

Asia Pacific Segment 

In our Asia Pacific segment, we develop, market, sell and manage vacation ownership products through Marriott Vacation Club, Asia Pacific, a right-to-use points program that we specifically designed to appeal to the vacation preferences of the Asian market, as well as a weeks-based right-to-use product. We believe opportunity exists to expand our Asia Pacific segment and are seeking to add inventory to support the growth of this business. 

Corporate and Other 

Corporate and Other consists of results not specifically attributable to an individual segment, including expenses in support of our financing operations, non-capitalizable development expenses incurred to support 

&#160;

overall company development, company-wide general and administrative costs, corporate interest expense, consumer financing interest expense and the fixed royalty fee payable under the License Agreements. 

Intellectual Property 

We manage and sell properties under the Marriott Vacation Club, Grand Residences by Marriott, The Ritz-Carlton Destination Club and The Ritz-Carlton Residences brands under license agreements with Marriott International and The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company. The foregoing segment descriptions specify the brands that are used by each of our segments. We operate in a highly competitive industry and our brand names, trademarks, service marks, trade names and logos are very important to the marketing and sales of our products and services. We believe that our licensed brand names and other intellectual property have come to represent the highest standards of quality, caring, service and value to our customers and the traveling public. We register and protect our intellectual property where we deem appropriate and otherwise seek to protect against its unauthorized use. 

Seasonality 

In general, the vacation ownership business is modestly seasonal, with stronger revenue generation during traditional vacation periods, including summer months and major holidays. Similar to the lodging industry, our rental operations generally maintain higher occupancy and room rates during the first, second and third quarters of our fiscal year compared to our fourth quarter. These seasonal patterns can be expected to cause fluctuations in the quarterly rental revenues and margin. Our residential business is generally not subject to seasonal fluctuations; rather, the sales pace of our residential products typically depends on the underlying residential real estate environment in the applicable geographic market. 

Competition 

Competition in the vacation ownership industry is based primarily on the quality, number and location of vacation ownership resorts, the quality and capability of the related property management program, trust in the brand, pricing of product offerings and the availability of program benefits, such as exchange programs and access to affiliated hotel networks. We believe that our focus on offering distinctive vacation experiences, combined with our financial strength, well-established and diverse market presence, strong brands, expertise and well-managed and maintained properties, will enable us to remain competitive. Vacation ownership is a vacation option that is positioned and sold as an attractive alternative to vacation rentals (such as hotels, resorts and condominium rentals) and second home ownership. The various segments within the vacation ownership industry can be differentiated by the quality level of the accommodations, range of services and ancillary offerings, and price. Our brands operate in the upscale and luxury tiers of the vacation ownership segment of the industry and the upscale and luxury tiers of the whole ownership segment (also referred to as the residential segment) of the industry. 

Our competitors in the vacation ownership industry range from small vacation ownership companies to large branded hotel companies that operate vacation ownership businesses. In North America and the Caribbean, we typically compete with companies that sell upscale tier vacation ownership products under a lodging or entertainment brand umbrella, such as Starwood Vacation Ownership (which includes the Westin and Sheraton brands), Hilton Grand Vacations Club, Hyatt Vacation Club, and Disney Vacation Club, as well as numerous regional vacation ownership operators. Our luxury vacation ownership products compete with vacation ownership products offered by Four Seasons, Exclusive Resorts, Timbers Resorts and several other smaller independent companies. In addition, the vacation ownership industry competes generally with other vacation rental options (such as hotels, resorts and condominium rentals) offered by the lodging industry. Innovations that impact the industry may also lead to new products and services that could disrupt our business model and create new and stronger competitors. 

Outside North America and the Caribbean, we operate in two primary regions, Europe and Asia Pacific. In both regions, we are one of the largest lodging-branded vacation ownership companies operating in the upscale tier, with regional operators dominating the competitive landscape. Where possible, our vacation 

&#160;

ownership properties in these regions are co-located with Marriott International branded hotels. In Europe, our owner base is derived primarily from the North America, Europe and Middle East regions. In Asia Pacific, our owner base is derived primarily from the Asia Pacific region and secondarily from the Europe and North America regions. 

Recent and potential future consolidation in the highly fragmented timeshare industry may increase competition. For example, Interval Leisure Group, Inc., which operates the Interval International exchange program, acquired Hyatt Residence Club in October 2014 and announced in October 2015 that it had agreed to acquire the vacation ownership operations of Starwood Hotels &#38; Resorts Worldwide, Inc. (which includes the Westin and Sheraton brands), to be known as Vistana Signature Experiences, Inc. Diamond Resorts International, Inc. completed the acquisition of the vacation ownership business of Gold Key Resorts in October 2015 and the acquisition of the vacation ownership business of Intrawest Resort Club Group in January 2016. Consolidation may create competitors that enjoy significant advantages resulting from, among other things, a lower cost of, and greater access to, capital and enhanced operating efficiencies. 

Regulation 

Our business is heavily regulated. We are subject to a wide variety of complex international, national, federal, state and local laws, regulations and policies in jurisdictions around the world. Some laws, regulations and policies may impact multiple areas of our business, such as securities, anti-discrimination, anti-fraud, data protection and security and anti-corruption and bribery laws and regulations or government economic sanctions, including applicable regulations of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the U.S. Department of the Treasury&#146;s Office of Foreign Asset Control and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (&#147;FCPA&#148;). The FCPA and similar anti-corruption and bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or generating business. Other laws, regulations and policies primarily affect one of four areas of our business: real estate development activities; marketing and sales activities; lending activities; and resort management activities. 

Real Estate Development Regulation 

Our real estate development activities are regulated under a number of different timeshare, condominium and land sales disclosure statutes in many jurisdictions. We are generally subject to laws and regulations typically applicable to real estate development, subdivision, and construction activities, such as laws relating to zoning, land use restrictions, environmental regulation, accessibility, title transfers, title insurance and taxation. In the United States, these include the Fair Housing Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act. In addition, we are subject to laws in some jurisdictions that impose liability on property developers for construction defects discovered or repairs made by future owners of property developed by the developer. 

Marketing and Sales Regulation 

Our marketing and sales activities are closely regulated. In addition to regulations implementing laws enacted specifically for the vacation ownership and land sales industries, a wide variety of laws and regulations govern our marketing and sales activities in the jurisdictions in which we carry out such activities, including regulations implementing the USA PATRIOT Act, Foreign Investment In Real Property Tax Act, the Federal Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act and fair housing statutes, U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the &#147;FTC&#148;) and state &#147;Little FTC Act&#148; and other regulations governing unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices including unfair or deceptive trade practices and unfair competition, state attorney general regulations, anti-fraud laws, prize, gift and sweepstakes laws, real estate, title agency or insurance, travel insurance and other licensing or registration laws and regulations, anti-money laundering, consumer information privacy and security, breach notification, information sharing and telemarketing laws, home solicitation sales laws, tour operator laws, lodging certificate and seller of travel laws, securities laws, and other consumer protection laws. 

Many jurisdictions, including many jurisdictions in the United States, require that we file detailed registration or offering statements with regulatory authorities disclosing certain information regarding the 

&#160;

vacation ownership interests and other real estate interests we market and sell, such as information concerning the interests being offered, the project, resort or program to which the interests relate, applicable condominium or vacation ownership plans, evidence of title, details regarding our business, the purchaser&#146;s rights and obligations with respect to such interests, and a description of the manner in which we intend to offer and advertise such interests. Regulation outside the United States includes, for example, European regulations to which our vacation ownership activities within the European Union are subject and Singaporean regulations to which certain of our Asia Pacific operations are subject. Among other things, the European and Singaporean regulations: (1) require delivery of specified disclosure (some of which must be provided in a specific format or language) to purchasers; (2) require a specified &#147;cooling off&#148; rescission period after a purchase is made; and (3) prohibit any advance payments during the &#147;cooling off&#148; rescission period. 

We must obtain the approval of numerous governmental authorities for our marketing and sales activities. Changes in circumstances or applicable law may necessitate the application for or modification of existing approvals. Currently, we are qualified to market and sell vacation ownership products in all 50 states and the District of Columbia in the United States and numerous countries in North and South America, the Caribbean, Europe, Asia and the Middle East. In some countries our vacation ownership products are marketed by third party brokers. 

Laws in many jurisdictions in which we sell vacation ownership interests grant the purchaser of a vacation ownership interest the right to cancel a purchase contract during a specified rescission period following the later of the date the contract was signed or the date the purchaser received the last of the documents required to be provided by us. 

In recent years, regulators in many jurisdictions have increased regulations and enforcement actions related to telemarketing operations, including requiring adherence to the federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act (the &#147;TCPA&#148;) and similar &#147;do not call&#148; legislation. These measures have significantly increased the costs associated with telemarketing. While we continue to be subject to telemarketing risks and potential liability, we believe that our exposure to adverse effects from telemarketing legislation and enforcement is mitigated in some instances by the use of permission-based marketing, under which we obtain the permission of prospective purchasers to contact them in the future. We participate in various programs and follow certain procedures that we believe help reduce the possibility that we contact individuals who have requested to be placed on federal or state &#147;do not call&#148; lists, including subscribing to the federal and certain state &#147;do not call&#148; lists, and maintaining an internal &#147;do not call&#148; list. 

Lending Regulation 

Our lending activities are subject to a number of laws and regulations including those of applicable supervisory agencies such as, in the United States, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the FTC, and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. These laws and regulations, some of which contain exceptions applicable to the timeshare industry, may include, among others, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and Regulation X, the Truth In Lending Act and Regulation Z, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Housing Act and implementing regulations, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E, unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices regulations and the Consumer Practices Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act and the Bank Secrecy Act. Our lending activities are also subject to the laws and regulations of other jurisdictions, including, among others, laws and regulations related to consumer loans, retail installment contracts, mortgage lending, usury, fair debt collection practices, consumer debt collection practices, mortgage disclosure, lender or mortgage loan originator licensing and registration and anti-money laundering. 

Resort Management Regulation 

Our resort management activities are subject to laws and regulations regarding community association management, public lodging, food and beverage services, labor, employment, health care, health and safety, 

&#160;

accessibility, discrimination, immigration, gaming, and the environment (including climate change). In addition, many jurisdictions in which we manage our resorts have statutory provisions that limit the duration of the initial and renewal terms of our management agreements for property owners&#146; associations and/or permit the property owners&#146; association for a resort to terminate our management agreement under certain circumstances (for example, upon a super-majority vote of the owners), even if we are not in default under the agreement. 

Environmental Compliance and Awareness 

The properties we manage or develop are subject to national, state and local laws and regulations that govern the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relate to protecting the environment. These laws and regulations include requirements that address health and safety; the use, management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes; and emission or discharge of wastes or other materials. We believe that our management and development of properties comply, in all material respects, with environmental laws and regulations. Our compliance with such provisions also has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position, nor do we anticipate that such compliance will have a material impact in the future. 

We take our commitment to protecting the environment seriously. We have collaborated with Audubon International to further the &#147;greening&#148; of our resorts in our North America segment through the Audubon Green Leaf Eco-Rating Program for Hotels. The Audubon partnership is just one of several programs incorporated into our green initiatives. We have more than 20 years of energy conservation experience that we have put to use in implementing our environmental strategy across all of our segments. This strategy includes further reducing energy and water consumption, expanding our portfolio of green resorts, including LEED &#174; (Leadership in Energy &#38; Environmental Design) certification, educating and inspiring associates and guests to support the environment, and embracing innovation. 

Employees 

As of January 1, 2016 we had nearly 10,000 employees with an average length of service of approximately seven years. We believe our relations with our employees are very good.
