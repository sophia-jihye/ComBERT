 ITEM 1. 

BUSINESS &#160; 

Company Overview &#160; 

Conn's is a leading specialty retailer that offers a broad selection of quality, branded durable consumer goods and related services in addition to a proprietary credit solution for its core credit constrained consumers. We operate an integrated and scalable business through our retail stores and website. Our complementary product offerings include furniture and mattresses, home appliances, consumer electronics and home office products from leading global brands across a wide range of price points. Our credit offering provides financing solutions to a large, under-served population of credit constrained consumers who typically have limited banking options. &#32;We provide customers the opportunity to comparison shop across brands with confidence in our competitive prices as well as affordable monthly payment options, next day delivery and installation in the majority of our markets, and product repair service. We believe our large, attractively merchandised stores and credit solutions offer a distinctive shopping experience compared to other retailers that target our core customer demographic. 

Our fiscal year ends on January 31. References to a fiscal year refer to the calendar year in which the fiscal year ends. 

We operate two reportable segments: retail and credit. Information regarding segment performance is included in Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , and Part II, Item 8. in Note 16, Segment Information , of the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Retail Segment. We began as a small plumbing and heating business in 1890 and started selling home appliances to the retail market in 1937 through one store located in Beaumont, Texas. As of January 31, 2016 , we operated 103 &#32;retail stores located in 12 &#32;states. Our stores typically range in size from 25,000 &#32;to 50,000 &#32;square feet and are predominantly located in areas densely populated by our core customer and are typically anchor stores in strip malls. 

We utilize a merchandising strategy that offers approximately 3,000 &#32;quality, branded products across a wide range of price points. This wide selection allows us to offer products and price points that appeal to the majority of our core consumers. Our primary retail product categories include: 

&#8226; 

Furniture and mattress, including furniture and related accessories for the living room, dining room and bedroom, as well as both traditional and specialty mattresses. We offer such brands as Franklin, Catnapper, Serta, Sealy, and Tempur-Pedic. 

&#8226; 

Home appliance, including refrigerators, freezers, washers, dryers, dishwashers and ranges. We offer such brands as Samsung, LG, General Electric, and Frigidaire. 

&#8226; 

Consumer electronics, including LED, OLED, Ultra HD, and internet-ready televisions, Blu-ray players, home theater and portable audio equipment. We offer such brands as Samsung, LG, Sharp, Sony, Haier, Monster, Sanus, and Bose. 

&#8226; 

Home office, including computers, printers and accessories. We offer such brands as HP, Samsung, LG, and Dell. 

We strive to ensure that our customers' shopping experience at Conn's is equal to, or exceeds, their experience with other providers of durable consumer goods targeting our core customer demographic. We offer a high level of customer service through our commissioned and trained sales force as well as next day delivery and installation in the majority of our markets, and product repair or replacement services for most items sold in our stores. Flexible payment alternatives offered through our proprietary in-house credit programs and third-party financing alternatives provide our customers the ability to make aspirational purchases. We believe our extensive brand and product selection, competitive pricing, financing alternatives and supporting services, combined with our customer service-focused store, delivery and service associates make us an attractive alternative to appliance and electronics superstores, department stores and other national, regional, local and internet retailers. 

Credit Segment. Our in-house consumer credit programs are an integral part of our business and is a major driver of customer loyalty. We believe our proprietary credit model is a significant competitive advantage we have developed over our 50-plus years of experience in providing credit. We have developed a proprietary underwriting model that provides standardized credit decisions, including down payment, limit amounts and credit terms, based on customer risk and income level. We use our proprietary auto-decision algorithm and in-depth evaluations of creditworthiness performed by qualified in-house credit underwriters to complete all credit decisions. In order to improve the speed and consistency of underwriting decisions, we continually review our auto- 

Table of Contents 

decision algorithm. Additionally, we provide access to monthly payment options to a wider range of consumers through our relationship with AcceptanceNow and Synchrony Bank. AcceptanceNow and Synchrony Bank manage their own respective underwriting decisions and are responsible for their own collections. Our in-house credit programs and access to third-party financing allows us to provide credit to a large and under-served customer base and differentiates us from our competitors that do not offer similar programs. 

Our goal is to provide every customer that enters our stores or applies for credit on our website an affordable monthly payment option. Currently, we make the following payment options available to our customers based on a review of their credit worthiness: 

&#8226; 

For customers with credit scores that are typically above 650, we offer special low or no-interest financing program on select products through a Conn's branded revolving credit card from Synchrony Bank or we may offer an in-house financing program; 

&#8226; 

For customers with credit scores that are typically between 550 and 650, we offer our proprietary in-house financing program, which is a fixed term, fixed payment installment contract; and 

&#8226; 

For customers that do not qualify for our credit programs, we offer a rent-to-own payment option through AcceptanceNow. 

We continue to evaluate alternative financing programs that may give us the ability to provide more customers with the ability to purchase the products and services we offer. 

Our retail business and credit business operate independently from each other. The retail segment is not involved in credit approval decisions or collections. Decisions to extend consumer credit to our retail customers under our in-house programs are made by our internal credit underwriting department. In addition to underwriting, we manage the collection process of our in-house consumer credit portfolio. Sales financed through our in-house credit programs are secured by the products purchased, which we believe gives us a distinct advantage over other creditors when pursuing collections. Also, the products we sell and finance are typically necessities for the home. 

We believe our attractive credit program generates strong customer loyalty and repeat business. For fiscal year 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , 54% , 52% &#32;and 56% , respectively, of our credit customers were repeat customers, based on the number of credit invoices written. As of January 31, 2016 &#32;and 2015 , 60% &#32;and 61% , respectively, of balances due under our in-house credit programs were from customers that have had previous credit accounts with us. 

Industry and Market Overview &#160; 

The products we sell are often times considered home necessities, used by our customers in their everyday lives. Many factors influence sales, including consumer confidence, economic conditions, and household formations. We benefit from the introduction of new products and technologies driving consumers to upgrade existing appliances and electronics. 

With 55 &#32;of our 103 &#32;stores in Texas, we continue to benefit from strong demographic trends. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, Texas was the largest state by nominal GDP in 2015 . In addition, from calendar year 2011 to 2015 &#32;Texas experienced population growth of 7.1% &#32;compared to the U.S. population growth of 3.1% &#32;over the same period. Moreover, Texas' average unemployment rate of 4.5% &#32;is below the national rate of 4.9% &#32;as of January 2016 . 

Furniture and Mattress. &#160; According to the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis, personal consumption expenditures for household furniture was $103.3 billion &#32;for calendar year 2015 , compared to $98.2 billion &#32;in 2014 . The household furniture and mattress market is highly fragmented with sales coming from manufacturer-owned stores, independent dealers, furniture centers, specialty sleep product stores, national and local chains, mass market retailers, department stores and, to a lesser extent, home improvement centers, decorator showrooms, wholesale clubs, catalog retailers and the internet. For fiscal year 2016 , we generated 34.2% &#32;of total product sales from the sale of furniture and mattresses. The furniture and mattress category generated our highest individual product category gross margin. Given our ability to provide customer financing and next day delivery, we believe that we have strong competitive advantages and significant growth opportunities in this market and expect to continue to expand our offering of furniture and the floor space in our stores dedicated to this category. 

Product design and innovation has been a key driver of sales in this market. Products introduced include specialty mattresses and motion furniture products, and variations on these products, including new features. 

Home Appliance. &#160; According to the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis, personal consumption expenditures for home appliances were $46.7 billion &#32;for calendar year 2015 , compared to $46.1 billion &#32;in 2014 . Major household appliances, such as refrigerators and washer/dryers, account for 86.3% &#32;of this total at $40.3 billion &#32;in 2015 . For fiscal year 2016 , we generated 29.7% &#32;of total product sales from the sale of home appliances. The retail appliance market is large and concentrated among a few major dealers, with sales coming primarily from department stores, home improvement centers, large appliance and electronics superstores, national chains and small regional chains. 

Table of Contents 

Key drivers of sales in the appliance market include product design and innovation. Examples of products introduced include large-capacity, high-efficiency laundry appliances and refrigerator design innovation, and variations on these products, including new features. 

Consumer Electronics and Home Office. &#160; According to the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis, electronics spending was $216.2 billion &#32;for calendar year 2015 , a 2.6% &#32;increase from 2014 . Televisions accounted for $36.6 billion &#32;of the overall personal consumption expenditures, versus $36.7 billion in the prior year. Personal computers and peripheral equipment accounted for $55.4 billion &#32;of the overall expenditures, compared to $52.7 billion &#32;in the prior year. For fiscal year 2016 , we generated 26.0% &#32;of total product sales from the sale of consumer electronics and 8.5% &#32;of total product sales from the sale of home office products. The electronics market is highly fragmented with sales coming from large appliance and electronics superstores, national chains, small regional chains, single-store operators, consumer electronics departments of selected department and discount stores and internet retailers. 

Technological advancements and the introduction of new products have largely driven demand in the electronics market. Historically, industry growth has been fueled primarily by the introduction of products that incorporate new technologies, including LED, OLED, Ultra HD, and internet-ready, for televisions, Blu-ray players, home theater and touch-screen computers. Digital products offer significant advantages, including better clarity and quality of video and audio, durability of recording and compatibility with computers and tablets. 

Consumer Credit. &#160; Based on data from the Federal Reserve System, estimated total consumer credit outstanding, which excludes primarily loans secured by real estate, was $3.5 trillion &#32;as of December 31, 2015 , an increase of 6.9% &#32;from $3.3 trillion &#32;at December 31, 2014 . Consumers obtain credit from banks, credit unions, finance companies and non-financial businesses that offer credit, including retailers. The credit obtained takes many forms, including revolving (e.g., credit cards) and fixed-term (e.g., automobile loans), and at times is secured by the products being purchased. 

Competition. &#32;Our competitive strength is based on enhanced customer service and customer shopping experience through our unique sales force training and product knowledge, next day delivery capabilities, offering of financing options for most customers, including our proprietary in-house credit programs, low price guarantee and product repair service. Currently, we compete against a diverse group of retailers, including national mass merchants such as Sears, Wal-Mart, Target, Sam's Club and Costco, specialized national retailers such as Best Buy, Rooms To Go, hhgregg and Mattress Firm, home improvement stores such as Lowe's and Home Depot, and locally-owned regional or independent retail specialty stores that sell furniture and mattresses, home appliances, and consumer electronics similar, and often identical, to those items we sell. We also compete with retailers that market products through store catalogs and the internet. In addition, there are few barriers to entry into our current and contemplated markets, and new competitors may enter our current or future markets at any time. However, these competitors typically do not provide a credit offering similar to our proprietary in-house credit programs for credit constrained consumers. We also compete, to some extent, against companies offering credit constrained consumers products for the home similar to those offered by us under weekly or monthly rent-to-own payment options. Competitors include Aaron's and Rent-A-Center, as well as many smaller, independent companies. 

Customers 

We have a well-defined core consumer base that is comprised of working individuals who typically earn between $25,000 &#32;to $60,000 &#32;in annual income, live in densely populated and mature neighborhoods, and typically shop our stores to replace older household goods with newer items. Our product line is comprised of durable home necessities which enables us to appeal to a diverse range of cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds and to operate stores in diverse markets. No single customer accounts for more than 10% of our total revenues and we otherwise do not have a significant concentration of sales with any individual customer and, therefore, the loss of any one customer would not have a material impact on our business. 

Seasonality &#160; 

Our business is seasonal with a higher portion of sales and operating profit realized during the fourth quarter due primarily to the holiday selling season. In addition, our results of operations and portfolio performance are stronger during our first quarter due primarily to the timing of personal income tax refunds received by our customers. &#32; 

Merchandising 

Vendors. &#160; We purchase products from approximately 200 &#32;manufacturers and distributors. Our agreements with these manufacturers and distributors typically cover a one-year time period, are renewable at the option of the parties and are terminable upon 30 days written notice by either party. Similar to other specialty retailers, we purchase a significant portion of our total inventory from a limited number of vendors. During fiscal year 2016 , 62.1% &#32;of our total inventory purchases were from six vendors, including 29.1% , 17.9% &#32;and 4.7% &#32;of our total inventory purchases from Samsung, LG, and GE, respectively. The loss of any one or more of these key vendors or our failure to establish and maintain relationships with these and other vendors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Other than industry-wide shortages that occur from time to 

Table of Contents 

time, we have not experienced significant difficulty in maintaining adequate sources of merchandise and we generally expect that adequate sources of merchandise will continue to exist for the types of products we sell. 

Merchandise. &#160; We focus on providing a comprehensive selection of quality merchandise at a wide range of price points to appeal to a broad range of potential customers. We primarily sell brand name warranted merchandise. Our established relationships with furniture and mattress, home appliance and consumer electronics vendors give us purchasing power that allows us to offer custom-featured appliances and electronics at prices that compare favorably with national retailers and provides us a competitive selling advantage over other independent retailers. Additionally, we are able to purchase furniture inventory in volumes that allow us to provide next-day delivery and at competitive prices, giving us a competitive advantage over smaller furniture retailers in the marketplace today. 

Credit Operations &#160; 

General. &#160; We sell our products by offering our customers financing through our proprietary in-house credit programs, the use of third-party financing, and by taking cash or credit card payments. 

Underwriting. Decisions to extend credit to our retail customers are made by our internal credit underwriting department, which is separate and distinct from our other operations, including credit monitoring and collections and retail sales. In addition to an auto-decision algorithm, we employ a team of credit underwriting personnel of approximately 45 individuals to make credit granting decisions using our proprietary underwriting process and oversee our credit underwriting process. Our underwriting process considers one or more of the following elements: credit bureau information; income and address verification; current income and debt levels; a review of the customer's previous credit history with us; and the particular products being purchased. Our underwriting model determines the finance terms, including down payment, limit amounts and credit terms. During fiscal year 2016 , for the credit applications that were approved and utilized, 73.5% were approved automatically. The remaining credit decisions were based on the evaluation of the customer's creditworthiness by a qualified in-house credit underwriter or required additional documentation from the applicant. For certain credit applicants that may have past credit problems or lack credit history, we use stricter underwriting criteria. The additional requirements include verification of employment and recent work history, reference checks and minimum down payment levels. Our underwriting employees are trained to follow our methodology in approving credit and are required to complete regular refresher training. 

Part of our ability to control delinquency and net charge-off is based on the level of down payments and limits that we require, the maximum contract terms we allow and the purchase money security interest that we obtain in the product financed, which reduce our credit risk and increase our customers' ability and willingness to meet their future obligations. We require the customer to provide proof of property insurance coverage on all installment credit purchases to offset potential losses relating to theft or damage of the product financed. We do not require customers to purchase property insurance from us if they have or acquire such insurance from another third-party. 

Credit monitoring and collections. Our collection activities involve a combination of efforts that take place in our Beaumont and San Antonio, Texas collection centers. We employed approximately 830 full time and part time individual collectors and support personnel who service our active customer credit portfolio. We also utilize collection agencies to service portions of our active and charged-off portfolio, which provide approximately 350 additional agents located in Phoenix, Arizona. Our in-house, credit-financed sales are secured by the products purchased, which we believe gives us a distinct advantage over other creditors when pursuing collections, especially given that many of the products we finance are generally necessities for the home. We employ a credit collection strategy that includes dialer-based calls, virtual calling and messaging systems, inside collectors that contact borrowers, collection letters, e-mails, and text messages, a legal staff that processes claims and attends bankruptcy hearings, and voluntary repossession. We also utilize current technologies that assist us in locating contact information for customers who have moved and left no contact information. Our employees are trained to follow our methodology in collecting our accounts and charging off any uncollectible accounts based on pre-determined aging criteria, depending on their area of responsibility. All collection personnel are required to complete classroom training, which includes negotiation techniques and credit policy training to ensure customer retention and compliance with debt collection regulations. Post-graduation, the collection trainees undergo skill assessment training, coaching and call monitoring within their respective departments. Our personnel are required to complete regular refresher training and testing. 

We closely monitor the credit portfolio to identify delinquent accounts early and dedicate resources to contacting customers concerning past due accounts. We believe that our unique underwriting model, secured interest in the products financed, required down payments and limits, local presence, ability to work with customers relative to their product and service needs, and the flexible financing alternatives we offer help mitigate the loss experience on our portfolio. 

Customers can make payments through our web portal, over the phone, ACH, third-party bill pay arrangements, lock box, or in-person at our store locations. During fiscal year 2016 , we received 93.3% &#32;of customer payments in a form other than cash. Also during fiscal year 2016 , we received 40.3% &#32;of the payments on credit accounts in our store locations, which helps us maintain a relationship with the customer that keeps losses lower while encouraging repeat purchases. 

Table of Contents 

We regularly extend or "re-age" a portion of our delinquent customer accounts as a part of our normal collection procedures to protect our investment. Generally, extensions are granted to customers who have experienced a financial difficulty (such as the temporary loss of employment), which was subsequently resolved and the customer indicates a willingness and ability to resume making monthly payments. Re-ages are not granted to debtors who demonstrate a lack of intent or ability to service the obligation or have reached our limits for account re-aging. These re-ages involve modifying the payment terms to defer a portion of the cash payments currently required of the debtor to help the debtor improve his or her financial condition and eventually be able to pay us. Our re-aging of customer accounts does not change the interest rate or the total amount due from the customer and typically does not reduce the monthly contractual payments. We may also charge the customer an extension fee, which approximates the interest owed for the time period the contract was past due. To a much lesser extent, we may provide the customer the ability to re-age their obligation by refinancing the account, which does not change the interest rate or the total amount due from the customer but does reduce the monthly contractual payments. Under these options, as with extensions, the customer must resolve the reason for delinquency and show a willingness and ability to resume making contractual monthly payments. &#32; 

We deem accounts to be uncollectible and charge off when the account is more than 209 days past due at the end of a month. Our credit and accounting staff consistently monitor trends in charge-offs by examining the various characteristics of the charge-offs, including store of origination, product type, customer credit and income information, down payment amounts and other identifying information. We track our charge-offs both gross, before recoveries, and net, after recoveries. We periodically adjust our credit granting, collection and charge-off policies based on this information. It is to our advantage to manage the portfolio to balance the combined servicing costs and net losses on the credit portfolio with the benefit of repeat retail sales. We may incur higher servicing costs in order to build customer relationships that may result in future retail sales.

Our stores have an average selling space of approximately 34,000 &#32;square feet, plus a storage area for fast-moving and smaller products that customers prefer to carry out rather than wait for in-home delivery and cross-dock facilities for 17 &#32;stores. 

We continuously evaluate our existing and potential sites to position our stores in desirable locations and relocate stores that are not properly positioned. We typically lease rather than purchase our stores, distribution centers and cross-dock facilities to retain the flexibility of managing our financial commitment to a location if we later decide that a store or market is performing below our standards or the market would be better served by a relocation. As of January 31, 2016 , &#160; we leased the majority of our store, distribution center and cross-dock locations.

Personnel and compensation. We staff a typical store with a store manager, an assistant manager, an average of 22 sales personnel and other support staff, including cashiers and porters based on store size and location. Managers have an average tenure with us of approximately 4 years and typically have prior sales floor experience. In addition to store managers, we have 15 district managers, which generally oversee from seven to 10 stores in each market. The senior management team of retail operations has an average of approximately 30 years of experience with us. 

We compensate the majority of our sales associates on a straight commission arrangement. Assistant store managers receive earned commissions plus base salary, while store managers are compensated on a salary plus bonus basis. We believe that because our store compensation plans are primarily tied to sales, they generally provide us an advantage in attracting and retaining highly motivated employees. 

Training. New sales personnel complete an intensive classroom training program in the markets where they will be assigned, under the direction of sales management personnel in those markets. In addition, our employees benefit from on-site training conducted by many of our vendors. 

We attempt to identify store manager candidates early in their careers with us and place them in a training program. They attend our in-house training program, which provides guidance and direction for the development of managerial and supervisory skills. After completion of the training program, manager candidates work as assistant managers for six to twelve months and are then allowed to manage one of our smaller stores, where they are supervised closely by the store's district manager. We give new managers an opportunity to operate larger stores as they become more proficient in their management skills. Each store manager attends mandatory training sessions on a regular basis and also attends sales training meetings where participants receive and discuss new product information. 

Advertising 

We design our marketing programs to increase awareness of our brands, which we expect will create and maintain customer loyalty, increase the number of customers that shop our stores and increase our sales. We utilize a multi-touch point approach utilizing direct mail, television, newspaper, digital, radio and out-of-home targeted advertising. Our promotional programs include the use of free delivery and free product promotions, in conjunction with various no-interest financing offers. 

Our website provides customers the ability to apply for credit and purchase our products on-line. Our website averaged approximately 41,000 &#32; credit applications per month during fiscal year 2016 . This compares to average monthly website applications of approximately 36,000 and 23,000 during fiscal year 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. The website is linked to a call center, allowing us to better assist customers with their credit and product needs. 

Distribution and Inventory Management 

We currently operate nine &#32;regional distribution centers located in Houston, San Antonio, Dallas, Beaumont, El Paso, and McAllen, Texas; Phoenix, Arizona; Denver, Colorado and Charlotte, North Carolina, 14 &#32;smaller cross-dock facilities, and 17 &#32;stores with cross-dock facilities. This enables us to deliver products to our customers quickly, reduces inventory requirements at the individual stores and facilitates regional inventory and accounting controls. 

In our retail stores, we maintain an inventory of certain fast-moving items and products that the customer is likely to carry out of the store. Our computer system and the use of scanning technology in our distribution centers allow us to determine, on a real-time basis, the location of any product we sell. If we do not have a product at the desired retail store at the time of sale, we can provide it through one of our distribution centers on a next day basis. 

We primarily use third-party providers to move products from distribution centers to stores and between markets to meet customer needs. We outsource the majority of our in-home deliveries to third-party providers. We use a fleet of home delivery vehicles that enables a highly-trained staff of delivery and installation specialists to quickly complete the sales process and enhance customer service. We also may receive a delivery fee based on the products sold and the services needed to complete the delivery. 

Product Support Services 

Next-day delivery and installation. We provide next-day delivery and installation services in most of the markets in which we operate. We believe next-day delivery of our goods is a highly valued service to our customers. 

Credit insurance. Acting as licensed agents for third-party insurance companies, we offer property, life, disability and involuntary unemployment credit insurance, which we collectively refer to as credit insurance, at all of our stores on sales financed through our offered credit programs. These insurance products protect the customer's purchase by covering their payments on their credit account if covered events occur, and can be canceled at any time. We receive sales commissions from the third-party insurance company at the time we sell the coverage, and we receive retrospective commissions, which are additional commissions paid by the insurance carrier if insurance claims are less than earned premiums. 

Table of Contents 

We require proof of property insurance on all installment credit purchases; however, we do not require that customers purchase this insurance from us if they have or acquire such insurance from another third-party provider. Premiums charged on the credit products we sell are regulated and vary by state. 

Product repair service. We believe that providing product repair and replacement services is an important differentiation and reinforces customer loyalty. We provide service for most of the products we sell and only for the products we sell. 

Repair service agreements. Customers may purchase repair service agreements that we sell for third-party insurers at the time the product is purchased. These agreements broaden and extend the period of covered manufacturer warranty service for up to four years from the date of purchase, depending on the product, and protect the customer against repair costs. Customers may finance the cost of the agreements along with the purchase price of the associated product. Through a third-party insurer, customers are contacted to provide them the opportunity to purchase an extended period of coverage after the manufacturer warranty and repair service agreement expire and we receive a commission on each sale. 

We have contracts with third-party insurers that issue the initial repair service agreements to cover the costs of repairs performed under these agreements. The initial service agreement is between the customer and the third-party insurance company, and, through our agreements with the third-party insurance company, we provide service when it is needed under each agreement sold. We receive a commission on the sale of the contract and we may receive retrospective commissions, which are additional commissions paid by the insurance carrier over time if the cost of repair claims are less than earned premiums. Additionally, we bill the insurance company for the cost of the service work that we perform. 

Regulation 

The extension of credit to consumers and related collection efforts is a highly regulated area of our business. Numerous federal and state laws impose disclosure and other requirements on the origination, servicing and enforcement of credit accounts. These laws include, but are not limited to, the Federal Truth in Lending Act, Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ("Dodd-Frank Act"), Fair Credit Reporting Act, Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, Telephone Consumer Protection Act and Federal Trade Commission Act. State laws impose limitations on the maximum amount of finance charges that we can charge and also impose other restrictions on consumer creditors, such as us, including restrictions on collection and enforcement. We routinely review our contracts and procedures to ensure compliance with applicable consumer credit laws. Failure on our part to comply with applicable laws could expose us to substantial penalties and claims for damages and, in certain circumstances, may require us to refund finance charges already paid and to forgo finance charges not yet paid under non-complying contracts. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable federal and state consumer credit and collection laws. 

Our sale of property, life, disability and involuntary unemployment credit insurance products is also highly regulated. State laws currently impose disclosure obligations with respect to our sales of credit and other insurance products similar to those required by the Federal Truth in Lending Act, impose restrictions on the amount of premiums that we may charge and require licensing of certain of our employees and operating entities. We believe we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations relating to our credit insurance business. 

Employees 

As of January 31, 2016 , we had approximately 4,300 full-time employees and 300 part-time employees. We offer a comprehensive benefits package for eligible employees, including health, life, short- and long-term disability, and dental insurance coverage as well as a 401(k) plan, employee stock purchase plan, paid vacation and holiday pay. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements governing their employment with us, and we believe that our employee relations are good. We have a formal dispute resolution plan that requires mandatory arbitration for employment-related issues.
