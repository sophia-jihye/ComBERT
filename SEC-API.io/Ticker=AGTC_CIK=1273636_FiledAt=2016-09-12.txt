 ITEM 1. 

BUSINESS

Overview

We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company using gene therapy based on adeno-associated virus, or AAV, to develop genetic therapies to treat patients with inherited diseases. Each treatment is precisely designed to address a specific genetic disorder. Our most advanced gene therapy programs are designed to produce treatments that will restore visual function in patients with rare blinding diseases. Genetic therapies are complex with interdependent components that must work in harmony. Fifteen years of gene therapy experience allows us to design and construct all critical gene therapy components and bring them together to develop potentially effective treatments for patients. We are committed to attracting and maintaining a team with a substantial breadth of clinical and scientific expertise who can foster an atmosphere of scientific growth and discovery.

Our strategy is to leverage the capabilities of our gene therapy platform to address diseases in ophthalmology where there is significant unmet medical need. We have concentrated initially on underserved orphan indications that are small enough to allow for clinical trials on a manageable scale but have a sufficient prevalence by orphan disease standards to provide a substantial commercial opportunity that we believe we can serve using a small, targeted commercial infrastructure. The eye diseases we are targeting are well understood with highly predictive animal models and clearly defined clinical endpoints, characteristics that we believe will facilitate clinical development and regulatory approval of our product candidates. We believe our initial focus on these orphan eye diseases will provide us with an attractive business opportunity and position us to drive the advancement of gene therapy technology. We plan to leverage our experience in orphan ophthalmology to develop new treatments for eye diseases with larger patient populations, such as wet age-related macular degeneration, or wet AMD. We will also evaluate opportunities to extend the commercial application of our gene therapy platform in other underserved indications beyond ophthalmology and to that end we recently announced initiation of research efforts in otology to identify opportunities to use our platform to address genetic causes of hearing loss.

Our most advanced products consist of four ophthalmology development programs across three targets, X&#8209;linked retinoschisis (XLRS), X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP), caused by mutations in the RPGR gene, and achromatopsia (ACHM) caused by mutations in either the CNGB3 gene or the CNGA3 gene. These three inherited orphan diseases of the eye are caused by mutations in single genes that significantly affect visual function and currently lack effective medical treatments. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

XLRS is characterized by abnormal splitting of the layers of the retina, resulting in poor visual function in young boys, which can progress to legal bl indness in adult men. Additionally, approximately 40% of patients are at risk of retinal hemorrhage or detachment. We currently are enrolling patients in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial with our XLRS product candidate. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

ACHM is characterized by the absence of cone photoreceptor function, resulting in extremely poor visual acuity, light sensitivity, day blindness and complete loss of color discrimination. We currently are enrolling patients in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial for our ACHM B3 product candidate. We anticipate filing an IND for our second ACHM product candidate targeting the &#8220;A3&#8221; gene this year. 

&#160;

&#183; 

XLRP is a disease characterized by progressive degeneration of the retina, which can lead to total blindness in adult men. We are currently conducting IND enabling preclinical studies for our XLRP product candidate. We expect to file an IND in 2017, and thereafter initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in the United States. In July 2015, we entered into a broad collaboration and license agreement with Biogen MA, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Biogen Inc., or Biogen, to develop gene-based therapies for multiple ophthalmic diseases. Our XLRS and XLRP product candidates are licensed to Biogen pursuant to this agreement together with options to three discovery stage programs. 

We continue to move forward additional ophthalmology indications, such as AMD and blue cone monochromacy, or BCM, in early research studies. We also have active programs to identify novel capsids and promoters in order to advance our gene therapy platform as well as projects to continue advancing our proprietary manufacturing platform.

Our gene therapy platform is based on viral vectors that utilize a modified version of non-replicating AAV to deliver a functional copy of a gene to the patient&#8217;s own cells through a variety of delivery methods, and we have obtained preliminary indications of safety and efficacy in clinical trials. These vectors deliver the functional genetic material to the nucleus of the cell, providing safe, sustained expression of the therapeutic protein to treat the disease without modifying the existing DNA of the patient.

We employ a highly targeted approach to selecting and designing our product candidates, choosing to develop therapies for indications having significant unmet medical need, clinical feasibility and commercial potential. We have a significant intellectual property portfolio and substantial gene therapy experience, which we believe will allow us to design and implement all critical gene therapy components and bring them together to develop potentially effective treatments for patients. These components include the capsid, promoter, gene cassette, formulation, manufacturing and physical delivery. 

Our proprietary AAV vector manufacturing process is both reproducible and scalable with a favorable cost of goods. We have assembled an experienced team with a substantial breadth of clinical, scientific, and management expertise who can foster an atmosphere of scientific growth and discovery. Our team works with a group of scientific advisors, and has strong collaborative relationships with recognized leaders in the field of ophthalmology, otology and gene therapy. 

Our AAV vectors can be used to introduce functional genes into many different cell types by a variety of delivery methods and can carry genes of up to 4,000 base pairs in length, a payload capacity sufficient to accommodate more than 90% of the individual genes in the human genome. We have developed a proprietary manufacturing process that we believe will enable our vectors to be manufactured reliably, and at high quality, on a commercial scale. Our gene therapy platform therefore has the potential to provide treatments for many other diseases outside of our current focus, including those with large dosing requirements or in larger markets. We expect to explore additional therapeutic areas selectively, either alone or through partnerships.

&#160;

&#160;

The chart below summarizes our current gene therapy programs: &#160; 

Our initial focus on orphan ophthalmology

Many chronically debilitating diseases for which there are currently no effective treatments have patient populations too small to attract the interest of large commercial entities. We believe that such orphan diseases can provide us with an attractive business opportunity. We are concentrating initially on several underserved diseases that have a relatively high prevalence by orphan disease standards but are small enough to allow for clinical trials on a manageable scale and provide markets that we believe we can serve using a small, targeted commercial infrastructure.

We are focused on treatments that can restore visual function for patients with rare blinding eye diseases for which we believe there is a significant unmet medical need. The diseases we are targeting are also of interest to us due to a number of factors that, in combination, have enabled us to screen and more accurately predict the potential safety and efficacy of product candidates at an early stage of development:

&#160;

&#183; 

Well-understood disease mechanisms . Because sight is the most important sense to humans&#8212;many people report that they fear blindness even more than premature death&#8212;even very rare diseases that cause vision loss have been studied extensively and are well-understood down to the molecular mechanism of action. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Monogenic diseases. &#160; We are initially pursuing eye diseases where the genetic abnormality is known and is caused by mutations in a single gene, known as monogenic diseases. We therefore know exactly what gene sequence to insert and which cell types to target for treatment, thus mitigating the uncertainty of disease biology. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Highly predictive animal models. &#160; For many eye diseases there are highly predictive animal models in which the disease is caused by the same underlying genetic defect and has clinical outcomes that are similar to those in humans. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Local delivery of therapeutic agent. Direct delivery to the eye of a therapeutic agent, via methods already widely used in ophthalmology, allows us to use lower doses, with reduced risk of unintended effects. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Short time to clinical data. In our XLRS and ACHM trials, once the appropriate dose is determined we expect to obtain meaningful clinical data from patients within six months after a one-time administration of the product candidate, which we believe will facilitate the clinical development of our product candidates. 

Ophthalmology is also attractive to us as a clinical stage company because treatments for diseases affecting vision have clearly defined, objective clinical endpoints with validated measurement tools that are accepted by the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. Other orphan drug companies have spent considerable time and resources working with the FDA to identify acceptable clinical endpoints and develop measurement tools in sometimes ill-defined diseases. In ophthalmology four accepted endpoints&#8212;visual acuity, visual fields, contrast sensitivity and color vision&#8212;are well understood and routinely measured by 

&#160;

&#160;

clinicians . In addition, the FDA consistently applies the se endpoints and provides guidance on how much improvement is required for clinical relevancy. We believe these clearly defined endpoints will help accelerate the process of clinical study and regulatory appro val for our ophthalmic products. 

Finally, through our internal research work and in collaboration with partners, we have obtained preliminary safety data in clinical trials with the two major delivery routes used in ophthalmology: intravitreal and subretinal injection. In clinical trials conducted with a previous partner, 19 patients with wet AMD were treated by intravitreal injection of an AAV vector, and in other trials conducted by us and others more than 75 patients with Leber congenital amaurosis type 2, or LCA2, have been treated with subretinal injections of AAV vectors. No reports of serious adverse events attributed to the vector used in either of those studies were noted, and promising indications of efficacy were demonstrated for LCA2 patients.

Otology

On May 9, 2016, we announced a new initiative in the area of otology in which we will use our capabilities to develop potential gene therapy products that can address genetic causes of hearing loss. Hearing loss is one of the most common human sensory deficits and it is estimated that nearly half of the cases are suspected to have a genetic origin. Of the inherited forms of hearing loss, more than 300 genetic causes have been defined with the specific gene identified for more than 70. Despite the impairment that can be caused by deafness, very little progress has been made in developing therapies that go beyond the temporary and partial solutions provided by hearing aids and cochlear implants. In multiple academic research studies, replacement of defective genes in animal models with normal copies has been shown to improve sound propagation in the auditory hair cells, making this a potentially promising application of AAV gene therapy. Additionally, the inner ear shares many of the characteristics that make ophthalmology attractive: it is anatomically well defined and is a small, well contained space where the target cells to be treated are easily identified. In addition, the clinical outcome measures for treatments for hearing loss are well defined. Developing product candidates for conditions having these characteristics is a natural complement to our ophthalmology portfolio strategy as we apply our core capabilities and expertise to a new disease field. As part of our efforts in otology, we have formed a scientific advisory board to help guide our target selection and will announce product candidates when we formally begin development plans. 

Our strategy

Our objective is to become the world leader in developing and commercializing gene therapy treatments for patients with severe diseases, with a primary focus in ophthalmology, and thereby to provide a better life for patients with these diseases. Our strategy to accomplish this goal is to:

&#160;

&#183; 

Develop and commercialize drugs in orphan ophthalmology. Our lead product candidates are treatments for the severe orphan eye diseases XLRS, ACHM, and XLRP. Given the severity of these diseases and the current lack of treatment options, a one-time-treatment alternative that corrects the underlying genetic defect would provide superior long-term value for patients, their families and the healthcare system more broadly. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Expand our position in ophthalmology. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Continue our leadership position in orphan ophthalmology. We have developed significant experience in the orphan ophthalmology space through our work on XLRS, ACHM, XLRP and LCA2. We have strong relationships with key opinion leaders in the field and with leading patient advocacy groups. We have received grants aggregating $9.5 million from the Foundation Fighting Blindness, or FFB, the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, the National Eye Institute, or NEI, and the FDA. Our scientific advisory board is comprised of leaders in the fields of ophthalmology and genetics, including one of our scientific founders, William W. Hauswirth, Ph.D., the Rybaczki-Bullard Professor of Ophthalmology and Molecular Genetics at the University of Florida, College of Medicine. We believe this experience provides a foundation to efficiently identify and develop additional orphan ophthalmology indications. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Expand our product offerings to AMD. We plan to develop new treatments for AMD by leveraging our experience developing products in orphan ophthalmology and our work with Genzyme on a first generation product. Advances have been made in understanding the disease etiology and the number of known potential targets has increased since the first gene therapy programs attempting to treat AMD were designed. We plan to use our resources and access to experts in this field to evaluate these new targets and identify potential product candidates that can be moved into the clinic. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Seek opportunities for strategic partnerships and acquisitions in ophthalmology gene therapy. On July 1, 2015, we entered into a broad collaboration and license agreement with Biogen to develop gene-based therapies for the XLRS and XLRP programs and three discovery programs. We believe there may be additional opportunities for us to partner with companies and academic groups. We expect that our breadth of experience in research, 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

manufacturing, clinical and regulatory matters will help us to identify and execute in-licens es , co-development agreements, intellectual property acquisitions or manufacturing agreements that would further extend our leadership position in opht halmology gene therapy . &#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Extend our expertise in AAV vector design, delivery and manufacturing . We believe that our understanding of our target indications and our robust internal expertise in viral vector design including the identification of novel capsids and the optimization of genes and promoters, physical vector delivery, vector manufacturing, clinical trial design and clinical trial conduct are significant competitive advantages. We intend to continue to devote substantial resources to developing the science underlying successful AAV vector design and delivery, such as our external research collaborations with organizations such as 4D Molecular Therapeutics and University of Florida to identify next generation capsids and Synpromics to develop optimized promoters. We are also expanding our discovery capabilities to further enhance our ability to develop next generation products. To that end we have grown our research personnel from 25 employees as of June 30, 2015 to 39 at June 30, 2016 and we plan to continue our growth into 2017. We have also expanded our facilities to approximately 21,300 square feet of laboratory and office space this year from approximately 7,000 square feet, with plans to add an additional 3,000 square feet in 2017. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Expand our manufacturing capabilities. Our new process development and pilot manufacturing facility is now operational, and as we advance further into clinical development we plan to further develop our internal manufacturing capabilities. We also plan to continue to decrease our dependence on a single contract manufacturer by qualifying and contracting with multiple backup contractors. We recently began the design phase for construction of a current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, facility at our Florida headquarters in preparation for moving product candidates into later stages of development. We believe these investments will facilitate the more rapid advancement of our product candidates through regulatory approval while reducing risk, and will enhance the therapeutic and commercial potential of our gene therapy platform. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Pursue orphan indications with high unmet medical need and greater probability of clinical, regulatory and commercial success. We will continue to focus on diseases for which the underlying genetic defect is well characterized and can be addressed by correcting or inserting a single gene, for which predictive animal models exist and for which clinical endpoints are objective and are accepted by the FDA. We believe that focusing on these types of indications will enable us to obtain data more rapidly and accelerate clinical studies and regulatory approval of our products. Given the relatively low prevalence of orphan diseases and the strong key opinion leader communities and patient advocacy groups around them, we also believe these markets can be served with a small, targeted commercial infrastructure. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Evaluate opportunities to leverage our gene therapy platform to address indications outside of ophthalmology. We intend to develop and partner selectively to expand the scope of our pipeline and the utilization of our gene therapy platform. The adaptability of our platform also presents an opportunity for us to selectively form collaborative alliances to expand our capabilities and product offerings into a range of genetically defined diseases and potentially to accelerate the development and commercialization of gene therapy products more broadly. We have a collaboration with Biogen that provides us with significant resources to expand our product development activities as well as access to significant development and commercialization expertise. Also, we recently announced a new effort in otology for which we will use our platform capabilities to develop potential therapies to address genetic causes of hearing loss. 

Gene therapy background

Genes enable production of proteins that perform a vast array of functions within all living organisms. Many diseases have a genetic aspect whereby a mutated gene is passed down from generation to generation. Mutated genes can cause production of abnormal proteins, or loss of production of a protein, which can cause disease.

Gene therapy involves the introduction of a functional copy of a gene into a patient&#8217;s own cells using a delivery system most commonly based on a viral vector to treat the genetic defect. Gene therapy has the potential to change the way these patients are treated, by correcting the underlying genetic defect that is the cause of their disease rather than offering treatments that only address symptoms. We believe that by correcting the underlying genetic defect, gene therapy can provide transformative disease modifying effects&#8212;potentially with long-term durable clinical benefits based on a one-time therapeutic administration.

The promise of gene therapy has evolved over the last decade, with a growing body of clinical data that we believe has provided evidence of efficacy and safety in a variety of disease areas, improvements in vector design and manufacturing processes by us and others and the establishment of regulatory guidelines for the development and approval of gene therapy products. These advances have led to increased investment from the biopharmaceutical industry and supported the emergence of gene therapy as an important therapeutic modality for patients with significant unmet medical needs.

&#160;

&#160;

Our gene therapy platform 

Our approach to gene therapy product development is conceptually straightforward. We design an AAV vector that will carry the functional gene necessary to express the desired protein, produce the vector using our proprietary production methods, and then deliver the product directly to the appropriate cells in a patient by a suitable physical delivery method. Although the concept of gene therapy is simple, the process of developing and manufacturing AAV vectors capable of delivering the genetic material safely into a patient&#8217;s own cells is highly technical and demands significant expertise, experience and know-how.

Our gene therapy platform is built on our core competencies in three key areas:

&#160;

&#183; 

vector selection and design; 

&#160;

&#183; 

vector manufacturing and formulation; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

vector delivery. 

Our vector selection and design process

AAV vectors . The success of a gene therapy platform is highly dependent on the vector selected. Our platform is based on the use of a modified version of the non-replicating adeno-associated virus to deliver the correct DNA directly to the nucleus of the cells affected by the disease. We believe that AAV vectors are particularly well suited for treating our target diseases and have advantages over other viral vectors, such as adenovirus, herpes virus and lentivirus. These advantages include: 

Simplicity &#8212;AAV is a small, simple non-enveloped virus with only two native genes. This makes the virus straightforward to work with from a vector engineering standpoint. 

Stability &#8212;AAV is extremely stable: it is resistant to degradation by shear, solvents and enzymes, facilitating purification and final formulation. AAV stability could also enable development of a freeze-dried formulation, should this become necessary for larger markets where shipping and distribution of the current frozen formulation would be challenging. 

Sustained expression &#8212;Unlike vectors based on other viruses, our AAV vectors are capable of inserting the functional gene into the patient&#8217;s cells as an extra-chromosomal episome, which is a stable, circular form of DNA in the nucleus of cells. Inserting the functional gene as an episome supports long-term production of the protein, leading to sustained therapeutic effect, without altering the patient&#8217;s native DNA. Sustained expression is a powerful advantage of using AAV as a vector: a one-time therapeutic administration of a functional gene into a cell can potentially support protein production for the life of the cell, which, in the cell types we are currently focused on treating, may approximate the duration of the patient&#8217;s lifetime. 

Safety &#8212;We believe AAV vectors are the safest for use in human gene therapy. In contrast, clinical trials using other vectors, such as lentivirus, adenovirus and herpes virus, have reported serious adverse events. The safety advantages of AAV vectors include the following: 

&#160;

&#183; 

AAV elicits a low immune response, reducing the risk of adverse inflammatory reactions. In contrast, trials with adenoviral vectors have reported severe inflammatory reactions. 

&#160;

&#183; 

AAV vectors, while they provide sustained expression, do not alter the patient&#8217;s native DNA, and safety is therefore improved over vectors that alter the patient&#8217;s DNA. Trials using early versions of lentiviral vectors, which insert genes directly into, and thereby alter, the patients&#8217; DNA, resulted in several well-publicized adverse events, including reported cases of leukemia. 

&#160;

&#183; 

AAV has never been linked to human disease, unlike most other viruses used as gene delivery vectors such as adenovirus, herpes virus and lentivirus. 

&#160;

&#183; 

AAV vectors have no viral genes remaining, eliminating the possibility that any viral genes will cause an adverse event. 

AAV vectors have been used in more than 100 human clinical trials, by us and others, with no serious adverse events traced to the use of AAV as the gene delivery vector. In our direct experience with human clinical trials for LCA2, alpha&#8209;1 antitrypsin deficiency, or AAT deficiency, and wet AMD, over 100 patients were treated using AAV vectors, with no serious adverse events attributed to the vector. In a Phase 2 trial of our AAT deficiency product candidate, patients were treated with doses more than 300-fold higher than those planned for use in any of our ophthalmic indications, with no serious adverse events reported.

&#160;

&#160;

Carrying capacity &#8212;AAV vectors have the capacity to carry therapeutic gene sequences up to 4,000 base pairs in length into a patient&#8217;s cell. As more than 90% of human genes have coding sequences less than 3,000 base pairs in length, we expect to be able to pursue a wide va riety of indications with our AAV vectors. 

Vector design . After the selection of the vector type, there are many other critical factors to be considered when designing a gene therapy product. These include selecting the appropriate: 

&#160;

&#183; 

therapeutic gene, 

&#160;

&#183; 

promoter and related gene regulatory elements, 

&#160;

&#183; 

AAV sequences needed to signal replication and packaging, and 

&#160;

&#183; 

AAV capsid (the protein shell) in which these elements are packaged. 

&#160;

The first step in vector design is to identify the therapeutic protein that we want the patient&#8217;s own cells to produce, and many times optimize the gene for efficient therapeutic protein expression in patient&#8217;s own cells, and then insert that efficient gene into an AAV vector. Production of the protein requires a promoter, which is a genetic element that drives expression. Certain promoters function well only in certain cell types, whereas other promoters function well in almost any cell type. We make our selection by comparing different promoters in the specific type of cells that are affected in each disease target, ideally in an animal whose physiology is close to that of humans, to find the promoter that best enables production of therapeutic levels of protein in that cell type.

After the promoter and gene of interest are selected, we insert these elements between AAV viral sequences that are needed for replication and packaging of the vector into the AAV capsid. There are hundreds of variations of AAV capsids with different efficiencies in their ability to bind to and enter varying cell types. We select the capsid for a specific product candidate after comparing different capsids in the type of cells that are affected by the targeted disease.

One of our key capabilities is our depth of understanding of the complex interplay between the clinical disease, the cells in the patient&#8217;s body that need treatment, the selection of a capsid and a promoter, the design of the gene construct and the physical administration method. We have spent years conducting research on the best combinations of these elements with the aim of developing safe and effective gene therapy treatments.

Vector manufacturing: our H.A.V.E. method

We have developed a proprietary, high-yield vector manufacturing process using scalable technologies for herpes-assisted vector expansion, which we refer to as our H.A.V.E. manufacturing method. While the H.A.V.E. manufacturing method uses the herpes virus as a helper in the first step of a four-step AAV vector manufacturing process, there is no herpes virus in the final product. Our H.A.V.E. manufacturing method addresses problems of low productivity and low efficacy that have historically plagued efforts to manufacture AAV vectors and enables us to produce vectors with improved potency, efficiency and safety over processes previously used by us and others. It also enables us to produce a more purified and concentrated end product, as evidenced by an approximately 25- to 30-fold reduction in non-infectious viral contaminants as compared to vectors used in previous clinical trials.

Our manufacturing process has been reviewed by both the FDA and the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and has been authorized for production of product candidates for use in clinical trials in the United States and Europe. Our manufacturing process is also reproducible and scalable. It has been transferred successfully to Genzyme and to SAFC (a part of Millipore Sigma), our contract manufacturing organization, where it is used in manufacturing clinical materials pursuant to the FDA&#8217;s cGMP requirements.

&#160;

&#160;

While SAFC continues to be our primary contract manufacturer, our new process development facility is now operational and we are conducting equipment evaluation runs with multiple vendors to support development of commercial processes for our product candidates, if approved. Additionally, we are vetting multiple new cGMP contract manufacturers to ensure sufficient capacity for all programs as they advance in the clinic and to account for any unforeseeable circumstances. Further we have begun design work on an internal cGMP facility at our Florida headquarters. 

We own or have licensed 26 issued patents and 6 pending patent applications covering our manufacturing technology. We believe that our core competency and intellectual property estate in vector manufacturing differentiate us competitively and provide a key element of our gene therapy platform.

Vector delivery

Our gene therapy platform allows for vector delivery by a variety of methods, and we select the method that is best suited for the disease we are targeting. The method used depends on the type of cells we are targeting for treatment.

In ophthalmology, the product candidate can best be delivered to cells in the eye by either intravitreal or subretinal injection.

Intravitreal injection into the vitreous humor, which is the clear gel that fills the space between the lens and the retina of the eye, is best for delivering the product candidate to the retinal neurons in the inner retina (the portion of the retina closest to the lens), to photoreceptors located in the fovea (the very center of the macula, which is the central part of the retina that is required for fine visual acuity), and other cells in the lateral portions of the eye. This routine procedure can be carried out in an ophthalmologist&#8217;s office. 

&#160;

Subretinal injection between the photoreceptors in the outer retina and the retinal pigment epithelium just below the retina are best for delivering the product candidate to the outer retina, farthest from the lens, where the AAV vector can readily enter photoreceptor cells and retinal pigment epithelium cells. This is a short, outpatient surgical procedure that is frequently performed by retinal surgeons. 

&#160;

We expect to use intravitreal injection as the method of delivery for our XLRS product candidate and subretinal injection as the method of delivery for our ACHM and XLRP product candidates. Other exploratory methods of delivering vector to anatomically defined sites are under evaluation.

&#160;

&#160;

Like the eye, the inner ear sensory organ &#8211; the organ of C orti &#8211; is bathed by fluid-filled spaces, enabling accessible vector administration. Surgical techniques used to introduce AAV include microinjection into the cochlear via an apical cochleostomy or through the round window membrane. These methods of admini stration of our product candidates are well established for the safe and effective delivery of other drugs and protein products. AAV vectors can be delivered by these and other methods to a wide array of other cells, such as heart muscle cells in certain c ardiac diseases or directly into the brain in certain neurologic diseases. 

Our approach can potentially arrest, correct or treat a disease with a one-time therapeutic administration, as many of the cells to which the product candidate is delivered will survive for the life of the patient and treatment of those cells thereby has the potential to deliver life-long effects. For example, cells in the retina, important in XLRS and ACHM, mature shortly after birth and in the absence of disease exist unchanged for the life of the patient. Once treated with our gene therapy product candidates, these cells have the potential to express the therapeutic protein for the remaining life of the cell. This approach potentially provides significant value to patients, families, providers and payors.

Our product programs

Our lead programs address XLRS, ACHM, and XLRP, which are orphan diseases of the eye that are caused by mutations in single genes, significantly affect visual function starting at birth and currently lack effective medical treatments. 

We initially developed our gene therapy platform and obtained clinical evidence of its safety and efficacy in proof-of-concept programs involving two other eye diseases: LCA2 and wet AMD. We obtained clinical evidence of safety and tolerability with both programs as well as encouraging signs of biologic activity. We chose to not continue the development of the LCA2 product for a number of reasons, but most importantly because we believed the disease characteristics and market opportunity for our current lead programs were more attractive.

Our lead programs

X-linked retinoschisis

XLRS is an inherited retinal disease, meaning that children are born with the defective gene that causes poor visual function that significantly affects daily living activities. XLRS is specifically caused by mutations in the RS1 gene, which is located on the X chromosome and encodes the retinoschisin, or RS1, protein. Retinoschisin is expressed and secreted primarily from photoreceptor cells and binds strongly and specifically to the surface of photoreceptor and bipolar cells in the retina. Mutated forms of retinoschisin are unable to bind properly, resulting in schisis, or splitting of the layers of the retina, primarily in the macula. The disease begins early in childhood, and affected boys typically have best-corrected visual acuity of 20/60 to 20/120 at initial diagnosis. Complications such as retinal hemorrhage or retinal detachment occur in up to 40% of patients, especially in older patients. According to Molecular Genetics of Inherited Eye Diseases (1988), the incidence rate for XLRS is between one in 5,000 and one in 20,000 males. Using an incidence rate of 1 in 11,500 and assuming half the population is male, we estimate that there are about 13,000 persons in the United States and about 22,000 persons in Europe with XLRS, or 35,000 persons in the United States and Europe combined.

The diagnosis of XLRS is made based on clinical findings and results of imaging studies and Electro Retino Gram (ERG). Clinical findings include reduced visual acuity and a characteristic spoke-wheel appearance of the macula when viewed by an ophthalmoscope, which is the instrument commonly used by ophthalmologists and optometrists to view the retina. Images obtained by optical coherence tomography, or OCT, a method of viewing layers of the eye somewhat like a sonogram, show spaces between the layers of the retina within the macula and fovea in most school-age boys with XLRS. These spaces mean that electrical signals cannot move from the photoreceptors to other retinal neurons and on to the brain, resulting in poor vision. When this is measured by ERG testing it can be detected by an abnormal ERG response.

&#160;

&#160;

The figure below shows an OCT image from a normal individual (top) an d from a patient with XLRS (bottom). The black spaces indicated by the arrows in the bottom portion of the figure demonstrate splitting of the layers of the retina leaving spaces that interfere with the movement of electrical signals. 

&#160;

There is currently no approved treatment for XLRS. Management of disease manifestations includes low vision aids such as large-print textbooks, preferential seating in the front of the classroom and use of handouts with high contrast. Surgery may be required to address complications of vitreous hemorrhage or full-thickness retinal detachment. Anecdotal reports suggest that topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may provide some reduction in the degree of schisis detected by OCT and improvement in visual acuity in some but not all patients, but the absence of controlled clinical trials makes interpretation of these reports difficult. In addition, treatment with carbonic anhydrase inhibitors does not address the fundamental genetic defect in persons affected by XLRS. Neither carbonic anhydrase inhibitors nor any other medicinal products have been approved by regulatory agencies for treatment of XLRS.

Our XLRS product candidate

Our gene therapy approach involves using an AAV vector to insert a functional copy of the RS1 gene into the patient&#8217;s retinal cells, thereby inducing those cells to produce the normal retinoschisin protein. Our XLRS product candidate contains the RS1 gene and a promoter that has been shown to work well in primate retinal cells, and is packaged in an AAV capsid that is able to efficiently enter cells in the inner layers of the retina after intravitreal injection.

The mechanism by which the XLRS product candidate is believed to improve visual function is described below. After the vector containing a functional copy of the RS1 gene enters a retinal cell, the gene is processed by normal biochemical processes into a stable DNA episome in the nucleus of the cell. This stable form of the gene allows production of the normal retinoschisin protein which is then secreted from the retinal cells and binds to the surfaces of photoreceptor and bipolar cells in the retina, which may correct the abnormal splitting of the layers of the retina. Upon light stimulation of the photoreceptor cells, the presence of the retinoschisin allows normal transmission of electrical signals from the photoreceptor cells to the bipolar cells and then to other retinal neurons that transmit the signals to the visual cortex in the brain. Production of normal retinoschisin continues as long as the episome persists in the cell, which may be for many years or even life-long, thereby providing long-term potential benefit after a one-time therapeutic administration.

Preclinical proof of concept for our XLRS product candidate

In mouse models of XLRS, our gene therapy approach restores to normal the abnormal ERG response that is characteristic of XLRS. Mouse models of XLRS have been developed by deactivating, or knocking out, the RS1 gene in mice. These &#8220;knockout&#8221; mice have clinical features similar to humans with XLRS, including reduced visual acuity, schisis cavities detected by OCT, and a markedly abnormal ERG response.

&#160;

&#160;

The figure below shows staining for retinoschisin (top row) and for nuclei in retinal cells (bottom row) in a normal mouse (left), a RS1 knockout mouse in the absence of treatment (middle) and a RS1 knockout mouse treated with an AAV-RS1 vector (right). The knockout mouse retina has no expression of retinoschisin and has splitting and disorganization of the laye rs of the retina, indicated by the arrowheads in the middle panel of the nuclear staining. After treatment, RS1 staining is present in a normal fashion and the nuclear staining shows restoration of the organization of the cell layers in the retina (right). 

&#160;

Based on data from Min et al. Molecular Therapy (2005)

Treatment by injection of an AAV vector expressing either mouse or human RS1 in these knockout mice improved visual function as measured by increased ERG b-wave responses.

The figure below shows improved ERG responses in RS1 knockout mice at various times after treatment with an AAV-RS1 vector compared to ERG responses in untreated control RS1 knockout mice. The figure shows a progressive decrease in the ERG response in the untreated mice but a slower decrease and eventual increase in the ERG response in the treated mice.

&#160;

Based on data from Min et al. Molecular Therapy (2005)

&#160;

&#160;

We have concluded that intravitreal injection is the preferred route of administration for an AAV-RS1 vector. We therefor e evaluated intravitreal injection of an AAV vector expressing a marker protein packaged in several different AAV capsids in monkeys and demonstrated that a vector packaged in an engineered capsid was able to target expression to the macula, which is the p rimary area in which retinoschisis occurs. 

The figure below shows expression of a marker protein (white areas) in the macula, fovea and nerve fibers of a monkey retina after intravitreal injection of a vector contained in the engineered capsid. We believe that intravitreal injection of a vector containing the RS1 gene in the same engineered capsid would show expression of retinoschisin in the same areas.

Planned clinical development of our XLRS product candidate

We are currently enrolling patients in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial the primary endpoint of which is safety. Secondary endpoints include efficacy analyses. The current clinical protocol, illustrated below, anticipates enrollment of up to 27 patients. 

As of August 2016, we have enrolled a total of eight patients &#8211; six of whom are in the lowest dose level and two are in the middle dose level. While this number is lower than we had hoped to report on at this point in the study we have identified a path forward to complete the trial expeditiously.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Safety data to date has shown that our XLRS product candidate has been generally well tolerated. We did observe mild to moderate ocular inflammation in the majority of patient s, which resolved either without tr eatment or after treatment with topical or oral corticosteroids. Since the primary endpoint of the study is safety , we amended the protocol to provide for standard prophylactic corticosteroids versus the original protocol that allowed for treatment with corticosteroids only after inflammation was observed . 

&#160;

Enrollment has been slower than we anticipated in the study for a number of reasons which are summarized here and further explained in the following paragraphs. The reasons for the slow enrollment include delays due to patients not meeting one or more study eligibility criteria, a protocol amendment, as mentioned above, to allow use of prophylactic corticosteroids that required institutional review board approvals at each site, and the necessity to re-test the study agent for a process component. We believe we have resolved these areas in order to meet our future enrollment plans.

&#160;

The Phase 1/2 clinical trial is currently being conducted at six clinical sites that specialize in inherited retinal diseases, an increase from the three originally planned sites in order to address the need to identify more patients that meet the eligibility criteria. These sites include: the Casey Eye Institute in Portland, Oregon, the Retina Foundation of the Southwest in Dallas, Texas, the Kellogg Eye Center in Ann Arbor, Michigan, the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary in Boston, Massachusetts, the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas and the University of California San Francisco in San Francisco, California. We have also signed a contract with a seventh site and are in the process of evaluating additional sites that can help to accelerate screening and enrollment. With the assistance from patient advocacy groups, academic centers, our investigators and our collaboration partner Biogen, we have completed screening on over 100 patients, eight of whom are enrolled and approximately 20 of whom meet the eligibility requirements for the expansion group which will provide additional safety data at the maximal tolerated dose. We continue our patient outreach and currently have multiple new patients in the screening process. 

&#160;

We are measuring a wide range of secondary endpoints that might provide early indications of potential efficacy and will help us design a subsequent trial. We have not observed any significant improvements in secondary endpoints in the six patients treated at the lowest dose level. As we are still in the process of completing the dose escalation phase of the trial, we plan to report results on these groups once we have enough data to draw meaningful conclusions from the results. As a result, we do not expect to report further data on the XLRS study this year.

We have also completed enrollment in a natural history study in persons affected by XLRS and results from the study will be presented in appropriate scientific meetings and publications in the future. 

Completion of the Phase 1/2 clinical trial and the natural history study will guide us in finalizing the design of a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial. In the planned pivotal Phase 3 trial, we would expect to enroll 40 - 75 patients who will be evaluated for changes in visual function over a 12-month period. If successful, we believe the results of this second trial could support submission of a Biologics License Application, or BLA, to the FDA in the United States and a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, to the EMA in Europe for our XLRS product candidate.

As a part of our collaboration, Biogen has obtained worldwide commercialization rights for the XLRS program. We will be responsible for the clinical development program through product approval. Biogen will support the clinical development costs, subject to certain conditions, following the first-in-human study. We have an option to share development costs and profits after the initial clinical trial data are available, and an option to co-promote the second of two products (XLRS and XLRP) to be approved in the United States. 

Congenital achromatopsia (ACHM)

ACHM is an inherited retinal disease, meaning that children are born with the defective gene that causes poor visual function which significantly affects daily activities. ACHM is present from birth and throughout life and is characterized by the lack of cone photoreceptor function. Cone photoreceptors which are concentrated in the macula and the fovea, respond to moderate or bright intensity light and mediate fine visual acuity. Individuals with ACHM have markedly reduced visual acuity, photophobia or light sensitivity, and complete loss of color discrimination. Their only functioning photoreceptors are rod photoreceptors, which respond to low intensity light conditions and mediate night vision but cannot achieve fine visual acuity. Best-corrected visual acuity in persons affected by ACHM, even under subdued light conditions, is usually about 20/200, a level at which people are considered legally blind. They also experience extreme light sensitivity resulting in even worse visual acuity under normal daylight conditions, or day blindness. 

&#160;

&#160;

ACHM can be caused by mutations in any of at least five genes that are required for normal cone photoreceptor function. The most common causes are mutations in the CNGB3 gene (about half of all cases) or CNGA3 gene (about one-fourth of all cases). These genes encode the CNGB3 and CNGA3 proteins, which combine to form a channel in the photoreceptor m embrane that is required for phototransduction, the process whereby a light signal is converted to an electrical signal that is then transmitted to the brain. According to Retinal Dystrophies and Degenerations (1988), the incidence rate for ACHM is approxi mately one in 30,000 people, and we therefore estimate that there are about 10,000 people in the United States and about 17,000 people in Europe with ACHM. Of these, about half, or a total of 13,500 in the United States and Europe combined, have the form o f the disease caused by mutations in the CNGB3 gene and approximately 6,800 people have the form of the disease caused by mutations in the CNG A 3 gene . 

There is currently no approved treatment for ACHM. Symptoms are managed by the use of dark lenses to reduce discomfort from ambient light, and low vision aids such as high-powered magnifiers for reading. Children with ACHM are provided preferential seating in the front of classrooms to allow maximum benefit from their magnifying devices.

Our ACHM product candidates

Our gene therapy approach to treatment of ACHM involves using an AAV vector to insert a functional copy of the CNGB3 or CNGA3 gene into the patient&#8217;s photoreceptor cells. Together these two genes account for 75% of the ACHM patient population. Our ACHM product candidates contain either the CNGB3 or the CNGA3 gene and a proprietary promoter, PR1.7, that has been shown in preclinical studies to drive efficient gene expression in primate cone photoreceptors and restores cone photoreceptor function in dog, mouse and sheep models of ACHM. We have identified an AAV capsid that works well for subretinal delivery and are evaluating additional AAV capsids to identify those that work well for intravitreal delivery that could be used in follow-on products.

The mechanism by which the ACHM CNGB3 or A3 product candidate is believed to improve visual function is described below. After the vector containing a functional CNGB3 A3 gene enters a photoreceptor cell, the gene is processed by normal biochemical processes into a stable DNA episome in the nucleus of the cell. The stable form of the gene allows production of the normal CNGB3 or A3 protein, which combines with proteins already being produced in the cell, to form a channel in the photoreceptor membrane that is required for phototransduction. Restoration of phototransduction enables cone photoreceptors to convert light entering the eye into an electrical signal that is transmitted to other retinal neurons and then to the visual cortex in the brain. Production of normal CNGB3 or A3 protein continues as long as the episome persists in the cell, which may be for many years or potentially life-long, thereby providing long-term potential benefit after a one-time therapeutic administration.

Preclinical proof of concept for our ACHM product candidates

In mouse, dog and sheep models of ACHM, our product candidates were able to restore photoreceptor function, improve visual acuity and mitigate photophobia and day blindness.

ACHM occurs in two breeds of dogs, Alaskan malamutes and German shorthaired pointers, due to mutations in the CNGB3 gene that either produce an abnormal protein or completely prevent production of the protein. Both breeds have clinical characteristics similar to human ACHM patients, with day blindness and absence of retinal cone function as measured by ERG. Treatment by subretinal injection of an AAV vector expressing human CNGB3 restored cone function in dogs with either mutation. Cone-specific ERG responses were undetectable in these dogs before treatment but were clearly detected after treatment. Day blindness was demonstrated before treatment by testing the ability of the dogs to navigate a maze under progressively brighter conditions. Before treatment, it took the ACHM dogs progressively longer to navigate the maze as the ambient light increased from dim light to normal room lighting and even longer with normal outdoor daytime lighting. After treatment, the day blindness was substantially eliminated, and the treated ACHM dogs were able to navigate the maze under bright light conditions at almost the same speed as normal dogs.

&#160;

&#160;

The figure below shows the average time taken to navigate a maze as the ambient light intensity was increased for three groups of dogs: normal dogs, dogs with ACHM that were unt reated and dogs with ACHM that were treated with our ACHM product candidate. The figure shows that under low light conductions (0.2 lux, equivalent to the light conditions on a moonlit night), when vision is normally mediated only by rod photoreceptors, al l three groups navigated the maze rapidly. As the light intensity was progressively increased (to 646 lux, equivalent to the light conditions in a business office), and vision became mediated by cone photoreceptors, the untreated ACHM dogs took progressive ly longer to navigate the maze, as they collided with walls in the maze and had to advance by trial and error. In contrast, as the light intensity was progressively increased, the time taken to navigate the maze did not change for normal dogs and increased only slightly for the treated ACHM dogs. 

&#160;

Based on Komaromy et al. Human Molecular Genetics (2010)

Untreated ACHM dogs also demonstrated photophobia and day blindness when outdoors in daylight, which severely limited their ability to interact with people and objects in their environment. After treatment there was a dramatic improvement in this important clinical manifestation of ACHM. The restored function persisted for more than 2.5 years (the longest duration tested).

In addition, a mouse model of ACHM was developed by knocking out the CNGB3 gene in mice. These knockout mice have markedly impaired cone photoreceptor function, as measured by ERG and visual acuity testing. Treatment by subretinal injection of an AAV vector expressing human CNGB3 in the knockout mice improved cone-specific ERG responses to nearly normal levels and improved visual acuity, as measured by their ability to follow a rotating pattern of vertical stripes of varying thickness.

There is also a sheep model of ACHM caused by mutations in the CNGA3 gene. These sheep have clinical characteristics similar to human ACHM patients, with day blindness and absence of retinal cone function as measured by ERG. In collaboration with scientists at three academic centers in Israel (The Volcani Center, the Koret School of Veterinary Medicine and the Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center), we conducted a preclinical study evaluating the safety and efficacy of our product candidate for CNGA3-related ACHM using the sheep model, which uses the same promoter and capsid used in our CNGB3 product candidate, administered by subretinal injection. Cone-specific ERG responses, which were undetectable in these sheep before treatment, were clearly detected after treatment. Day blindness was demonstrated before treatment by testing the ability of the sheep to navigate a maze under bright light conditions. After treatment, the day blindness was substantially eliminated, and the treated sheep were able to navigate the maze under bright light conditions, as illustrated in the figure below. At both the higher and lower doses tested, the maze transit time was similar, and clearly improved over the pre-dose performance.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

These results agree closely with a previously published proof-of-concept study, in which the performance of AAV treated animals approached that of normal (unaffected) animals. See table below.

Planned clinical development of our CNGB3-related ACHM product candidate 

We are currently enrolling patients in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in which the primary endpoint is safety. Secondary endpoints include efficacy analysis. The current clinical protocol, illustrated below, anticipates enrollment of up to a total of 24 ACHM CNGB3 patients. 

&#160;

&#160;

The Phase 1/2 clinical trial is being conducted at four clinical sites that specialize in inherited retinal diseases: the Casey Eye Institute in Portland, Oregon, the Pangere Center for Inherited Retinal Diseases in Chicago, Illinois, the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute in Miami, Florida, and Vitreo Retinal Associates in Gainesville, Florida. An additional site is performing advanced optical testing on every patient. As of August 2016, two patients are currently enrolled in the lowest dose group, which is a lower number of patients than we had hoped to report on at this point in the study.

Vendor errors in testing of the study agent for a process component resulted in a delay to the initiation of enrollment in this trial. 

We have dosed two patients and the future enrollment schedule will depend on the preliminary data from these patients. As a first in man study, our internal and external teams are following the first patients very carefully over time, to meet our primary objective of patient safety before proceeding with further study enrollment involving a larger number of patients. We will release data when we have sufficient data to draw meaningful conclusions from the results.

We have completed enrollment in a natural history study in persons affected by ACHM caused by CNGB3 mutations and results from the study will be presented in appropriate scientific meetings and publications. 

Completion of the Phase 1/2 clinical study and the natural history study will guide us in finalizing the design of a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial. In the planned pivotal Phase 3 trial, we expect that between 40 and 75 patients will be enrolled and evaluated for changes in visual function over a 12-month period following treatment. If successful, we believe the results of this pivotal Phase 3 trial could support our submission of a BLA to the FDA and of an MAA to the EMA for our ACHM-B3 product candidate.

Planned clinical development of our CNGA3-related ACHM product candidate

We expect to submit the IND for our ACHM CNGA3 product candidate by the end of 2016. Once the IND has been cleared by the FDA, we anticipate enrolling 24 ACHM CNGA3 patients in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial with a design similar to the design of the ACHM-CNGB3 study described in the figure above.

We have also initiated an international natural history study in patients with CNGA3-related ACHM, at the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute in Miami, Florida, and the Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center in Jerusalem, Israel.

&#160;

&#160;

X-linked retinitis pigmentosa 

Retinitis pigmentosa is an inherited retinal dystrophy with progressive loss of vision, meaning children are born with defective genes that cause poor visual function that significantly affects daily activities and worsens over time. XLRP is commonly first observed in boys and young men who notice problems with vision under low light conditions, or night blindness, followed by a restriction of peripheral visual fields, or tunnel vision, leading to poor central vision and eventually to total blindness.

The incidence rate for retinitis pigmentosa is about one in 4,000 people, according to Retinitis Pigmentosa (1988), and we estimate that there are about 75,000 people in the United States and 125,000 people in Europe with retinitis pigmentosa, or 200,000 people in the United States and Europe combined. According to a paper by Dr. Marianne Haim published in Acta Ophthalmologica (1992), about 10% of cases of retinitis pigmentosa are XLRP, from which we therefore estimate that there are about 20,000 persons with XLRP in the United States and Europe combined.

Preclinical studies in a dog model of XLRP caused by mutations in the RPGR gene demonstrated a reduction in the rate of disease progression in eyes that received a subretinal injection of an AAV vector expressing the correct form of the gene. A comparative dose range finding study of our XLRP product candidate in dogs demonstrated expression of the RPGR protein in photoreceptors and improvement in structural and functional parameters associated with disease progression in this model. IND-enabling good laboratory practices, or GLP, toxicology studies are underway in two relevant disease models &#8212; the dog model discussed above and also in an RPGR knockout mouse model. After completion of these studies, we expect to submit an IND to the FDA in 2017.

We are conducting a natural history study in patients with XLRP caused by RPGR mutations. This study will document the progression of the disease in the absence of treatment and provide important information about the best methods for measuring visual function and other parameters in these patients, which will guide us in the design of subsequent clinical trials in which our product candidate will be tested for safety and efficacy. The study is being conducted at the Scheie Eye Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

As a part of our collaboration, Biogen obtained worldwide commercialization rights for our XLRP program. We will lead the clinical development program through the completion of first-in-human trials. Biogen will support the clinical development costs, subject to certain conditions, following the IND-enabling studies. We have an option to share development costs and profits after the initial clinical trial data are available, and an option to co-promote the second of two products (XLRS and XLRP) to be approved in the United States. 

Other opportunities in ophthalmology

We believe our current gene therapy platform will enable us to develop and test new AAV vectors that carry gene sequences for other inherited diseases in ophthalmology, and that by leveraging our work on our four lead programs we can reduce the need for early research work. In this way, we anticipate being able to move products efficiently through preclinical studies and into clinical development. We also believe that there are large-market ophthalmology diseases where AAV vectors may provide benefit, such as wet AMD.

Wet AMD 

AMD is a retinal disease that affects older adults and results in a loss of vision in the center of the visual field (the macula). It is a major cause of blindness and visual impairment and occurs in neovascular (&#8220;wet&#8221;) or non-neovascular (&#8220;dry&#8221;) forms. There are an estimated 3.2 million persons with wet AMD in the United States and Europe combined. Wet AMD is characterized by the abnormal growth of blood vessels in the retina stimulated by a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF, and is currently treated with intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF agents delivered every one to two months, for an indefinite period. An effective gene therapy product has the potential to improve on the approximately 35% success rate for existing therapies by targeting other critical factors, and to reduce the burdensome injection frequency for patients and physicians.

Based on our proof-of-concept studies, we believe that gene therapy offers a potential long-term solution to treat wet AMD with a single injection. Additionally, as in the case of &#8220;cocktail&#8221; treatment paradigms in oncology, there is a strong rationale for combination therapy to become the standard of care in wet AMD. For instance, we are aware that others are conducting Phase 3 trials of an anti-platelet-derived growth factor, or PDGF, agent in combination with anti-VEGF agents for wet AMD. We believe that, while the predictability of targeting VEGF itself would mitigate development risk, the most compelling gene therapy approach would offer not only sustained expression but also pathway synergy with existing anti-VEGF options. We have defined our preferred target profile, are proceeding with a comprehensive analysis of possible targets, and are conducting preclinical efficacy studies in order to select candidate targets for clinical evaluation.

&#160;

&#160;

Once a candidate target is identified, t he development pathway for wet AMD therapies has been well- established. Given our experience gained from previous efforts, including our prior relationshi p with Genzyme, our already-established manufacturing infrastructure , our deep clinical capabilities and our well defined regulatory path, we expect to be able to file an IND for a wet AMD product candidate and execute a clinical trial efficiently. 

Other autosomal recessive retinal diseases

It is estimated that approximately 290 genes causing inherited retinal disease have been identified, of which 186 are autosomal recessive, or X-linked, and therefore most amenable to treatment by gene replacement therapy. Among the 42 most common autosomal recessive forms of retinitis pigmentosa, LCA and cone or cone-rod dystrophy, 38 have gene coding regions of less than 3,760 nucleotides and can therefore be readily accommodated within our AAV vectors. We are continuing to evaluate indications having these characteristics to select those most appropriate for addition to our longer-term product development pipeline. As an example, in January 2016 we announced a research effort in BCM, a rare genetic disease of the retina that almost exclusively affects males. It is a hereditary condition linked to the X chromosome that manifests with a partial dysfunction of the cones of the retina. BCM can result in reduced visual acuity, impaired color vision, photosensitivity, myopia and infantile-onset nystagmus. These manifestations are similar to those in ACHM caused by mutations in the CNGB3 or CNGA3 gene.

Manufacturing

Until recently, there has been a lack of manufacturing infrastructure to enable the production of gene therapies in a reliable and reproducible manner at a commercially viable scale. The historical challenges for gene therapy manufacturing relate to the difficulty of developing constructs that provide the necessary helper functions, and in having systems that provide adequate yield, scalability and potency. We have made significant investments in developing improved manufacturing processes, which include the following:

&#160;

&#183; 

We have developed proprietary AAV vector manufacturing processes and techniques that produce a more purified and concentrated product candidate, as evidenced by the approximately 25- to 30-fold reduction in non-infectious viral contaminants as compared to vectors used in many previous clinical trials. 

&#160;

&#183; 

We do not need a specially cloned and isolated cell line for each of our disease targets; we instead use specially engineered replication-incompetent herpes simplex helpers, or HSV helpers, which are stable and straightforward to clone. 

&#160;

&#183; 

We have developed over 30 assays to accurately characterize our process and the HSV and AAV vectors we produce. 

&#160;

&#183; 

We have developed a purification system applicable to multiple AAV capsids. 

&#160;

&#183; 

We are investing in the development of mid- to large-scale manufacturing processes to enable the manufacture of our product candidates at commercial scale. 

We believe these improvements and our continued investment in our manufacturing platform will enable us to develop best-in-class, next generation gene therapy products.

Our viral vector production platform for AAV-based gene therapeutics, which we call the herpes-assisted vector expansion, or H.A.V.E. method, offers significant benefits in comparison with the methods used by others to manufacture AAV vectors, as summarized in the following table.

&#160;

Yes

&#160;

&#160;

The four key steps involved in our proprietary H.A.V.E. manufacturing method are as follows:

&#160;

&#183; 

First, the therapeutic gene and the appropriate AAV capsid genes are inserted into individual HSV helpers, and these helpers are individually grown in a complementing cell line called V27. The complementing cell line is required to provide critical functions that allow the replication-incompetent HSV helpers to grow; the same cell line is used to produce HSV helpers for all disease targets. This step occurs in disposable culture vessels of increasing size, up to and 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

including disposable stirred tank bioreactors. The HSV helpers are harvested, minimally processed and concentrated to prepare them for use in producing our AAV vectors. These HSV helpers can be stored frozen for years before use. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Next, the two HSV helpers are used together to infect a cell line called sBHK, allowing for packaging of the therapeutic gene into the AAV capsid and to produce our AAV vectors. The sBHK cell line does not provide the critical functions that would allow for growth of the HSV helpers, which provides an added layer of safety. The same sBHK cell line is used to produce AAV vectors for all disease targets. This step occurs in disposable culture vessels of increasing size depending on the amount of AAV vector that is required. The AAV vector is recovered by using a detergent solution to break open the sBHK cells and release the AAV vectors. This step also destroys any residual HSV helpers that were used to infect the sBHK cells. 

&#160;

&#183; 

The third step is to purify the harvested AAV vector using two chromatography columns. The exact method used to column-purify our AAV vectors varies depending on the AAV capsid used in the product candidate; we have developed purification methods for multiple AAV capsids. We have shown in formal clearance studies that the combination of detergent treatment and two chromatography columns can remove up to 10 14 (100 trillion) units of HSV. This step also helps to eliminate any remaining parts, such as proteins or DNA, of the HSV helpers and sBHK production cells. 

&#160;

&#183; 

The final step is to formulate, filter and fill the AAV vector in appropriate containers for use in animal or human studies. This filled AAV vector drug product can be stored frozen for many years before use. 

H.A.V.E. Production of our AAV Vectors for Gene Therapy

&#160;

The H.A.V.E. method is inherently flexible, allowing the manufacture of a wide range of AAV vectors without the need to modify the manufacturing steps used to produce the HSV helpers or AAV vectors. We have already demonstrated our manufacturing knowledge through multiple successful production batches of both HSV helpers and AAV vectors at SAFC, our contract manufacturing organization, under current good manufacturing practices, or GMP.

Research is already underway to meet our future manufacturing needs. Our new process development and pilot manufacturing facility is now operational and we will continue to decrease our dependence on a single contract manufacturer by qualifying and contracting with multiple new contractors and by further developing our internal manufacturing capabilities. We recently began the design phase of construction for a cGMP facility at our Florida headquarters in preparation for moving products forward into later stages of development. We believe these investments will facilitate the more rapid advancement of our products through regulatory approval and enhance the therapeutic and commercial potential of our gene therapy platform. 

&#160;

&#160;

Strategic collaborations and acquisitions 

We have formed strategic alliances where both parties contribute expertise to enable the discovery and development of potential gene therapy product candidates. To access the substantial funding and other resources required to develop and commercialize gene therapy products, we intend to seek additional opportunities to form strategic alliances with collaborators who can augment our industry-leading gene therapy expertise.

&#160;

On July 1, 2015, we entered into a broad collaboration and license agreement with Biogen to develop gene-based therapies for multiple ophthalmic diseases. Biogen made an upfront payment to us in the amount of $124.0 million, which included a $30.0 million equity investment and certain prepaid research and development expenditures. Biogen will be granted a license to the XLRS and XLRP programs and the option to license discovery programs for two additional ophthalmic indications and one non-ophthalmic indication at the time of clinical candidate selection. In February 2016, we announced Biogen&#8217;s selection of adrenoleukodystrophy, or ALD, as the non-ophthalmic indication of the three discovery programs. Under the collaboration, we are eligible to receive upfront and milestone payments exceeding $1 billion. This includes up to $472.5 million collectively for the two lead programs, which also will carry royalties in the high single digit to mid-teen percentages of annual net sales. In addition, Biogen may make payments up to $592.5 million across the discovery programs, along with royalties in the mid-single digits to low teen percentages of annual net sales for the discovery programs. In October 2015, Biogen paid us an additional $5.0 million upon achievement of the first enrollment milestone for XLRS.

&#160;

Biogen will also receive an exclusive license to use our proprietary manufacturing technology platform to make AAV vectors for up to six genes, three of which are at our discretion, in exchange for payment of milestones and royalties.

We have also entered into an agreement with SAFC, which also is our current contract manufacturing organization, for cGMP manufacture of clinical grade material for third parties. This arrangement allows us to approach other gene therapy companies that might benefit from our manufacturing and vector design capabilities. Under such an arrangement, we could potentially license our manufacturing technology and receive upfront payments, milestones and royalties. SAFC would do the manufacturing of commercial grade material.

We also plan to continue to in-license additional intellectual property to support our current programs, to establish new development programs and to support our manufacturing technology. Additionally, we will seek to partner with other commercial gene therapy companies and academic institutions to leverage our expertise in vector design, research, manufacturing and the regulatory process. The goal of these collaborations would be to forge strategic partnerships around technologies and programs that would fit with our current and future development pipeline. In general, we would seek new intellectual property, development programs in rare diseases, pipeline products where the regulatory pathway is understood, partners with strong scientific, clinical and management expertise, and programs that have synergy with our current knowledge base and product pipeline that would add to our industry leadership. We would also be looking at programs where the disease being treated has a large enough patient population that there would be adequate financial returns for the investment of resources.

Our relationship with the University of Florida

All of our scientific founders spent part of their careers at the University of Florida, or UF, and three are still UF faculty members. Since our inception we have licensed significant technology from and funded research at multiple labs at UF. Pursuant to four agreements, we have licensed three U.S. patents and multiple pending applications covering inventions made at UF. UF has multiple capabilities in genetic cloning, gene therapy manufacturing, animal model development and facilities for both small and large animal testing, and in certain instances we have benefited from the ability to conduct important research at UF without having to expand in-house facilities and personnel. We interact frequently with the Powell Gene Therapy Center at UF and have an excellent working relationship with the UF Office of Technology Licensing.

In May 2013, we and UF were jointly awarded an $8.3 million dollar grant from the NEI to support development of our ACHM CNGB3 product candidate, with Dr. William Hauswirth, one of our scientific founders and Professor and holder of the Rybaczki-Bullard Chair in the Department of Ophthalmology at UF, as principal investigator. As a sub-awardee, we expected to receive approximately $3.8 million over five years under this grant. As of June 30, 2016, we had received payments in the aggregate amount of $1.9 million under this grant.

&#160;

&#160;

Our relationships with patient advocacy groups and academic centers 

We have long believed that when developing products to treat orphan indications it is important to form strong relationships with patient advocacy groups, and we have done this successfully with both the Foundation Fighting Blindness, or FFB, and the Alpha-1 Foundation. Both organizations are well known for their advocacy of patients&#8217; interests in obtaining diagnosis, developing treatments and providing for reimbursement. Both actively support research into treatment, and we have been awarded three research grants totaling $1.6 million from the FFB and one grant of $0.3 million from the Alpha-1 Foundation. More importantly, both organizations have been instrumental in assisting us in forming ties with disease experts, recruiting patients into clinical trials and helping us to understand the needs, wants and concerns of patients. We also have relationships with other advocacy organizations such as Achroma Corp and the BCM Family Foundation.

We also have formed strong relationships with key academic centers across the United States that have core competencies in gene therapy, orphan ophthalmology and AAT deficiency. These centers conduct sponsored research, act as advisors and collaborate with us on grant proposals. Since our inception, we have been awarded a variety of grant funding, either independently or with our collaborators. This funding has provided peer-reviewed scientific validation of our programs and has facilitated critical early stage research for our lead product candidates.

Intellectual property

We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business, including seeking, maintaining and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties and seeking patent term extensions where available. We also rely on trade secrets relating to our proprietary technology platform and on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in the field of gene therapy that may be important for the development of our business. In addition to IP and trade secrets, we also will rely on regulatory protection afforded through orphan drug designations, data exclusivity and market exclusivity for our products, when possible. 

Our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce our patents; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and operate without infringing the valid enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. With respect to both licensed and company-owned intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our commercial products and methods of manufacturing the same.

We have developed or in-licensed numerous patents and patent applications and possess substantial know-how and trade secrets relating to the development and commercialization of gene therapy products. Our proprietary intellectual property, including patent and non-patent intellectual property, is generally directed to, for example, certain genes and promoters, methods of transferring genetic material into cells, processes to manufacture our AAV-based product candidates and other proprietary technologies and processes related to our lead product candidates.

As of August 19, 2016, our patent portfolio included approximately 62 patents and patent applications that we own and approximately 73 patents and patent applications that we have licensed. More specifically, we own five U.S. patents, seven pending U.S. applications, 32 foreign patents and 18 foreign patent applications. We have licensed 22 U.S. patents, four pending U.S. applications, 35 foreign patents and 12 pending foreign patent applications. Of the patents and patent applications that we own or license, 32 cover methods to manufacture AAV vectors, the longest lived and most significant of which is expected to expire in 2025. Ten of the patent applications that we own are directed to small cone promoters and uses thereof. A patent issuing from this group could have an expiration date in 2034.

Our objective is to continue to expand our portfolio of patents and patent applications in order to protect our gene therapy product candidates and AAV manufacturing process. Our owned and licensed patent portfolio includes patents and patent applications directed to our XLRS, ACHM, XLRP and AAT deficiency programs, as well as our foundational AAV production platform. See also &#8220;&#8212;License agreements.&#8221;

&#160;

&#160;

In addition to the above, we have established expertise and development capabilities focused in the areas of preclinical research and development, manufacturing and manufacturing process scale-up, quality control, quality assurance, regulatory affairs and clinical trial design and implementation. We b elieve that our focus and expertise will help us develop products based on our proprietary intellectual property and to expand our intellectual property. 

The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing the non-provisional application. In the United States, a patent&#8217;s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the United States Patent and Trademark Office in granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier-filed patent. The issued patents that we own and license are expected to expire on various dates from 2016 to 2029.

The term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration of a U.S. patent as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent per approved drug may be extended. Moreover, a patent can only be extended once, and thus, if a single patent is applicable to multiple products, it can only be extended based on one product. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. When possible, depending upon the length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of a new drug application, or NDA, we expect to apply for patent term extensions for patents covering our product candidates and their methods of use.

We may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our consultants, contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.

License agreements

We have rights to use and exploit multiple issued and pending patents under licenses from other entities. We consider the commercial terms of these licenses, which provide for modest milestone and royalty payments, and their provisions regarding diligence, insurance, indemnification and other similar matters, to be reasonable and customary for our industry.

Information about our principal licenses is set forth below. 

University of Florida 

We currently have four license agreements with the University of Florida Research Foundation, or UFRF, an affiliate of UF, of which the principal licenses are as follows:

&#160;

&#183; 

A license from UFRF signed in September 2001 relates to the AAV construct containing the AAT gene and the method to treat AAT deficiency using this construct. We have an exclusive license in all fields of use. 

Under the terms of this license, we made cash and stock-based up-front payments to UFRF and are required to make payments ranging from the mid-five figures to the low-six figures based upon development, regulatory and commercial milestones for any products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property. Assuming that we meet each of the specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones not more than once for each product, which we expect will be the case, the maximum aggregate milestone payments payable under this license with respect to any individual product that we commercialize will be $0.3 million. We will also be required to pay a royalty on net sales of products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property in the mid-single digits. The royalty is subject to reduction for any third-party payments required to be made, with a minimum floor in the low single digits. We have the right to sublicense our rights under this agreement, and we will be required to pay a percentage of such license income in the low-double digits. We are required to make annual maintenance payments in the low four figures under this license, which payments are creditable against royalty payments on a year-by-year basis.

&#160;

&#160;

This license will terminate upon the expiration of all of the patents subject to the license. Additionally, UFRF may terminate this license upon certain breaches by us of the terms of the license and we may terminate the license at any time by submitting writt en notice to UFRF. 

The longest-lived patent covered by this license is expected to expire in 2019.

&#160;

&#183; 

A joint license from UFRF and Johns Hopkins University, or JHU, signed in October 2003 relates to a particular HSV construct and various compositions thereof. We have an exclusive license in all fields of use. 

Under the terms of this license, we made cash and stock-based up-front payments to UFRF and JHU and are required to make payments ranging from the mid-five figures to the low-six figures based upon development, regulatory and commercial milestones for any products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property. Assuming that we meet each of the specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones not more than once for each product, which we expect will be the case, the maximum aggregate milestone payments payable under this license with respect to any individual product that we commercialize will be $0.5 million. We will also be required to pay a royalty on net sales of products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property in the low-single digits. We have the right to sublicense our rights under this agreement, and we will be required to pay a percentage of such license income in the low-double digits. We are required to make annual maintenance payments in the low four figures under this license, which payments are creditable against royalty payments on a year-by-year basis.

This license will terminate upon the earlier to occur of the expiration of all of the patents subject to the license and the date on which royalty payments, once commenced, cease for more than three calendar quarters. Additionally, UFRF and JHU may terminate this license upon certain breaches by us of the terms of the license and we may terminate the license at any time by submitting written notice to UFRF.

The longest-lived patent covered by this license is expected to expire in 2022.

&#160;

&#183; 

Two licenses from UFRF, signed in September and November 2012, respectively, relate to the use of engineered AAV capsids. We have an exclusive license to the patents covered by the November 2012 license in the fields of ACHM, XLRS and XLRP and a semi-exclusive license in all other fields of orphan ophthalmology. We have a non-exclusive license in all fields of use with respect to the patents covered by the September 2012 license. Currently these patents are most useful for ACHM, XLRS and XLRP but could be important for treating a wide variety of diseases as the mutant capsids have been shown to be able to enter cells more effectively than standard AAV capsids. 

Under the terms of these licenses, we made cash up-front payments to UFRF and are required to make payments ranging from the mid-five figures to the low-six figures based upon development, regulatory and commercial milestones for any products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property. Assuming that we meet each of the specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones not more than once for each product, which we expect will be the case, the maximum aggregate milestone payments payable under these licenses with respect to any individual product that we commercialize will be $0.6 million. We will also be required to pay a royalty on net sales of products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property in the low-single digits. We have the right to sublicense our rights under these agreements, and we will be required to pay a percentage of such license income in the mid-single digits. We are required to make annual maintenance payments in the mid four figures under these licenses, which payments are creditable against royalty payments on a year-by-year basis.

These licenses will continue until the expiration of all of the patents subject to the licenses, provided or, if later, a date specified in the license. Additionally, UFRF may terminate this license upon certain breaches by us of the terms of the licenses and we may terminate the licenses at any time by submitting written notice to UFRF.

The longest-lived patent covered by these licenses is expected to expire in 2029. There are also patent applications pending under these licenses.

University of Alabama at Birmingham 

A license agreement from the UAB Research Foundation affiliated with The University of Alabama at Birmingham signed in 2006, relates to one U.S. patent with claims covering the use of HSV helpers to produce AAV vectors. The patent is expected to expire in 2025. Effective in July 2015, we modified the license from co-exclusive to exclusive.

Under the terms of this license, we made a cash up-front payment to the UAB Research Foundation, and we will be required to make payments ranging from the mid-five figures to the low-six figures based upon development and regulatory milestones for any products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property. Assuming that we meet each of these development and regulatory milestones not more than once for each product, which we expect will be the case, the maximum aggregate milestone payments payable under this license with respect to any individual product that we commercialize will be $0.5 million. We will also be required to pay a royalty on net sales of products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property in the low-single digits. We have the right to 

&#160;

&#160;

sublicense our rights under this agreement, and we will be require d to pay a percentage of such license income in the mid-single digits. We are required to make annual maintenance payments in the mid-four figures under this license, which payments are creditable against royalty payments on a year-by-year basis. 

This license will terminate upon the expiration of all of the patents subject to the license. Additionally, the UAB Research Foundation may terminate this license upon certain breaches by us of the terms of the license and we may terminate the license at any time by submitting written notice to the UAB Research Foundation.

Collaboration with 4D Molecular Therapeutics 

In April 2015, we signed an agreement with 4D Molecular Therapeutics (&#8220;4DMT&#8221;) to conduct research on optimized next generation capsids to target specific target cell populations within the human retina using 4DMT&#8217;s Directed Evolution AAV vector discovery platform. We have an option to enter into a licensing agreement if the confirmatory studies are successful.

Collaboration with Synpromics Limited &#160; 

In December 2015, we entered into an agreement with Synpromics to utilize Synpromics' proprietary technology to develop and optimize synthetic promoters. In the event that results from the research are promising, we have options to license promoters that result from the collaboration efforts. 

Over the past year we have progressed our collaborations with 4DMT and Synpromics to identify novel potent cell-specific capsids and promoters.

Competition

The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by intense and rapidly changing competition to develop new technologies and proprietary products, and any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will have to compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. While we believe that our proprietary technology estate and scientific expertise in the gene therapy field provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including larger and better-funded pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as from academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions that may develop potentially competitive products or technologies. To the extent that we develop product candidates for indications with larger patient populations, such as wet AMD, we expect to experience particularly intense competition from larger and better funded pharmaceutical companies. Any product candidate for wet AMD that we may develop will compete with established drugs such as Genentech&#8217;s Lucentis and Avastin, Regeneron&#8217;s Eylea, and new drug candidates being developed by others, including Genzyme, that are currently in clinical trials, as well as other treatment modalities such as photodynamic therapy.

Currently there are no approved products for any of our lead orphan ophthalmology indications of XLRS, ACHM and XLRP. We believe the key competitive factors that will affect the success of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience of administration and delivery, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.

Many of our potential competitors, alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of treatments and the commercialization of those treatments. Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position or a period of market exclusivity in the case of &#8220;orphan indications&#8221; before we are able to enter the market.

Government regulation

Biological products, including gene therapy products, are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FD&#38;C Act, and the Public Health Service Act, or PHS Act, and other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations. Both the FD&#38;C Act and the PHS Act and their corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, reporting, advertising and other promotional practices involving biological products. Before clinical testing of biological products may begin, we must submit an IND which must go into effect, and each clinical trial protocol for a gene therapy product candidate is reviewed by the FDA and, in some instances, the NIH, through its 

&#160;

&#160;

Reco mbinant DNA Advisory Committee, or RAC. FDA approval of a BLA also must be obtained before marketing of biological products. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign stat utes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources and we may not be able to obtain the required regulatory approvals. 

Within the FDA, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER, regulates gene therapy products. CBER works closely with the NIH and its RAC, which makes recommendations to the NIH on gene therapy issues and engages in a public discussion of scientific, safety, ethical and societal issues related to proposed and ongoing gene therapy protocols. The FDA and the NIH have published guidance documents with respect to the development and submission of gene therapy protocols. The FDA also has published guidance documents related to, among other things, gene therapy products in general, their preclinical assessment, observing subjects involved in gene therapy studies for delayed adverse events, potency testing, and chemistry, manufacturing and control information in gene therapy INDs.

Ethical, social and legal concerns about gene therapy, genetic testing and genetic research have led to the enactment of legislation such as the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 and could result in additional regulations restricting or prohibiting the processes we may use. Federal and state agencies, congressional committees and foreign governments have expressed interest in further regulating biotechnology. More restrictive regulations or claims that our products are unsafe or pose a hazard could prevent us from commercializing any products. New government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, regulations, policies or guidance changed, or interpretations by agencies or courts changed, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.

Recent developments in regulation of gene therapy

Although the FDA has not yet approved any human gene therapy product for sale, it has provided guidance for the development of gene therapy products. For example, the FDA has established the Office of Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies, or OCTGT, within CBER, to consolidate the review of gene therapy and related products, and the Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee, or CTGTAC, to advise CBER on its reviews. In addition, the FDA has issued a growing body of clinical guidelines, chemistry, manufacturing and control, or CMC, guidelines and other guidelines, all of which are intended to facilitate industry&#8217;s development of gene therapy products. While no gene therapy products have received FDA approval to date, we believe that several gene therapy products will be submitted to the FDA for approval over the next several years.

In 2012, the EMA approved a gene therapy product called Glybera, which is the first gene therapy product approved by regulatory authorities anywhere in the Western world. Most recently, Strimvelis became the second gene therapy product approved by the EMA.

United States biological products development process

The process required by the FDA before a biological product candidate may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

&#160;

&#183; 

completion of nonclinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to good laboratory practices, or GLP, requirements and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations; 

&#160;

&#183; 

submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 

&#160;

&#183; 

performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA&#8217;s regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practices, or GCP, requirements and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biological product candidate for its intended use; 

&#160;

&#183; 

submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application, or BLA, for marketing approval that includes substantive evidence of safety, purity, and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials; 

&#160;

&#183; 

satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product candidate is produced to assess compliance with GMP requirements, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product candidate&#8217;s identity, strength, quality and purity; 

&#160;

&#183; 

potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the product candidate in the United States. 

&#160;

&#160;

Before testing any biological product candidate, including a gene therapy product candidate, in humans, t he product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety a nd activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLP requirements. 

When a gene therapy trial is conducted at, or sponsored by, institutions receiving NIH funding for recombinant DNA research, along with the submission of an IND to the FDA, the protocol and related documentation is submitted to and the trial is registered with the NIH Office of Science Policy, or OSP, pursuant to the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules, or NIH Guidelines. Compliance with the NIH Guidelines is mandatory for investigators at institutions receiving NIH funds for research involving recombinant DNA, however many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them. The oversight bodies at the initial clinical site(s) (Institutional Review Board (IRB) and Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC)) are responsible for recommending whether or not the clinical study requires public review by the RAC, a federal advisory committee, which discusses protocols that raise novel or particularly important scientific, safety or ethical considerations. This recommendation is included with the protocol and related documentation submitted to the OSP as part of the trial registration process. The OSP may agree or disagree with that recommendation. Should the oversight bodies recommend public RAC review and the OSP concur, the protocol will then be reviewed at one of the NIH RAC&#8217;s quarterly meetings for which information must be submitted at least eight weeks in advance. RAC proceedings and reports are posted to the OBA web site and may be accessed by the public.

The clinical trial sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. With gene therapy protocols, if the FDA allows the IND to proceed, and the trial oversight bodies and the OSP decide that full public review of the protocol is warranted, initiation of the protocol will be delayed until after completion of the RAC review process. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a biological product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such trials.

Clinical trials involve the administration of the biological product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor&#8217;s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA&#8217;s GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Clinical trials also must be reviewed by an institutional biosafety committee, or IBC, a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees basic and clinical research conducted at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment.

Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:

Phase 1 . The biological product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety. In the case of some product candidates for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product candidate may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. 

Phase 2 . The biological product candidate is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule. 

Phase 3 . Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency, and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide an adequate basis for product approval and labeling. 

&#160;

&#160;

Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, ma y be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up. Depending on the type of prod uct and mechanism of action, the FDA may recommend that sponsors observe subjects for potential gene therapy-related delayed adverse events for a 15-year period, including a minimum of five years of annual examinations followed by 10 years of annual querie s, either in person or by questionnaire, of trial subjects. 

During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA, the NIH and the investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions, any findings from other trials, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor&#8217;s initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB&#8217;s requirements or if the biological product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.

Human gene therapy products are a new category of therapeutics. Because this is a relatively new and expanding area of novel therapeutic interventions, there can be no assurance as to the length of the trial period, the number of patients the FDA will require to be enrolled in the trials in order to establish the safety, efficacy, purity and potency of human gene therapy products, or that the data generated in these trials will be acceptable to the FDA to support marketing approval. The NIH and the FDA have a publicly accessible database, the Genetic Modification Clinical Research Information System, which includes information on gene transfer trials and serves as an electronic tool to facilitate the reporting and analysis of adverse events on these trials. Over the last several years the FDA has issued helpful guidance on development of gene therapy products and shown a willingness to work closely with developers, especially with those working in orphan disease areas.

Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biological product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product candidate in commercial quantities in accordance with GMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with the use of biological products, the PHS Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.

United States review and approval processes

After the completion of clinical trials of a biological product candidate, FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the biological product candidate. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human trials, information on the manufacture and composition of the product candidate, proposed labeling and other relevant information. In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product candidate is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any biological product candidate for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.

Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. According to the FDA&#8217;s fee schedule for fiscal year 2017, which becomes effective October 1, 2016, the user fee for an application requiring clinical data, such as a BLA, is $2,038,100. PDUFA also imposes an annual product fee for biologics ($97,750) and an annual establishment fee ($512,200) on facilities used to manufacture prescription biologics. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for product candidates designated as orphan drugs, unless the product candidate also includes a non-orphan indication.

&#160;

&#160;

Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incompl ete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product candidate is safe and potent, or effective, for its intend ed use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product candidate is being manufactured in accordance with GMP regulations to assure and preserve the product candidate&#8217;s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may ref er applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the biological product candidate. A REMS may be imposed to ensure safe use of the drug, and could include medication gui des, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; th e FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required. 

Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product candidate is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product candidate unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with GMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product candidate within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND trial requirements and GCP requirements. To assure GMP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production, and quality control.

Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. If the agency decides not to approve the BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.

If a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product candidate. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, designed to further assess a biological product&#8217;s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.

One of the performance goals agreed to by the FDA under the PDUFA is to review 90% of standard BLAs in 10 months and 90% of priority BLAs in six months, whereupon a review decision is to be made. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs and its review goals are subject to change from time to time. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the BLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date.

Orphan drug designation

Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product candidate intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug or biological product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product candidate. Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.

&#160;

&#160;

If a product candidate that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. Competitors, however, may recei ve approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product does not ha ve exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same biological product as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor&#8217;s product for the same in dication or disease. If a drug or biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Uni on has similar, but not identical, benefits. 

Expedited development and review programs

The FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biological products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biological products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new drug or biologic may request the FDA to designate the drug or biologic as a Fast Track product candidate at any time during the clinical development of the product candidate. Unique to a Fast Track product candidate, the FDA may consider for review sections of the marketing application on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application.

Any product candidate submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product candidate is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biological product candidate designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review, and aims to review such applications within six months as opposed to ten months for standard review. Additionally, a product candidate may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug or biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biological product candidate receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.

Lastly, under the provisions of the new Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, enacted in 2012, a sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a &#8220;breakthrough therapy.&#8221; A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval and receive the same benefits as drugs with Fast Track designation. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy.

Fast Track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.

Post-approval requirements

Maintaining compliance with applicable federal, state, and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of biological products continues after approval, particularly with respect to GMP requirements. We will rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of any products that we may commercialize. Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with 

&#160;

&#160;

applicable requirements in the GMP regulations, includ ing quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Other post-approval requirements applicable to biological products include reporting of GMP deviations that may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects, reporting updated safety and efficacy information, and complying with electronic record and signature requirements. After a BLA is approved, the product may also be subjec t to official lot release. In this case, as part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA , the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer&#8217;s tests performed on the lot. The FDA also may perfo rm certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, pot ency, and effectiveness of biological products. 

We also must comply with the FDA&#8217;s advertising and promotion requirements, such as those related to direct-to-consumer advertising, the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product&#8217;s approved labeling (known as &#8220;off-label use&#8221;), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions and adverse publicity. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical hold, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.

Biological product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biological products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with GMPs and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain GMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, including withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.

United States patent term restoration and marketing exclusivity

Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product&#8217;s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved biological product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for one or more of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA.

A biological product can obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued &#8220;Written Request&#8221; for such a study.

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or Affordable Care Act, signed into law on March 23, 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be similar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product. This amendment to the PHS Act attempts to minimize duplicative testing. Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical trial or trials. Interchangeability 

&#160;

&#160;

requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same c linical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relat ive to exclusive use of the reference biologic. However, complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structure of biological products, as well as the process by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implemen tation that are still being worked out by the FDA. 

A reference biologic is granted twelve years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product. On April 10, 2013, President Obama released his proposed budget for fiscal year 2014 and proposed to cut this twelve-year period of exclusivity down to seven years. He also proposed to prohibit additional periods of exclusivity for brand biologics due to minor changes in product formulations, a practice often referred to as &#8220;evergreening.&#8221; The first biologic product submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product has exclusivity against other biologics submitting under the abbreviated approval pathway for the lesser of (i) one year after the first commercial marketing, (ii) 18 months after approval if there is no legal challenge, (iii) 18 months after the resolution in the applicant&#8217;s favor of a lawsuit challenging the biologics&#8217; patents if an application has been submitted, or (iv) 42 months after the application has been approved if a lawsuit is ongoing within the 42-month period.

Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement

Sales of our products, when and if approved for marketing, will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state, and foreign government health care programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products, drugs and services. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our product candidates or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover our product candidates could reduce physician usage of our products once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. Given the potential for long term durable therapeutic benefit from the single administration of a gene therapy product, the question of appropriate pricing and method of payment, including annuity payments and &#8220;pay for performance&#8221; schemes, is currently an active discussion and, depending on outcome, could affect the use of our products and our financial performance.

Other Healthcare Laws

Although we currently do not have any products on the market, we may be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security and physician sunshine laws and regulations, many of which may become more applicable to us if our product candidates are approved and we begin commercialization. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.

Employees

As of June 30, 2016, we had 53 full-time employees, 34 of whom have Ph.D., M.D. or other post-graduate degrees. Of these full-time employees, 39 are engaged in research and development activities and 14 are engaged in finance, legal, human resources, facilities and general management.

All of our personnel are co-employees of AGTC and a professional human resource service organization, TriNet HR Corporation, or TriNet. Under our agreement with TriNet, TriNet is a co-employer of our personnel, and is responsible for administering all payroll functions, including tax withholding, and providing health insurance and other benefits for these individuals. We reimburse TriNet for these costs and pay TriNet an administrative fee for its services. We are responsible for, and control, all aspects of the hiring, retention, compensation, management and supervision of our personnel. We consider the terms of our contract with TriNet to be reasonable and customary and believe this arrangement provides substantial benefit to us, in the form of lower costs for employee benefits and a reduced administrative burden on us.

We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees and we have not experienced any work stoppages. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.

&#160;

&#160;

Corporate information 

We were incorporated in Florida in January 1999 and reincorporated in Delaware in October 2003.

Implications of being an emerging growth company

As a company with less than $1 billion in revenue during our last fiscal year, we qualify as an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of specified reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include:

&#160;

&#183; 

only two years of audited financial statements, in addition to any required unaudited interim financial statements, with correspondingly reduced &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; disclosure; 

&#160;

&#183; 

reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements; 

&#160;

&#183; 

no non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting. 

We may take advantage of these exemptions for up to five years from the date of our initial public offering of common stock or such earlier time that we are no longer an emerging growth company. We would cease to be an emerging growth company if we have more than $1 billion in annual revenue, we have more than $700 million in market value of our stock held by non-affiliates or we issue more than $1 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period. We may choose to take advantage of some, but not all, of the available exemptions.

In addition, the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.
