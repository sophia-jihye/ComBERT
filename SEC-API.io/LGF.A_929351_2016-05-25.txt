 ITEM 1. &#32; BUSINESS. 

Overview 

Lionsgate is a premier next generation global content leader with a diversified presence in motion picture production and distribution, television programming and syndication, home entertainment, international distribution and sales, branded channel platforms, interactive ventures and games, and location-based entertainment. 

Although our business is both global and diverse, we classify our operations through two reporting segments: Motion Pictures and Television Production . 

Motion Pictures 

Our Motion Pictures segment includes revenues derived from the following: 

&#8226; 

Theatrical . Theatrical revenues are derived from the domestic theatrical release of motion pictures licensed to theatrical exhibitors on a picture-by-picture basis (distributed by us directly in the United States and through a sub-distributor in Canada). 

&#8226; 

Home Entertainment . Home entertainment revenues are derived from the sale and rental of our film productions and acquired or licensed films and certain television programs (including theatrical and direct-to-video releases) on packaged media and through digital media platforms. We distribute a library of approximately 16,000 motion picture titles and television episodes and programs. 

&#8226; 

Television . Television revenues are primarily derived from the licensing of our theatrical productions and acquired films to the linear pay, basic cable and free television markets. 

&#8226; 

International . International revenues are derived from the licensing of our productions, acquired films, our catalog product and libraries of acquired titles from our international subsidiaries and revenues from our distribution to international distributors, on a territory-by-territory basis. International revenues also include revenues from the direct distribution of our productions, acquired films and our catalog product and libraries of acquired titles in the United Kingdom. 

&#8226; 

Motion Pictures-Other . Other revenues are derived from, among others, our interactive ventures and games division, our global franchise management and strategic partnerships division (which includes location-based entertainment), the sales and licensing of music from the theatrical exhibition of our films and the television broadcasts of our productions, and from the licensing of our films and television programs to ancillary markets. 

Television Production 

Our Television Production segment includes revenues derived from the following: 

&#8226; 

Domestic Television. Domestic television revenues are derived from the licensing and syndication to domestic markets of one-hour and half-hour scripted and unscripted series, television movies, mini-series and non-fiction programming. 

&#8226; 

International. International revenues are derived from the licensing and syndication to international markets of one-hour and half-hour scripted and unscripted series, television movies, mini-series and non-fiction programming. 

&#8226; 

Home Entertainment. Home entertainment revenues are derived from the sale or rental of television production movies or series on packaged media and through digital media platforms. We distribute a library of approximately 16,000 motion picture titles and television episodes and programs. 

&#8226; 

Television Production-Other . Other revenues are derived from, among others, product integration in our television episodes and programs, the sales and licensing of music from the television broadcasts of our productions, and from the licensing of our television programs to ancillary markets. 

Segment Revenue 

For the year ended March 31, 2016, contributions to the Company&#8217;s consolidated revenues from its reporting segments included Motion Pictures &#32; 71.5% &#32;and Television Production 28.5% . 

Within the Motion Pictures &#32;segment, revenues were generated from the following: Theatrical &#32; 18.7% , Home Entertainment &#32; 34.6% , Television &#32; 12.2% , International &#32; 32.7% &#32;and Motion Pictures-Other &#32; 1.8% . &#32; 

Within the Television Production &#32;segment, revenues were generated from the following: Domestic Television &#32; 62.0% , International 28.4% , Home Entertainment &#32; 9.0% &#32;and Television Production-Other &#32; 0.6% . 

Business Strategy 

We continue to grow and diversify our portfolio of content to capitalize on demand from emerging and traditional platforms throughout the world. We maintain a disciplined approach to acquisition, production and distribution of product, by balancing our financial risks against the probability of commercial success for each project. We pursue the same disciplined approach to investments in, and acquisition of, libraries and other assets complementary to our business. We believe that our strategic focus on content and creation of innovative content distribution strategies will enhance our competitive position in the industry, ensure optimal use of our capital, build a diversified foundation for future growth and generate significant long-term value for our shareholders. 

Motion Pictures - Theatrical 

Theatrical Production 

Theatrical production consists of &#8220;greenlighting&#8221; (proceeding with production) and financing motion pictures, as well as the development of screenplays, filming activities and the post-filming editing/post-production process. 

We take a disciplined approach to theatrical production with the goal of producing content that can be distributed through various domestic and international platforms. We typically attempt to mitigate the financial risk associated with production by negotiating co-financing development and co-production agreements (which provide for joint efforts and cost-sharing between us and one or more third-party companies) and pre-selling international distribution rights on a selective basis, including through 

international output agreements (which refers to licensing the rights to distribute a film in one or more media generally for a limited term, in one or more specific territories prior to completion of the film). We also often attempt to minimize production exposure by structuring agreements with talent that provide for them to participate in the financial success of the motion picture in exchange for reducing guaranteed amounts to be paid, regardless of the film's success (referred to as &#8220;up-front payments&#8221;). In addition, many states and foreign countries have implemented incentive programs designed to attract film production as a means of economic development. Government incentives typically take the form of sales tax refunds, transferable tax credits, refundable tax credits, low interest loans, direct subsidies or cash rebates, which are generally calculated based on the amount of money spent in the particular jurisdiction in connection with the production. Each jurisdiction determines the regulations that must be complied with, as well as the conditions that must be satisfied, in order for a production to qualify for the incentive. We use such incentives and/or programs and other structures to further reduce our financial risk in theatrical production. 

Our approach to acquiring films for theatrical release is similar to our approach to film production. We generally seek to limit our financial exposure in acquiring films while adding films of quality and commercial viability to our release schedule and library. 

&#160; 

Theatrical Distribution 

In general, the economic life of a motion picture consists of its exploitation in theaters, on packaged media and on various digital and television platforms in territories around the world. 

Theatrical distribution refers to the marketing and commercial or retail exploitation of motion pictures. We distribute motion pictures directly to U.S. movie theaters. Generally, distributors and exhibitors (theater owners) will enter into agreements whereby the exhibitor retains a portion of the &#8220;gross box office receipts,&#8221; which are the admissions paid at the box office. The balance is remitted to the distributor. Successful motion pictures may continue to play in theaters for more than three months following their initial release. Concurrent with their release in the U.S., motion pictures are generally released in Canada and may also be released in one or more other foreign markets. After the initial theatrical release, distributors seek to maximize revenues by releasing movies in sequential release date windows, which may be exclusive against other non-theatrical distribution channels. 

In most territories, international theatrical distribution (outside of the U.S. and Canada) generally follows the same cycle as domestic theatrical distribution. Historically, the international distribution cycle would begin a few months after the start of the domestic distribution cycle. However, due, in part, to international box office growth, as well as film piracy in international markets, a much higher percentage of films are being released simultaneously in the U.S. and international markets, or even earlier in certain international markets. 

We construct release schedules taking into account moviegoer attendance patterns and competition from other studios' scheduled theatrical releases. We use either wide (generally, more than 2,000 screens nationwide) or limited initial releases, depending on the film. We believe that we generally spend significantly less on prints and advertising for a given film than other studios and design our marketing plans to cost-effectively reach a large audience. 

Producing, marketing and distributing a motion picture can involve significant risks and costs, and can cause our financial results to vary depending on the timing of a motion picture&#8217;s release. For example, marketing costs are generally incurred before and throughout the theatrical release of a film and, to a lesser extent, other distribution windows, and are expensed as incurred. Therefore, we typically incur losses with respect to a particular film prior to and during the film&#8217;s theatrical exhibition, and profitability for the film may not be realized until after its theatrical release window. 

We may revise the release date of a motion picture as the production schedule changes or in such a manner as we believe is likely to maximize revenues or for other business reasons. Additionally, there can be no assurance that any of the motion pictures scheduled for release will be completed, that completion will occur in accordance with the anticipated schedule or budget, or that the film will ever be released.

Over the last 15 years, Lionsgate, Summit Entertainment and affiliated companies have distributed films that have earned 90 Academy Award &#174; nominations, won 20 Academy Awards and have been nominated for and won numerous Golden Globe &#174; Awards, Screen Actors Guild Awards &#174;, BAFTA Awards and Spirit Awards. 

Motion Pictures - Home Entertainment 

Our U.S. home entertainment distribution operation exploits our film and television content library of approximately 16,000 motion picture titles and television episodes and programs, consisting of titles from, among others, Lionsgate, our subsidiaries, affiliates and joint ventures (such as Summit Entertainment, Artisan Entertainment, CodeBlack Films, Grindstone Entertainment Group, Modern Entertainment, Trimark, Pantelion Films and Roadside Attractions), as well as titles from third parties such as A&#38;E, LeapFrog Entertainment, Marvel, MGA Entertainment, Miramax, Saban Entertainment, StudioCanal, Tyler Perry Studios and Zoetrope Corporation. Home entertainment revenue consists of packaged media and digital revenue. 

Packaged Media 

Packaged media distribution involves the marketing, promotion and sale and/or lease of DVDs and Blu-ray discs to wholesalers and retailers who then sell or rent the DVDs and Blu-ray discs to consumers for private viewing. 

For new theatrical titles, home entertainment distribution has traditionally occurred within three to four months of initial theatrical release. However, due in part to new methods of distribution and the rise of new digital platforms and networks, select titles are now being released on video-on-demand (&#8220;VOD&#8221;) and other digital formats on the same day as the title is theatrically released (a so called &#8220;day &#38; date&#8221; release strategy). These titles typically release on a modest number of screens for the purpose of positioning VOD and other ancillary platforms. We have also experimented with various other windowing strategies, where, for instance, a title may be released theatrically on several hundred screens, followed by an electronic-sell-through (&#8220;EST&#8221;) and premium priced interactive VOD window, followed by release on packaged media, regular priced cable VOD, and later, subscription video-on-demand (&#8220;SVOD&#8221;). Importantly, these release strategies are not applicable to every film, and may change based on release patterns, new technologies and product flow. 

We distribute or sell content directly to retailers such as Wal-Mart, Best Buy, Target, Costco and others who buy large volumes of our DVDs and Blu-ray discs to sell directly to consumers. Sales to Wal-Mart accounted for approximately 42% of net home entertainment packaged media revenue in fiscal 2016. We also directly distribute content to the rental market through Netflix, 

Amazon, Redbox and others. The DVDs and Blu-ray discs for new titles in the U.S. include an UltraViolet digital copy, a home entertainment industry standard that allows consumers who have purchased film and television content to access their content at any time by downloading or streaming it from the cloud to various devices supported by participating UltraViolet retailers. 

Of these titles, certain are released through our subsidiary, Grindstone Entertainment Group, which acquires and/or produces titles as finished pictures and as &#8220;pre-buys&#8221; based on script, cast and genres, and creates targeted key art, marketing materials and release plans, which is then distributed direct-to-video, VOD and through other media. In fiscal 2016, Grindstone Entertainment Group released 38 titles. 

Additionally, we distribute television product including series such as Mad Men , Orange Is The New Black , The Royals , Weeds , Nurse Jackie , Duck Dynasty , Hannibal , Blue Mountain State , and the upcoming Narcos &#32;and Grace and Frankie , library titles such as Alf and Little House on the Prairie , certain Disney-ABC Domestic Television series, as well as premiere children's brands including our Alpha and Omega &#32;franchise, Saban Entertainment&#8217;s Power Rangers , Aardman&#8217;s &#32;Shaun the Sheep &#32;library, LeapFrog Entertainment's LeapFrog , MGA Entertainment's LalaLoopsy and Bratz , American Greetings' Care Bears , and our catalog of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles &#32;and Marvel Animated Features. 

In fiscal 2016, four of our theatrical releases debuted at number one on DVD and Blu-ray - The Divergent Series: Insurgent &#32;(which held the number one spot for two weeks), The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2, The Last Witch Hunter and Sicario . 

We shipped approximately 80 million DVD and Blu-ray finished units during fiscal 2016. In calendar 2015, we had an approximate 10% market share for home entertainment (packaged media, VOD and digital combined) making us the number five studio in market share overall. We also maintained a box office-to-home entertainment conversion rate of approximately 15% above that of the industry average in calendar 2015. Box office-to-home entertainment conversion rate is calculated as the ratio of the total of both first cycle DVD release revenues and total digital platform revenues for a theatrical release compared to the total North American box-office revenues from such theatrical release. 

Digital Media 

Digital media distribution involves delivering content (including certain titles not available on packaged media) by electronic means directly to consumers through in-home devices (such as set-top boxes from cable, satellite and telco companies, connected or &#8220;smart&#8221; devices, game consoles and HDMI dongles) and mobile devices (such as smart phones, tablets and personal computers). The key distribution methods today, of which Lionsgate is an active participant, include transactional distribution (such as pay-per-view (&#8220;PPV&#8221;), EST and transaction video-on-demand (&#8220;TVOD&#8221;)), non-transactional distribution (such as SVOD), advertiser-supported video-on-demand (&#8220;AVOD&#8221;) and free video-on-demand (&#8220;FVOD&#8221;)) and distribution through various linear pay, basic cable and free television platforms. 

Distribution on pay networks include, among others, EPIX, HBO, Starz and Showtime. Distribution on basic cable networks include, among others, USA Networks, FX, Turner Networks, BET, Pop, SyFy, Lifetime, MTV, Comedy Central, Spike, AMC Networks, Freeform (formerly known as ABC Family), Reelz, Telemundo, UniM&#225;s and Mundo Fox. We also license library content to digital platforms and networks such as iTunes, iQIYI, Amazon, Wal-Mart's Vudu, Microsoft's Xbox, Sony's PlayStation Network, Google Play, Netflix, Best Buy/Cinema Now, Hulu, EPIX, Barnes &#38; Noble/Nook, M-Go and, most recently, Valve Corporation&#8217;s Steam platform, and directly distribute (including, in some cases, our home entertainment rights, VOD, PPV and EST content) to multichannel video programming distributors such as Comcast, DirecTV/AT&#38;T, Dish Network, Cablevision, Cox Communications, Charter Communications and Verizon Communications. 

Transactional digital media distribution of theatrically released motion pictures generally occurs within three to six months of the initial theatrical release. Pay television distribution and/or digital SVOD distribution usually follows within nine months of a movie&#8217;s initial theatrical release. Finally, all other linear television and non-transactional digital models commence throughout various windows thereafter. While these current release patterns may not remain static in the future and may change based on release patterns, new technologies and product flow, a film&#8217;s lifecycle remains long. A release pattern may look as follows: 

&#32; 

We also distribute our original and acquired television programming across a variety of digital platforms on an EST basis, often the day after an episode airs on television in the territory. Television content is usually made available on digital SVOD, FVOD and AVOD platforms years after such content first airs, generating additional revenues for the Company and supplementing those revenues earned from traditional linear television distribution. 

In fiscal 2016, three of our titles debuted at number one on the Rentrak On-Demand VOD charts - The Duff , The Divergent Series: Insurgent &#32;and Sicario. 

In fiscal 2016, five Lionsgate titles achieved the number one ranking on iTunes&#8217; Top Movies chart - The Duff , The Divergent Series: Insurgent , Sicario , Blue Mountain State: The Rise of Thadland and The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2 . 

The Company also licenses its product outside of the U.S. The typical windowing sequence is generally consistent with the domestic cycle; however, windowing strategies are developed in response to local market practices and conditions, and the exact sequence and length of each window can vary by country and by title. 

Over-The-Top Initiatives 

We also distribute content through Tribeca ShortList, Comic-Con HQ and, shortly, Laugh Out Loud, our suite of over-the-top services which feature branded, targeted content for affinity audiences. 

Tribeca Short List, our SVOD service with Tribeca Enterprises, a diversified global media company which owns and operates the Tribeca Film Festival, encompasses a prestigious selection of Lionsgate and Tribeca titles as well as critically-acclaimed films drawn from around the world. The films are curated by Tribeca and leading voices in contemporary culture and are refreshed on a weekly basis. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Comic-Con HQ, our SVOD service with Comic-Con International, a nonprofit educational organization dedicated to creating awareness of, and appreciation for, comics and related popular artforms, primarily through the presentation of conventions and events that celebrate the historic and ongoing contribution of comics to art and culture, features an evolving slate of programming. This slate includes original scripted and unscripted series, recurring daily and weekly entertainment commentary, plus unique access to a growing library of live and archival programming from world-class events, a highly-curated selection of film and television genre titles, and behind-the-scenes access and bonus features from genre titles that defy and define pop culture. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

In March 2016, we announced that we had formed a partnership with Kevin Hart and his company, Hartbeat Digital, to launch a new video-on-demand service, Laugh Out Loud, and create a new social adventure mobile tablet game. The new service will serve as the exclusive home for all content created by Kevin Hart outside his theatrical and live touring activities and will include original series starring Kevin Hart. Laugh Out Loud will also showcase content curated by Kevin Hart along with shows featuring social media stars and up and coming comedians. 

Motion Pictures - Television 

We license our theatrical productions and acquired films to the domestic linear pay, basic cable and free television markets. For additional information, see Motion Pictures-Home Entertainment - Digital Media &#32;above. 

Motion Pictures - International 

Our international sales operations are headquartered at our offices in London, England. The primary components of our international business are, on a territory by territory basis through third parties or directly through our international divisions: (i) the licensing of rights in all media of our in-house feature film product on an output basis; (ii) the licensing of rights in all media of our in-house product on a pre-sales basis; (iii) the licensing and sale of third party feature films on an agency basis; and (iv) direct distribution. 

We sell or license rights in all media on a territory by territory basis (other than the territories where Lionsgate self-distributes) of (i) our in-house Lionsgate and Summit Entertainment feature film product, and (ii) films produced by third parties such as Alcon Entertainment, Black Label Media, CBS Films, River Road Entertainment, Thunder Road Pictures and other independent producers. Films licensed and/or released by us in fiscal 2016 included such in-house productions as The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2 , The Divergent Series: Allegiant , &#32;Sicario , The Last Witch Hunter , Gods of Egypt , Child 44 , &#32;Now You See Me 2 , &#32;Deepwater Horizon , La La Land , &#32;Nerve , The Shack , John Wick: Chapter 2 , Power Rangers , &#32;The Glass Castle , Robin Hood: Origins &#32;and Stronger . Third party films for which we were engaged as exclusive sales agent and/or released by us in fiscal 2016 included Love &#38; Mercy , A Little Chaos , Pawn Sacrifice , Love the Coopers , The Last Face, A Monster Calls &#32;and Middle School . 

Through our pre-sales and output arrangements, we generally cover the majority of the production budget or acquisition cost of new theatrical releases we distribute internationally. Our output agreements for Lionsgate and Summit feature films currently cover 11 territories including Australia/New Zealand, Benelux (Belgium/Netherlands/Luxembourg), Canada, CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States), Eastern Europe, France, Germany/Austria, Italy, Poland, Scandinavia and Spain. These output agreements generally include all rights for all media (including home entertainment and television rights). We also distribute theatrical titles in Latin America through our partnership with IDC, certain theatrical titles in China through our financing relationship with Hunan TV &#38; Broadcast Intermediary Co., and certain television and library titles in Asia through our Celestial Tiger Entertainment joint venture. In all, we currently have 17 output arrangements covering 13 major territories and 80% of the movie going population (excluding China and India). 

We self-distribute motion pictures in the United Kingdom and Ireland through Lionsgate UK (formerly Redbus Film Distribution), which we acquired in October 2005. Lionsgate UK has since established a reputation in the United Kingdom as a leading producer and distributor and acquirer of commercially successful and critically acclaimed product. In fiscal 2016, Lionsgate UK released the following 18 films theatrically:

Interactive Ventures and Games 

Our Interactive Ventures and Games division develops our digital investment strategy as well as our operational initiatives for both our own and third party intellectual property for traditional and digital media adaptation through, among other things, the production and global distribution of multi-platform games, the licensing of content for games and mobile devices, and development of branded online services and experiences including virtual and augmented reality. 

Over the past few years, we have invested in interactive storytellers Telltale Games, Finnish mobile game developer/publisher Next Games, live mobile gaming platform Mobcrush, and formed a strategic partnership with Hong Kong based mobile game developer/publisher Fifth Journey. 

In gaming, we have announced an Orange Is The New Black &#32;slot machine with International Game Technology (which was simultaneously released into their DoubleDown Casino app), partnered with Alcon Entertainment and Starbreeze to create Point Break &#32;game pack extensions for Payday 2 , released a Norm of the North &#32;edutainment app with Hong Kong based Animoca (to be followed by a Norm of the North runner game), and collaborated with Flashman Games on interactive Hunger Games &#32;PlayStation 4 themes. We also announced a deeper integration of John Wick &#32;into Payday 2 , an Expendables &#32;mobile game in partnership with Avi Lerner's Millennium Films and Hong Kong-based mobile game developer and publisher Fifth Journey, a Kevin Hart social adventure game with Fifth Journey, and a story driven Now You See Me &#32;game with Kiwi. We anticipate significantly building this slate over the next several years. 

In the past year, we have also launched a broad range of virtual reality ("VR") initiatives building upon our reputation as early definers of new content platforms and markets. We became one of the first studios to invest in a AAA VR game for tethered headsets (e.g., Vive, Oculus and PlayStation VR) with our soon-to-be released John Wick: The Impossible Task &#32;VR Game, a first-person shooter game in collaboration with Starbreeze. We also partnered with Side-Kick VR to develop one of the first-ever premium IP based mobile VR games based on the Now You See Me &#32;film franchise. Finally, we produced Hulu&#8217;s first original VR experience in collaboration with RocketJump and became one of the first two studios to provide EST and VOD titles to Oculus for the launch of their video platform. 

Global Franchise Management and Strategic Partnerships 

Our Global Franchise Management and Strategic Partnership division broadly covers all theatrical and television promotions and branded partnerships, licensed consumer products and location-based entertainment initiatives. Our goal is to drive incremental revenue and deepen fan engagement across our entire portfolio of properties via meaningful brand extensions, a direct model consumer products business and location-based entertainment destinations around the world. 

Recent initiatives include strategic alliances with Samsung, Kellogg's and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles to support the release of The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2, &#32;a Lionsgate theme park zone featuring multiple attractions scheduled to open at Motiongate Dubai in late 2016, and a Lionsgate branded indoor entertainment experience scheduled to open in Hengqin, China. 

Music 

Our film and television music departments creatively oversee music for our theatrical and television slates, respectively. Our music strategy is to service the Company&#8217;s creative division&#8217;s music needs, while providing music for use in marketing our films and television shows. For our theatrical slate, the work of the music department includes overseeing songs, scores and soundtracks for all of our productions, co-productions and acquisitions. For our television slate, the work of the music department includes overseeing music staffing, scores and soundtracks for all of our television productions. Music revenues are derived from the sales and licensing of music from our films and television programs, and the theatrical exhibition of our films and the television broadcasts of our productions. 

Ancillary Revenues 

Ancillary revenues are derived from the licensing of non-theatrical uses of our films and television programs to distributors who, in turn, make a motion picture or television program available to airlines, hotels, schools, oil rigs, public libraries, prisons, community groups, the armed forces, ships at sea and others. 

Television Production - Domestic Television 

Our television business consists of the development, production, syndication and distribution of television programming. We principally generate revenue from the licensing and distribution of such programming to broadcast television networks, pay and basic cable networks, digital platforms and syndicators of first-run programming, which license programs on a station-by-station basis and pay in cash or via barter (i.e., trade of programming for airtime). Each of these platforms may acquire a mix of original and library programming. 

After initial exhibition, we distribute programming to subsequent buyers, both domestically and internationally, including basic cable network, premium subscription services or digital platforms (known as &#8220;off-network syndicated programming&#8221;). Off-network syndicated programming can be sold in successive cycles of sales which may occur on an exclusive or non-exclusive basis. In addition, television programming is sold on home video (packaged media and via digital delivery) and across all other applicable ancillary revenue streams including music publishing, touring and integration. 

As with film production, we use tax credits, subsidies, and other incentive programs for television production in order to maximize our returns and ensure fiscally responsible production models. 

In November 2015, we acquired a 62.5% interest in Pilgrim Media Group, one of the world's leading producers of unscripted programming. Following this transaction, we currently produce, syndicate and distribute over 80 television shows on more than 40 networks. 

In fiscal 2016, syndication (through our subsidiary, Debmar-Mercury), scripted and unscripted programming produced, co-produced or distributed by us and our affiliated entities included, among others, the following:

Intellectual Property 

We currently use a number of trademarks, service marks, copyrights, domain names and similar intellectual property in connection with our business and own registrations and applications to register them both domestically and internationally. We believe that ownership of such trademarks, service marks, copyrights, domain names and similar intellectual property is an important factor in our business and that our success does depends, in part, on such ownership. 

Motion picture and television piracy is extensive in many parts of the world, including South America, Asia and certain Eastern European countries, and is made easier by technological advances and the conversion of content into digital formats. This trend 

facilitates the creation, transmission and sharing of high quality unauthorized copies of content on packaged media and through digital formats. The proliferation of unauthorized copies of these products has had and will likely continue to have an adverse effect on our business, because these products reduce the revenue we receive from our products. Our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to certain risks and from time to time, we encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property. We cannot provide assurance that we will prevail in any intellectual property disputes. 

This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains references to our trademarks and to trademarks belonging to other entities. Solely for convenience, trademarks and trade names referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including logos, artwork and other visual displays, may appear without the &#174; or TM symbols, but such references are not intended to indicate, in any way, that we will not assert, to the fullest extent under applicable law, our rights or the rights of the applicable licensor to these trademarks and trade names. We do not intend our use or display of other companies&#8217; trade names or trademarks to imply a relationship with, or endorsement or sponsorship of us by, any other company. 

Competition 

Television and motion picture production and distribution are highly competitive businesses. We face competition from companies within the entertainment business and from alternative forms of leisure entertainment, such as travel, sporting events, outdoor recreation, video games, the internet and other cultural related activities. We compete with the major studios, numerous independent motion picture and television production companies, television networks, pay television systems and digital media platforms for the acquisition of literary and film properties, the services of performing artists, directors, producers and other creative and technical personnel and production financing, all of which are essential to the success of our entertainment businesses. In addition, our motion pictures compete for audience acceptance and exhibition outlets with motion pictures produced and distributed by other companies. Likewise, our television product faces significant competition from independent distributors as well as major studios. As a result, the success of any of our motion pictures and television product is dependent not only on the quality and acceptance of a particular film or program, but also on the quality and acceptance of other competing motion pictures or television programs released into the marketplace at or near the same time. 

Given such competition, we attempt to operate with a different business model than many others. We typically emphasize a lower cost structure, risk mitigation, reliance on financial partnerships and innovative financial strategies. Our cost structures are designed to utilize our flexibility and agility as well as the entrepreneurial spirit of our employees, partners and affiliates, in order to provide creative entertainment content to serve diverse audiences worldwide. 

Social Responsibility 

We are committed to acting responsibly and making a positive difference in the local and global community through Lionshares, the umbrella for our companywide commitment to our communities. Lionshares is a volunteer program that seeks to provide opportunities for employees within the Lionsgate family to partner with a diverse range of charitable organizations. The program not only enriches the Lionsgate work experience through cultural and educational outreach, but also positively interacts and invests in the local and global community. Specifically, Lionshares strives to: 

&#8226; 

Provide diverse activities intended to appeal to a broad range of interests, including: literacy, elderly visits, food banks, animal interactions, disaster relief, community relations, environmental activities, health/fitness, cancer awareness and charitable fundraising. 

&#8226; 

Partner with leading organizations with expertise in these areas. 

&#8226; 

Create an effectual and influential impact through human contact. 

&#8226; 

Share time and experience, not just among Lionsgate employees, but with the greater community as well. 

For further information about our social responsibility initiatives, see www.lionsgate.com/corporate/volunteer . 

Employees 

As of May 23, 2016, we had 795 full-time employees in our worldwide operations, including full-time and part-time employees of our wholly-owned subsidiaries and consolidated ventures.
