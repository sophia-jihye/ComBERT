Plan of Operations 

&#160;

Insynergy Products (&#147;Insynergy&#148;) is a company with deep experience in commercializing consumer products. Beyond developing products, a core competency is commercial and infomercial production development combined with specific expertise in traditional and digital media acquisition. The foundation of Insynergy and the continued corporate goal is to develop intellectual property (&#147;IP&#148;) internally or via a license from a third party. The path to monetization and value creation is realized as the Company then exploits our growing distribution footprint. Beyond the goal of extensive profitability, the intent is to engineer sustained and long term value by building the portfolio of IP inclusive of products and brands. The Board of Directors is cognizant of the Company&#146;s stage, size, limitations, attributes short and long term goals. Ultimately the Company envisions a healthy organic growth path coupled by strategic acquisitions. This will lead the Company to an upgrade onto a primary securities exchange by 2018. Insynergy has a keen eye for strategic acquisitions and has identified certain takeover targets that the Company expects to start to capitalize on in 2017. 

&#160;

The Company&#146;s commercialization path intently depends on identifying a novel product(s). Once found, a series of due diligence steps are taken ensuring the product&#146;s success. From technology to marketing to feasibility, the product as a whole is intently examined. The Company consistently and with discipline follows a SWOT Analysis in understanding a product from a 360 vantage point that sets the stage for sound and low risk commercialization inferences. SWOT is the analysis of Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats. Everything from patent and trademark searches to liability analysis to broad retail shelf sweeps are undertaken until the Board of Directors approves a product as a candidate for launch. Then a series of intimate customer engagements begins. From focus groups to trial runs to engagement with corporate buyers for their privileged views, this all provides a level of insight that strategically positions Insynergy as a unique and formative player in the consumer products industry.

Insynergy today has established vendor numbers with key retailors across the nation, including Home Depot, Walgreens, Kroger, and Dollar General, to name a few, all due to our first product&#146;s success Plumbers Hero &#150; www.plumbershero.com. 

&#160;

This unique drain clearing aerosol product was launched in the first quarter of 2015 in an expedited fashion in order to accomplish a few key tactical goals being revenue growth, vendor number acquisition and brand development. Due to our CEO&#146;s past experience, commercializing Plumbers Hero was a quick process. With a cumulative media spend over the first three quarters of approximately $500,000 not only was national retail distribution gained but total gross revenues topped $1.5M in under eight months. The project was designed as a short term run with a critical start and stop time line. This provided enough market inertia to not only generate sales and brand development but it positioned the Company to gain retail vendor numbers and shelf space. Due to the media and direct to consumer response the strategy to then pull the product through retail was a comprehensive success. The nature of this project was to commercialize, market and distribute via Direct Response TV and retail with the understanding the product will not have long term shelf stability as the goal was not to reinvest in media. A quick controlled investment with specific and measured goals. As this product had a relatively low cost to commercialize, the Company desired a big splash, easy consumer acceptance, DR sales, vendor numbers, shelf space and retail sales that now set the stage for our future, which includes a remarkable and broad portfolio of recently acquired IP.

&#160;

In the third quarter of 2015, we struck a land mark license deal with Mr. Ross Sklar of The Starco Group. Insynergy secured the exclusive license to a broad body of novel products and technologies in the following categories: 

&#160;

- 

Consumer Food 

- 

Cosmetic 

- 

OTC Personal Care 

- 

House hold cleaning 

- 

Hardware, Automotive 

- 

Pet Care 

- 

Seasonal 

- 

Arts &#38; Crafts 

&#160;

The products in the aforementioned categories will fill our pipeline until 2025.

&#160;

The significance of the license agreement is that it enables the Company access to cutting edge products that span multiple categories. This allows Insynergy the ability to focus on our core competencies in branding, media production/buying and distribution. With the ground work done in this first year Insynergy has opened retail channels with many of the major retail accounts and will commercialize unique IP while strategically marketing and placing our products into their distribution. 

&#160;

Mr. Sklar currently oversees a very broad manufacturing infrastructure that produces products in the aforementioned categories. This adds a portfolio of leading-edge IP that not only vertically integrates Insynergy&#146;s research and development efforts but it completely builds out our product pipeline for years to come. It is our belief that no one in the space has our technological depth. While there are competitive players in Insynergy&#146;s DRTV/retail vertical, the resources and depth Insynergy now has positions the Company to take a dominating role over the next five years. 

&#160;

In 2015 the Company had a busy and successful year. To top things off we secured and fulfilled a very large order from a big box leader, totaling over $350,000.

&#160;

2015 has been a wonderful developmental year for Insynergy, while we have experienced some recent cash flow rigidity the Company is well structured with very low overhead. In the following months we will be announcing further strategic corporate joint ventures involving a shopping channel combined with cross category product launches and management is thrilled to execute on our strategic plan in 2016 and beyond.

&#160;

Direct Response Marketing 

&#160;

Direct Response Marketing generally takes the form of the marketing and sale of products utilizing infomercials which are broadcast over local television channels, paired with a Call Response Center which takes the calls generated by potential purchasers who call in after viewing the infomercial, and a fulfillment center, which ships out the product.

&#160;

The infomercial is designed to solicit a direct response in the target audience which is specific and quantifiable. The delivery of the response is directly between the viewer and the advertiser, that is, the customer responds to the marketer or its agent directly. In direct marketing (such as telemarketing), there is no intermediary broadcast media involved. In Direct &#147;Response&#148; Marketing, marketers use broadcast media to encourage customers to contact them directly. This direct response marketing seeks to elicit action. Marketing results from a Direct Response Marketing Program can be tracked, measured, and quantified.

Direct Response Marketing is characterized by:

&#160;

&#183; 

An offer of a specific product or combination of products 

&#183; 

Sufficient information for the consumer to make a decision whether to act and buy 

&#183; 

An explicit &#147;call to action&#148; 

&#183; 

Provision of a means for buy response (typically multiple options such as toll free number, web page, and email) 

&#160;

Direct Response Marketing Products 

&#160;

Direct Response Marketing is often used for new and innovative products that can be demonstrated and shown to make life easier or better, or products which solve a specific problem the target audience may have.

&#160;

Health and fitness products, skin, hair and personal care products, nutritional supplements, house wares and appliances, have all been successfully marketed. Anti-aging products are a category of product which is currently generating successful sales. An idea for a new product usually comes from an inventor, who then approaches a company such as ours for development and implementation of a Direct Marketing Program or campaign for the product.

&#160;

Our Company selects products invented by others for use in a Direct Response Marketing Program, but we also develop our own products for sale as well. We will analyze each product presented to us to see if it looks like it would be an attractive candidate for a direct marketing campaign. We will look for products which satisfy a specific need that can be concretely presented in the infomercial, lend themselves to generation of a call for action motivation in the target audience, provide for a substantial markup on the sales price over their cost (typically somewhere in the realm of a 5 to 1 markup), have a lower range target price in order to encourage immediate discretionary purchase, and have anticipated staying power as a useful product which the Company can sell over and over again.

&#160;

We will license products from the inventor or owner of the product, with license fees paid on collected revenue from the sales of the product, net of returns and allowances. Typical license fees run between 2% and 4% of net sales for sales generated over television and the web, and if the Company is able to then take the product for distribution to traditional brick and mortar outlets for further sales, an increased license fee of between 4% and 6% is typically paid. The license rights typically run for between 24 and 36 months, and are generally renewable. Products may or may not have patent protection, copyright protection, and/or trademark protection.

&#160;

The Company is developing products that will be marketed in many different areas. This will be a completely different type of branding. Social media will be a key factor to making consumers aware of new and great retail brands. This special type of advertising will bring consumers into the stores and create a special awareness of new and exciting products.

&#160;

Products to Be Marketed 

&#160;

During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company centered its efforts on Plumber&#146;s Hero, a product that clears normal clogs in the shower, tub, kitchen sink, bathroom sink and toilet.

&#160;

Our exclusive License Agreement gives us worldwide rights to advertise, promote, market, manufacture, distribute, sell and/or exploit the product in any and all media, means and markets and all channels of trade and distribution now known or hereafter devised.

&#160;

The Plumber&#146;s Hero kit comes with a canister containing twenty applications of the Plumber&#146;s Hero formula, one large and one small rubber drain cover to work on kitchen sinks, including double sinks with a disposal, bathroom, shower and tub drains, as well as an extension handle for use in the toilet.

&#160;

Two minute, one minute and thirty second commercials were shot and the marketing campaign ran throughout 2015.

&#160;

Production of Infomercials 

&#160;

Demonstrating the appeal and uniqueness of the product in a sales video infomercial is critical in creating a buying response. 

An offer must be presented in the video such that its appeal is relevant to the wants or needs of the audience. 

&#160;

Short form direct response video commercials have time lengths ranging from 30 seconds to 2 minutes. Long form infomercials are 30 minutes in length. Direct Response ads can be contrasted with normal television commercials because traditional commercials normally do not solicit a direct immediate response from the viewer, but instead try to brand their product in the market place.

&#160;

The typical direct response spot of two minutes consists of a spokesperson or dominant voice over footage showing the product being demonstrated, solving a problem and/or making life easier and better. An 800 phone number will be shown on screen a few seconds into the spot along with a website address. The last few seconds of the spot will show a blue screen with all the information to make a purchase and provide a call to action.

&#160;

The Company writes, produces, hires the talent, directs, shoots and edits many of its infomercials in-house. The Company will also hire outside production companies who have had success shooting shows with products in the same genre as the products we will be releasing such as fitness, house wares and hair care.

&#160;

Test Marketing 

&#160;

We test all our products with a retail sales group before we execute a license agreement, in order to gauge the likely reaction in the market place. Once a license agreement is executed, we will typically create the video, and then spend small amounts of money on media air time over test stations and test air segments that have what management considers the right demographics for a particular product. If a product successfully generates sales in these test spots, we will then expand the campaign for the product over additional TV markets. During the test marketing stage we also tweak the video infomercial as to dialogue, and as to order of presentment of material.

&#160;

Purchasing of Air Time 

&#160;

The products and demographics will dictate which TV market management selects for a particular campaign. We expect most of our spots to run approximately 2 minutes. The cost per spot will depend on which market it is show in, and at what time the spot airs. We may also use radio and/or direct mailing campaigns, and will provide a website over which a product can be purchased. 

Telephone Marketing Functions 

&#160;

Once a customer has decided to buy our product, they either call an 800 phone number or go to a website to conclude the purchase. In today&#146;s marketing climate, order taking for many products sold under $20 is done by an interactive voice recognition telephone application (&#147;IVR&#148;) which electronically takes the customer&#146;s name and address, phone number, credit card information and orders for products. Order information will be in a file format to be batched and sent daily to a fulfillment facility.

&#160;

Using the IVR application is perhaps half the cost of using live agents to respond to calls, but for some products with higher price points, live sales agents provided by independent third party contractors will be used.

&#160;

The Company will subcontract out to independent third parties the telephone marketing functions associated with a campaign for each product. Initially, the Company has contracted for Teleperformance (&#147;Teleperformance&#148;) to provide this function, although many other companies are available to undertake this roll at competitive pricing, and the Company may use others in the future.

&#160;

Manufacture of Products 

&#160;

The Company will out-source the manufacture of products it markets to independent third party companies. The Company has had discussions with several mainland China manufacturers, for the manufacture of products. Unless presented with a Letter of Credit, a mainland China manufacturer generally requires 30% as down payment to begin manufacturing and the balance when the product is ready to ship. Management believes there are many sources for manufacturing in China, and elsewhere offshore, which are generally dependable and reasonably priced. However, the product, Plumber&#146;s Hero, is 100% manufactured in the United States.

Fulfillment of Orders 

&#160;

Fulfillment involves the storage of inventory, acceptance of order information, boxing and shipping out of products, and dealing with questions, order status, complaints, returns and allowances on products, and maintaining proper records. The fulfillment function on each product will be sub-contracted out to independent third party companies.

&#160;

Initially, the Company has contracted for Moulton Logistics to provide this function, although many other companies are available to undertake this role at competitive prices, and the Company may use others in the future.

&#160;

Credit Card Transactions 

&#160;

Sales orders for Direct Response Marketing Programs are typically taken using credit cards. The Company has contracted for credit card processing of sales orders on products with BluePay, an independent third party company. BluePay powers payment processing for companies that sell direct to consumers through internet retail, online services, direct response marketing and multichannel retail. 

&#160;

Product Campaign Failure 

&#160;

Some of our future Direct Response Marketing Campaigns will no doubt fail. Direct response products can fail due to many reasons, including no perceived need for the product, other competing products provide better solutions or are better priced, the product price is too high, the infomercial is unconvincing, the wrong time slot or market segment is selected for broadcast, the marketing company lacks sufficient capital to fund product inventory and air time purchase, and for a variety of other reasons. Larger trends, such as a recessionary economy, less discretionary purchasing power in the hands of consumers, more restrictive credit or higher rates on credit cards, also can discourage sales and cause a campaign to fail. Other issues can also cause a campaign to fail, such as too low a price markup, poor quality resulting in high returns, a lack of sufficient capital to purchase sufficient airtime, or to purchase sufficient inventory, or failure by third party contractors to properly carry out their responsibilities for manufacturer, order taking, and fulfillment.

&#160;

Management will endeavor to avoid these pitfalls in selection of a product, production of the TV spot, test marketing, purchasing of air time, and other aspects of running of the campaign, but there are significant risks in conducting a direct response marketing business, and we will no doubt have some product failures which will result in loss, while other products may barely breakeven and return the costs laid out to undertake product production and the campaign.

&#160;

Transition from Direct Response Marketing to Brick and Mortar Distribution 

&#160;

If a product is financially successful in our direct marketing response campaign, management will consider marketing and distributing the product to big box retail stores, building off the product branding that has occurred by running the television campaign. 

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

There is significant competition in the Direct Response Marketing industry from both small and large companies since there are really no barriers to entry. As a result, there are literally hundreds of direct response companies that operate in the U.S. and offer a wide variety of products across all categories of consumer goods.

&#160;

The Company will have to rely on the skills of its management to pick products which produce successful direct response marketing campaigns and ultimately profits to the Company.

&#160;

Insurance 

&#160;

The Company carries general liability insurance through CNA with an occurrence limit of $1,000,000 with a general aggregate of $2,000,000 and a deductible of $500. The Company also carries product liability insurance to insure against liability on the products it sells.

&#160;

Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights 

&#160;

The Company may file registrations for such patents, trademarks, or copyrights, as it deems commercially prudent from time to time.

Government Regulation 

&#160;

Our infomercials may be subject to regulation by the FTC and each of the states under general consumer protection statutes prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts and practices. Most deception involves written or oral misrepresentations, or omissions of material information. Deception may also occur in other forms of conduct associated with a sales transaction.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

The Company has two full-time employees, but will use independent contractors when we shoot our direct response marketing TV spots.

&#160;
