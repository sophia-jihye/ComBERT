 Item 1. Business 

Our Company 

We are a self-advised and self-administered Maryland real estate investment trust ("REIT") that acquires primarily premium-branded, focused-service and compact full-service hotels. We are one of the largest U.S. publicly-traded lodging REITs in terms of both number of hotels and number of rooms. Our hotels are concentrated in markets that we believe exhibit multiple demand generators and high barriers to entry. We believe premium-branded, focused-service and compact full-service hotels with these characteristics generate high levels of RevPAR, strong operating margins and attractive returns. 

As of December 31, 2015 , we, through wholly-owned subsidiaries, owned 126 &#32;hotels with approximately 20,900 &#32;rooms, located in 21 &#32;states and the District of Columbia and an interest in one mortgage loan secured by a hotel. We own, through wholly-owned subsidiaries, 100% of the interests in all properties, with the exception of one property in which we own a 98.3% &#32;controlling interest in a joint venture. 

For U.S. federal income tax purposes, we elected to be taxed as a REIT commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2011. Substantially all of our assets are held by, and all of our operations are conducted through, our operating partnership. We are the sole general partner of our operating partnership. As of December 31, 2015 , we owned, through a combination of direct and indirect interests, 99.3% &#32;of the OP units in our operating partnership. 

The Lodging Industry 

The lodging industry in the United States consists of private and public entities that operate in an extremely diversified market under a variety of brand names. The lodging industry has several key participants as follows: 

&#8226; 

Owners &#32; &#8212; &#32;own the hotel and typically enter into a management agreement for an independent third party to manage the hotel. The hotel properties may be branded and operated under the manager&#8217;s brand or branded under a separate franchise agreement. 

&#8226; 

Franchisors &#32; &#8212; &#32;own a brand or brands and provide their hotels with brand recognition, marketing support and worldwide reservation systems for the franchised hotels. 

&#8226; 

Managers &#32; &#8212; &#32;responsible for the day-to-day operation of the hotel, including the employment of the hotel staff, the determination of room rates, the development of sales and marketing plans, the preparation of operating and capital expenditures budgets and the preparation of financial reports for the owner. 

Our Investment and Growth Strategies 

Our objective is to generate strong returns for our shareholders by acquiring primarily premium-branded, focused-service hotels and compact full-service hotels at prices where we believe we can generate attractive returns on investment and long-term value appreciation through proactive asset management. We intend to pursue acquisitions of these hotels and selectively dispose of properties when we believe returns have been maximized in order to redeploy capital into more accretive acquisitions and other opportunities. We intend to pursue this objective through the following investment and growth strategies: 

Investment Strategies 

&#8226; 

Targeted ownership of premium-branded, focused-service and compact full-service hotels. We believe that premium-branded, focused-service hotels have the potential to generate attractive returns relative to other types of hotels due to their ability to achieve RevPAR levels at or close to those generated by traditional full-service hotels, while achieving higher profit margins due to their more efficient operating model and less volatile cash flows. We also may acquire compact full-service hotels which have operating characteristics that resemble those of focused-service hotels. 

&#8226; 

Use of premium hotel brands. We believe in affiliating our hotels with premium brands owned by leading international franchisors such as Marriott, Hilton and Hyatt. We target hotels affiliated with premium brands such as Courtyard by Marriott, Residence Inn by Marriott, Hilton Garden Inn and Hyatt House. We believe that utilizing premium brands provides significant advantages because of their guest loyalty programs, worldwide reservation systems, effective product segmentation, global distribution and strong customer awareness. 

&#8226; 

Focus on high-growth markets. We focus on owning and acquiring hotels in markets that we believe have multiple demand generators and high barriers to entry. As a result, we believe that these hotels generate higher returns on investment. 

Growth Strategies 

&#8226; 

Maximize returns from our hotels. We believe that our hotels have the potential to generate significant improvements in RevPAR and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") as a result of our proactive asset management and the anticipated economic growth in the United States. We actively monitor and advise our third-party hotel management companies on most aspects of our hotels' operations, including property positioning, physical design, capital planning and investment, guest experience and overall strategic direction. We regularly review opportunities to further invest in our hotels in an effort to enhance the quality and attractiveness of our hotels, increase their long-term value and generate attractive returns on investment. 

&#8226; 

Pursue a disciplined hotel acquisition strategy. We seek to acquire additional hotels at prices below replacement cost where we believe we can generate attractive returns on investment. We intend to target acquisition opportunities where we can enhance value by pursuing proactive investment strategies such as renovation, repositioning or rebranding. 

&#8226; 

Pursue a disciplined capital recycling program. We intend to continue to pursue a disciplined capital allocation strategy designed to maximize the value of our investments by selectively selling hotels that are no longer consistent with our investment strategy or whose returns appear to have been maximized. To the extent that we sell hotels, we intend to redeploy the capital into higher yielding investments including acquisition and investment opportunities that we believe will achieve higher returns as well as repurchasing our shares on an opportunistic basis. 

Our Hotels 

Overview 

As of December 31, 2015 , we owned a high-quality portfolio of 126 &#32;hotels located in 21 &#32;states and the District of Columbia comprised of approximately 20,900 &#32;rooms. No single hotel accounted for more than 6.2% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 . We believe that the quality of our portfolio is evidenced by the RevPAR penetration index of 110.7 &#32;for our hotels for the year ended December 31, 2015 . 

Brand Affiliations 

Our hotels operate under strong, premium brands, with nearly 97% &#32;of our hotels operating under existing relationships with Marriott, Hilton or Hyatt. The following table sets forth the brand affiliations of our hotels as of December 31, 2015 :

Asset Management 

We have a dedicated team of asset management professionals that proactively work with our third-party hotel management companies to maximize profitability at each of our hotels. Our asset management team monitors the performance of our hotels on a daily basis and holds frequent ownership meetings with corporate operations executives and key personnel at the hotels. Our asset management team works closely with our third-party hotel management companies on key aspects of each hotel's operation, including, among others, revenue management, market positioning, cost structure, capital and operational budgeting as well as the identification of return on investment initiatives and overall business strategy. In addition, we retain approval rights on key staffing positions at many of our hotels, such as the hotel's general manager and director of sales. We believe that our strong asset management process helps to ensure that each hotel is being operated to our and our franchisors' standards, that our hotels are being adequately maintained in order to preserve the value of the asset and the safety of the hotel to customers, and that our hotel management companies are maximizing revenue and enhancing operating margins. 

Competition 

The U.S. lodging industry is highly competitive. Our hotels compete with other participants in the lodging industry for guests in each of their markets on the basis of several factors, including, among others, location, quality of accommodations, convenience, brand affiliation, room rates, service levels and amenities, and level of customer service. Competition is often specific to the individual markets in which our hotels are located and includes competition from existing and new hotels in the focused-service and compact full-service segments. We believe that hotels, such as our hotels, that are affiliated with leading national brands, such as the Marriott, Hilton or Hyatt brands, will enjoy competitive advantages associated with operating under such brands. 

We face competition for the acquisition of hotels from institutional pension funds, private equity funds, REITs, hotel companies and others who are engaged in the acquisition of hotels. Some of these competitors may have substantially greater financial and operational resources and access to capital than we have and may have greater knowledge of the markets in which we seek to invest. This competition may reduce the number of suitable investment opportunities offered to us and decrease the attractiveness of the terms on which we may acquire our targeted hotel investments, including the cost thereof. 

Seasonality 

The lodging industry is seasonal in nature, which can be expected to cause quarterly fluctuations in our revenues. For example, our hotels in the Chicago, Illinois metropolitan area experience lower revenues and profits during the winter months of December through March while our hotels in Florida generally have higher revenues in the months of January through April. This seasonality can be expected to cause periodic fluctuations in a hotel's room revenues, occupancy levels, room rates, operating expenses and cash flows. 

Our Financing Strategy 

We expect to continue to maintain a prudent capital structure by limiting our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 5.0x or below. We define net debt as total indebtedness minus cash and cash equivalents. Over time, we intend to finance our long-term growth with equity issuances and debt financing with staggered maturities. We will seek to primarily utilize unsecured debt (with the ultimate goal of achieving an investment grade rating) and a greater percentage of fixed rate and hedged floating rate debt relative to unhedged floating rate debt. Our debt is currently comprised of both unsecured debt and mortgage debt secured by our hotels. We have a mix of fixed and floating rate debt; however, the majority of our debt either bears interest at fixed rates or effectively bears interest at fixed rates due to interest rate hedges on the debt. 

Organizational Structure 

We were formed as a Maryland REIT in January 2011. We conduct our business through a traditional umbrella partnership real estate investment trust ("UPREIT") in which our properties are indirectly owned by our operating partnership, RLJ Lodging Trust, L.P., through limited partnerships, limited liability companies or other subsidiaries. We are the sole general partner of our operating partnership, and as of December 31, 2015 , we owned 99.3% &#32;of the OP units in our operating partnership. In the future, we may issue OP units from time to time in connection with acquisitions of properties or for financing, compensation or other reasons. 

In order for the income from our hotel operations to constitute "rents from real property" for purposes of the gross income tests required for REIT qualification, we cannot directly or indirectly operate any of our hotels. Accordingly, we lease each of our hotels, and intend to lease any hotels we acquire in the future, to subsidiaries of our TRSs ("TRS lessees"), which are wholly-owned by us, and our TRS lessees have engaged, or will engage, third-party hotel management companies to manage our hotels, and any hotels we acquire in the future, on market terms. Our TRS lessees pay rent to us that we intend to treat as "rents from real property," provided that the third-party hotel management companies engaged by our TRS lessees to manage our hotels are deemed to be "eligible independent contractors" and certain other requirements are met. Our TRSs are subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes applicable to corporations. 

The following chart generally depicts our corporate structure as of December 31, 2015 : 

Regulation 

General 

Our hotels are subject to various U.S. federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, including regulations relating to common areas and fire and safety requirements. We believe that each of our hotels has the necessary permits and approvals to operate its business. 

Americans with Disabilities Act 

Our hotels must comply with the applicable provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the Accessibility Guidelines promulgated thereunder (the "ADA"), to the extent that such hotels are "public accommodations" as defined by the ADA. The ADA may require removal of structural barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our hotels where such removal is readily achievable. We believe that our hotels are in substantial compliance with the ADA and that we will not be required to make substantial capital expenditures to address the requirements of the ADA. However, non-compliance with the ADA could result in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. The obligation to make readily achievable accommodations is an ongoing one, and we will continue to assess our hotels and to make alterations as appropriate in this respect. 

Environmental Matters 

Under various laws relating to the protection of the environment, a current or previous owner or operator (including tenants) of real estate may be subject to liability related to contamination resulting from the presence or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances at that property and may be required to investigate and clean up such contamination at that property or emanating from that property. These costs could be substantial and liability under these laws may attach without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the contaminants, and the liability may be joint and several. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination at our hotels may expose us to third-party liability for cleanup costs, property damage or bodily injury, natural resource damages and costs or expenses related to liens or property use restrictions and materially and adversely affect our ability to sell, lease or develop the real estate or to incur debt using the real estate as collateral. Furthermore, persons who sent waste to a waste disposal facility, such as a landfill or an incinerator, may be liable for costs associated with cleanup of that facility. 

Our hotels are subject to various federal, state, and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that address a wide variety of issues, including, but not limited to, storage tanks, air emissions from emergency generators, storm water and wastewater discharges, lead-based paint, mold and mildew and waste management. Our hotels incur costs to comply with these laws and regulations and could be subject to fines and penalties for non-compliance. The costs of complying with environmental, health and safety laws could increase as new laws are enacted and existing laws are modified. 

Some of our hotels contain asbestos-containing building materials. We believe that the asbestos is appropriately contained in accordance with current environmental regulations and that we have no need for any immediate remediation or current plans to remove the asbestos. Environmental laws require that owners or operators of buildings with asbestos-containing building materials properly manage and maintain these materials, adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement, in the event that asbestos is disturbed during building renovation or demolition. These laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failure to comply with these requirements. In addition, third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos-containing building materials. 

Some of our hotels may contain or develop harmful mold or suffer from other adverse conditions, which could lead to liability for adverse health effects and costs of remediation. The presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our hotels could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants from the affected hotel or increase indoor ventilation. In addition, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from guests or employees at our hotels and others if property damage or health concerns arise. 

Insurance 

We carry comprehensive general liability, fire, extended coverage, business interruption, rental loss coverage and umbrella liability coverage on all of our hotels and earthquake, wind, flood and hurricane coverage on hotels in areas where we believe such coverage is warranted, in each case with limits of liability that we deem adequate. Similarly, we are insured against the risk of direct physical damage in amounts we believe to be adequate to reimburse us, on a replacement basis, for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each hotel, including loss of revenue during the reconstruction period. We have selected policy specifications and insured limits which we believe to be appropriate given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage and industry practice. We do not carry insurance for generally uninsured losses, including, but not limited to losses caused by riots, war or acts of God. In the opinion of our management, our hotels are adequately insured. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had 56 &#32;employees.
