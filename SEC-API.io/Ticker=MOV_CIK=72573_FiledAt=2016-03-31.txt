GENERAL 

In this Form 10-K, all references to the &#8220;Company&#8221; or &#8220;Movado Group&#8221; include Movado Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context requires otherwise. 

Movado Group designs, sources, markets and distributes fine watches. Its portfolio of brands is currently comprised of Coach &#174; Watches, Concord &#174; , Ebel &#174; , ESQ &#174; Movado, Scuderia Ferrari &#174; Watches, HUGO BOSS &#174; Watches, Juicy Couture &#174; Watches, Lacoste &#174; Watches, Movado &#174; , and Tommy Hilfiger &#174; Watches. The Company is a leader in the design, development, marketing and distribution of watch brands sold in almost every major category comprising the watch industry. 

The Company was incorporated in New York in 1967 under the name North American Watch Corporation to acquire Piaget Watch Corporation and Corum Watch Corporation, which had been, respectively, the exclusive importers and distributors of Piaget and Corum watches in the United States since the 1950&#8217;s. The Company sold its Piaget and Corum distribution businesses in 1999 and 2000, respectively, to focus on its own portfolio of brands. Since its incorporation, the Company has developed its brand-building reputation and distinctive image across an expanding number of brands and geographic markets. Strategic acquisitions of watch brands and their subsequent growth, along with license agreements, have played an important role in the expansion of the Company&#8217;s brand portfolio. 

In 1970, the Company acquired the Concord brand and the Swiss company that had been manufacturing Concord watches since 1908. In 1983, the Company acquired the U.S. distributor of Movado watches and substantially all of the assets related to the Movado brand from the Swiss manufacturer of Movado watches. The Company changed its name to Movado Group, Inc. in 1996. In March 2004, the Company completed its acquisition of Ebel, one of the world&#8217;s premier luxury watch brands that was established in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland in 1911. 

The Company is highly selective in its licensing strategy and chooses to enter into long-term agreements with only powerful brands with strong positions in their respective businesses. 

The following table sets forth the brands licensed by the Company and the year in which the Company launched each licensed brand for watches.

Movado 

The Movado brand is renowned for its iconic Museum&#174; dial and modern design aesthetic. Since its founding in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland in 1881, Movado has earned more than 100 patents and 200 international awards for artistry and innovation in watch design and technology, and Movado timepieces have won world renown for their unique beauty and timeless design.

Movado is a hallmark of some of the most famous timepieces ever created, most notably, the Movado Museum&#174; Watch. Designed in 1947 by Bauhaus-influenced artist Nathan George Horwitt, the watch dial defined by a solitary dot at 12, symbolizing the sun at high noon, has been acclaimed for purity of design unrivaled in the history of time-keeping. When Horwitt&#8217;s dial was selected for the permanent design collection of the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 1960, it became the first watch dial ever awarded this distinction. Known today as the Movado Museum Watch, this legendary dial is regarded as an icon of Modernism. A trademarked and award-winning design, the celebrated single dot dial now distinguishes a wide range of Movado timepieces.

The Movado brand experience is defined by its long, rich heritage of design innovation, and a close, enduring association with the arts. Expressions of Movado&#8217;s commitment to the fine and cultural arts encompass commissioned watch designs by famed artists, affiliations with talented brand ambassadors, sponsorship of major arts institutions and support of emerging artists.

The Movado BOLD collection represents iconic Movado design re-imagined for the cool, fashion-savvy, on-trend consumer and is innovative in both design and use of materials. The Movado Edge collection, launched on October 6, 2015, brings design innovation and enhanced sophistication to the legendary Museum Dial through the efforts of world-renowned industrial designer Yves Behar.

&#160;

DESIGN AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT 

The Company&#8217;s offerings undergo two phases before they are produced for sale to customers: design and product development. The design phase includes the creation of artistic and conceptual renderings while product development involves the construction of prototypes. The Company&#8217;s Movado BOLD and licensed brands are designed by in-house design teams in Switzerland and the United States in cooperation with outside sources, including (in the case of the licensed brands) licensors&#8217; design teams. Product development for the licensed brands and Movado BOLD takes place in the Company&#8217;s Asia operations. For the Company&#8217;s Movado (with the exception of Movado BOLD), Ebel and Concord brands, the design phase is performed by a combination of in-house and freelance designers in Europe and the United States while product development is carried out in the Company&#8217;s Swiss operations. Senior management of the Company is actively involved in the design and product development process. 

MARKETING 

The Company&#8217;s marketing strategy is to communicate a consistent, brand-specific message to the consumer. Recognizing that advertising is an integral component to the successful marketing of its product offerings, the Company devotes significant resources to advertising and maintains its own in-house advertising department which focuses primarily on the implementation and management of global marketing and advertising strategies for each of the Company&#8217;s brands, ensuring consistency of presentation. The Company develops advertising campaigns individually for each of the Company&#8217;s brands, utilizing outside agencies as deemed appropriate. These campaigns are directed primarily to the end consumer rather than to trade customers. The Company&#8217;s advertising targets consumers with particular demographic characteristics appropriate to the image and price range of each brand. Company advertising is placed in magazines and other print media, on radio and television, online, in catalogs, on outdoor signs and through other promotional materials. Marketing expenses totaled 12.5%, 12.3% and 13.0% of net sales in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 

OPERATING SEGMENTS 

The Company conducts its business primarily in two operating segments: Wholesale and Retail. For operating segment data and geographic segment data for the years ended January 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements regarding Segment and Geographic Information. 

The Company&#8217;s Wholesale segment includes the design, development, sourcing, marketing and distribution of high quality watches, and unallocated corporate expenses, in addition to after-sales service activities and shipping. The Retail segment includes the Company&#8217;s retail outlet locations.

The Company divides its business into two major geographic locations: United States operations, and International, which includes the results of all other Company operations. The allocation of geographic revenue is based upon the location of the customer. The Company&#8217;s International operations in Europe, the Americas (excluding the United States), the Middle East and Asia account for 21.2%, 10.5%, 7.4% and 6.1%, respectively, of the Company&#8217;s total net sales for fiscal 2016. Substantially all of the Company&#8217;s International assets are located in Switzerland and Hong Kong. For a discussion of the risks associated with the Company&#8217;s operations conducted outside the United States, see &#8220;A significant portion of the Company&#8217;s business is conducted outside of the United States. Many factors affecting business activities outside the United States could adversely impact this business&#8221; under Item 1A. Risk Factors , below.

Wholesale 

United States Wholesale 

The Company sells all of its brands in the U.S. wholesale market primarily to major jewelry store chains such as Sterling, Inc. and Helzberg Diamonds Corp.; department stores, such as Macy&#8217;s and Nordstrom; as well as independent jewelers. Sales to trade customers in the United States are made directly by the Company&#8217;s U.S. sales force and, to a lesser extent, independent sales representatives. Sales representatives are responsible for a defined geographic territory, generally specialize in a particular brand and sell to and service independent jewelers within their territory. The sales force also consists of account executives and account representatives who, respectively, sell to and service chain and department store accounts. 

&#160;

International Wholesale 

Internationally, the Company&#8217;s brands are sold in department stores, jewelry chains and independent jewelers. The Company employs its own international sales force operating at the Company&#8217;s sales and distribution offices in Canada, China, Germany, France, Hong Kong, Singapore, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates. In addition, the Company sells all of its brands through a network of independent distributors operating in numerous countries around the world. A majority of the Company&#8217;s arrangements with its international distributors are long-term, generally require certain minimum purchases and minimum advertising expenditures and impose restrictions on the distributor&#8217;s sale of competitive products. 

In France and Germany, the Company&#8217;s licensed brands were marketed and distributed by MGI-TWC SAS, a French corporation, and MGI-TWC GmbH, a German corporation, that are wholly-owned by MGI-TWC B.V., a Dutch company, of a joint venture company that was owned 51% by the Company and 49% by TWC, a French company with established distribution, marketing and sales operations in France and Germany. As of January 6, 2016, the Company acquired the remaining 49% interest from TWC and simultaneously terminated the joint venture agreement. Since that date, the Company has accounted for the Subsidiaries as wholly-owned entities. 

In the U.K., the Company distributes both its licensed brands as well as Movado and Ebel watches through MGS Distribution Limited (&#8220;MGS&#8221;), an English company in which the Company has a 90% ownership interest. The Company&#8217;s former joint venture partner in MGS, Swico Limited, also based in the U.K., continues to own the remaining 10% interest and provides MGS with logistical support and after-sales service. 

Retail 

The Company&#8217;s subsidiary, Movado Retail Group, Inc., operates 40 retail outlet locations in outlet centers across the United States, which serve as an effective vehicle to sell discontinued models and factory seconds of all of the Company&#8217;s watches. 

SEASONALITY 

The Company&#8217;s U.S. sales are traditionally greater during the Christmas and holiday season. Consequently, the Company&#8217;s net sales historically have been higher during the second half of its fiscal year. The amount of net sales and operating profit generated during the second half of each fiscal year depends upon the general level of retail sales during the Christmas and holiday season, as well as economic conditions and other factors beyond the Company&#8217;s control. Major selling seasons in certain international markets center on significant local holidays that occur in late winter or early spring. The second half of each fiscal year accounted for 55.3%, 54.9%, and 56.5% of the Company&#8217;s net sales for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. 

BACKLOG 

At March 24, 2016, the Company had unfilled orders of $50.3 million compared to $54.1 million at March 24, 2015 and $30.4 million at March 19, 2014. Unfilled orders include both confirmed orders and orders that the Company believes will be confirmed based on the historical experience with the customers. It is customary for many of the Company&#8217;s customers not to confirm their future orders with formal purchase orders until shortly before their desired delivery dates. 

CUSTOMER SERVICE, WARRANTY AND REPAIR 

The Company assists in the retail sales process of its wholesale customers by monitoring their sales and inventories by product category and style. The Company also assists in the conception, development and implementation of customers&#8217; marketing vehicles. The Company places considerable emphasis on cooperative advertising programs with its wholesale customers. The Company&#8217;s assistance in the retail sales process has resulted in close relationships with its principal customers, often allowing for influence on the mix, quantity and timing of their purchasing decisions. The Company believes that customers&#8217; familiarity with its sales approach has facilitated, and should continue to facilitate, the introduction of new products through its distribution network. 

The Company permits the return of damaged or defective products. In addition, although the Company generally has no obligation to do so, it accepts other returns from customers in certain instances. 

&#160;

The Company has service facilities around the world including five Company -owned service facilities and multiple independent service centers which are authorized to perform warranty repairs. A list of authorized service centers can be accessed online at www.mgiservice.com . In order to maintain consistency and quality at its serv ice facilities and authorized independent service centers, the Company conducts training sessions and distributes technical information and updates to repair personnel. All watches sold by the Company come with limited warranties covering the movement agai nst defects in material and workmanship for periods ranging from two to three years from the date of purchase, with the exception of Tommy Hilfiger watches, for which the warranty period is ten years. In addition, the warranty period is five years for the gold plating on certain Movado watch cases and bracelets. Products that are returned under warranty to the Company are generally serviced by the Company&#8217;s employees at its service facilities. 

The Company retains adequate levels of component parts to facilitate after-sales service of its watches for an extended period of time after the discontinuance of such watches. 

The Company makes available a web-based system at www.mgiservice.com providing immediate access for the Company&#8217;s retail partners to information they may want or need about after sales service issues. The website allows the Company&#8217;s retailers to track their repair status online 24 hours a day. The system also permits customers to authorize repairs, track repair status through the entire repair life cycle, view repair information and obtain service order history. 

SOURCING, PRODUCTION AND QUALITY 

The Company does not manufacture any of the products it sells. The Company employs a flexible manufacturing model that relies on independent manufacturers to meet shifts in marketplace demand and changes in consumer preferences. All product sources must achieve and maintain the Company&#8217;s high quality standards and specifications. With strong supply chain organizations in Switzerland, China and Hong Kong, the Company maintains control over the quality of its products, wherever they are manufactured. Compliance is monitored with strictly enforced quality control standards, including on-site quality inspections. 

A majority of the Swiss watch movements used in the manufacture of Movado, Ebel and Concord watches are purchased from two suppliers. The Company obtains other watch components for all of its brands, including movements, cases, hands, dials, bracelets and straps from a number of other suppliers. The Company does not have long-term supply commitments with any of its component parts suppliers. 

Movado (with the exception of Movado BOLD), Ebel and Concord watches are manufactured in Switzerland by independent third party assemblers. All Movado (with the exception of Movado BOLD), Ebel and Concord watches are manufactured using Swiss movements. Movado smart watches include connected technology developed by Fullpower Technologies, Inc. or HP Inc. All of the Company&#8217;s products are manufactured using components obtained from third party suppliers. A majority of Movado BOLD watches are manufactured by independent contractors in Asia using Swiss movements. Coach, Tommy Hilfiger, HUGO BOSS, Juicy Couture, Scuderia Ferrari and Lacoste watches are manufactured by independent contractors in Asia.

The Company actively seeks to protect and enforce its intellectual property rights by working with industry associations, anti-counterfeiting organizations, private investigators and law enforcement authorities, including customs authorities in the United States and internationally, and, when necessary, suing infringers of its trademarks and patents. Consequently, the Company is involved from time to time in litigation or other proceedings to determine the enforceability, scope and validity of these rights. With respect to the trademarks MOVADO &#174; , EBEL &#174; , CONCORD &#174; and certain other related trademarks, the Company has received exclusion orders that prohibit the importation of counterfeit goods or goods bearing confusingly similar trademarks into the United States and other countries. In accordance with customs regulations, these exclusion orders, however, do not cover the importation of genuine Movado, Ebel and Concord watches because the Company is considered the manufacturer of such watches. All of the Company&#8217;s exclusion orders are renewable. 

COMPETITION 

The markets for each of the Company&#8217;s watch brands are highly competitive. With the exception of Swatch Group, Ltd., a large Swiss-based competitor, no single company competes with the Company across all of its brands. Certain companies, however, compete with Movado Group with respect to one or more of its watch brands. Certain of these companies have, and other companies that may enter the Company&#8217;s markets in the future may have, greater financial, distribution, marketing and advertising resources than the Company. The Company&#8217;s future success will depend, to a significant degree, upon its continued ability to compete effectively with regard to, among other things, the style, quality, price, advertising, marketing, distribution and availability of supply of the Company&#8217;s watches and other products. 

EMPLOYEES 

As of January 31, 2016, the Company had approximately 1,100 full-time employees in its global operations. Approximately 210 Company employees in Switzerland and 13 Company employees in France are subject to collective bargaining agreements. The Company has never experienced a work stoppage due to labor difficulties and believes that its employee relations are good.
