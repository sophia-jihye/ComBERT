 ITEM 1. BUSINESS General 

Unisys Corporation is a global information technology (&#147;IT&#148;) company. We work with many of the world&#146;s largest companies and government organizations to solve their most pressing IT and business challenges. We specialize in providing integrated, leading-edge solutions to clients in the government, financial services and commercial markets. Our offerings include cloud and infrastructure services, application services, security solutions and high-end server technology. We have more than 20,000 employees serving clients around the world. 

We operate in two business segments &#150; Services and Technology. Financial information concerning the two segments can be found in Note 15, &#147;Segment information,&#148; of the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing in our annual report to stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2015 (the &#147;Unisys 2015 Annual Report to Stockholders&#148;), and such information is incorporated herein by reference. 

Principal Products and Services 

In our Services segment, we provide services to help our clients improve their competitiveness, security and cost efficiency. Our services include cloud and infrastructure services, application services and business process outsourcing services. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; In cloud and infrastructure services, we help clients apply cloud and as-a-service delivery models to capitalize on business opportunities, make their end users more productive and more cost-effectively manage and secure their IT infrastructure and operations. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; In application services, we help clients transform their business processes by providing advanced solutions for select industries, developing and managing new leading-edge applications and modernizing existing enterprise applications. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; In business process outsourcing services, we assume management of critical processes and functions for clients in target industries, helping them improve performance and reduce costs. 

In our Technology segment, we design and develop software, servers and related products to help clients reduce costs, improve security and flexibility, and improve the efficiency of their data center environments. As a pioneer in large-scale computing, Unisys offers deep experience and rich technological capabilities in transaction-intensive, mission-critical environments. We provide a range of data center, infrastructure management and cloud computing offerings to help clients virtualize and automate their data-center environments. Product offerings include enterprise-class servers, such as the ClearPath Forward&#153; family of fabric servers, the Unisys Stealth&#153; family of security software, and operating system software and middleware. 

The primary vertical markets Unisys serves worldwide are government (comprising the U.S. federal government and other public sector organizations globally), commercial and financial services. 

We market our products and services primarily through a direct sales force. In certain foreign countries, we market primarily through distributors. Complementing our direct sales force, we make use of a select group of resellers and alliance partners to market our services and product portfolio. 

&#160; 

Materials 

Unisys purchases components and supplies from a number of suppliers around the world. For certain technology products, we rely on a single or limited number of suppliers, although we make every effort to assure that alternative sources are available if the need arises. The failure of our suppliers to deliver components and supplies in sufficient quantities and in a timely manner could adversely affect our business. 

Patents, Trademarks and Licenses 

Unisys owns over 920 active U.S. patents and over 80 active patents granted in eleven non-U.S. jurisdictions. These patents cover systems and methods related to a wide variety of technologies, including, but not limited to, computing systems, relational database management, information storage, device/circuit manufacture and design, imaging, data compression and document recognition/handling. We have granted licenses covering both single patents, and particular groups of patents, to others. Likewise, we have active licensing agreements granting us rights under patents owned by other entities. However, our business is not materially dependent upon any single patent, patent license, or related group thereof. 

Unisys also maintains 25 U.S. trademark and service mark registrations, and over 710 additional trademark and service mark registrations in over 100 non-U.S. jurisdictions. These marks are valuable assets used on or in connection with our products and services, and as such are actively monitored, policed and protected by Unisys and its agents. 

Seasonality 

Our revenue is affected by such factors as the introduction of new products and services, the length of sales cycles and the seasonality of purchases. Seasonality has generally resulted in higher fourth quarter revenues than in other quarters. 

Customers 

No single client accounts for more than 10% of our revenue. Sales of commercial products and services to various agencies of the U.S. government represented approximately 19% of total consolidated revenue in 2015. For more information on the risks associated with contracting with governmental entities, see &#147;Factors that may affect future results&#148; in &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#148; in the Unisys 2015 Annual Report to Stockholders which is incorporated herein by reference. 

Backlog 

In the Services segment, firm order backlog at December 31, 2015 was $4.3 billion, compared to $4.8 billion at December 31, 2014. Approximately $1.8 billion (42%) of 2015 backlog is expected to be filled in 2016. Although we believe that this backlog is firm, we may, for commercial reasons, allow the orders to be cancelled, with or without penalty. In addition, funded government contracts included in this backlog are generally subject to termination, in whole or part, at the convenience of the government or if funding becomes unavailable. In such cases, we are generally entitled to receive payment for work completed plus allowable termination or cancellation costs. 

Because of the relatively short cycle between order and shipment in our Technology segment, we believe that backlog information for this segment is not material to the understanding of our business. 

Competition 

Our business is affected by rapid change in technology in the information services and technology industries and aggressive competition from many domestic and foreign companies. Principal competitors 

&#160; 

are systems integrators, consulting and other professional services firms, outsourcing providers, infrastructure services providers, computer hardware manufacturers and software providers. We compete primarily on the basis of service, product performance, technological innovation, and price. We believe that our continued focused investment in engineering and research and development, coupled with our sales and marketing capabilities, will have a favorable impact on our competitive position. For more information on the competitive risks we face, see &#147;Factors that may affect future results&#148; in &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#148; in the Unisys 2015 Annual Report to Stockholders which is incorporated herein by reference. 

Research and Development 

Unisys-sponsored research and development costs were $76.4 million in 2015, $68.8 million in 2014, and $69.5 million in 2013. 

Environmental Matters 

Our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position have not been materially affected by compliance with federal, state and local laws regulating the protection of the environment. Capital expenditures for environmental control facilities are not expected to be material in 2016 and 2017. 

Employees 

At December 31, 2015, we employed approximately 23,000 employees serving clients around the world. 

International and Domestic Operations 

Financial information by geographic area is set forth in Note 15, &#147;Segment information&#148;, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in the Unisys 2015 Annual Report to Stockholders, and such information is incorporated herein by reference. For more information on the risks of doing business internationally, see &#147;Factors that may affect future results&#148; in &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#148; in the Unisys 2015 Annual Report to Stockholders which is incorporated herein by reference.
