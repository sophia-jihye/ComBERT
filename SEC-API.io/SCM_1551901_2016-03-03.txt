 Item 1. Business Except as otherwise indicated, the terms &#147;we,&#148; &#147;us,&#148; &#147;our,&#148; and the &#147;Company&#148; refer to Stellus Capital Investment Corporation; and &#147;Stellus Capital Management&#148; refers to our investment adviser and administrator, Stellus Capital Management, LLC. 

General We are an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected and qualified to be regulated as a business development company, or &#147;BDC&#148;, under the Investment Company Act of 1940, or the &#147;1940 Act.&#148; We originate and invest primarily in private middle-market companies (typically those with $5.0 million to $50.0 million of EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization)) through first lien, second lien, unitranche and mezzanine debt financing, with corresponding equity co-investments. Unitranche debt is typically structured as first lien loans with certain risk characteristics of mezzanine debt. Mezzanine debt includes senior unsecured and subordinated loans. 

Our investment activities are managed by our investment adviser, Stellus Capital Management, an investment advisory firm led by Robert T. Ladd and other senior investment professionals. We source investments primarily through the extensive network of relationships that the principals of Stellus Capital Management have developed with financial sponsor firms, financial institutions, middle-market companies, management teams and other professional intermediaries. The companies in which we invest are typically highly leveraged, and, in most cases, our investments in such companies will not be rated by national rating agencies. If such investments were rated, we believe that they would likely receive a rating which is often referred to as &#147;junk.&#148; 

Our investment objective is to maximize the total return to our stockholders in the form of current income and capital appreciation. We seek to achieve our investment objective by: 

&#149; accessing the extensive origination channels that have been developed and established by the Stellus Capital Management investment team that include long-standing relationships with private equity firms, commercial banks, investment banks and other financial services firms; &#149; investing in what we believe to be companies with strong business fundamentals, generally within our core middle-market company focus; &#149; focusing on a variety of industry sectors, including business services, energy, general industrial, government services, healthcare, software and specialty finance; &#149; focusing primarily on directly originated transactions; &#149; applying the disciplined underwriting standards that the Stellus Capital Management investment team has developed over their extensive investing careers; and &#149; capitalizing upon the experience and resources of the Stellus Capital Management investment team to monitor our investments. In addition, we received exemptive relief from the SEC to co-invest with investment funds managed by Stellus Capital Management where doing so is consistent with our investment strategy as well as applicable law (including the terms and conditions of the exemptive order issued by the SEC). Under the terms of the relief permitting us to co-invest with other funds managed by Stellus Capital Management, a &#147;required majority&#148; (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of our independent directors must make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including (1) the terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our stockholders and do not involve overreaching of us or our stockholders on the part of any person concerned and (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of our stockholders and is consistent with our investment objectives and strategies. We intend to co-invest, subject to the conditions included in the exemptive order we received from the SEC, with private credit funds managed by Stellus Capital Management that have an investment strategy that is identical to our investment strategy. We believe that such co-investments may afford us additional investment opportunities and an ability to achieve greater diversification. 

&#160;

&#160;

As a BDC, we are required to comply with regulatory requirements, including limitations on our use of debt. We are permitted to, and expect to continue to, finance our investments through borrowings. However, as a BDC, we are only generally allowed to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 200% after such borrowing. The amount of leverage that we employ will depend on our assessment of market conditions and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing, such as the maturity, covenant package and rate structure of the proposed borrowings, our ability to raise funds through the issuance of our securities and the risks of such borrowings within the context of our investment outlook. Ultimately, we only intend to use leverage if the expected returns from borrowing to make investments will exceed the cost of such borrowings. 

We have elected and qualified to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a regulated investment company, or &#147;RIC,&#148; under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code, or the Code. As a RIC, we generally will not have to pay corporate-level federal income taxes on any net ordinary income or capital gains that we distribute to our stockholders if we meet certain source-of-income, distribution and asset diversification requirements.

Portfolio Composition The following table provides a summary of our portfolio investments as of December 31, 2015: 

&#160; &#160; As of December 31, 2015 ($ in millions) Number of investments &#160; &#160; 39 &#160; Fair value &#040;a&#041; &#160; $ 349.0 &#160; Cost &#160; $ 364.2 &#160; % of portfolio at fair value &#150; first lien debt &#160; &#160; 38 %&#160; % of portfolio at fair value &#150; second lien debt &#160; &#160; 38 %&#160; % of portfolio at fair value &#150; mezzanine debt &#160; &#160; 20 %&#160; % of portfolio at fair value &#150; equity &#160; &#160; 4 %&#160; Weighted-average annual yield &#040;b&#041; &#160; &#160; 10.6 %&#160; 

(a) As of December 31, 2015, $252.8 million of our debt investments at fair value were at floating interest rates (subject to interest rate floors), which represented approximately 75% of our total portfolio of debt investments at fair value. As of December 31, 2015, $83.3 million of our debt investments at fair value were at fixed interest rates, which represented approximately 25% of our total portfolio of debt investments at fair value. (b) The weighted average yield on all of our debt investments as of December 31, 2015, was approximately 10.6%, of which approximately 10.1% was current cash interest. The weighted average yield of our debt investments is not the same as a return on investment for our stockholders but, rather, relates to a portion of our investment portfolio and is calculated before the payment of all of our and our subsidiaries&#146; fees and expenses. The weighted average yield was computed using the effective interest rates for all of our debt investments, which represents the interest rate on our debt investment restated as an interest rate payable annually in arrears and is computed including cash and payment in kind, or PIK interest, as well as accretion of original issue discount. There can be no assurance that the weighted average yield will remain at their current level. Our investments generally range in size from $5 million to $30 million, and we may also selectively invest in larger positions, and we generally expect that the size of our positions will increase in proportion to the size of our capital base. Pending such investments, we may reduce our outstanding indebtedness or invest in cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and other high-quality debt investments with a maturity of one year or less. In the future, we may adjust opportunistically the percentage of our assets held in various 

&#160;

&#160;

types of loans, our principal loan sources and the industries to which we have greatest exposure, based on market conditions, the credit cycle, available financing and our desired risk/return profile. 

Stellus Capital Management Stellus Capital Management manages our investment activities and is responsible for analyzing investment opportunities, conducting research and performing due diligence on potential investments, negotiating and structuring our investments, originating prospective investments and monitoring our investments and portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. 

The senior investment professionals of Stellus Capital Management have an average of over 26 years of investing, corporate finance, restructuring, consulting and accounting experience and have worked together at several companies. The Stellus Capital Management investment team has a wide range of experience in middle-market investing, including originating, structuring and managing loans and debt securities through market cycles. The Stellus Capital Management investment team continues to provide investment sub-advisory services to D. E. Shaw &#38; Co., L.P. and its associated investment funds (the &#147;D. E. Shaw group&#148;) with respect to an approximately $250 million investment portfolio (as of December 31, 2015) in middle-market companies pursuant to sub-advisory arrangements. 

In addition to serving as our investment adviser and the sub-advisor to the D. E. Shaw group as noted above, Stellus Capital Management currently manages a private credit fund that has an investment strategy that is identical to our investment strategy and energy private equity funds. We received exemptive relief from the SEC to co-invest with investment funds managed by Stellus Capital Management (other than the D. E. Shaw group funds) where doing so is consistent with our investment strategy as well as applicable law (including the terms and conditions of the exemptive order issued by the SEC). We believe that such co-investments may afford us additional investment opportunities and an ability to achieve greater diversification. We will not co-invest with the energy private equity funds, as the energy private equity funds focus on predominantly equity-related investments, and we focus on predominantly credit-related investments. 

Stellus Capital Management is headquartered in Houston, Texas, and also maintains an office in the Washington, D.C. area. 

Market Opportunity We originate and invest primarily in private middle-market companies through first lien, second lien, unitranche and mezzanine debt financing, often times with a corresponding equity investment. We believe the environment for investing in middle-market companies is attractive for several reasons, including: 

Robust Demand for Debt Capital. We believe that private equity firms have significant committed but uncalled capital, a large portion of which is still available for investment in the United States. We expect the large amount of uninvested capital commitments will drive buyout activity over the next several years, which should, in turn, create lending opportunities for us. 

Reduced Availability of Capital for Middle-Market Companies. We believe there are fewer providers of, and less capital available for financing to middle-market companies, as compared to the time period prior to the recent economic downturn. We believe that, as a result of that downturn, many financing providers have chosen to focus on large, liquid corporate loans and managing capital markets transactions rather than lending to middle-market businesses. In addition, we believe recent regulatory changes, including the adoption of the Dodd-Frank Act and the introduction of the international capital and liquidity requirements under the Basel III Accords, or &#147;Basel III,&#148; have caused banks to curtail their lending to middle-market-companies. As a result, we believe that less competition will facilitate higher quality deal flow and allow for greater selectivity throughout the investment process. 

Attractive Deal Pricing and Structures. We believe that the pricing of middle-market debt investments is higher, and the terms of such investments are more conservative, compared to larger liquid, public debt financings, due to the more limited universe of lenders as well as the highly negotiated nature of these financings. These transactions tend to offer stronger covenant packages, higher interest rates, lower leverage levels and better call protection compared to larger financings. In addition, middle-market loans typically offer other investor protections such as default penalties, lien protection, change of control provisions and information rights for lenders. 

&#160;

&#160;

Specialized Lending Requirements. Lending to middle-market companies requires in-depth diligence, credit expertise, restructuring experience and active portfolio management. We believe that several factors render many U.S. financial institutions ill-suited to lend to middle-market companies. For example, based on the experience of Stellus Capital Management&#146;s investment team, lending to middle-market companies in the United States (a) is generally more labor intensive than lending to larger companies due to the smaller size of each investment and the fragmented nature of the information available with respect to such companies, (b) requires specialized due diligence and underwriting capabilities, and (c) may also require more extensive ongoing monitoring by the lender. We believe that, through Stellus Capital Management, we have the experience and expertise to meet these specialized lending requirements. 

Competitive Strengths We believe that the following competitive strengths will allow us to achieve positive returns for our investors: 

Experienced Investment Team. Through our investment adviser, Stellus Capital Management, we have access to the experience and expertise of the Stellus Capital Management investment team, including its senior investment professionals who have an average of over 26 years of investing, corporate finance, restructuring, consulting and accounting experience and have worked together at several companies. The Stellus Capital Management investment team has a wide range of experience in middle-market investing, including originating, structuring and managing loans and debt securities through market cycles. We believe the members of Stellus Capital Management&#146;s investment team are proven and experienced, with extensive capabilities in leveraged credit investing, having participated in these markets for the predominant portion of their careers. We believe that the experience and demonstrated ability of the Stellus Capital Management investment team to complete transactions enhances the quantity and quality of investment opportunities available to us. 

Established, Rigorous Investment and Monitoring Process. The Stellus Capital Management investment team has developed an extensive review and credit analysis process. Each investment that is reviewed by Stellus Capital Management is brought through a structured, multi-stage approval process. In addition, Stellus Capital Management takes an active approach in monitoring all investments, including reviews of financial performance on at least a quarterly basis and regular discussions with management. Stellus Capital Management&#146;s investment and monitoring process and the depth and experience of its investment team should allow it to conduct the type of due diligence and monitoring that enables it to identify and evaluate risks and opportunities. 

Demonstrated Ability to Structure Investments Creatively. Stellus Capital Management has the expertise and ability to structure investments across all levels of a company&#146;s capital structure. While at the D. E. Shaw group, the Stellus Capital Management investment team invested approximately $5.4 billion across the entire capital structure in 193 middle-market companies. These investments included secured and unsecured debt and related equity securities. Furthermore, we believe that current market conditions will allow us to structure attractively priced debt investments and may allow us to incorporate other return-enhancing mechanisms such as commitment fees, original issue discounts, early redemption premiums, payment-in-kind, or &#147;PIK,&#148; interest or some form of equity securities. 

Resources of Stellus Capital Management Platform . We have access to the resources and capabilities of Stellus Capital Management, which has 18 investment professionals, including Messrs. Ladd, Dean D&#146;Angelo, Joshua T. Davis and Todd A. Overbergen, who are supported by five managing directors, one principal, four vice presidents and three analysts. These individuals have developed long-term relationships with middle-market companies, management teams, financial sponsors, lending institutions and deal intermediaries by providing flexible financing throughout the capital structure. We believe that these relationships provide us with a competitive advantage in identifying investment opportunities in our target market. We also expect to benefit from Stellus Capital Management&#146;s due diligence, credit analysis, origination and transaction execution experience and capabilities, including the support provided with respect to those functions by Mr. W. Todd Huskinson, who serves as our chief financial officer and chief compliance officer, and his staff of five additional mid- and back-office professionals. 

&#160;

&#160;

Investment Strategy The Stellus Capital Management investment team employs an opportunistic and flexible investing approach, combined with strong risk management processes, which we believe will yield a highly diversified portfolio across companies, industries, and investment types. We seek direct origination opportunities of first lien, second lien, unitranche and mezzanine debt financing, often times with modest corresponding equity investments, in middle-market companies. We believe that businesses in this size range often have limited access to public financial markets, and will benefit from Stellus Capital Management&#146;s reliable lending partnership. Many financing providers have chosen to focus on large corporate clients and managing capital markets transactions rather than lending to middle-market businesses. Further, many financial institutions and traditional lenders are faced with constrained balance sheets and are requiring existing borrowers to reduce leverage. 

With an average of over 26 years of investing, corporate finance, restructuring, consulting and accounting experience, the senior investment team of Stellus Capital Management has demonstrated investment expertise throughout the balance sheet and in a variety of situations, including financial sponsor buyouts, growth capital, debt refinancings, balance sheet recapitalizations, rescue financings, distressed opportunities, and acquisition financings. Our investment philosophy emphasizes capital preservation through superior credit selection and risk mitigation. We expect our portfolio to provide downside protection through conservative cash flow and asset coverage requirements, priority in the capital structure and information requirements. We also anticipate benefiting from equity participation through warrants and other equity instruments structured as part of our investments. This flexible approach enables Stellus Capital Management to respond to market conditions and offer customized lending solutions. 

Stellus Capital Management invests across a wide range of industries with deep expertise in select verticals including, but not limited to, business services, retail, general industrial, government services, healthcare, software and specialty finance. Our typical transactions include providing financing for leveraged buyouts, acquisitions, recapitalizations, growth opportunities, rescue financings, distressed or turnaround situations and bridge loans. We seek to maintain a diversified portfolio of investments as a method to manage risk and capitalize on specific sector trends. In addition, we intend to co-invest with private credit funds managed by Stellus Capital Management that have an identical investment strategy as us and where doing so is consistent with conditions of the exemptive order issued by the SEC. 

Our objective is to act as the lead or largest investor in transactions, generally investing between $5 million and $30 million per transaction. We expect the average investment holding period to be between two and four years, depending upon portfolio company objectives and conditions in the capital markets. 

We focus on middle-market companies with between $5 million and $50 million of EBITDA in a variety of industry sectors with positive long-term dynamics and dependable cash flows. We seek businesses with management teams with demonstrated track records and economic incentives in strong franchises and sustainable competitive advantages with dependable and predictable cash flows. 

We employ leverage prudently and within the limitations of the applicable laws and regulations for BDCs. Any decision on our part to use leverage will depend upon our assessment of the attractiveness of available investment opportunities in relation to the costs and perceived risks of such leverage. 

Transaction Sourcing As access to investment opportunities is highly relationship-driven, the senior investment team and other investment professionals of Stellus Capital Management spend considerable time developing and maintaining contacts with key deal sources, including private equity firms, investment banks and senior lenders. The senior investment team and other investment professionals of Stellus Capital Management have been actively investing in the middle-market for the past decade and have focused on extensive calling and marketing efforts via speaking engagements, sponsorships, industry events and referrals to broaden their relationship network. Existing relationships are constantly cultivated through transactional work and other personal contacts. 

In addition to financial sponsors, Stellus Capital Management has developed a network of other deal sources, including: 

&#160;

&#160;

&#149; management teams and entrepreneurs; &#149; portfolio companies of private equity firms; &#149; other investment firms that have similar strategies to Stellus Capital Management and are seeking co-investors; &#149; placement agents and investment banks representing financial sponsors and issuers; &#149; corporate operating advisers and other financial advisers; and &#149; consultants, attorneys and other service providers to middle-market companies and financial sponsors. We believe that Stellus Capital Management&#146;s broad network of deal origination contacts will afford us with a continuous source of investment opportunities. 

These origination relationships provide access not only to potential investment opportunities but also to market intelligence on trends across the credit markets. Since inception, Stellus Capital Management has completed financing transactions with more than 128 equity sponsors and completed multiple financing transactions with 29 of those equity sponsors. 

We believe that, over the past decade, the senior investment team and other investment professionals of Stellus Capital Management have built a reputation as a thoughtful and disciplined provider of capital to middle-market companies and a preferred financing source for private equity sponsors and management teams. We believe these factors give Stellus Capital Management a competitive advantage in sourcing investment opportunities, which are put to use for our benefit. 

Investment Structuring Stellus Capital Management believes that each investment has unique characteristics that must be considered, understood and analyzed. Stellus Capital Management structures investment terms based on the business, the credit profile, the outlook for the industry in which a potential portfolio company operates, the competitive landscape, the products or services which the company sells and the management team and ownership of the company, among other factors. Stellus Capital Management relies upon the analysis conducted and information gathered through the investment process to evaluate the appropriate structure for our investments. 

We invest primarily in the debt securities of middle-market companies. Our investments typically carry a high level of cash pay interest and may incorporate other return-enhancing mechanisms such as commitment fees, original issue discounts, early redemption premiums, PIK interest and some form of equity participation, including preferred stock, common stock, warrants and other forms of equity participation. We expect that a typical debt investment in which we invest will have a term at origination of between five and seven years. We expect to hold most of our investments to maturity or repayment, but we may sell some of our investments earlier if a liquidity event occurs, such as a sale, recapitalization or worsening of the credit quality of the portfolio company. 

Stellus Capital Management negotiates covenants in connection with debt investments that provide protection for us but allow appropriate flexibility for the portfolio company. Such covenants may include affirmative and negative covenants, default penalties, lien protection and change of control provisions. Stellus Capital Management requires comprehensive information rights including access to management, financial statements and budgets and, in some cases, membership on the board of directors or board of directors observation rights. Additionally, Stellus Capital Management generally requires financial covenants and terms that restrict an issuer&#146;s use of leverage and limitations on asset sales and capital expenditures. 

Secured Debt Secured debt, including first lien, second lien and unitranche financing, has liens on the assets of the borrower that serve as collateral in support of the repayment of such loans. 

&#160;

&#160;

First Lien Debt . First lien debt is structured with first-priority liens on the assets of the borrower that serve as collateral in support of the repayment of such loans. First lien loans may provide for moderate loan amortization in the early years of the loan, with the majority of the amortization deferred until loan maturity. 

Second Lien Debt . Second lien debt is structured as junior, secured loans, with second priority liens on an issuer&#146;s assets. These loans typically provide for moderate loan amortization in the initial years of the loan, with the majority of the amortization deferred until loan maturity. 

Unitranche Debt . Unitranche debt typically is structured as first lien loans with certain risk characteristics of second lien debt. Unitranche debt typically provides for moderate loan amortization in the initial years of the debt, with the majority of the principal payment deferred until loan maturity. Since unitranche debt generally allows the borrower to make a large lump sum payment of principal at the end of the loan term, there is a risk of loss if the borrower is unable to pay the lump sum or refinance the amount owed at maturity. In some cases, we will be the sole lender, or we together with our affiliates will be the sole lender, of unitranche debt, which can provide us with more influence interacting with a borrower in terms of monitoring and, if necessary, remediation in the event of underperformance. 

Mezzanine Debt Mezzanine debt, including senior unsecured and subordinated loans, is not secured by any collateral and is effectively subordinated to the borrower&#146;s secured indebtedness (to the extent of the collateral securing such indebtedness), including pursuant to one or more intercreditor agreements that we enter into with holders of a borrower&#146;s senior debt. 

Senior Unsecured Loans . Senior unsecured loans are structured as loans that rank senior in right of payment to any of the borrower&#146;s unsecured indebtedness that is contractually subordinated to such loans. These loans generally provide for fixed interest rates and amortize evenly over the term of the loan. Senior unsecured loans are generally less volatile than subordinated loans due to their priority over subordinated loans. 

Subordinated Loans . Subordinated loans are structured as unsecured, subordinated loans that provide for relatively high, fixed interest rates that provide us with significant current interest income. These loans typically have interest-only payments (often representing a combination of cash pay and PIK interest) in the early years, with amortization of principal deferred to maturity. Subordinated loans generally allow the borrower to make a large lump sum payment of principal at the end of the loan term, and there is a risk of loss if the borrower is unable to pay the lump sum or refinance the amount owed at maturity. Subordinated loans are generally more volatile than secured loans and senior unsecured loans and may involve a greater risk of loss of principal as compared to other types of loans. Subordinated loans often include a PIK feature, which effectively operates as negative amortization of loan principal, thereby increasing credit risk exposure over the life of the loan. 

Equity Securities In connection with some of our debt investments, we may also invest in preferred or common stock or receive nominally priced warrants or options to buy an equity interest in the portfolio company. As a result, as a portfolio company appreciates in value, we may achieve additional investment return from this equity interest. We may structure such equity investments and warrants to include provisions protecting our rights as a minority-interest holder, as well as a &#147;put,&#148; or right to sell such securities back to the issuer, upon the occurrence of specified events. In many cases, we may also seek to obtain registration rights in connection with these equity interests, which may include demand and &#147;piggyback&#148; registration rights. 

Investment Process Through the resources of Stellus Capital Management, we have access to significant research resources, experienced investment professionals, internal information systems and a credit analysis framework and investment process. Stellus Capital Management has designed a highly involved and interactive investment management process, which is the core of its culture and the basis for what we believe is a strong track record of investment returns. The investment process seeks to select only those investments which it believes have the most attractive risk/reward characteristics. The process involves several levels of review and is 

&#160;

&#160;

coordinated in an effort to identify risks in potential investments. Stellus Capital Management applies its expertise to screen our investment opportunities as described below. This rigorous process, combined with our broad origination capabilities, has allowed the Stellus Capital Management team to be prudent in selecting opportunities in which to make an investment. 

All potential investment opportunities undergo an initial informal review by Stellus Capital Management&#146;s investment professionals. Each potential investment opportunity that an investment professional determines merits consideration is presented and evaluated at a weekly meeting in which Stellus Capital Management&#146;s investment professionals discuss the merits and risks of a potential investment opportunity as well as the due diligence process and the pricing and structure. If Stellus Capital Management&#146;s investment professionals believe an investment opportunity merits further review, the deal team prepares and presents to the investment committee for initial review a prescreen memorandum that generally describes the potential transaction and includes a description of the risks, due diligence process and proposed structure and pricing for the proposed investment opportunity. 

Prior to making an investment, Stellus Capital Management conducts rigorous diligence on each investment opportunity. In connection with its due diligence on a potential investment opportunity, Stellus Capital Management utilizes its internal diligence resources which include its internally developed credit analytical framework, subscriptions to third party research resources, discussions with industry experts, internal information sharing systems and the analytical expertise of its investment professionals. Stellus Capital Management typically reviews the company&#146;s historical financials; industry drivers and outlook, competitive threats, customer concentration, asset coverage, projected financials and credit metrics; management background checks; and, if applicable, the track record and funding capabilities of the private equity sponsor. 

Upon review of the prescreen memorandum, if the investment committee determines to proceed with the review of an investment opportunity, the deal team continues its diligence and deal structuring plans, and prepares a credit approval memorandum for review by the investment committee. The credit approval memorandum, updates the prescreen memorandum with more deal specific detail, including an update to the diligence process and any changes in the structure and pricing of the proposed investment. Upon unanimous approval by the investment committee of the proposed investment as presented in the credit approval memorandum, Stellus Capital Management&#146;s Chief Investment Officer reviews any amendments before finalizing and closing negotiations with the prospective portfolio company. 

Investment Committee Each new investment opportunity is unanimously approved by Stellus Capital Management&#146;s investment committee. Follow-on investments in existing portfolio companies require the investment committee&#146;s approval beyond that obtained when the initial investment in the company was made. The purpose of Stellus Capital Management&#146;s investment committee is to evaluate and approve all of our investments, subject at all times to the oversight and approval of our board of directors. The investment committee process is intended to bring the diverse experience and perspectives of the committee&#146;s members to the analysis and consideration of each investment. The investment committee consists of Robert T. Ladd, Dean D&#146;Angelo, Joshua T. Davis, Todd A. Overbergen and W. Todd Huskinson. The investment committee serves to provide investment consistency and adherence to our core investment philosophy and policies. The investment committee also determines appropriate investment sizing and suggests ongoing monitoring requirements. 

In addition to reviewing investments, investment committee meetings serve as a forum to discuss credit views and outlooks. Potential transactions and deal flow are reviewed on a regular basis. Members of the investment team are encouraged to share information and views on credits with the investment committee early in their analysis. We believe this process improves the quality of the analysis and assists the deal team members to work more efficiently. 

Each transaction is presented to the investment committee in a formal written report. All of our new investments require unanimous approval by the investment committee. Each member of the investment committee performs a similar role for other accounts managed by Stellus Capital Management. In certain instances, including in connection with co-investments under our exemptive order, our board of directors may also determine that its approval is required prior to the making of an investment. 

&#160;

&#160;

Monitoring Investments In most cases, we do not have board influence over portfolio companies. In some instances, Stellus Capital Management&#146;s investment professionals may obtain board representation or observation rights in conjunction with our investments. Stellus Capital Management takes an active approach in monitoring all investments, including reviews of financial performance on at least a quarterly basis and regular discussions with management. The monitoring process begins with structuring terms and conditions, which require the timely delivery and access to critical financial and business information on portfolio companies. 

Specifically, Stellus Capital Management&#146;s monitoring system consists of the following activities: 

Regular Investment Committee Updates . Key portfolio company developments are discussed each week as part of the standard investment committee agenda. 

Written Reports . The deal teams provide written updates as appropriate for key events that impact portfolio company performance or valuation. In addition, deal teams provide written updates following each portfolio company board meeting. 

Quarterly Full Portfolio Review . Stellus Capital Management&#146;s Chief Investment Officer and our Chief Compliance Officer perform a quarterly comprehensive review of every portfolio company with the deal teams. This process includes a written performance and valuation update, and credit-specific discussion on each of our portfolio companies. In addition, pursuant to our valuation policy, quarterly valuations are reviewed by our independent third party valuation firm. 

As part of the monitoring process, Stellus Capital Management also tracks developments in the broader marketplace. Stellus Capital Management&#146;s investment professionals have a wealth of information on the competitive landscape, industry trends, relative valuation metrics, and analyses that assist in the execution of our investment strategy. In addition, Stellus Capital Management&#146;s extensive communications with brokers and dealers allows its investment professionals to monitor market and industry trends that could affect portfolio investments. Stellus Capital Management may provide ongoing strategic, financial and operational guidance to some portfolio companies either directly or by recommending its investment professionals or other experienced representatives to participate on the board of directors. Stellus Capital Management maintains an extensive network of strategic and operational advisers to call upon for industry expertise or to supplement existing management teams. 

Asset Quality In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, Stellus Capital Management uses an investment ranking system to characterize and monitor the credit profile and expected level of returns on each investment in our portfolio. This investment ranking system uses a five-level numeric scale. The following is a description of the conditions associated with each investment category: 

Investment Category 1 is used for investments that are performing above expectations, and whose risks remain favorable compared to the expected risk at the time of the original investment. 

Investment Category 2 is used for investments that are performing within expectations and whose risks remain neutral compared to the expected risk at the time of the original investment. All new loans are initially rated 2. 

Investment Category 3 is used for investments that are performing below expectations and that require closer monitoring, but where no loss of return or principal is expected. Portfolio companies with a rating of 3 may be out of compliance with financial covenants. 

Investment Category 4 is used for investments that are performing substantially below expectations and whose risks have increased substantially since the original investment. These investments are often in work out. Investments with a rating of 4 are those for which some loss of contractual return but no loss of principal is expected. 

Investment Category 5 is used for investments that are performing substantially below expectations and whose risks have increased substantially since the original investment. These investments are almost always in work out. Investments with a rating of 5 are those for which some loss of return and principal is expected. 

&#160;

&#160;

In the event that Stellus Capital Management determines that an investment is underperforming, or circumstances suggest that the risk associated with a particular investment has significantly increased, Stellus Capital Management will increase its monitoring intensity and prepare regular updates for the investment committee, summarizing current operating results and material impending events and suggesting recommended actions. While the investment ranking system identifies the relative risk for each investment, the ranking alone does not dictate the scope and/or frequency of any monitoring that is performed. The frequency of Stellus Capital Management&#146;s monitoring of an investment is determined by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the trends in the financial performance of the portfolio company, the investment structure and the type of collateral securing the investment. 

Determination of Net Asset Value and Portfolio Valuation Process The net asset value per share of our outstanding shares of common stock is determined quarterly by dividing the value of total assets minus liabilities by the total number of shares outstanding. 

In calculating the value of our total assets, investment transactions will be recorded on the trade date. Realized gains or losses will be computed using the specific identification method. Investments for which market quotations are readily available are valued at such market quotations. Debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market price is not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors based on the input of our management and audit committee. In addition, our board of directors retains one or more independent valuation firms to review at least twice annually, the valuation of each portfolio investment for which a market quotation is not readily available. We also have adopted Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , or &#147;ASC 820.&#148; This accounting statement requires us to assume that the portfolio investment is assumed to be sold in the principal market to market participants, or in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market, which may be a hypothetical market. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact. In accordance with ASC 820, the market in which we can exit portfolio investments with the greatest volume and level activity is considered our principal market. 

A readily available market value is not expected to exist for most of the investments in our portfolio, and we value these portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors under our valuation policy and process. The types of factors that our board of directors may take into account in determining the fair value of our investments generally include, as appropriate, comparisons of financial ratios portfolio company to peer companies that are public, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company&#146;s ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, and other relevant factors. 

When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, we consider the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate our valuation. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the investments may differ materially from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments. In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different from the valuations currently assigned. 

With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, our board of directors undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below: 

&#149; our quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the investment professionals of Stellus Capital Management responsible for the portfolio investment; &#149; preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with our senior management and Stellus Capital Management; &#149; at least twice annually, the valuation for each portfolio investment is reviewed by an independent valuation firm; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#149; the audit committee of our board of directors then reviews these preliminary valuations and makes a recommendation to our board of directors; and &#149; the audit committee of our board of directors then reviews these preliminary valuations; &#149; the board of directors then discusses the valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith, based on the input of Stellus Capital Management, the independent valuation firm and the audit committee. In following these approaches, the types of factors that are taken into account in fair value pricing our investments include, as relevant, but are not limited to: 

&#149; available current market data, including relevant and applicable market trading and transaction comparables; &#149; applicable market yields and multiples; &#149; security covenants; &#149; call protection provisions; &#149; information rights; &#149; the nature and realizable value of any collateral; &#149; the portfolio company&#146;s ability to make payments, its earnings and discounted cash flows and the markets in which it does business; &#149; comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public; &#149; comparable merger and acquisition transactions; and &#149; the principal market and enterprise values. Realization of Investments The potential exit scenarios of a portfolio company play an important role in evaluating investment decisions. As such, Stellus Capital Management formulates specific exit strategies at the time of investment. Our debt-orientation provides for increased potential exit opportunities, including (a) the sale of investments in the private markets, (b) the refinancing of investments held, often due to maturity or recapitalizations, and (c) other liquidity events including the sale or merger of the portfolio company. Since we seek to maintain a debt orientation in our investments, we expect to receive interest income over the course of the investment period, resulting in a significant return on invested capital well in advance of final exit. 

Derivatives We may utilize hedging techniques such as interest rate swaps to mitigate potential interest rate risk on our indebtedness. Such interest rate swaps would principally be used to protect us against higher costs on our indebtedness resulting from increases in both short-term and long-term interest rates. We also may use various hedging and other risk management strategies to seek to manage various risks, including changes in currency exchange rates and market interest rates. Such hedging strategies would be utilized to seek to protect the value of our portfolio investments, for example, against possible adverse changes in the market value of securities held in our portfolio. 

Managerial Assistance As a BDC, we offer, and must provide upon request, managerial assistance to our portfolio companies. This assistance could involve monitoring the operations of our portfolio companies, participating in board and management meetings, consulting with and advising officers of portfolio companies and providing other organizational and financial guidance. Stellus Capital Management or an affiliate of Stellus Capital Management provides such managerial assistance on our behalf to portfolio companies that request this assistance. We may receive fees for these services and will reimburse Stellus Capital Management or an affiliate of Stellus Capital Management for its allocated costs in providing such assistance, subject to the review by our board of directors, including our independent directors. 

&#160;

&#160;

Competition Our primary competitors in providing financing to middle-market companies include public and private funds, other BDCs, commercial and investment banks, commercial financing companies and, to the extent they provide an alternative form of financing, private equity and hedge funds. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. For example, we believe some competitors may have access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us. Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a BDC or to the distribution and other requirements we must satisfy to maintain our qualification as a RIC. 

We use the expertise of the investment professionals of Stellus Capital Management to which we have access to assess investment risks and determine appropriate pricing for our investments in portfolio companies. In addition, we believe that the relationships of the investment professionals of Stellus Capital Management enable us to learn about, and compete effectively for, financing opportunities with attractive middle-market companies in the industries in which we invest. 

Employees We do not have any direct employees, and our day-to-day investment operations are managed by Stellus Capital Management. We have a chief executive officer and president and a chief financial officer and chief compliance officer. To the extent necessary, our board of directors may hire additional personnel going forward. Our officers are employees of Stellus Capital Management and our allocable portion of the cost of our chief financial officer and chief compliance officer and their respective staffs is paid by us pursuant to the administration agreement that we have entered into with Stellus Capital Management. 

Management Agreements Stellus Capital Management serves as our investment adviser and is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, or the &#147;Advisers Act.&#148; In addition, Stellus Capital Management serves as our administrator. 

Investment Advisory Agreement Subject to the overall supervision of our board of directors and in accordance with the 1940 Act, Stellus Capital Management manages our day-to-day operations and provides investment advisory services to us. Under the terms of the investment advisory agreement, Stellus Capital Management: 

&#149; determines the composition of our portfolio, the nature and timing of the changes to our portfolio and the manner of implementing such changes; &#149; identifies, evaluates and negotiates the structure of the investments we make; &#149; executes, closes, services and monitors the investments we make; &#149; determines the securities and other assets that we purchase, retain or sell; &#149; performs due diligence on prospective portfolio companies; and &#149; provides us with such other investment advisory, research and related services as we may, from time to time, reasonably require for the investment of our funds. Pursuant to the investment advisory agreement, we have agreed to pay Stellus Capital Management a fee for investment advisory and management services consisting of two components &#151; a base management fee and an incentive fee. The cost of both the base management fee and the incentive fee are borne by our stockholders. 

Management Fee The base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1.75% of our gross assets, including assets purchased with borrowed funds or other forms of leverage (including preferred stock, public and private debt issuances, derivative instruments, repurchase agreements and other similar instruments or arrangements) and 

&#160;

&#160;

excluding cash and cash equivalents. For services rendered under the investment advisory agreement, the base management fee is payable quarterly in arrears. The base management fee is calculated based on the average value of our gross assets, excluding cash and cash equivalents, at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters. Base management fees for any partial month or quarter are appropriately pro-rated. 

Incentive Fee We pay Stellus Capital Management an incentive fee. Incentive fees are calculated as below and payable quarterly in arrears. The incentive fee, which provides Stellus Capital Management with a share of the income that it generates for us, has two components, ordinary income and capital gains, calculated as follows: 

The ordinary income component is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on our pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter, subject to a total return requirement, and deferral of non-cash amounts, and is 20.0% of the amount, if any, by which our pre-incentive fee net investment income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets attributable to our common stock, for the immediately preceding calendar quarter, exceeds a 2.0% (which is 8.0% annualized) hurdle rate and a &#147;catch-up&#148; provision measured as of the end of each calendar quarter. Under this provision, in any calendar quarter, Stellus Capital Management receives no incentive fee until our pre-incentive fee net investment income equals the hurdle rate of 2.0%, but then receives, as a &#147;catch-up,&#148; 100% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 2.5%. 

The effect of the &#147;catch-up&#148; provision is that, subject to the total return provision discussed below, if pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds 2.5% in any calendar quarter, Stellus Capital Management receives 20.0% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income as if a hurdle rate did not apply. For this purpose, pre-incentive fee net investment income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees, such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence, managerial assistance and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus our operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, expenses payable under the administration agreement (as described below), and any interest expense and any distributions paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-incentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with PIK interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we have not yet received in cash. The foregoing incentive fee is subject to a total return requirement, which provides that no incentive fee in respect of the Company&#146;s pre-incentive fee net investment income will be payable except to the extent 20.0% of the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations over the then current and 11 preceding quarters exceeds the cumulative incentive fees accrued and/or paid for the 11 preceding quarters. In other words, any ordinary income incentive fee that is payable in a calendar quarter will be limited to the lesser of (i) 20.0% of the amount by which our pre-incentive fee net investment income for such calendar quarter exceeds the 2.0% hurdle, subject to the &#147;catch-up&#148; provision, and (ii) (x) 20.0% of the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations for the then current and 11 preceding calendar quarters minus (y) the cumulative incentive fees accrued and/or paid for the 11 preceding calendar quarters. 

For the foregoing purpose, the &#147;cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations&#148; is the amount, if positive, of the sum of pre-incentive fee net investment income, realized gains and losses and unrealized appreciation and depreciation of the Company for the then current and 11 preceding calendar quarters. In addition, the portion of such incentive fee that is attributable to deferred interest (such as PIK interest or OID) will be paid to Stellus Capital Management, without any interest thereon, only if and to the extent we actually receive such interest in cash, and any accrual thereof will be reversed if and to the extent such interest is reversed in connection with any write-off or similar treatment of the investment giving rise to any deferred interest accrual. Any reversal of such amounts would reduce net income for the quarter by the net amount of the reversal (after taking into account the reversal of incentive fees payable) and would result in a reduction and possible elimination of the incentive fees for such quarter. There is no accumulation of amounts on the hurdle rate from quarter to quarter, and accordingly there is no clawback of amounts previously paid if subsequent quarters are below the quarterly hurdle, and there is no delay of payment if 

&#160;

&#160;

prior quarters are below the quarterly hurdle. Stellus Capital Management has agreed to permanently waive any interest accrued on the portion of the incentive fee attributable to deferred interest (such as PIK interest or OID). 

Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. Because of the structure of the incentive fee, it is possible that we may pay an incentive fee in a quarter where we incur a loss, subject to the total return requirement. For example, if we receive pre-incentive fee net investment income in excess of the quarterly minimum hurdle rate, we will pay the applicable incentive fee even if we have incurred a loss in that quarter due to realized and unrealized capital losses. Our net investment income used to calculate this component of the incentive fee is also included in the amount of our gross assets used to calculate the 1.75% base management fee. These calculations are appropriately prorated for any period of less than three months and adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the current quarter. 

The following is a graphical representation of the calculation of the income-related portion of the incentive fee: 

Quarterly Incentive Fee Based on Net Investment Income Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (expressed as a percentage of the value of net assets) 

Percentage of Pre-incentive Fee Net Investment Income Allocated to Income-Related Portion of Incentive Fee The capital gains component of the incentive fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the investment advisory agreement, as of the termination date), is equal to 20.0% of our cumulative aggregate realized capital gains from inception through the end of that calendar year, computed net of our aggregate cumulative realized capital losses and our aggregate cumulative unrealized capital depreciation through the end of such year, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fees. If such amount is negative, then no capital gains incentive fee will be payable for such year. Additionally, if the investment advisory agreement is terminated as of a date that is not a calendar year end, the termination date will be treated as though it were a calendar year end for purposes of calculating and paying the capital gains incentive fee. 

Examples of Quarterly Incentive Fee Calculation Example 1: Income Related Portion of Incentive Fee before Total Return Requirement Calculation: Alternative 1 Assumptions Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 1.25% Hurdle rate (1) = 2.0% Management fee (2) = 0.4375% Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) = 0.2% Pre-incentive fee net investment income (investment income &#150; (management fee + other expenses)) = 0.6125% 

Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed hurdle rate, therefore there is no income-related incentive fee. 

Alternative 2 Assumptions Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 2.9% Hurdle rate (1) = 2.0% 

&#160;

&#160;

Management fee (2) = 0.4375% Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) = 0.2% Pre-incentive fee net investment income (investment income &#150; (management fee + other expenses)) = 2.2625% 

Incentive fee = 100% &#215; Pre-incentive fee net investment income (subject to &#147;catch-up&#148;) (3) = 100% &#215; (2.2625% &#150; 2.0%) = 0.2625% Pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds the hurdle rate, but does not fully satisfy the &#147;catch-up&#148; provision, therefore the income related portion of the incentive fee is 0.2625%. 

Alternative 3 Assumptions Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 3.5% Hurdle rate (1) = 2.0% Management fee (2) = 0.4375% Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) = 0.2% Pre-incentive fee net investment income (investment income &#150; (management fee + other expenses)) = 2.8625% Incentive fee = 100% &#215; Pre-incentive fee net investment income (subject to &#147;catch-up&#148;) (3) Incentive fee = 100% &#215; &#147;catch-up&#148; + (20.0% &#215; (Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income &#150; 2.5%)) 

&#147;Catch-up&#148; = 2.5% &#150; 2.0% = 0.5% Incentive fee = (100% &#215; 0.5%) + (20.0% &#215; (2.8625% &#150; 2.5%)) = 0.5% + (20.0% &#215; 0.3625%) = 0.5% + 0.0725% = 0.5725% Pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds the hurdle rate, and fully satisfies the &#147;catch-up&#148; provision, therefore the income related portion of the incentive fee is 0.5725%. 

(1) Represents 8.0% annualized hurdle rate. (2) Represents 1.75% annualized base management fee. (3) The &#147;catch-up&#148; provision is intended to provide Stellus Capital Management with an incentive fee of 20.0% on all pre-incentive fee net investment income as if a hurdle rate did not apply when our net investment income exceeds 2.5% in any fiscal quarter. Example 2: Income Portion of Incentive Fee with Total Return Requirement Calculation: Alternative 1: Assumptions Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 3.5% Hurdle rate (1) = 2.0% Management fee (2) = 0.4375% Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) = 0.2% Pre-incentive fee net investment income (investment income &#150; (management fee + other expenses) = 2.8625% Cumulative incentive compensation accrued and/or paid for preceding 11 calendar quarters = $9,000,000 20.0% of cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations over current and preceding 11 calendar quarters = $8,000,000 

Although our pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds the hurdle rate of 2.0% (as shown in Alternative 3 of Example 1 above), no incentive fee is payable because 20.0% of the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations over the then current and 11 preceding calendar quarters did not exceed the cumulative income and capital gains incentive fees accrued and/or paid for the preceding 11 calendar quarters. 

&#160;

&#160;

Alternative 2: Assumptions Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 3.5% Hurdle rate (1) = 2.0% Management fee (2) = 0.4375% Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) = 0.2% Pre-incentive fee net investment income (investment income &#150; (management fee + other expenses) = 2.8625% Cumulative incentive compensation accrued and/or paid for preceding 11 calendar quarters = $9,000,000 20.0% of cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations over current and preceding 11 calendar quarters = $10,000,000 

Because our pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds the hurdle rate of 2.0% and because 20.0% of the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations over the then current and 11 preceding calendar quarters exceeds the cumulative income and capital gains incentive fees accrued and/or paid for the preceding 11 calendar quarters, an incentive fee would be payable, as shown in Alternative 3 of Example 1 above. 

(1) Represents 8.0% annualized hurdle rate. (2) Represents 1.75% annualized base management fee. Example 3: Capital Gains Portion of Incentive Fee(*): Alternative 1: Assumptions Year 1: $2.0 million investment made in Company A (&#147;Investment A&#148;), and $3.0 million investment made in Company B (&#147;Investment B&#148;) 

Year 2: Investment A sold for $5.0 million and fair market value (&#147;FMV&#148;) of Investment B determined to be $3.5 million 

Year 3: FMV of Investment B determined to be $2.0 million 

Year 4: Investment B sold for $3.25 million 

The capital gains portion of the incentive fee would be: 

Year 1: None 

Year 2: Capital gains incentive fee of $0.6 million &#151; ($3.0 million realized capital gains on sale of Investment A multiplied by 20.0%) 

Year 3: None &#151; $0.4 million (20.0% multiplied by ($3.0 million cumulative capital gains less $1.0 million cumulative capital depreciation)) less $0.6 million (previous capital gains fee paid in Year 2) 

Year 4: Capital gains incentive fee of $50,000 &#151; $0.65 million ($3.25 million cumulative realized capital gains multiplied by 20.0%) less $0.6 million (capital gains incentive fee taken in Year 2) 

Alternative 2 Assumptions Year 1: $2.0 million investment made in Company A (&#147;Investment A&#148;), $5.25 million investment made in Company B (&#147;Investment B&#148;) and $4.5 million investment made in Company C (&#147;Investment C&#148;) 

Year 2: Investment A sold for $4.5 million, FMV of Investment B determined to be $4.75 million and FMV of Investment C determined to be $4.5 million 

Year 3: FMV of Investment B determined to be $5.0 million and Investment C sold for $5.5 million 

Year 4: FMV of Investment B determined to be $6.0 million 

&#160;

&#160;

Year 5: Investment B sold for $4.0 million 

The capital gains incentive fee, if any, would be: 

Year 1: None 

Year 2: $0.4 million capital gains incentive fee &#151; 20.0% multiplied by $2.0 million ($2.5 million realized capital gains on Investment A less $0.5 million unrealized capital depreciation on Investment B) 

Year 3: $0.25 million capital gains incentive fee (1) &#160;&#151; $0.65 million (20.0% multiplied by $3.25 million ($3.5 million cumulative realized capital gains less $0.25 million unrealized capital depreciation)) less $0.4 million capital gains incentive fee received in Year 2 

Year 4: $0.05 million capital gains incentive fee &#151; $0.7 million ($3.50 million cumulative realized capital gains multiplied by 20.0%) less $0.65 million cumulative capital gains incentive fee paid in Year 2 and Year 3 

Year 5: None &#151; $0.45 million (20.0% multiplied by $2.25 million (cumulative realized capital gains of $3.5 million less realized capital losses of $1.25 million)) less $0.7 million cumulative capital gains incentive fee paid in Year 2, Year 3 and Year 4 (2) 

* The hypothetical amounts of returns shown are based on a percentage of our total net assets and assume no leverage. There is no guarantee that positive returns will be realized and actual returns may vary from those shown in this example. (1) As illustrated in Year 3 of Alternative 1 above, if a portfolio company were to be wound up on a date other than its fiscal year end of any year, it may have paid aggregate capital gains incentive fees that are more than the amount of such fees that would be payable if such portfolio company had been wound up on its fiscal year end of such year. (2) As noted above, it is possible that the cumulative aggregate capital gains fee received by Stellus Capital Management ($0.70 million) is effectively greater than $0.45 million (20.0% of cumulative aggregate realized capital gains less net realized capital losses or net unrealized depreciation ($2.25 million)). Payment of Our Expenses All investment professionals of Stellus Capital Management, when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory and management services to us, and the compensation and routine overhead expenses of personnel allocable to these services to us, are provided and paid for by Stellus Capital Management and not by us. We bear all other out-of-pocket costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including, without limitation, those relating to: 

&#149; organization and offering; &#149; calculating our net asset value (including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firm); &#149; fees and expenses payable to third parties, including agents, consultants or other advisors, in monitoring financial and legal affairs for us and in monitoring our investments and performing due diligence on our prospective portfolio companies or otherwise relating to, or associated with, evaluating and making investments; &#149; interest payable on debt, if any, incurred to finance our investments and expenses related to unsuccessful portfolio acquisition efforts; &#149; offerings of our common stock and other securities; &#149; base management and incentive fees; &#149; administration fees and expenses, if any, payable under the administration agreement (including our allocable portion of Stellus Capital Management&#146;s overhead in performing its obligations under the administration agreement, including rent and the allocable portion of the cost of our chief compliance officer, chief financial officer and their respective staffs); &#149; transfer agent, dividend agent and custodial fees and expenses; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#149; U.S. federal and state registration fees; &#149; all costs of registration and listing our shares on any securities exchange; &#149; U.S. federal, state and local taxes; &#149; independent directors&#146; fees and expenses; &#149; costs of preparing and filing reports or other documents required by the SEC or other regulators; &#149; costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to stockholders, including printing costs; &#149; costs and fees associated with any fidelity bond, directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance, and any other insurance premiums; &#149; direct costs and expenses of administration, including printing, mailing, long distance telephone, copying, secretarial and other staff, independent auditors and outside legal costs; &#149; proxy voting expenses; and &#149; all other expenses incurred by us or Stellus Capital Management in connection with administering our business. Duration and Termination Unless terminated earlier as described below, the investment advisory agreement will continue in effect from year to year if approved annually by our board of directors or by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, and, in either case, if also approved by a majority of our directors who are not &#147;interested persons.&#148; The investment advisory agreement automatically terminates in the event of its assignment, as defined in the 1940 Act, by Stellus Capital Management and may be terminated by either party without penalty upon 60 days&#146; written notice to the other. The holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities may also terminate the investment advisory agreement without penalty upon 60 days&#146; written notice. See Item 1A. &#147;Risk Factors &#151; Risks Relating to our Business and Structure.&#148; We are dependent upon key personnel of Stellus Capital Management for our future success. If Stellus Capital Management were to lose any of its key personnel, our ability to achieve our investment objective could be significantly harmed. 

Indemnification The investment advisory agreement provides that Stellus Capital Management and its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons and members, and any other person or entity affiliated with it, are entitled to indemnification from us for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys&#146; fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising from the rendering of Stellus Capital Management&#146;s services under the investment advisory agreement or otherwise as our investment adviser. Our obligation to provide indemnification under the investment advisory agreement, however, is limited by the 1940 Act and Investment Company Act Release No. 11330, which, among other things, prohibit us from indemnifying any director, officer or other individual from any liability resulting directly from the willful misconduct, bad faith, gross negligence in the performance of duties or reckless disregard of applicable obligations and duties of the directors, officers or other individuals and require us to set forth reasonable and fair means for determining whether indemnification shall be made. 

Board Approval of the Investment Advisory Agreement Our board of directors, including a majority of our independent directors, approved the investment advisory agreement at its first meeting, held on September 24, 2012, and approved the annual continuation of the investment advisory agreement on October 14, 2015. In its consideration of the investment advisory agreement, the board of directors focused on information it had received relating to, among other things: (a) the nature, quality and extent of the advisory and other services to be provided to us by our investment adviser; (b) comparative data with respect to advisory fees or similar expenses paid by other BDCs with similar investment objectives; (c) our projected operating expenses and expense ratio compared to BDCs with similar investment objectives; (d) any existing and potential sources of indirect income to our investment 

&#160;

&#160;

adviser from its relationships with us and the profitability of those relationships; (e) information about the services to be performed and the personnel performing such services under the investment advisory agreement; (f) the organizational capability and financial condition of our investment adviser; and (g) various other factors. 

Based on the information reviewed and the discussions, the board of directors, including a majority of the non-interested directors, concluded that the investment management fee rates and terms are reasonable in relation to the services to be provided and approved the investment advisory agreement as being in the best interests of our stockholders. 

Administration Agreement Under the administration agreement, Stellus Capital Management furnishes us with office facilities and equipment and will provide us with clerical, bookkeeping, recordkeeping and other administrative services at such facilities. Stellus Capital Management also performs, or oversees the performance of, our required administrative services, which include being responsible for the financial and other records that we are required to maintain and preparing reports to our stockholders and reports and other materials filed with the SEC. In addition, Stellus Capital Management assists us in determining and publishing our net asset value, oversees the preparation and filing of our tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports and other materials to our stockholders, and generally oversees the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others. Under the administration agreement, Stellus Capital Management also provides managerial assistance on our behalf to those portfolio companies that have accepted our offer to provide such assistance. 

Payments under the administration agreement are equal to an amount based upon our allocable portion (subject to the review of our board of directors) of Stellus Capital Management&#146;s overhead in performing its obligations under the administration agreement, including rent, the fees and expenses associated with performing compliance functions and our allocable portion of the cost of our chief financial officer and chief compliance officer and their respective staffs. In addition, if requested to provide significant managerial assistance to our portfolio companies, Stellus Capital Management will be paid an additional amount based on the services provided, which shall not exceed the amount we receive from such portfolio companies for providing this assistance. The administration agreement has an initial term of two years and may be renewed with the approval of our board of directors. The administration agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon 60 days&#146; written notice to the other party. To the extent that Stellus Capital Management outsources any of its functions, we will pay the fees associated with such functions on a direct basis without any incremental profit to Stellus Capital Management. Stockholder approval is not required to amend the administration agreement. 

Indemnification The administration agreement provides that Stellus Capital Management, its affiliates and their respective, officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons and members, and any other person or entity affiliated with it, are entitled to indemnification from us for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys&#146; fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising from the rendering of Stellus Capital Management&#146;s services under the administration agreement or otherwise as our administrator. Our obligation to provide indemnification under the administration agreement, however, is limited by the 1940 Act and Investment Company Act Release No. 11330, which, among other things, prohibit us from indemnifying any director, officer or other individual from any liability resulting directly from the willful misconduct, bad faith, gross negligence in the performance of duties or reckless disregard of applicable obligations and duties of the directors, officers or other individuals and require us to set forth reasonable and fair means for determining whether indemnification shall be made. 

License Agreement We have entered into a license agreement with Stellus Capital Management under which Stellus Capital Management has agreed to grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name &#147;Stellus Capital.&#148; Under this agreement, we have a right to use the &#147;Stellus Capital&#148; name for so long as Stellus Capital Management or one of its affiliates remains our investment adviser. Other than with respect to this limited 

&#160;

&#160;

license, we have no legal right to the &#147;Stellus Capital&#148; name. This license agreement will remain in effect for so long as the investment advisory agreement with Stellus Capital Management is in effect. 

Exchange Act Reports We maintain a website at www.stelluscapital.com. The information on our website is not incorporated by reference in this annual report on Form 10-K. 

We make available on or through our website certain reports and amendments to those reports that we file with or furnish to the SEC in accordance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the &#147;Exchange Act.&#148; These include our annual reports on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and our current reports on Form 8-K. We make this information available on our website free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file the information with, or furnish it to, the SEC. 

Regulation as a Business Development Company We are a BDC under the 1940 Act. The 1940 Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between BDCs and their affiliates (including any investment advisers), principal underwriters and affiliates of those affiliates or underwriters and requires that a majority of the directors be persons other than &#147;interested persons,&#148; as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. In addition, the 1940 Act provides that we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or to withdraw our election as, a BDC unless approved by a majority of our outstanding voting securities. 

Qualifying Assets Under the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as &#147;qualifying assets,&#148; unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the company&#146;s total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our business are the following: 

(1) Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. Under the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder, &#147;eligible portfolio companies&#148; include (1) private domestic operating companies, (2) public domestic operating companies whose securities are not listed on a national securities exchange (e.g., the New York Stock Exchange), and (3) public domestic operating companies having a market capitalization of less than $250 million. Public domestic operating companies whose securities are quoted on the over-the-counter bulletin board or through Pink Sheets LLC are not listed on a national securities exchange and therefore are eligible portfolio companies. (2) Securities of any eligible portfolio company which we control. (3) Securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incident to such a private transaction, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities, was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements. (4) Securities of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no ready market for such securities and we already own 60% of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company. (5) Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities. (6) Cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities that mature in one year or less from the date of investment. 

&#160;

&#160;

The regulations defining qualifying assets may change over time. We may adjust our investment focus as needed to comply with and/or take advantage of any regulatory, legislative, administrative or judicial actions in this area. 

Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies BDCs generally must offer to make available to the issuer of the securities significant managerial assistance, except in circumstances where either (i) the BDC controls such issuer of securities or (ii) the BDC purchases such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together and one of the other persons in the group makes available such managerial assistance. Making available managerial assistance means any arrangement whereby the BDC, through its directors, officers, employees or agents, offers to provide, and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company. Stellus Capital Management will provide such managerial assistance on our behalf to portfolio companies that request this assistance. 

Temporary Investments Pending investment in other types of qualifying assets, as described above, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, repurchase agreements and high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less from the date of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as temporary investments, so that 70% of our assets are qualifying assets or temporary investments. Typically, we will invest in U.S. Treasury bills or in repurchase agreements, so long as the agreements are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price that is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements. However, if more than 25% of our total assets constitute repurchase agreements from a single counterparty, we would not meet the diversification tests in order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, we do not intend to enter into repurchase agreements with a single counterparty in excess of this limit. Stellus Capital Management will monitor the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we enter into repurchase agreement transactions. 

Senior Securities We are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 200% immediately after each such issuance. In addition, while any senior securities remain outstanding, we may be prohibited from making any distribution to our stockholders or repurchasing our securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. We may also borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our total assets for temporary or emergency purposes without regard to asset coverage. For a discussion of the risks associated with leverage, see Item 1A. &#147;Risk Factors &#151; Risks Relating to our Business and Structure &#151; Regulations governing our operation as a BDC will affect our ability to, and the way in which we, raise additional capital. As a BDC, the necessity of raising additional capital may expose us to risks, including the typical risks associated with leverage.&#148; 

Common Stock We are not generally able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share. We may, however, sell our common stock at a price below the current net asset value of the common stock if our board of directors determines that such sale is in our best interests and that of our stockholders, and our stockholders approve such sale. In any such case, the price at which our securities are to be issued and sold may not be less than a price which, in the determination of our board of directors, closely approximates the market value of such securities (less any distributing commission or discount). A proposal, approved by our stockholders at our 2015 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, authorizes us to sell shares equal to up to 25% of our outstanding common stock below the then current net asset value per share of our common stock in one or more offerings for the period ending on the earlier of the one year anniversary of the date of the Company&#146;s 2015 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and the date of the Company&#146;s 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, which is expected to be held in June 2016. We would need similar future approval from our 

&#160;

&#160;

stockholders to issue shares below the then current net asset value per share any time after the expiration of the current approval. We may also make rights offerings to our stockholders at prices per share less than the net asset value per share, subject to applicable requirements of the 1940 Act. 

Codes of Ethics We and Stellus Capital Management have each adopted a code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act that establishes procedures for personal investments and restricts certain personal securities transactions. Personnel subject to each such code may invest in securities for their personal investment accounts, including securities that may be purchased or held by us, so long as such investments are made in accordance with such code&#146;s requirements. You may read and copy our code of ethics at the SEC&#146;s Public Reference Room in Washington, D.C. You may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at (202) 551-8090. In addition, each code of ethics is available on the EDGAR Database on the SEC&#146;s website at www.sec.gov. You may also obtain copies of each code of ethics, after paying a duplicating fee, by electronic request at the following e-mail address: publicinfo@sec.gov , or by writing the SEC&#146;s Public Reference Section, 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. 

Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures We have delegated our proxy voting responsibility to Stellus Capital Management. The proxy voting policies and procedures of Stellus Capital Management are set out below. The guidelines will be reviewed periodically by Stellus Capital Management and our directors who are not &#147;interested persons,&#148; and, accordingly, are subject to change. 

Introduction . As an investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act, Stellus Capital Management has a fiduciary duty to act solely in our best interests. As part of this duty, Stellus Capital Management recognizes that it must vote our securities in a timely manner free of conflicts of interest and in our best interests. 

Stellus Capital Management&#146;s policies and procedures for voting proxies for its investment advisory clients are intended to comply with Section 206 of, and Rule 206(4)-6 under, the Advisers Act. 

Proxy Policies . Stellus Capital Management votes proxies relating to our portfolio securities in what it perceives to be the best interest of our stockholders. Stellus Capital Management reviews on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted to a stockholder vote to determine its effect on the portfolio securities we hold. In most cases Stellus Capital Management will vote in favor of proposals that Stellus Capital Management believes are likely to increase the value of the portfolio securities we hold. Although Stellus Capital Management will generally vote against proposals that may have a negative effect on our portfolio securities, Stellus Capital Management may vote for such a proposal if there exist compelling long-term reasons to do so. 

Stellus Capital Management has established a proxy voting committee and adopted proxy voting guidelines and related procedures. The proxy voting committee establishes proxy voting guidelines and procedures, oversees the internal proxy voting process, and reviews proxy voting issues. To ensure that Stellus Capital Management&#146;s vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, Stellus Capital Management requires that (1) anyone involved in the decision-making process disclose to our Chief Compliance Officer any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote; and (2) employees involved in the decision-making process or vote administration are prohibited from revealing how Stellus Capital Management intends to vote on a proposal in order to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties. Where conflicts of interest may be present, Stellus Capital Management will disclose such conflicts to us, including our independent directors and may request guidance from us on how to vote such proxies. 

Proxy Voting Records . You may obtain information about how Stellus Capital Management voted proxies by making a written request for proxy voting information to: Stellus Capital Investment Corporation, Attention: Investor Relations, 4400 Post Oak Parkway, Suite 500, Houston, TX 77027, or by calling us collect at (713) 292-5400. The SEC also maintains a website at www.sec.gov that contains this information. 

&#160;

&#160;

Privacy Principles We are committed to maintaining the privacy of our stockholders and to safeguarding their nonpublic personal information. The following information is provided to help you understand what personal information we collect, how we protect that information and why, in certain cases, we may share information with select other parties. 

Generally, we do not receive any nonpublic personal information relating to our stockholders, although certain nonpublic personal information of our stockholders may become available to us. We do not disclose any nonpublic personal information about our stockholders or former stockholders to anyone, except as permitted by law or as is necessary in order to service stockholder accounts (for example, to a transfer agent or third-party administrator). 

We restrict access to nonpublic personal information about our stockholders to employees of Stellus Capital Management and its affiliates with a legitimate business need for the information. We intend to maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards designed to protect the nonpublic personal information of our stockholders. 

Other We are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect us against larceny and embezzlement. Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to us or our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person&#146;s office. 

We and Stellus Capital Management are each required to adopt and implement written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of relevant federal securities laws, review these policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation, and designate a chief compliance officer to be responsible for administering the policies and procedures. 

In general, BDCs are prohibited under the 1940 Act from knowingly participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our board of directors who are not interested persons and, in some cases, prior approval by the SEC. The SEC has interpreted the BDC prohibition on transactions with affiliates to prohibit all &#147;joint transactions&#148; between entities that share a common investment adviser. The staff of the SEC has granted no-action relief permitting purchases of a single class of privately placed securities provided that the adviser negotiates no term other than price and certain other conditions are met. In addition, we received exemptive relief from the SEC to co-invest with investment funds managed by Stellus Capital Management (other than the D. E. Shaw group funds, as defined below) where doing so is consistent with our investment strategy as well as applicable law (including the terms and conditions of the exemptive order issued by the SEC). Under the terms of the relief permitting us to co-invest with other funds managed by Stellus Capital Management, a &#147;required majority&#148; (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of our independent directors must make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including (1) the terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our stockholders and do not involve overreaching of us or our stockholders on the part of any person concerned and (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of our stockholders and is consistent with our investment objectives and strategies. We intend to co-invest, subject to the conditions included in the exemptive order we received from the SEC, with a private credit fund managed by Stellus Capital Management that has an investment strategy that is identical to our investment strategy. We believe that such co-investments may afford us additional investment opportunities and an ability to achieve greater diversification. 

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 imposes a wide variety of regulatory requirements on publicly held companies and their insiders. Many of these requirements affect us. For example: 

&#149; pursuant to Rule 13a-14 under the Exchange Act, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer must certify the accuracy of the financial statements contained in our periodic reports; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#149; pursuant to Item 307 under Regulation S-K, our periodic reports must disclose our conclusions about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures; &#149; pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, our management must prepare an annual report regarding its assessment of our internal control over financial reporting; and &#149; pursuant to Item 308 of Regulation S-K and Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, our periodic reports must disclose whether there were significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses. Taxation as a Regulated Investment Company As a BDC, we have elected and qualified to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, we generally do not have to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any income that we distribute to our stockholders as dividends. To maintain our qualification as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements (as described below). In addition, we must distribute to our stockholders, for each taxable year, at least 90% of our &#147;investment company taxable income,&#148; which is generally our ordinary income plus the excess of our realized net short-term capital gains over our realized net long-term capital losses (the &#147;Annual Distribution Requirement&#148;). 

For any taxable year in which we: 

&#149; qualify as a RIC; and &#149; satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement; we will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of our income we distribute to stockholders. We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular corporate rates on any income or capital gains not distributed (or deemed distributed) to our stockholders. 

We will be subject to a 4% nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on our undistributed income unless we distribute in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of (a) 98% of our net ordinary income for each calendar year, (b) 98.2% of our capital gain net income for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (c) any income realized, but not distributed, in the preceding year and on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax, or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement. For this purpose, however, any net ordinary income or capital gain net income retained by us that is subject to corporate income tax for the tax year ending in that calendar year will be considered to have been distributed by year end (or earlier if estimated taxes are paid). We currently intend to make sufficient distributions each taxable year to satisfy the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement. 

In order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must, among other things: 

&#149; continue to qualify as a BDC under the 1940 Act at all times during each year; &#149; derive in each taxable year at least 90% of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities loans, gains from the sale of stock or other securities, or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock or securities, and net income derived from interests in &#147;qualified publicly traded partnerships&#148; (which generally are partnerships that are traded on an established securities market or tradable on a secondary market, other than partnerships that derive 90% of their income from interest, dividends and other permitted RIC income), or the 90% Income Test; and &#149; diversify our holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year: &#149; at least 50% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5% of the value of our assets or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer; and 

&#160;

&#160;

&#149; no more than 25% of the value of our assets is invested in the securities, other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs, of one issuer or of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable tax rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses or in the securities of one or more qualified publicly traded partnerships, or the Diversification Tests. We may invest in partnerships, including qualified publicly traded partnerships, which may result in our being subject to state, local or foreign income, franchise or withholding liabilities. 

We may be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive cash. For example, if we hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount (such as debt instruments with PIK interest or, in certain cases, with increasing interest rates or issued with warrants), we must include in income each year a portion of the original issue discount that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year. Because any original issue discount accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income for the year of accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, even though we will not have received any corresponding cash amount. If we are not able to obtain sufficient cash from other sources to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, we may fail to maintain our qualification as a RIC and become subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on all of our taxable income without the benefit of the dividends-paid deduction. 

Although we do not presently expect to do so, we are authorized to borrow funds and to sell assets in order to satisfy (i) the Annual Distribution Requirements and to otherwise eliminate our liability for U.S. federal income and excise taxes and/or (ii) the Diversification Tests. However, under the 1940 Act, we are not permitted in certain circumstances to make distributions to our stockholders while our debt obligations and other senior securities are outstanding unless certain &#147;asset coverage&#148; tests are met. See Item 1A. &#147;Regulation as a Business Development Company &#151; Senior Securities.&#148; Moreover, our ability to dispose of assets to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement, the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement or the Diversification Test may be limited by (a) the illiquid nature of our portfolio and/or (b) other requirements relating to our qualifications as a RIC, including the Diversification Tests. If we dispose of assets in order to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement, the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement or the Diversification Tests, we may make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous. 

In addition, we have formed and operate a SBIC subsidiary, and are partially dependent on the SBIC subsidiary for cash distributions to enable us to meet the RIC distribution requirements. The SBIC subsidiary may be limited by the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, and SBA regulations governing SBICs, from making certain distributions to us that may be necessary to maintain our status as a RIC. We may have to request a waiver of the SBA&#146;s restrictions for the SBIC subsidiary to make certain distributions to maintain our RIC status. We cannot assure you that the SBA will grant such waiver. If the SBIC subsidiary is unable to obtain a waiver, compliance with the SBA regulations may cause us to fail to maintain our qualification as a RIC, which would result in us becoming subject to corporate-level federal income tax. 

Certain of our investment practices may be subject to special and complex U.S. federal income tax provisions that may, among other things, (a) treat dividends that would otherwise constitute qualified dividend income as non-qualified dividend income, (b) treat dividends that would otherwise be eligible for the corporate dividends received deduction as ineligible for such treatment, (c) disallow, suspend or otherwise limit the allowance of certain losses or deductions, (d) convert lower-taxed long term capital gain into higher-taxed short-term capital gain or ordinary income, (e) convert an ordinary loss or a deduction into a capital loss (the deductibility of which is more limited), (f) cause us to recognize income or gain without a corresponding receipt of cash, (g) adversely affect the time as to when a purchase or sale of stock or securities is deemed to occur, (h) adversely alter the characterization of certain complex financial transactions and (i) produce income that will not be qualifying income for purposes of the 90% Income Test. We intend to monitor our transactions and may make certain tax elections to mitigate the effect of these provisions and prevent our disqualification as a RIC. 

&#160;

&#160;

Gain or loss realized by us from warrants acquired by us as well as any loss attributable to the lapse of such warrants generally will be treated as capital gain or loss. Such capital gain or loss generally will be long term or short term, depending on how long we held a particular warrant. Some of the income and fees that we may recognize will not satisfy the 90% Income Test. In order to ensure that such income and fees do not disqualify us as a RIC for a failure to satisfy the 90% Income Test, we may hold assets that generate such income and provide services that generate such fees indirectly through one or more entities treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Such corporations will be required to pay U.S. federal corporate income tax on their earnings, which ultimately will reduce our return on such income and fees. 

If we are unable to qualify for treatment as a RIC, and if certain remedial provisions are not available, we would be subject to tax on all of our taxable income at regular corporate rates. We would not be able to deduct distributions to stockholders, nor would they be required to be made. Distributions, including distributions of net long-term capital gain, would generally be taxable to our stockholders as ordinary dividend income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. Subject to certain limitations under the Code, corporate stockholders would be eligible to claim a dividends received deduction with respect to such distributions, non-corporate stockholders would be able to treat such dividend income as &#147;qualified dividend income,&#148; which is subject to reduced rates of U.S. federal income tax. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholder&#146;s tax basis, and any remaining distributions would be treated as a capital gain. If we fail to qualify as a RIC for a period greater than two taxable years, to requalify as a RIC in a subsequent year we may be subject to regular corporate tax on any net built-in gains with respect to certain of our assets ( i.e. , the excess of the aggregate gains, including items of income, over aggregate losses that would have been realized with respect to such assets if we had been liquidated) that we elect to recognize on requalification or when recognized over the next ten years (or shorter applicable period). 

Our Status as an Emerging Growth Company We are an &#147;emerging growth company,&#148; as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of specified reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These eased requirements include an exemption from certain financial disclosure and governance requirements and relaxed restrictions on the sale of securities. The JOBS Act provides scaled disclosure provisions for emerging growth companies, including, among other things, removing the requirement that emerging growth companies comply with Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 404(b) auditor attestation of internal control over financial reporting. Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act also permits an emerging growth companies to elect an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until such time as these new or revised standards are made applicable to all private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards, which may make it more difficult for investors and securities analysts to evaluate us since our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (a) the last day of the fiscal year (i) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering (IPO), (ii) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.0 billion, or (iii) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30 th , and (b) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. 

The New York Stock Exchange Corporate Governance Regulations The New York Stock Exchange has adopted corporate governance regulations that listed companies must comply with. We are in compliance with such corporate governance listing standards applicable to BDCs. 

Regulation as a Small Business Investment Company Our wholly-owned subsidiary&#146;s SBIC license allows it to obtain leverage by issuing SBA-guaranteed debentures, subject to customary procedures. SBA-guaranteed debentures are non-recourse, interest only debentures with interest payable semi-annually and have a ten-year maturity. The principal amount of 

&#160;

&#160;

SBA-guaranteed debentures is not required to be paid prior to maturity but may be prepaid at any time without penalty. The interest rate of SBA-guaranteed debentures is fixed at the time of issuance at a market-driven spread over U.S. Treasury Notes with ten-year maturities. 

SBICs are designed to stimulate the flow of private equity capital to eligible small businesses. Under SBA regulations, SBICs may make loans to eligible small businesses and invest in the equity securities of small businesses. Under present SBA regulations, eligible small businesses include businesses that have a tangible net worth not exceeding $19.5 million and have average annual fully taxed net income not exceeding $6.5 million for the two most recent fiscal years. In addition, an SBIC must devote 25% of its investment activity to &#147;smaller&#148; concerns as defined by the SBA. A smaller concern is one that has a net worth not exceeding $6 million and has average annual fully taxed net income not exceeding $2 million for the two most recent fiscal years. SBA regulations also provide alternative size standard criteria to determine eligibility, which depend on the industry in which the business is engaged and are based on such factors as the number of employees and gross sales. According to SBA regulations, SBICs may make long-term loans to small businesses, invest in the equity securities of such businesses and provide them with consulting and advisory services. 

SBA regulations currently limit the amount that an SBIC subsidiary may borrow to a maximum of $150 million when it has at least $75 million in regulatory capital. Affiliated SBICs are permitted to issue up to a combined maximum amount of $225 million when they have at least $112.5 million in regulatory capital. In December 2015, the 2016 omnibus spending bill approved by Congress and signed into law by the President increased the amount of SBA-guaranteed debentures that affiliated SBIC funds can have outstanding from $225 million to $350 million. This new legislation may allow us to issue additional SBIC debentures above the $225 million threshold subject to SBA approval. As of December 31, 2015, our SBIC subsidiary had $32.5 million in regulatory capital and $65.0 million in SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding, which approximated their fair value. 

We have received exemptive relief from the SEC to permit us to exclude the debt of our SBIC subsidiaries guaranteed by the SBA from the definition of senior securities in the 200% asset coverage test under the 1940 Act. This allows us increased flexibility under the 200% asset coverage test by permitting us to borrow up to $225 million more than we would otherwise be able to absent the receipt of this exemptive relief. 

The SBA restricts the ability of SBICs to repurchase their capital stock. SBA regulations also include restrictions on a &#147;change of control&#148; or transfer of an SBIC and require that SBICs invest idle funds in accordance with SBA regulations. In addition, our SBIC subsidiary may also be limited in its ability to make distributions to us if it does not have sufficient capital, in accordance with SBA regulations. 

Our SBIC subsidiary is subject to regulation and oversight by the SBA, including requirements with respect to maintaining certain minimum financial ratios and other covenants. Receipt of an SBIC license does not assure that our SBIC subsidiary will receive SBA guaranteed debenture funding, which is dependent upon our SBIC subsidiary continuing to be in compliance with SBA regulations and policies. The SBA, as a creditor, will have a superior claim to our SBIC subsidiary&#146;s assets over our stockholders in the event we liquidate our SBIC subsidiary or the SBA exercises its remedies under the SBA-guaranteed debentures issued by our SBIC subsidiary upon an event of default.
