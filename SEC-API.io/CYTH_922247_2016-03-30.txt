 Item 1. Business. 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

CTD Holdings, Inc. (&#8220;we&#8221; &#8220;our&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; or &#8220;the Company&#8221;) was organized as a Florida corporation on August 9, 1990, with operations beginning in July 1992. In conjunction with a restructuring in 2000, we changed our name from Cyclodextrin Technologies Development, Inc., or CTDI, to CTD Holdings, Inc.; CTDI was then incorporated as a Florida corporation and became a wholly owned subsidiary of CTD Holdings, Inc. 

&#160; 

We are a biotechnology company focused on the use of cyclodextrins in drug development. In 2014 we filed a Type II Drug Master File with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;) for our lead drug candidate, Trappsol&#174; Cyclo&#8482; (hydroxypropyl beta cyclodextrin) as a treatment for Neimann-Pick Type C disease (&#8220;NPC&#8221;). NPC is a rare and fatal cholesterol metabolism disease found primarily in children and young adults. In 2015, we launched an International Clinical Program for Trappsol&#174; Cyclo&#8482; as a treatment for NPC and met with the U.K. Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) regarding a proposed clinical trial for the treatment of NPC to be conducted in the UK. Most recently, we were advised by the FDA that we have sufficient pre-clinical data to support a clinical trial of Trappsol&#174; Cyclo&#8482; in the United States, and we are preparing an Investigational New Drug (IND) application for Trappsol&#174; Cyclo&#8482; as a treatment for NPC. Following approval of the IND, we expect to conduct a U.S. clinical study in which we will provide Trappsol&#174; Cyclo&#8482; intravenously to NPC patients two years of age and older in order to track biochemical markers of cholesterol metabolism and to measure effects on neurologic, lung and liver symptoms. 

&#160; 

Our core business is focused on the development of cyclodextrin-based biopharmaceuticals for the treatment of disease. Our strategy is to pursue biopharmaceutical opportunities in healthcare where we believe cyclodextrin applications have maximum value. We also sell cyclodextrins and related products and services to the pharmaceutical, nutritional, and other industries, primarily for use in diagnostics and specialty drugs with continuing growth in research and new product development. 

&#160; 

Cyclodextrins 

&#160; 

Cyclodextrins are molecules that bring together oil and water, making the oily materials soluble in water, and have potential applications anywhere oil and water must be used together. Successful applications of cyclodextrins have been established in biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, analytical chemistry, cosmetics, diagnostics, electronics, foodstuffs, and toxic waste treatment. Stabilization of food flavors and fragrances is the largest current worldwide market for cyclodextrin applications. We and others have developed cyclodextrin-based applications in stabilization of flavors for food products; elimination of undesirable tastes and odors; preparation of antifungal complexes for foods and pharmaceuticals; stabilization of fragrances and dyes; reduction of foaming in foods, cosmetics and toiletries; and the improvement of quality, stability and storability of foods. 

&#160; 

Cyclodextrins can improve the solubility and stability of a wide range of drugs. Many promising drug compounds are unusable or have serious side effects because they are either unstable or poorly soluble in water. Strategies for administering currently approved compounds involve injection of formulations requiring pH adjustment and/or the use of organic solvents. The result is frequently painful, irritating, or damaging to the patient. These side effects can be ameliorated by cyclodextrins. Cyclodextrins also have many potential uses in drug delivery for topical applications to the eyes and skin. In 2010, one of our Trappsol&#174; cyclodextrins was designated an orphan drug by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Trappsol&#174; Cyclo&#8482; is the first use of a cyclodextrin as an active pharmaceutical and not just as an inactive formulation excipient. 

&#160; 

Cyclodextrin Product Background 

&#160; 

Cyclodextrins are donut shaped rings of glucose (sugar) molecules. Cyclodextrins are formed naturally by the action of bacterial enzymes on starch. They were first noticed and isolated in 1891. The bacterial enzyme naturally creates a mixture of at least three different cyclodextrins depending on how many glucose units are included in the molecular circle; six glucose units yield alpha cyclodextrin; seven units, beta cyclodextrin; eight units, gamma cyclodextrin. The more glucose units in the molecular ring, the larger the cavity in the center of the ring. The inside of this ring provides an excellent resting place for &#8220;oily&#8221; molecules while the outside of the ring is compatible with water, allowing clear, stable solutions of cyclodextrins to exist in aqueous environments even when an &#8220;oily&#8221; molecule is carried within the ring. The net result is a molecular carrier that comes in small, medium, and large sizes with the ability to transport and deliver &#8220;oily&#8221; materials using plain water as the solvent. It is the ability of molecular encapsulation of compounds that makes cyclodextrins so useful chemically and pharmaceutically. 

&#160;

&#160; 1 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Cyclodextrins are manufactured commercially in large quantities by mixing purified enzymes with starch solutions. A mixture of alpha, beta, and gamma cyclodextrins can be manufactured by this enzymatic modification of starch with purified natural enzymes and therefore are considered to be natural products. Additional processing is required to isolate and separate the individual cyclodextrins. The purified alpha, beta and gamma cyclodextrins are referred to collectively as natural or native cyclodextrins. 

&#160; 

The hydroxyl chemical groups on each glucose unit in a cyclodextrin molecule provide chemists with ways to modify the properties of the cyclodextrins, i.e. to make them more water soluble or less water soluble, thereby making them better carriers for a specific chemical. The cyclodextrins that result from chemical modifications are no longer considered natural and are referred to as chemically modified cyclodextrins. Since the property modifications achieved are often so advantageous to a specific application, the Company does not believe the loss of the natural product categorization will prevent its ultimate pharmaceutical use. It does, however, create a greater regulatory burden. 

&#160; 

Use of Cyclodextrins to Treat NPC 

&#160; 

Natural cyclodextrins have been confirmed to be generally recognized as safe (GRAS) in most of the world, including the U.S. Moreover, approvals of products containing cyclodextrins by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration since 2001 suggest that regulatory approval for new products may be easier to obtain in the future. In 2001, Janssen Pharmaceutica, now a subsidiary of Johnson &#38; Johnson, received FDA approval to market Sporanox&#174;, an antifungal which contained hydroxypropyl beta cyclodextrin as an excipient. In 2008, one of our clients used our product, Trappsol&#174; hydroxypropyl beta cyclodextrin, in an FDA approved compassionate use investigational new drug protocol for the treatment of NPC. We now sell this product for industrial use under our trademark Trappsol&#174; Cyclo&#8482;. Our customer successfully applied to the FDA to designate Trappsol&#174; Cyclo&#8482; as an orphan drug in the treatment of NPC in support of an Investigational New Drug protocol for a particular U.S. patient. Under the Orphan Drug Act, companies that develop a drug for a disorder affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the United States may seek designation as an orphan drug and, if such application is approved, they have the ability to sell it exclusively for seven years, and may get clinical trial tax incentives. On May 17, 2010, the FDA designated Trappsol&#174; Cyclo&#8482; as an orphan drug for the treatment of NPC. To date, Trappsol&#174; Cyclo&#8482; has been administered to approximately 20 NPC patients in compassionate use programs around the world, including in the U.S., Brazil and Spain. The doctors and patients participating in these programs, including patients that have been administered Trappsol&#174; Cyclo&#8482; intravenously for more than five years, have made their data available to us, and we are using that data to design our proposed clinical studies in the U.S. and abroad. 

&#160; 

Other Cyclodextrin Uses 

Applications of cyclodextrins in personal products and for industrial uses have appeared in many patents and patent applications. Cyclodextrins are used in numerous brand-name household goods, including fabric softeners and air fresheners. With increased manufacturing capacity and supply the prices of the natural cyclodextrins have decreased to the point that use of these materials is considered in even the most price sensitive goods. 

&#160; 

In Japan, at least twelve pharmaceutical preparations are now marketed which contain cyclodextrins; there are also multiple products in Europe and the United States. Cyclodextrins permit the use of all routes of administration. Ease of delivery and improved bioavailability of such well-known drugs as nitroglycerin, dexamethasone, PGE(1&#38;2), and cephalosporin permit these &#8220;old&#8221; drugs to command new market share and sometimes new patent lives. Because of the value added, it is management&#8217;s opinion that the dollar value of the worldwide market for products containing cyclodextrins and for complexes of cyclodextrins can be substantially greater than that of the market sales of the cyclodextrin itself.

&#160; 

Our Cyclodextrin Products 

&#160; 

Substantially all of our revenues are currently derived from the sale of cyclodextrins, including bio-pharmaceuticals containing cyclodextrins, cyclodextrin complexes, the resale of cyclodextrins manufactured by others for our clients to their specifications, and our own licensed cyclodextrin products. We have trademarked certain products under our Trappsol&#174;, Aquaplex&#174;, and AP&#8482;-Flavor product lines. The Trappsol&#174; product line includes basic cyclodextrins, and cyclodextrins with different chemical adducts resulting in more than 100 different cyclodextrins. The Aquaplex&#174; product line includes various cyclodextrins combined with more than 80 different active ingredients that, only as a complex, then become water soluble; we currently list for sale more than 200 different Aquaplex&#174; products. Historically, substantially all of our sales of Aquaplex&#174; products were to one chemical supply house, Sigma-Aldrich Fine Chemical. The APTM-Flavor product lines are cyclodextrins that contain various food flavors. Sales of Trappsol&#174; and Aquaplex&#174; comprise approximately 92% and 8%, respectively, of our 2015 product sales. Our sales of APTM-Flavors are not significant and are primarily targeted to the food industry. The Trappsol&#174; and Aquaplex&#174; products can be used in many industries, the largest being the food and pharmaceutical industries. We do not have any other registered trademarks and do not have any patents or licenses. 

&#160; 

We have protected our service and trade marks by registering them with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. These trademarks add additional visibility to our products and reputation as a leader in the industry. Our website at www.cyclodex.com has grown to be an important cyclodextrin information Internet site. 

&#160; 

Natural and chemically modified cyclodextrins are available from at least four major commercial manufacturers around the world, including Wacker Biosolutions, a division of Wacker Chemie AG (Germany), with a production facility located in Adrian, Michigan; Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation (Japan); Roquettes Freres (France); and Hangzhou Pharma and Chem Co. (China). Prior to 2008, we purchased all of our Aquaplex&#174; cyclodextrin complex products from Cyclodextrin Research &#38; Development Laboratory, which is located in Budapest, Hungary; there are few, if any, other sources in the world for commercial quantities of current Good Manufacturing Practice (c-GMP) cyclodextrin complexes. While we continue to purchase many of our cyclodextrin complexes (Aquaplex&#174;) from Cyclodextrin Research &#38; Development Laboratory, we have also begun purchasing some cyclodextrin complexes from Equinox Chemical in Albany, Georgia. We historically have not had difficulties obtaining natural and chemically modified cyclodextrins from our suppliers and we do not expect to experience any difficulties obtaining adequate cyclodextrins for our current and expected expanded future needs. 

&#160; 

Our Pulse Dryer 

&#160; 

We have identified pulse drying as a technology that promises benefits for turning commercial quantities of aqueous (liquid) solutions of Trappsol&#174; cyclodextrins and Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients and other ingredients into a powdered solid. Pulse drying does this more economically and with less degradation to the materials than the traditional drying processes. 

&#160; 

In 2012 we built a c-GMP (current Good Manufacturing Practice) compliant pulse drying facility to combine cyclodextrins with other ingredients to produce our Aquaplex&#174; products rather than have them produced by others, with the intent that this would allow for a more cost efficient production and shorter lead time of larger bulk quantities. Pulse drying is a proprietary spray drying technology that uses a pulse combustion engine similar to those used in natural gas furnaces to dry aqueous liquid solutions and slurries into fine powder. To date, we have not been able to take full advantage of the capacity that the pulse dryer gives us. We can provide no assurances we will be successful in increasing our sales volume through increased utilization of our pulse dryer. 

&#160; 

Proposed Sale of Cyclodextrin Distribution Business 

&#160; 

Subsequent to the end of 2015, we entered into a non-binding Letter of Intent with C.E. Rick Strattan, a significant stockholder and one of our directors, to sell our cyclodextrin manufacturing and distribution business in order to focus exclusively on the development of cyclodextrin-based biopharmaceuticals for the treatment of disease. Under the Letter of Intent, Mr. Strattan (or his designee) would acquire the purchased assets in exchange for 7.5 million shares of our Common Stock that Mr. Strattan holds, and the assumption by Mr. Strattan of certain liabilities related to that business. The purchased assets will not include our real property or our Trappsol&#174; Cyclo&#8482; assets. However, as part of the transaction, Mr. Strattan will lease CTD's office and manufacturing facilities in Alachua, Florida, with an option to buy the facilities, including our pulse dryer. There can be no assurance that we will close the transaction.

Customers 

&#160; 

We currently sell our products directly to customers in the diagnostics, pharmaceutical, and industrial chemical industries, and to chemical supply distributors. In addition, in 2012, we began offering pulse drying services for the production of raw materials used primarily in industrial and consumer products. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our revenues consisted of 38% biopharmaceuticals, 54% basic natural and chemically modified cyclodextrins, and 8% cyclodextrin complexes. 

&#160; 

Our cyclodextrin sales historically involve small quantities (i.e., less than 1.0 kg). We sell directly to our customers, package the orders at our facility and ship using common carriers. 

&#160; 

The majority of our revenues are from five to ten customers who have historically been repeat purchasers. In 2015 and 2014, one customer (UNO Healthcare, Inc.) accounted for 31% and 57% of our total revenue, respectively. Sigma-Aldrich Fine Chemical, Inc. accounts for almost 100% of our annual sales of Aquaplex&#174;. In a given year, we typically sell to fewer than 200 individual customers. Our customers buy products from us as needed primarily for product research and development purposes. Therefore, it is difficult to predict future sales, as it is dependent on the current cyclodextrin related research and development activities of others, which we have monitored in the past by following the issuance and applications of patents in the US and elsewhere. 

&#160; 

We intend to continue promoting the use of Trappsol&#174; and Aquaplex&#174; products in the research and product development activities of existing and new customers and clients. We plan to pursue licensing rights created as a result of the research work conducted using our products. We will also look for opportunities to develop our own new products; including conducting our own research and development activities and creating a commission based sales force. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

We face competition in the commercialization of our Trappsol&#174; Cyclo&#8482; orphan drug product. An effort to pursue a similar product has been announced by another company, and the disclosed team is composed of professionals in the finance and pharmaceutical industries. We believe our longstanding efforts, our close connections with patient advocacy groups in the U.S. and Europe, and the fact that we have a finished product currently in use in human patients all give us a competitive advantage. 

&#160; 

We have also noted increased competition for the distribution of small quantities of cyclodextrins. Those we have examined are small operations or small offerings of a larger distributor that lack the focus and depth of expertise offered by the Company. They are also most often not price competitive with our products. We believe there is a perceived barrier to entry into the cyclodextrin industry because of the lack of general experience with cyclodextrins. We have established informal business relationships with many of the producers and consumers of cyclodextrins worldwide and, over more than 25 years, we have developed an unmatched experience database. We believe these relationships and market knowledge provide significant business advantages. 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

We are currently pursuing clinical programs in Europe, and expect to conduct clinical trials in the U.S. to gain market authorization of our bio-pharmaceutical product for the treatment of NPC. We plan to make substantial investment in continued research and development of our Trappsol&#174; Cyclo&#8482; product in connection with obtaining approval for marketing the product for the treatment of NPC. As a result of the shift in our business focus and these efforts, research and development expenses increased to $659,000 in 2015, from $94,000 in 2014. 

&#160; 

We also conduct research and development focused on the improvement of our manufacturing processes. We occasionally initiate research to develop a new product such as a novel cyclodextrin complex that has promising applications and is not otherwise available. We do not currently conduct, nor have we historically conducted, research and development activities or on behalf of or jointly with our customers. Our clients bear their own research and development costs.

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

The development, production and marketing of biological products, which include the proposed use of Trappsol&#174; Cyclo&#8482; to treat NPC, are subject to regulation for safety, efficacy and quality by numerous governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries. In the U.S., the development, manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceuticals are subject to extensive regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The FDA, and comparable agencies in foreign countries, not only assesses the safety and efficacy of these products but also regulate, among other things, the testing, manufacture, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising and promotion of such products. The process of obtaining FDA and foreign regulatory approval for a new pharmaceutical is costly and time-consuming. 

&#160; 

Under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the FDA is also given comprehensive authority to regulate the development, production, distribution, labeling and promotion of food and food additives. The FDA&#8217;s authority includes the regulation of the labeling and purity of our food additive and nutraceutical products. In the event the FDA believes any company is not in compliance with the law, the FDA can institute proceedings to detain or seize products, enjoin future violations or assess civil and/or criminal penalties against that Company. 

&#160; 

Trappsol&#174; Cyclo&#8482; has been granted orphan drug status by the FDA. It has been used by a limited number of customers for the treatment of NPC under the supervision of a physician following an Investigational New Drug (IND) protocol approved by the FDA. All of our other products are sold for our customers&#8217; research and development purposes only, and do not require FDA approval. Any use in humans as a drug or food product would require compliance with FDA regulations. Under present FDA regulations, FDA defines drugs as &#8220;articles intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment or prevention of disease in man.&#8221; In 2014, the Company submitted a Type II Drug Master File (DMF) to the FDA for Trappsol&#174; Cyclo&#8482; and it was accepted for filing. This DMF (#028889) can now be cited by researchers seeking IND approval for use of Trappsol&#174; Cyclo&#8482; in the treatment of disease. This same product is also the focus of a clinical program to achieve market authorization in Europe. As such it will be subject to the regulatory authorities in that jurisdiction including, but not limited to, the European Medicines Agency (EMEA). Trappsol&#174; Cyclo&#8482; has also been designated an orphan drug in Europe. 

&#160; 

Most recently, we were advised by the FDA that we have sufficient pre-clinical data to support a clinical trial of Trappsol&#174; Cyclo&#8482; in the United States, and we are preparing an Investigational New Drug (IND) application for Trappsol&#174; Cyclo&#8482; as a treatment for NPC. Following approval of the IND, we expect to conduct a U.S. clinical study in which we will provide Trappsol&#174; Cyclo&#8482; intravenously to NPC patients two years of age and older in order to track biochemical markers of cholesterol metabolism and to measure effects on neurologic, lung and liver symptoms. 

&#160; 

There have also been a number of federal and state legislative changes made over the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical products, government control and other changes to the healthcare system of the U.S. It is uncertain how such legislative changes will be adopted or what actions federal, state or private payers for medical goods and services may take in response to such legislation. We cannot predict the effect such healthcare changes will have on our business, and no assurance can be given that any such reforms will not have a material adverse effect. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we employed nine people on a full-time basis. None of our employees belong to a union. We believe relations with our employees are good. 

&#160; &#160; 

Capital Structure 

&#160; 

In 2004, we authorized a series of &#8220;blank check&#8221; preferred stock consisting of 5,000,000 shares and creating a series of Series A Preferred Stock consisting of a single share that was issued to C.E. &#8220;Rick&#8221; Strattan, our who at the time was our chairman and chief executive officer, in exchange for the surrender of 1,029,412 shares of Common Stock then owned by him. The most significant right of the Series A Preferred Stock was the right to vote with the holders of Common Stock on all matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders, with shares of Series A Preferred Stock being entitled to vote one more than one-half of all votes entitled to be cast by all holders of voting capital stock of the Company on any matter submitted to holders of common shares. This ensured that the votes entitled to be cast by Mr. Strattan as the holder of the Series A Preferred Stock were equal to at least one more than a majority of the total of all votes entitled to be cast by the holders of common shares and the preferred share together. 

&#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

In connection with the closing of a private placement of 10,000,000 shares of our Common Stock to certain accredited investors in February 2014, Mr. Strattan converted his share of Series A Preferred Stock into one million shares of our Common Stock. By its terms, the Series A Preferred Stock was convertible into a number of shares of Common Stock to be agreed mutually by the Company and the holder at the time of conversion. The conversion was effected through a Conversion Agreement, dated as of February 19, 2014, between the Company and Mr. Strattan. The conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock was a condition to the closing of the February 2014 private placement.
