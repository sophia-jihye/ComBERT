 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Background 

Nocopi Technologies, Inc. (hereinafter &#34;Nocopi&#34;, &#34;Registrant&#34; or the &#34;Company&#34;) is a Maryland corporation organized in 1983 that currently develops and markets specialty reactive inks that it believes have applications in the large educational and toy products market. Registrant also develops and markets technologies for document and product authentication which it believes can reduce losses caused by fraudulent document reproduction or by product counterfeiting and/or diversion. Registrant derives its revenues primarily from licensing its technologies on an exclusive or non-exclusive basis to licensees who incorporate the technologies into their product offering and from selling products incorporating its technologies to the licensees or to their licensed printers. 

In the three years preceding 2014, Registrant experienced a period of decline in revenues resulting in significant operating losses and a decline in financial condition and a period of adverse liquidity that affected its business operations through mid-2014 when revenue increases generated from (1) higher license fees and royalties from two licensees in the entertainment and toy products market and (2) higher ink sales to the licensed printer of certain of the Company&#146;s licensees in the entertainment and toy products market began to positively impact Registrant&#146;s cash flow. This causes of the revenue decline and Registrant&#146;s remedial actions are more fully described in Registrant&#146;s Comprehensive Form 10-K for the three years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 11, 2015. As a result of the aforementioned positive effects on its revenues during 2014, Registrant generated revenues of $922,800 in 2014, an increase of 18% compared to $750,200 in 2013. Registrant experienced further revenue growth in 2015 as revenues increased 3% in 2015 to $950,800. Registrant&#146;s net loss in 2015 of $18,000 compared to net income of $7,900 in 2014 is attributable in part to (1) expenses incurred in filing the three year comprehensive Form 10-K in September 2015 and (2) accretion of interest related to the extension of the maturity dates of $95,000 of subordinated debentures. During 2015 Registrant concluded a new multi-year license with one of its two major licensees in the entertainment and toy products market and signed a multi-year license with an Australia-based company in the entertainment and toy products market.

Registrant continues its efforts to raise additional capital, in the form of debt, equity or both to support its working capital requirements and to provide funding for other business opportunities. There are no assurances that Registrant will be able to attract such additional capital.

There can be no assurances that the marketing and product development activities of the Company&#146;s licensees will produce a significant increase in operating revenues for the Company, nor can the timing of any potential revenue increases be predicted.

Entertainment and Toy Technologies and Products 

Registrant&#146;s technology for the entertainment and toy products market consists of removable dyes that can be produced in a variety of colors and can be revealed by rubbing with a fingernail or other firm object such as a plastic pen cap. This technology, introduced in 2004, has been named Rub-it &#38; Color. Registrant believes that this technology does not compromise the confidentiality of its security and authentication technologies whose chemistry is similar but the specific formulations are different for each application. Applications include children&#146;s activity products such as coloring books without crayons or restaurant place mats, educational instruction books and testing review manuals. Registrant has obtained certifications of non-toxicity from the Consumer Products Services, Inc. and the American Society for Testing and Materials Laboratories.

Since January 2012, Registrant has had a license agreement, expiring in 2017, with a licensee who has a significant presence in the entertainment and toy products market which permits this licensee to exclusively market (1) a specific line of products incorporating Registrant&#146;s technologies through a specific distribution channel but permitting Registrant to license the covered technologies to others (including Bendon, Inc., as noted below) for applications and sale through channels of distribution not available to this licensee under the terms of the license and (2) since January 2013, an additional technology on an exclusive basis in certain geographic areas of the world and on a non-exclusive basis in other geographic areas of the world. The licensee displayed products incorporating this additional technology to the marketplace at the American International Toy Fair in February 2015 and initial sales of products incorporating this technology were realized in the second quarter of 2015.

&#160;

Registrant has a license agreement, expiring in 2019, containing guaranteed minimum royalties over the term of the license, with Bendon, Inc. (Bendon), an international, well-known children&#146;s coloring and activity book publishing company that permits Bendon to exclusively market products with other characteristics that incorporate Registrant&#146;s technologies through a distinctly different channel of distribution. The new four-year license agreement with Bendon was completed.in June 2015, replacing a previous three-year license agreement.

These two licensees are well known and highly regarded participants in the entertainment and toy products market with significant market recognition and retail distribution. These two licensees have been distributing products incorporating Registrant&#146;s technologies for more than three years. Since the inception of these licenses, sales of ink to the licensed printer of the licensees have been increasing. The agreements with both licensees contain renewal options but there can be no assurances that the licenses will continue in force at the same or more favorable terms beyond their current termination dates nor can there be any assurances that the relationships with these two licensees will generate significant additional operating revenues for Registrant in the future. 

Since March 2011, Registrant has had a license agreement with a privately-held designer of creative educational products for children granting the licensee the exclusive right to utilize Registrant&#146;s Rub-it &#38; Color ink technology in a newly-created vertical market in the United States. In addition to an annual license fee, Registrant receives a royalty based on units of product produced. The license was renewed in July 2014 for a period of up to three years. There can be no assurances that the marketing efforts of Registrant&#146;s licensee will generate significant additional operating revenues for the Registrant in the future. 

Since November 2012, Registrant has had a license agreement with a privately-held children&#146;s meal entertainment program provider that allows the licensee to use Registrant&#146;s Rub-it &#38; Color ink technology in children&#146;s menus, placemats, butcher paper and certain other products for restaurant use and for sale in certain children&#146;s retail outlets. In December 2014, the license was renewed for a period of six years, expiring in December 2020. There can be no assurances that the marketing efforts of Registrant&#146;s licensee will generate significant additional operating revenues for the Registrant in the future. 

Since April 2013, Registrant has had a license with a nationally known distributor of seasonal boxed greeting cards and other products which permits the licensee to market certain products distributed by the licensee that incorporate specific technologies of the Registrant. Unless renewed, the license terminates in December 2016. The licensee introduced products incorporating Registrant&#146;s technologies in late 2014. Revenues were realized by Registrant in both 2014 and 2015. There can be no assurances that the marketing efforts of Registrant&#146;s licensee will generate significant additional operating revenues for the Registrant in the future.

In October 2015, Registrant negotiated a multi-year license containing guaranteed minimum royalties with a privately-held international publisher of family products and publications based in Australia. Unless renewed, the license terminates in December 2018. The license allows the licensee to market certain products that incorporate specific technologies of the Registrant on an exclusive basis in certain specific countries and on a non-exclusive basis in other countries with the exclusion of the United States, Canada and Mexico. The license agreement contains a renewal option but there can be no assurances that the license will continue in force at the same or more favorable terms beyond its current termination date nor can there be any assurances that the relationship with this new licensee will generate significant additional operating revenues for the Registrant in the future.

Registrant continues to pursue additional licensing opportunities for its technologies in the large worldwide entertainment and toy products market through direct marketing efforts and attendance at trade shows. During 2015, Registrant derived approximately 80% of its 2015 total revenues from its licensees and their licensed printers in the entertainment and toy products market compared to approximately 76% derived from this market in 2014. There can be no assurances that the Registrant&#146;s available resources, even with additional investment, if obtained, for marketing and further technical development of this product line will be sufficient to increase Registrant&#146;s revenues.

Anti-Counterfeiting and Anti-Diversion Technologies and Products 

Continuing developments in copying and printing technologies have made it ever easier to counterfeit a wide variety of documents. Product labels and packaging, retail receipts, event and transportation tickets and the like are all susceptible to counterfeiting, and Registrant believes that losses from such counterfeiting have increased substantially with improvements in the copying and printing technologies. Product counterfeiting has long caused losses to manufacturers of brand name products, and Registrant believes these losses have increased as the counterfeiting of labeling and packaging has become easier. 

&#160;

Registrant's proprietary document authentication technologies are useful to businesses desiring to authenticate a wide variety of printed materials and products. One product incorporating these technologies has the ability to print invisibly on certain areas of a document. When authentication of certain documents is required, the invisible printing can be activated or revealed by use of a special highlighter pen. This technology is marketed under the trademark COPIMARK. Other variations of the COPIMARK technology involve multiple color responses from a common pen, visible marks of one color that turn another color with the pen or visible and invisible marks that turn into a multicolored image. A related technology is Nocopi's RUB &#38; REVEAL system, which permits the invisible printing of an authenticating symbol or code that can be revealed by rubbing a fingernail over the printed area. These technologies provide users with the ability to authenticate documents and detect counterfeit documents. Applications include the authentication of documents having intrinsic value, such as merchandise receipts, checks, travelers' checks, gift certificates and event tickets, and the authentication of product labeling and packaging. When applied to product labels and packaging such technologies allow detection of counterfeit products, the labels and packaging of which would not contain the authenticating marks invisibly printed on the packaging or labels of the legitimate product. Registrant has focused recent marketing efforts on specific industries it believes may be affected by product counterfeiting. These technologies also combat product diversion (i.e. sale of legitimate products through unauthorized distribution channels or in unauthorized markets). A related technology of Registrant, the invisible inkjet technology permits manufacturers and distributors to track the movement of products from production to ultimate consumption when coupled with proprietary software. Management believes that the &#147;track and trace&#148; capability provided by this technology can be attractive to brand owners and marketers. There are no assurances that its ongoing initiatives will result in additional revenues in the future.

Registrant currently participates in the retail receipt and document fraud market through licensing arrangements with seven printers and distributors in the United States and Canada who provide loss prevention products to retailers and other outlets. Registrant believes that these technologies are most efficiently marketed through the use of licensed printers and distributors. Registrant continues to use its available internal sales and technical resources to expand the number of licensees marketing its technologies in this market. During 2015, Registrant derived approximately 10% of its 2015 total revenues from its licensees in the retail loss prevention market compared to approximately 13% derived from this market in 2014. There can be no assurances that Registrant&#146;s strategy for the retail loss prevention market will result in significant additional revenues and cash flow for Registrant. 

The following table illustrates the approximate percentage of Registrant's revenues accounted for by each type of its products for each of the two last fiscal years:

Marketing 

Registrant&#146;s marketing approach focuses on the sufficient flexibility in its products and technologies and its ability to provide innovative, cost effective technologies for the entertainment and toy products market as well as solutions to a wide variety of counterfeiting, diversion and copier fraud problems. As a technology company, Registrant generates revenues primarily by collecting license fees and royalties from market-specific businesses that incorporate Registrant's technologies into their products and, in certain cases, sales of Registrant&#146;s inks to these licensees and their designated manufacturers. Registrant also licenses its technologies directly to end-users. 

Registrant has identified two major markets for its technologies and products, the entertainment and toy product market and the anti-counterfeiting/anti-diversion market. Registrant&#146;s adverse financial condition in the years from 2011 to the present has limited its sales efforts to direct selling by Registrant&#146;s personnel. Sales travel, attendance at trade shows and marketing expenditures have been constrained. Current marketing efforts are focused on Registrant&#146;s developed technologies that can be utilized in geographic or market areas not contractually committed to an existing licensee on an exclusive basis. There can be no assurances that the limited resources Registrant can dedicate to its marketing activities will result in significant additional revenues in the future.

Registrant presently markets its technologies through its own employees. In Europe, certain of its security technologies are marketed by Contrast Technologies, formerly known as Euro-Nocopi, S.A., and a former affiliate of the Registrant, which holds certain European marketing rights with respect to those technologies. 

&#160;

Major Customers 

During 2015, Registrant made sales or obtained revenues equal to 10% or more of Registrant's 2015 total revenues from two non-affiliated customers who individually accounted for approximately 53% and 17%, respectively, of 2015 revenues of the Company. During 2014, Registrant made sales or obtained revenues equal to 10% or more of Registrant's 2014 total revenues from two non-affiliated customers who individually accounted for approximately 47% and 19%, respectively, of 2014 revenues of the Company. 

Manufacturing 

Registrant has a small facility for the manufacture of its security inks. Except for this facility, Registrant does not maintain manufacturing facilities. Registrant presently subcontracts the manufacture of its applications (mainly printing and coating) to third party manufacturers and expects to continue such subcontracting. Because some of the processes that Nocopi uses in its applications are based on relatively common manufacturing technologies, there appears to be no technical or economic reason for Registrant to invest capital in its own manufacturing facilities. 

Registrant has established a quality control program that currently entails laboratory analysis of developed technologies. When warranted, Registrant&#146;s specially trained technicians travel to third party production facilities to install equipment, train client staff and monitor the manufacturing process. 

Patents 

Since its inception, Registrant has received various patents in the United States, Canada, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, France, the United Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, Luxembourg, and Liechtenstein. Registrant currently has obtained patent protection on substantially all of its security inks including the RUB &#38; REVEAL system and the Rub-it &#38; Color technology. Registrant&#146;s latest patent is on a certain newly developed technology that Registrant believes has applications in the entertainment and toy products market. 

When a new product or process is developed, the developer may seek to preserve for itself the economic benefit of the product or process by applying for a patent in each jurisdiction in which the product or process is likely to be exploited. Generally speaking, in order for a patent to be granted, the product or process must be new and be inventively different from what has been previously patented or otherwise known anywhere in the world. Patents generally have a duration of twenty years from the date of application depending on the jurisdiction concerned, after which time any person is free to exploit the product or process covered by a patent. A person who is the owner of a patent has, within the jurisdiction in which the patent is granted, the exclusive right, either directly or through licensees, to prevent any person from infringing on the patent. 

The granting of a patent does not prevent a third party from seeking a judicial determination that the patent is invalid. Such challenges to the validity of a patent are not uncommon and are occasionally successful. There can be no assurance that a challenge will not be filed to one or more of Registrant's patents and that, if filed, such challenge(s) will not be successful. 

In the United States and some other countries, patent applications are automatically published at a specified time after filing. Nocopi is required to pay annuities from time to time on patents to keep them in force; with this in mind, Nocopi makes an annual evaluation of its patents in order to determine which patents it will continue to maintain. In Europe, the territory of Contrast Technologies, formerly known as Euro-Nocopi, S.A. (&#147;Contrast&#148;), annuities for European patents are paid by Contrast.

Research and Development 

Registrant has been involved in research and development since its inception. Although Registrant&#146;s financial condition has forced it to limit funding for research and development in recent years, it intends to continue its research and development activities in three areas, to the extent feasible. First, Registrant will seek to continue to refine its present family of products. Second, Registrant will seek to develop specific customer applications. Finally, Registrant will seek to expand its technology into new areas of implementation. There can be no assurances that Registrant will continue to have funds available to maintain its research and development activities at current or increased levels.

During the years ended December 31, 2015, and December 31, 2014, Registrant expended approximately $128,100 and $121,600, respectively, on research and development.

&#160;

Competition 

In the area of document and product authentication and serialization, Registrant is aware of other covert and overt surface marking technologies requiring decoding implements or analytical methods to reveal certain information. These technologies are offered by other companies for the same anti-counterfeiting and anti-diversion purposes for which the Registrant markets its covert technologies. These include, among others, biological DNA codes, microtaggants, thermochromic, UV and infrared inks as well as encryption, 2D symbology and laser engraving. Nonetheless, Registrant believes its patented and proprietary technologies provide a unique and cost-effective solution to the problem of counterfeiting and gray marketing in the document and product authentication markets it has traditionally sought to exploit.

The entertainment and toy products markets include numerous potential competitors who have significantly greater financial resources and presence in these markets than Registrant.

The loss prevention market includes numerous potential competitors, including large-publicly traded companies such as NCR Corporation and regional paper converters, many of whom have greater financial resources and presence in these markets than Registrant.

Registrant currently has limited resources and competes with businesses that have greater financial resources than Registrant. There can be no assurance that businesses with greater resources than Registrant will not enter Registrant&#146;s markets and compete successfully with Registrant. 

Contrast Technologies (formerly Euro-Nocopi, S.A.) 

Contrast Technologies, formerly known as Euro-Nocopi, S.A., is a former affiliate of Registrant which, since June 2003, has held a perpetual royalty-free license to exploit certain of Registrant&#146;s technologies in Europe. 

Employees 

At March 15, 2016 and December 31, 2015, Registrant had three full-time and two part-time employees.

Financial Information about Foreign and Domestic Operations 

Registrant conducts its operations solely in the United States; however, it does have licensees and customers in Asia and Australia. These licensees and customers accounted for approximately 54% of Registrant&#146;s gross revenues in 2015 and approximately 48% in 2014. Certain information concerning Registrant's foreign and domestic operations is contained in Note 14 to Registrant's Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
