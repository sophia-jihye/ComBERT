 Item 1. Business. 

Overview 

We are a late stage pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of Locilex&#174; (pexiganan cream 0.8%), a novel, first-in-class, broad spectrum, topical antibiotic. Locilex&#174; is a chemically synthesized, 22-amino acid peptide isolated from the skin of the African Clawed Frog. Its novel mechanism of action kills microbial targets by disrupting the bacterial cell membrane; a process known as cell membrane permeability. Locilex&#174; is initially being targeted for the treatment of mild infections of diabetic foot ulcers (or Mild DFI). In 2011, the market for diabetic foot infection therapeutics worldwide was approximately $1.46 billion. Our primary objective is to establish Locilex&#174; as the standard of care for the treatment of patients with Mild DFI. Thereafter, our growth strategy includes potentially expanding the indications for Locilex&#174; to include moderate infections of diabetic foot ulcers (or Moderate DFI) and certain other mild or moderate skin and skin structure infections in superficial wounds. 

We believe that we have a clear clinical and regulatory pathway with the potential for United States Food and Drug Administration (or FDA) approval of Locilex&#174; by the second half of 2017. We are conducting two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials in the United States under the auspicies of our special protocol assessment (or SPA) agreement with the FDA on our Phase 3 program. We intend to complete enrollment in these two pivotal Phase 3, double blind, placebo-controlled superiority studies in the first half of 2016. We successfully conducted two separate Phase 1 skin irritation and skin sensitization studies and we reported data on the first of these two Phase 1 studies in Q3 2014 and reported data on the second Phase 1 study in Q1 2015. If the data from our Phase 3 studies are sufficient to meet the primary endpoint, we expect to submit a new drug application (or NDA) amendment for Locilex&#174; to the FDA and European Medicines Agency (EMA) soon thereafter. We expect to receive a response from the FDA within six months of our NDA amendment submission. In Europe, we anticipate receiving a response from EMA within ten months of submitting a marketing authorization application to the EMA under the centralized process. 

According to the Infectious Disease Society of America (or IDSA), diabetic foot infections (or DFI) may be classified by their clinical severity as mild, moderate, or severe. 47% of DFI patients first present to a treating physician in the mild stage of infection, 34% of DFI patients first present at the moderate stage and 18% of DFI patients first present at the severe stage. At the mild stage, patients can typically be treated on an outpatient basis and amputation risk is minimal (2% to 3% in Mild DFI). When not managed effectively, the potential for Mild DFI to progress to a limb- or life-threatening infection increases dramatically. Published research suggests amputation rates increase in Moderate DFI and severe infections of diabetic foot ulcers (or Severe DFI) to approximately 45% and 75%, respectively. Similarly, the hospitalization rate for Mild DFI patients is approximately 10%, increasing in Moderate DFI and Severe DFI to approximately 55% and 85%, respectively. Thus, DFIs are a major cause of patient morbidity, a substantial burden to the healthcare system, and a source of high financial costs. 

Systemic antibiotics currently prescribed off-label to treat Mild DFI generate resistant pathogens which create infections that are more difficult to treat. Such antibiotics are also associated with toxic side effects in patients who typically have some degree of compromised liver and kidney function. We believe that a topical preparation like Locilex&#174;, which is locally administered on the open wound and skin, offers significant advantages over systemic treatments. As a topical antibiotic, Locilex&#174; affects only the area to which it is applied, and unlike most systemic antibiotics, it does not spread to the entire body through the bloodstream, which is host to a number of different bacteria other than bacteria causing the skin infection. Topical antibiotics are also delivered to the infected area at a higher concentration than those antibiotics that are delivered systemically. As a result, we believe that topical 

antibiotics are less likely to develop bacterial resistance, both because the higher antibiotic concentration more effectively kills the infection-causing bacteria before they develop resistance, and because other bacteria in the bloodstream are not exposed to the Locilex&#174; topical cream. Currently, there are no products, including no antibiotics, specifically approved by the FDA for the treatment of Mild DFI, nor are there any topical antibiotics currently approved for any severity of DFI. As such, we believe that Locilex&#174; has the potential to be the first topical antibiotic approved for the treatment of DFI, as well as the first product of any kind to be labeled specifically for the treatment of Mild DFI. 

We believe that the key attributes of Locilex&#174; are: (i) it has not generated resistant bacteria systemically; (ii) it has not generated cross resistance with other antibiotics; (iii) it has demonstrated activity against a broad spectrum of pathogens, including difficult to treat gram negative, and anaerobic bacteria; (iv) it has not been systemically absorbed; and (v) it has not caused any significant safety or tolerability issues in over 500 patients treated (all data being that from studies prior to the current double blind Phase 3 studies); and (vi) it has demonstrated significant success treating multi-drug resistant bacteria in several laboratory tests and clinical trials performed to date. These attributes lead us to believe that Locilex&#174; has the potential to be positioned as the standard of care to treat patients with Mild DFI. In addition, data generated to date support the potential use of Locilex&#174; to treat a broad array of mild or moderate skin and skin structure infections in superficial wounds. 

As reported in published research, Locilex&#174; has previously demonstrated statistical non-inferiority to a systemic antibiotic in a large-scale, randomized, active-controlled double blind, multi-center clinical study in patients with Mild or Moderate DFI. We have conducted microbiology studies that highlight the sensitivity of resistant bacteria, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (or MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (or VRE), extended-spectrum b -lactamase (or ESBL) and multi-drug resistant (or MDR) bacteria, to pexiganan, the active pharmaceutical ingredient (or API) in Locilex&#174;. Due to the increased global prevalence of resistant bacteria in all types of skin infections, Locilex&#174; may provide an important therapeutic advance. 

We have contracted with third party vendors with respect to all key elements of our clinical and regulatory program, including vendors to: (i) conduct the Phase 3 and Phase 1 clinical trials for Locilex&#174;; (ii) manufacture the API; (iii) formulate the finished product; and (iv) label and package the product. We believe these key relationships will help drive our clinical, regulatory and commercialization program for Locilex&#174; in a timely and efficient manner. 

Locilex&#174; was originally sponsored by Magainin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (or Magainin), which engaged in the FDA review process during 1998 and 1999, ultimately receiving a non-approvable letter based upon two manufacturing issues. We acquired the worldwide rights to pexiganan, the API in Locilex&#174;, from a third party in April 2010. These rights included the prior formulation and all of the clinical and preclinical data generated by Magainin in its FDA review process. This includes data from over 1,000 evaluable patients, including 835 in large-scale, randomized, active-controlled, double blind, multi-center clinical studies as compared to a systemic quinolone standard of care as more fully described below. We believe we have corrected the manufacturing problems encountered by the prior sponsor. See "History of Locilex&#174;" below. 

Corporate Conversion 

We were organized originally as a limited liability company under the laws of the State of Delaware in January 2010. On March 12, 2014, we converted Dipexium Pharmaceuticals, LLC from a Delaware limited liability company to a Delaware corporation. As a result of the corporate conversion: 

&#149; the Class A Membership Interests of Dipexium Pharmaceuticals, LLC became shares of common stock of Dipexium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. pursuant to a conversion ratio of seven shares of common stock of Dipexium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. for each Class A membership interest of Dipexium Pharmaceuticals, LLC previously held. Accordingly, 767,911 Class A Membership 4 

Interests of Dipexium Pharmaceuticals, LLC issued and outstanding immediately prior to the corporate conversion were converted automatically into 5,375,377 shares of Dipexium Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; and 

&#149; all of the outstanding warrants to purchase Class A Membership Interests of Dipexium Pharmaceuticals, LLC became warrants to purchase shares of common stock of Dipexium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in a ratio of seven shares of common stock of Dipexium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. for each Class A membership interest of Dipexium Pharmaceuticals, LLC underlying such warrants, with the effect that warrants to purchase 4,900 Class A Membership Interests of Dipexium Pharmaceuticals, LLC outstanding immediately prior to the corporate conversion automatically converted into warrants to purchase 34,300 shares of Dipexium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. upon consummation of the corporate conversion; and &#149; the exercise price of all of the outstanding warrants was adjusted in the same ratio as the seven-for-one conversion ratio noted above such that all of our outstanding warrants to purchase Class A Membership Interests of Dipexium Pharmaceuticals, LLC which were exercisable at $60 per Class A membership interest were automatically adjusted such that the new exercise price for the outstanding warrants upon consummating the corporate conversion was $8.57 per share, subject to certain adjustments noted in each of the warrants. In connection with the corporate conversion, Dipexium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. continued to hold all property of Dipexium Pharmaceuticals, LLC and assumed all of the debts and obligations of Dipexium Pharmaceuticals, LLC. Dipexium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is governed by a certificate of incorporation filed with the Delaware Secretary of State and bylaws. On the effective date of the corporate conversion, the members of the board of directors of Dipexium Pharmaceuticals, LLC became the members of the board of directors of Dipexium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and the officers of Dipexium Pharmaceuticals, LLC became the officers of Dipexium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. The purpose of the corporate conversion was to reorganize our corporate structure so that our company would continue as a corporation rather than a limited liability company, and so that our existing investors would own our common stock rather than equity interests in a limited liability company. In order to consummate the corporate conversion, a certificate of conversion was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on March 12, 2014. 

Our Strategy 

Our primary objective is to establish Locilex&#174; as the standard of care to treat patients with Mild DFI. The key elements of our strategy are as follows: 

&#149; Complete the Phase 3 program for Locilex&#174;. As a result of our SPA for Locilex&#174;, we believe the clinical pathway for Locilex&#174; is clear. Working with our key third party vendors, we commenced our Phase 3 program in the third quarter of 2014 and we anticipate completing enrollment in the first half of 2016. &#149; Obtain FDA approval of Locilex&#174; for Mild DFI. If our Phase 3 trials meet their primary endpoints, we plan to submit an NDA amendment for Locilex&#174;. We believe that Locilex&#174; may be approved by the FDA within 6 months of submitting our NDA amendment. &#149; Commercially launch Locilex&#174; in the U.S. We plan to utilize a small specialty sales force to launch Locilex&#174;, if it is approved, in the U.S., initially targeting podiatrists and potentially expanding to other specialty healthcare providers. &#149; Expand Locilex&#174;'s FDA-approved uses. If we are able to obtain FDA approval in Mild DFI, we will consider obtaining additional FDA approvals that will enable us to expand the Locilex &#174; label to include patients with Moderate DFI and certain other mild or moderate skin and skin structure infections in superficial wounds. 5 

&#149; Commercially launch Locilex&#174; in Europe. Based upon regulatory advice received to date, if our pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials are completed successfully, we plan to file our marketing authorization application (or MAA) in the E.U. under the centralized process promptly following the completion of our Phase 3 program in the U.S. We will rely on our strong management team, board of directors and scientific advisors to execute our strategy. The individuals on our management team, board of directors and scientific advisors will contribute their significant business development, finance, and regulatory experience to the development and commercialization of Locilex &#174;. 

The Antibiotics Market 

The widespread use of antibiotics has led to the development of resistant strains of bacteria, which limits the effectiveness of existing drugs, leading the World Health Organization to state in 2011 that antibiotic resistance is one of the greatest threats to human health. 

Antibiotic resistance is primarily caused by genetic mutations in bacteria or when bacteria acquire resistance genes from other bacteria. In addition to mutated bacteria being resistant to the drug used for treatment, many bacterial strains can also be cross-resistant, meaning that the use of a particular treatment to address one kind of bacteria can result in resistance to other types of antibiotics. As a result, the effectiveness of many antibiotics has declined, limiting physicians' options to treat serious infections and creating a global health issue. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (or CDC), each year in the U.S., at least two million people acquire serious infections with bacteria that are resistant to one or more of the antibiotics designed to treat those infections. Antibiotic resistance has a significant impact on mortality and contributes heavily to healthcare system costs worldwide. In a 2013 report, the CDC estimates antibiotic resistance contributes to as much as $20 billion in direct healthcare costs and $35 billion in indirect costs (lost productivity) to the U.S. economy. 

In addition to resistance issues, current antibiotic therapies have other limitations, including serious side effects. These side effects may include: severe allergic reaction, decreased blood pressure, nausea and vomiting, suppression of platelets, pain and inflammation at the site of injection, muscle, renal and oto-toxicities, optic and peripheral neuropathies and headaches. Some of these side effects may be significant enough to require that therapy be discontinued or not used. Furthermore, some systemic treatments require clinicians to closely monitor diabetic patients' blood glucose levels and other parameters, increasing the expense and inconvenience of treatment. As such, we believe that there is a need for new antibiotics that have improved potency and pharmacokinetics, effectiveness against resistant bacterial strains, improved side effect profiles and more flexible administration formulations. Topical formulations having no systemic absorption can complement systemic antibiotics with no drug-drug interaction in patients with localized skin infections. 

Market Opportunity for Diabetic Foot Infection 

Based upon our analysis of data from industry sources, the markets for DFI therapeutics in the U.S. and worldwide were $1.01 billion and $1.46 billion, respectively. According to the American Medical Association, approximately 12-14% of the U.S. population has diabetes. Based on long-term trends, the number of newly diagnosed cases is expected to increase annually. In published data, results of a meta-analysis of studies that followed patients with diabetes for periods of time between 12 weeks and four years, researchers reported that the incidence of foot ulceration in diabetics was between 8% and 17%. In another three-year study of patients with diabetes, the cumulative incidence of diabetic foot ulcers (or DFUs) was approximately 6%. The majority (approximately 61%) of DFUs are clinically infected at the time the patient initially presents to a treating physician. In addition, another study shows that the incidence of infection recurrence after complete healing approaches 32%. 

Foot infection is the most frequent diabetic complication requiring hospitalization and the most common precipitating event leading to lower limb amputation. Approximately 1.35 million patients are diagnosed with DFI each year in the U.S., of which approximately 650,000 patients are diagnosed with Mild DFI and approximately 470,000 patients are diagnosed with Moderate DFI. According to published research, 47% of DFI patients present at the mild stage, 34% of DFI patients present at the moderate stage and 18% of DFI patients present at the severe stage. At the mild stage, patients can typically be treated on an outpatient basis and amputation risk is minimal (from 2 to 3% in Mild DFI). When not managed effectively, the potential for Mild DFI to progress to a limb- or life-threatening infection increases dramatically. Published research suggests amputation rates increase in Moderate and Severe DFI to approximately 45% and 75%, respectively. Similarly, the hospitalization rate for Mild DFI patients is approximately 10%, increasing in Moderate and Severe DFI to approximately 55% and 85%, respectively. Thus, DFI are a major cause of patient morbidity, a substantial burden to the healthcare system, and a source of high financial costs. 

The goal of any antibiotic regimen is to treat patients with the least invasive therapy for the shortest amount of time, such that infection control can be achieved while minimizing the risk of antibiotic resistance. According to published research, there has long been interest in treating Mild DFI, the extent of which are confined to superficial skin and skin structures, with topical antibacterial agents. In Mild DFI, assuming equivalent or greater efficacy, we believe that a topical treatment such as Locilex&#174; could hold significant advantages over intravenous and oral therapies by avoiding systemic adverse events, providing increased target site concentration, and most importantly, avoiding patient exposure to systemic antibiotic resistance. 

While various systemic antibiotics have been approved to treat more severe levels of DFI, according to the 2012 IDSA Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Diabetic Foot Infections, there is no FDA approved antibiotic standard of care for the treatment of Mild DFI. In the absence of any approved treatment for Mild DFI, oral antibiotics, such as quinolones, cephalosporins, or penicillins, are considered to be acceptable for off-label use. We are not aware of any ongoing clinical trials evaluating the use of these oral antibiotics for the treatment of Mild DFI. The IDSA does not recommend the use of any currently FDA approved topical antibiotics for the treatment of Mild DFI. In infected DFUs, currently available prescription wound healing products are either contraindicated, indicated for use only after establishing infection control, or indicated for use as an adjunct, and not a substitute for, antibiotics. 

All classes of systemic antibiotics are associated with antibiotic resistance. Furthermore, side effects associated with a variety of systemic therapies include: gastrointestinal infections, liver and renal side effects, serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions, central nervous system effects, QT interval prolongation (effects on heartbeat), myelosuppression (effects on bone marrow), and black box warnings for tendinopathy and tendon rupture. Some of these side effects can be exacerbated by drug-drug interactions in diabetic patients who often are on concurrent medications. Diabetics taking a hypoglycemic agent or insulin must be particularly mindful of blood glucose disturbances that can occur with systemic quinolone antibiotic therapy. 

In addition to the absence of FDA-approved antibiotics or antimicrobials labeled for the treatment of Mild DFI, research published in 2012 stated that no approved topical antibiotic products had demonstrated sufficient activity to recommend for off-label treatment in DFI of any level of severity. However, in a large-scale, randomized, active-controlled, double blind, multi-center clinical trial, topical Locilex&#174; was noted to be as effective as an oral quinolone in treating Mild or Moderate DFI. 

Based upon discussions with our scientific advisors, the following chart highlights the key attributes of products which we believe are the most commonly used products to treat Mild or Moderate DFI: 

Mechanism of Action 

We believe that the particular chemical attributes of Locilex&#174; will differentiate it from other antibiotic agents. Our API, pexiganan acetate, is a new chemical entity that is a chemically synthesized 22-amino acid analog of Magainin II, a natural host defense peptide isolated from skin secretions of the African Clawed Frog. Magainin II is one of a group of peptides that are considered to be the first line of defense against microbial invasion in this host. The peptides are simple linear structures that have a common feature of being basic peptides, which are able to form an amphipathic a -helical structure. This basic a -helical structure is the basis for the peptides' antimicrobial activity as inferred by studies in artificial lipid bilayers. Our API binds to artificial membranes, assumes an a -helical structure, and induces membrane lysis similar to Magainin II. In models of membrane interactions, the peptides exist as a random conformation in aqueous solution and an amphipathic a -helical structure is induced upon an initial ionic interaction with the microbial membrane. This interaction is not mediated by any membrane linked receptor. After ionic interaction, it is postulated that the hydrophobic side of the amphipathic a -helix of the lytic peptide is incorporated into the bilayer. The peptides could interact to form a raft-like structure in the membrane ultimately leading to the disruption of the membrane. In the model, the peptide raft will then realign perpendicular to the membrane surface to form a discrete pore structure with the helical peptides forming the sides of the pore like staves in a barrel. Although membrane disruption as a proposed mechanism of action is shared by other antimicrobial agents (e.g. polymyxin and amphotericin), the distinguishing characteristic of our API is its ability to cause 

membrane disruption in a broad spectrum of microbes including gram-negative bacteria, gram-positive bacteria, and fungi. 

Clinical Development Strategy 

Drug Development Strategy 

We are conducting two Phase 3 clinical trials of Locilex&#174; for the treatment of Mild DFI (DPX-305 and DPX-306) and the clinical trials are being conducted concurrently. We have an SPA with the FDA relating to the trial design for our Phase 3 studies. The SPA calls for us to conduct two placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies, but does not require us to demonstrate equivalence to oral antibiotics. We began enrollment in these studies in the third quarter of 2014 and we anticipate completing enrollment in the first half of 2016. Both trials are large-scale, randomized, active-controlled double blind, multi-center trials designed to establish the superiority of Locilex&#174; over placebo-cream in the treatment of Mild DFI. We are conducting DPX-305 and DPX-306 at up to 74 clinical sites in the U.S. Each trial will be comprised of 180 patients randomized 1:1 (statistical power 90%; P=0.05) to receive standard wound care (off-loading, debridement) plus twice-daily Locilex&#174; cream or placebo-cream for 14 days. The primary endpoint of the trial will be clinical success, defined as resolution of infection per the clinical judgment of each treating physician using the 2012 DFI treatment guidelines. Microbiological success, defined as complete microbiological response, will be assessed as a secondary endpoint. A second secondary endpoint in the Phase 3 studies compares wound measurement at baseline to wound measurement at Day 28. The primary and secondary endpoints will be assessed for each patient at day 28. Furthermore, the FDA agreed that data from the Locilex&#174; arm of the two prior studies conducted by Locilex&#174;'s prior sponsor can be used to supplement our safety database. 

We successfully completed a Phase 1 skin irritation study and a Phase 1 skin sensitization study in 2014. We reported top-line data on the Phase 1 skin irritation study in July 2014 and reported top-line data from the Phase 1 skin sensitization study in February 2015. The first Phase 1 study, for skin irritation, evaluated 30 healthy volunteers, and the second Phase 1 study, for skin sensitization, evaluated 203 healthy volunteers. 

We continue to work with Research Pharmaceutical Services, Inc. as the contract research organization to conduct our Phase 3 studies for Locilex&#174;. This work is being performed under the auspices of RRD International, LLC, which has continued to manage all aspects of our scientific, clinical and regulatory development. 

Previous Phase 3 Clinical Trial Results: Studies 303 and 304 

Locilex&#174; was previously investigated in two Phase 3 clinical trials in patients with DFI, referred to as Studies 303 and 304, conducted by the prior sponsor. Each trial was a large-scale, randomized, active-controlled, double blind, multi-center, non-inferiority trial designed to establish equivalence of Locilex&#174; to systemic ofloxacin. Across both trials, 835 patients received twice-daily Locilex&#174; cream plus placebo pill or twice-daily oral ofloxacin plus placebo cream for 14 to 28 days. The primary endpoint was the resolution of infection or clinical improvement of infection in response to antimicrobial treatment. Secondary endpoints included eradication of the wound pathogens, healing of the ulcer, development of antibiotic resistance to a study drug, and safety. 

Although one study (Study 303) did not demonstrate equivalence, the second study (Study 304) and the combined data for the two trials did demonstrate equivalent results for topical Locilex&#174; and oral ofloxacin in clinical improvement rates and overall microbiological eradication rates. Guidelines for establishing equivalence for these results were a 95% confidence interval with a lower bound delta of &#150;15%, for clinical effectiveness, and a lower bound delta of &#150;20%, for overall microbiological effectiveness. In each case, the confidence interval must cross zero to establish a statistically significant result. Additionally, there were no statistically significant differences in wound assessment scores between patients treated with Locilex&#174; and ofloxacin. Wound assessment scores decreased at the end of treatment visit in both studies for both treatment arms, and they decreased further at the follow-up visit. No serious adverse events were determined to have been related to either Locilex&#174; or ofloxacin. Moreover, the overall incidence of serious adverse events unrelated to the study medication (12% Locilex&#174; to 9% ofloxacin), including worsening cellulitis (2% to 4%) and amputation (2% to 3%), did not differ significantly between treatment arms. Bacterial resistance to ofloxacin emerged in some patients in the control arm, but no significant resistance to Locilex&#174; emerged among patients in the treatment arm. 

A summary table of the primary clinical outcome, secondary microbiological outcome and wound assessment scores are shown below:

Microbiology Study Results 

JMI Laboratories, an independent microbiology testing laboratory, has conducted several microbiology studies on our behalf, including a minimum inhibitory concentration (or MIC) study and a minimum bactericidal concentration (or MBC) study on our behalf, in part, to respond to the FDA's request for information on the sensitivity of certain resistant bacteria to Locilex&#174;. The results demonstrate that resistant bacteria, including MRSA, multi-drug resistant pathogens and VRE, are particularly sensitive to the API in Locilex&#174;. These results were deemed satisfactory by the FDA in February 2012. 

Most if not all of resistant bacteria tested in the MIC and MBC studies are commonly involved with mild or moderate skin and skin structure infections in superficial wounds. Therefore, we believe these data suggest that Locilex&#174; has potential as a standard of care for mild or moderate skin and skin structure infections in superficial wounds. 

In addition, we have finalized protocols for 5 new microbiology studies to be conducted on our behalf by outside vendors including JMI Laboratories, in 2016. These microbiology studies are intended to strengthen our planned regulatory submissions with the FDA and European Medicines Agency and will test the activity of pexiganan against a broad range of contemporary microorganisms to provide supportive information for inclusion in the clinical and in vitro list for proposed US drug labelling and for the planned Marketing Authorization Application to be filed in the EU. We anticipate that these 5 studies will be completed on our behalf in the first half of 2016. 

Manufacturing and Supply 

We utilize three contract manufacturers (or CMOs) to produce Locilex&#174;. Our manufacturing supply chain for Locilex&#174; starts with PolyPeptide Laboratories, Inc. which manufactures pexiganan, the API in Locilex&#174;. At our direction, Polypeptide Laboratories delivers the API to DPT Laboratories, Inc., which formulates the API into a cream formulation on our behalf. DPT Laboratories then delivers the formulated product to Almac Group Limited, which labels, packages, and delivers the finished goods for clinical trials as we request. 

In the late 1990s, the prior sponsor engaged in an FDA review process for a prior formulation of Locilex&#174;. In its 1999 non-approvable letter, the FDA identified two cGMP manufacturing issues. The first issue concerned the stability of the formulated product. Examination of the formulated product over time showed evidence of water separation from the cream matrix. The second issue related to the purity level of the API in the product. The prior source of the API yielded a purity level as low as 95%. 

After acquiring the rights to Locilex&#174;, we developed a detailed product development plan to arrive at an optimized formulation to address these issues to the satisfaction of the FDA. We believe that the changes we made to the formulation have resolved the previously observed product separation. 

PolyPeptide Laboratories, our API manufacturer, has now completed the manufacture of the first of three validation lots of API that we will need for our planned submission of a NDA amendment in the U.S. and marketing authorization application in Europe. We are planning to initiate the manufacture of additional validation lots per regulatory guidelines, and these tasks will be performed starting in the first quarter and second quarter of 2016, respectively. 

We have also scaled up the size of our API lots and have completed successfully our scale-up of the first formulated batch of Locilex cream at the 140 kg batch size. The scale-up was achieved successfully in the view of our manufacturing advisors. We have incorporated this commercial-scale batch in the OneStep Phase 3 trials to support our anticipated regulatory submissions. 

As previously reported, we continue to anticipate that we will have adequate stability data on 3 cGMP registration batches of product supply well ahead of completion of the OneStep Phase 3 clinical trials. These 3 cGMP registration batches of product supply currently are subject to ongoing stability testing. Our stability testing is conducted in compliance with the ICH Guideline Q1A(R2): International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, ICH Harmonised Tripartate Guideline, Stability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products, Current Step 4 version, Dated 6 February 2003. The purpose of the stability testing is to provide evidence on how the quality of a drug substance or drug product varies with time under the influence of a variety of environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and light, and to establish a re-test period for the drug substance or a shelf life for the drug product and recommended storage conditions. We believe and our CROs have confirmed that we will have sufficient stability data on the three cGMP batches of commercial supply by mid-2016; to support a new drug application amendment which we anticipate filing soon after receiving top line Phase 3 data. At the present time, the stability data supports a shelf life of at least 24 months for Locilex&#174;. 

We also believe our peptide is highly purified. The impurity levels of the API used in our commercial scale batch of Locilex&#174; has been confirmed to be 99.4% pure for the API used in our cGMP batches. 

In October 2013, we submitted our manufacturing data, including data from the first 30 kg cGMP batch as well as 18-month stability data on our 30 kg non-cGMP batch, to the FDA, and in December 2013 the FDA indicated in written communications with us that Locilex&#174;'s stability and purity levels were acceptable for use in our Phase 3 studies. As a result of the aforementioned activities, we believe we have resolved the stability and purity concerns previously articulated by the FDA. 

Commercial Plans 

We intend to market and sell Locilex&#174;, if approved, through a small, specialty sales force primarily to podiatrists at extended care facilities, wound care clinics, high volume group podiatry practices, and other treatment centers that specialize in the care of patients with DFI. Initially, we intend to hire a senior national sales officer, a senior marketing officer, and either directly or through a contract sales organization, a small team of fully dedicated Locilex&#174; sales representatives. Based on current data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we estimate that there are approximately 13,700 podiatrists in the U.S. Our marketing efforts may also include other specialty healthcare providers. 

Intellectual Property 

We hold rights to a U.S. patent covering our proprietary formulation of Locilex&#174; and the method of using it for the treatment of skin and wound infections (U.S. Patent Number 8,530,409). This patent was granted in September 2013 and expires in the U.S. in June 2032. The patent incorporates discoveries made by Dow Pharmaceutical Sciences, Inc. (later acquired by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.). The application which gave rise to U.S. Patent No. 8,520,409 was assigned to us in June 2013. In addition, we have filed a Patent Cooperation Treaty (or PCT) application claiming priority to U.S. Patent No. 8,520,409 that will allow us to seek corresponding protection outside of the U.S., including in Europe, Japan, China, Australia, and Korea, as well as in other PCT jurisdictions. We commenced national stage patent prosecutions internationally in the fourth quarter of 2014 and will continue to prosecute such patent claims throughout 2015 and potentially 2016. We announced in February 2016 that patents were granted by patent offices in Australia and New Zealand which extend out to 2033 in each of these territories. We anticipate completing the national stage patent prosecutions in other international regions throughout 2016 and potentially 2017. 

In addition to this patent, we hold an exclusive sublicense to the composition-of-matter patent covering the pexiganan technology (U.S. Patent No. 5,912,231) which expires in June 2016, not including any patent term extension that we expect to seek under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (or the Hatch-Waxman Act). We acquired this sublicense when we acquired the rights to Locilex&#174; in April 2010. Our rights to practice the pexiganan technology are originally derived through a license agreement between Scripps Research Institute (or Scripps), the inventor of the pexiganan technology, and Multiple Peptide Systems, Inc. (or MPS). MPS then sublicensed the pexiganan technology to the prior sponsor of the pexiganan program. In October 1996, both of the license and sublicense agreements were amended by Scripps, MPS and the prior sponsor of Locilex&#174; to confirm that the license and sublicense were fully-paid, royalty free and of indefinite duration, with no further economic obligations for the practice of the pexiganan technology. 

Although U.S. Patent 5,912,231 supplements our existing intellectual property portfolio, we are chiefly reliant on our U.S. Patent 8,530,409, which covers the novel formulation and method of use for Locilex&#174; and provides for substantially longer patent coverage than U.S. Patent 5,912,231, and that U.S. Patent 8,530,409's attributes as a topical formulation, its potentially broader scope of coverage and opportunity for foreign patent protection offer greater benefits to us than U.S. Patent 5,912,231. As 

such, we have not yet engaged in any discussions with Scripps regarding a possible patent term extension for U.S. Patent No. 5,912,231. If and when we decide to apply for an extension, we will we will need to work with Scripps throughout the application process to facilitate its approval. 

Competition 

The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry is characterized by intense competition, rapid product development and technological change. Competition is intense among manufacturers of prescription pharmaceuticals and other product areas where we may develop and market products in the future. Most of our competitors are large, well established pharmaceutical or healthcare companies with considerably greater financial, marketing, sales and technical resources than are available to us. Additionally, many of our competitors have research and development capabilities that may allow such competitors to develop new or improved products that may compete with Locilex&#174;. Our product could be rendered obsolete or made uneconomical by the development of new products to treat Mild DFI or other acute bacterial skin infections. 

Our business, financial condition and results of operation could be materially adversely affected by any one or more of such developments. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations are also conducting research activities and seeking patent protection and may commercialize products on their own or with the assistance of major healthcare companies for indications for which we are developing Locilex&#174;. We are aware of certain development projects for products to treat or prevent certain diseases targeted by us. The existence of these potential products or other products or treatments of which we are not aware, or products or treatments that may be developed in the future, may adversely affect the marketability of Locilex&#174;. 

Even if Locilex&#174; receives regulatory approval, of which there can be no assurance, our competitors' drugs may be more effective, more effectively marketed and sold, or less costly than Locilex&#174;, and may render our product obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing Locilex&#174;. 

Although there are currently no products approved specifically to treat Mild DFI, we anticipate that, if approved, Locilex&#174; will compete with other anti-infective products that are marketed for the general treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. These include systemic products that have been generally accepted by the ISDA to treat DFI at other levels of severity such as linezolid (marketed by Pfizer, Inc. as Zyvox), piperacillin/tazobactam (marketed by Pfizer, Inc. as Zosyn), ertapenam (marketed by Merck &#38; Co. as Invanz); generic products recommended by the IDSA for off-label use in the treatment of all severity levels of DFI such as dicloxacillin, clindamycin, cephalexin, ofloxacin, trimethoprim, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and others; as well as antimicrobial wound care dressings such as medicinal grade honey and antiseptics such as silver and iodine. Furthermore, we are aware of other development stage topical or systemic products that may represent significant competition if approved. These include, but are not limited to nemonoxacin/TG-873870 (under development by TaiGen Biotechnology Co., Ltd.), Dermacyn (under development by Oculus Innovative Sciences, Inc.), SR-0379 (under development by Shionigi &#38; Co., Ltd) and Cogenzia (under development by Innocoll, Inc.). 

In addition, some of our competitors have greater experience than we do in conducting preclinical and clinical trials and obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in obtaining FDA or other regulatory approvals for drug candidates more rapidly than we do. Companies that complete clinical trials, obtain required regulatory agency approvals and commence commercial sale of their drugs before their competitors may achieve a significant competitive advantage. Locilex&#174; therefore may not be commercially competitive with existing products or products 

under development. With respect to Mild, Moderate or Severe DFI specifically, such competitors include very large international organizations such as Pfizer, Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Johnson &#38; Johnson, Merck &#38; Co., and GlaxoSmithKline plc. 

History of Locilex&#174; 

In August 1992, the prior sponsor of Locilex&#174;, Magainin, submitted an initial IND for the prior formulation of Locilex&#174; to study broad spectrum anti-infective activity for the treatment of superficial and complicated dermatological infections. Another IND was submitted in November 1993 to cover a new indication for the treatment of DFI. In the late 1990s, the prior sponsor tested the prior formulation of Locilex&#174;, with over 1,000 human subjects exposed without safety concerns, to such prior formulation of Locilex&#174;, including 835 evaluable patients in two Phase 3 clinical trials. The Phase 3 trial results showed that such prior formulation of topical Locilex&#174; had an approximate 80% response rate measured as resolution or improvement in infection in patients who under today's standards would be considered to have Mild or Moderate DFI. See "&#151;Clinical Development Strategy&#151;Phase 3 Clinical Trial Results: Studies 303 and 304" above. 

The FDA Advisory Committee reviewing Locilex&#174; at the time unanimously approved the safety of the product, but did not approve its efficacy and recommended an additional Phase 3 placebo controlled trial. In its 1999 non-approvable letter, the FDA identified certain cGMP manufacturing deficiencies, namely stability and quality control issues, and questions regarding the comparability of the product used in the Phase 3 program versus that which was produced at commercial scale. We believe that these hurdles and a lack of financing ultimately caused Magainin (later renamed Genaera Corporation) to deprioritize the product within their product pipeline. MacroChem Corporation (or MacroChem) licensed the technology in late 2007, after several years of attempting to remediate the manufacturing deficiencies. In February 2009, MacroChem was acquired by Access Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (or Access), which focused on oncology and oncology supportive care product candidates. Rights to Locilex&#174; reverted to Genaera Liquidating Trust (established to sell the drug related assets of Genaera Corporation in liquidation) when Access failed to start a Phase 3 trial by the two-year anniversary of the effective date of the license agreement, triggering a termination right for Genaera Liquidating Trust in December 2009. 

In April 2010, we acquired the worldwide rights to pexiganan, the API in Locilex&#174;, and the prior formulation of the product and all related assets after participating in a public auction for our product conducted by Genaera Liquidating Trust. During the period between the FDA non-approval letter received in July 1999 and the second half of 2006, SmithKline Beecham Corporation (now part of GlaxoSmithKline plc) held the exclusive distribution rights to Locilex&#174; in the U.S. 

In March 2011, we exercised our exclusive option to buy out the downstream, success-based milestones and royalty obligations related to Locilex&#174; and currently own 100% of our product candidate. 

Government Regulation and Product Approval 

Governmental authorities in the U.S., at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, packaging, promotion, storage, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA through the NDA process before they may be legally marketed in the U.S. and by the European Medicines Agency (or EMA) through the Marketing Authorisation Application (or MAA) process before they may be legally marketed in Europe. Our product candidates will be subject to similar requirements in other countries prior to marketing in those countries. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the 

subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 

U.S. Government Regulation 

NDA Approval Processes 

In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (or FDCA) and implementing regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process or approval process, or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. These sanctions could include: 

&#149; refusal to approve pending applications; &#149; withdrawal of an approval; &#149; imposition of a clinical hold; &#149; warning letters; &#149; product seizures; &#149; total or partial suspension of production or distribution; or &#149; injunctions, fines, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following: 

&#149; completion of nonclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies conducted according to Good Laboratory Practices (or GLPs) or other applicable regulations; &#149; submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application (or IND), which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; &#149; performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to Good Clinical Practices (or GCPs) to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use; &#149; submission to the FDA of an NDA; &#149; satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current cGMPs to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug's identity, strength, quality and purity; and &#149; FDA review and approval of the NDA. Once a pharmaceutical candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical or nonclinical testing stage. Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some nonclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. In addition to including the results of the nonclinical studies, the IND will also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the first phase lends itself to an efficacy determination. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, places the IND on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must 

resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin. A clinical hold may occur at any time during the life of an IND, and may affect one or more specific studies or all studies conducted under the IND. 

All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs. They must be conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, dosing procedures, research subject selection and exclusion criteria and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and progress reports detailing the status of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA annually. Sponsors also must timely report to FDA serious and unexpected adverse reactions, any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigation brochure, or any findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug. An institutional review board, or IRB, at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the protocol before a clinical trial commences at that institution and must also approve the information regarding the trial and the consent form that must be provided to each research subject or the subject's legal representative, monitor the study until completed and otherwise comply with IRB regulations. 

Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 

&#149; Phase 1. The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and elimination. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the product may be inherently too toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. &#149; Phase 2. Clinical trials are performed on a limited patient population intended to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. &#149; Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These studies are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. Human clinical trials are inherently uncertain and Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be successfully completed. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time for a variety of reasons, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB's requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 

During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to the submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2 and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date and for the FDA to provide advice on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the meeting at the end of Phase 2 to discuss their Phase 2 clinical results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial that they believe will support the approval of the new drug. If a Phase 2 clinical trial is the subject of discussion at the end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA, a sponsor may be able to request a SPA, the purpose of which is to reach agreement with the FDA on the Phase 3 clinical trial protocol design and analysis that will form the primary basis of an efficacy claim. 

According to published guidance on the SPA process, a sponsor which meets the prerequisites may make a specific request for a SPA and provide information regarding the design and size of the proposed clinical trial. The FDA is supposed to evaluate the protocol within 45 days of the request to assess whether the proposed trial is adequate, and that evaluation may result in discussions and a request for additional information. A SPA request must be made before the proposed trial begins, and all open issues must be resolved before the trial begins. If a written agreement is reached, it will be documented and made part of the record. The agreement will be binding on the FDA and may not be changed by the sponsor or the FDA after the trial begins except with the written agreement of the sponsor and the FDA or if the FDA determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or efficacy of the drug was identified after the testing began. 

Concurrent with clinical trials, sponsors usually complete additional animal safety studies and also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing commercial quantities of the product in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug and the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the quality, purity and potency of the drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its proposed shelf-life. 

The results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests and other control mechanisms, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of user fees, but a waiver of such fees may be obtained under specified circumstances. The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. It may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. 

Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. NDAs receive either standard or priority review. A drug representing a significant improvement in treatment, prevention or diagnosis of disease may receive priority review. The FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical or other data. Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant. The FDA may refer the NDA to an advisory committee for review and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured and tested. We anticipate that our NDA submission, which may technically be classified as an amended NDA (a so-called Class II resubmission), will address the manufacturing concerns previously articulated by the FDA regarding the prior formulation of Locilex&#174;. Should our NDA be accepted for review, the FDA is supposed to respond within six months of submission. 

Recent Changes to the Regulatory Landscape for Anti-Infective Drugs 

The analytic approach of the FDA's Anti-Infective Drugs Division has undergone evolution in recent years, primarily driven by concerns that increasingly less effective antibiotics may have been approved in the last 10 to 15 years. The impact of these changes was a rethinking of how antibiotic efficacy is measured in clinical trials, and a review of the statistical tools used to analyze the data. In March 2009, the FDA published a draft guidance entitled "Guidance for Industry Community-Acquired 

Bacterial Pneumonia: Developing Drugs for Treatment" and in August 2010, it published draft guidance (subsequently published as final guidance in October 2013) entitled "Guidance for Industry Acute Bacterial Skin and Skin Structure Infections: Developing Drugs for Treatment" (or 2010 Guidance). The purpose of this guidance was to address many of the uncertainties regarding what the FDA expected from sponsors and clinical trials for the indications of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. 

The FDA asked sponsors to include additional measurements in their evaluation of efficacy that the FDA believes are more objective and less susceptible to interpretation by investigators. Non-inferiority comparisons of drugs are the standards for antibiotics, and non-inferiority margins are the margins used in the statistical analysis comparing two treatment arms in a study. These are the statistical margins or rules used to distinguish the degree of potential difference between two antibiotics in a study. In September 2010, one month after issuing the 2010 Guidance, the FDA approved the first antibiotic NDA reviewed pursuant to these new endpoints and non-inferiority margins. The clinical protocol that was reviewed by the FDA in support of our SPA with the FDA includes provisions that are consistent with the 2010 Guidance, as well as the FDA's final guidance published in October 2013. 

Expedited Review and Approval 

The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track, priority review, and accelerated approval, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing drugs, and/or provide for the approval of a drug on the basis of a surrogate endpoint. Even if a drug qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the drug no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the time period for FDA review or approval will be shortened. Generally, drugs that are eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. For example, Fast Track is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and fill unmet medical needs. Priority review is designed to give drugs that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists an initial review within six months as compared to a standard review time of ten months. 

Although Fast Track and priority review do not affect the standards for approval, the FDA will attempt to facilitate early and frequent meetings with a sponsor of a Fast Track designated drug and expedite review of the application for a drug designated for priority review. Accelerated approval, which is described in Subpart H of 21 CFR Part 314, provides for an earlier approval for a new drug that is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and that fills an unmet medical need based on a surrogate endpoint. A surrogate endpoint is a laboratory measurement or physical sign used as an indirect or substitute measurement representing a clinically meaningful outcome. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a product candidate receiving accelerated approval perform post-marketing clinical trials. 

In the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (or FDASIA), which was signed into law in July 2012, Congress encouraged the FDA to utilize innovative and flexible approaches to the assessment of products under accelerated approval. The law required the FDA to issue related draft guidance within a year after the law's enactment and also promulgate confirming regulatory changes. In June 2013, the FDA published a draft Guidance for Industry entitled, "Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions&#151;Drugs and Biologics" which provides guidance on FDA programs that are intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs as well as threshold criteria generally applicable to concluding that a drug is a candidate for these expedited development and review programs. In addition to the Fast Track, accelerated approval and priority review programs discussed above, the FDA also provided guidance on a new program for Breakthrough Therapy designation. A request for Breakthrough Therapy designation should be submitted concurrently with, or 

as an amendment to an IND. FDA has already granted this designation to around 30 new drugs and recently approved a couple of Breakthrough Therapy designated drug. 

Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 

Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our drug candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product's approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND, and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for extension must be made prior to expiration of the patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we intend to apply for restorations of patent term for some of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond their current expiration date, depending on the expected length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the submission of the relevant NDA. 

Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the U.S. to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (or ANDA) or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an approved NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. 

FDASIA includes the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now Act (or GAIN Act), which is intended to provide incentives for the development of new qualified infectious disease products. A new drug that is designated as a qualified infectious disease product after a request by the sponsor that is made before an NDA is submitted will be eligible, if approved, for an additional five years of exclusivity beyond any period of exclusivity to which it would have previously been eligible. In addition, a qualified infectious disease product will receive priority review and Fast Track designation. Qualified infectious disease products are defined as antibacterial or antifungal drugs intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections that are resistant to treatment, or that treat qualifying resistant pathogens identified by the FDA. Examples of pathogens that may be designated as a qualifying pathogen include MRSA, VRE and multi-drug resistant gram-negative bacteria. We believe that Locilex&#174; will qualify for this designation because it has already shown promising results in treating several qualifying pathogens in preclinical studies and clinical trials, and we have applied for "qualified infectious disease product" 

status under the GAIN Act. On January 14, 2014, we received notification from the FDA that it had denied our request for such status, primarily because there is no clinical evidence that Mild DFI is a serious condition. The FDA invited us to reapply either now if such evidence exists or in the future if such evidence becomes available or if we would like to target another clinical indication. Accordingly, we intend to re-apply for "qualified infectious disease product" status in the first quarter of 2014 based on clinical evidence from the prior Studies 303 and 304 that demonstrates that Locilex&#174; successfully treats resistant bacteria, including MRSA, multi-drug resistant bacteria and VRE, in patients with Moderate DFI, which we believe is widely accepted as a serious condition. 

Post-approval Requirements 

Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. In addition, the FDA may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products that have been commercialized, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. 

Any drug products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things: 

&#149; record-keeping requirements; &#149; reporting of adverse experiences with the drug; &#149; providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information; &#149; drug sampling and distribution requirements; &#149; notifying the FDA and gaining its approval of specified manufacturing or labeling changes; and &#149; complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and some state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. 

We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products. Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. 

From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be. 

Regulation Outside of the U.S. 

In addition to regulations in the U.S., we will be subject to regulations of other countries governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of countries outside of the U.S. before we can commence clinical trials in such countries and approval of the regulators of such countries or economic areas, such as the E.U., before we may market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. 

Under E.U. regulatory systems, a company may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure, which is compulsory for medicines produced by biotechnology or those medicines intended to treat AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders or diabetes and optional for those medicines which are highly innovative, provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all E.U. member states. The decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions. Under this procedure, the holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the remaining member states. Within 90 days of receiving the applications and assessments report, each member state must decide whether to recognize approval. If a member state does not recognize the marketing authorization, the disputed points are eventually referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states. 

Reimbursement 

Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other therapies, they may not cover our products after approved as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis. 

The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (or MMA) imposed new requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities which will provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Part D plans include both stand-alone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for our products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than 

the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors. 

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. A plan for the research will be developed by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures will be made to Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payors, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of any product, if any such product or the condition that it is intended to treat is the subject of a study. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor's product could adversely affect the sales of our product candidates. If third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis. 

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (or collectively, the ACA), enacted in March 2010, is expected to have a significant impact on the health care industry. ACA is expected to expand coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. With regard to pharmaceutical products, among other things, the ACA is expected to expand and increase industry rebates for drugs covered under Medicaid programs and make changes to the coverage requirements under the Medicare Part D program. We cannot predict the impact of the ACA on pharmaceutical companies, as many of the ACA reforms require the promulgation of detailed regulations implementing the statutory provisions which has not yet occurred. In addition, some members of the U.S. Congress have been seeking to overturn at least portions of the legislation and we expect they will continue to review and assess this legislation and alternative health care reform proposals. Any legal challenges to the ACA, as well as Congressional efforts to repeal the ACA, add to the uncertainty of the legislative changes enacted as part of the ACA. 

In addition, in some non-U.S. jurisdictions, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the E.U. provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the E.U. do not follow price structures of the U.S. and generally tend to be significantly lower.
