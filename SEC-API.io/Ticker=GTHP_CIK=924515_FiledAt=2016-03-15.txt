 Item 1. Business 

&#160;

Overview 

We are a medical technology company focused on developing innovative medical devices that have the potential to improve healthcare. Our primary focus is the sales and marketing of our LuViva&#174; Advanced Cervical Scan non-invasive cervical cancer detection device. The underlying technology of LuViva primarily relates to the use of biophotonics for the non-invasive detection of cancers. LuViva is designed to identify cervical cancers and precancers painlessly, non-invasively and at the point of care by scanning the cervix with light, then analyzing the reflected and fluorescent light.

&#160;

LuViva provides a less invasive and painless alternative to conventional tests for cervical cancer screening and detection. Additionally, LuViva improves patient well-being not only because it eliminates pain, but also because it is convenient to use and provides rapid results at the point of care. We focus on two primary applications for LuViva: first, as a cancer screening tool in the developing world, where infrastructure to support traditional cancer-screening methods is limited or non-existent, and second, as a triage following traditional screening in the developed world, where a high number of false positive results cause a high rate of unnecessary and ultimately costly follow-up tests.

&#160;

Screening for cervical cancer represents one of the most significant demands on the practice of diagnostic medicine. As cervical cancer is linked to a sexually transmitted disease&#8212;the human pampillomavirus (HPV)&#8212;every woman essentially becomes &#8220;at risk&#8221; for cervical cancer simply after becoming sexually active. In the developing world there are approximately 2.0 billion women aged 15 and older who are potentially eligible for screening with LuViva. Guidelines for screening intervals vary across the world, but U.S. guidelines call for screening every three years. Traditionally, the Pap smear screening test, or Pap test, is the primary cervical cancer screening methodology in the developed world. However, in developing countries, cancer screening using Pap tests is expensive and requires infrastructure and skill not currently existing, and not likely to be developed in the near future, in these countries.

&#160;

We believe LuViva is the answer to the developing world&#8217;s cervical cancer screening needs. Screening for cervical cancer in the developing world often requires working directly with foreign governments or non-governmental agencies (NGOs). By partnering with governments or NGOs, we are able to provide immediate access to cervical cancer detection to large segments of a nation&#8217;s population as part of national or regional governmental healthcare programs, eliminating the need to develop expensive and resource-intensive infrastructures.

&#160;

In the developed world, we believe LuViva offers a more accurate and ultimately cost-effective triage medical device, to be used once a traditional Pap test indicates the possibility of cervical cancer. Due to the high number of false positive results from Pap tests, traditional follow-on tests entail increased medical treatment costs. We believe these costs can be minimized by utilizing LuViva as a triage to determine whether follow-on tests are actually warranted.

&#160;

We believe our non-invasive cervical cancer detection technology can be applied to the early detection of other cancers as well. In 2013, we announced a license agreement with Konica Minolta, Inc. allowing us to manufacture and develop a non-invasive esophageal cancer detection product from Konica Minolta based on our biophotonic technology platform. Early market analyses of our biophotonic technology indicated that skin cancer detection was also promising, but currently we are focused primarily on the large-scale commercialization of LuViva.

&#160;

&#160;

The Need for LuViva 

Cancer is a group of many related diseases. All forms of cancer involve the out-of-control growth and spread of abnormal cells. Normal cells grow, divide, and die in an orderly fashion. Cancer cells, however, continue to grow and divide and can spread to other parts of the body. In America, half of all men and one-third of all women will develop some form of cancer during their lifetimes. According to the American Cancer Society, the sooner a cancer is found and treatment begins, the better a patient&#8217;s chances are of being cured. We began investigating the applications of our biophotonic technology to cancer detection before 1997, when we initiated a preliminary market analysis. We concluded that our biophotonic technology had applications for the detection of a variety of cancers through the exposure of tissue to light. We selected detection of cervical cancer and skin cancer from a list of the ten most promising applications to pursue initially, and ultimately focused primarily on our LuViva cervical cancer detection device.

&#160;

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Cervical cancer is a cancer that begins in the lining of the cervix (which is located in the lower part of the uterus). Cervical cancer forms over time and may spread to other parts of the body if left untreated. There is generally a gradual change from a normal cervix to a cervix with precancerous cells to cervical cancer. For some women, precancerous changes may go away without any treatment. While the majority of precancerous changes in the cervix do not advance to cancer, if precancers are treated, the risk that they will become cancers can be greatly reduced.

&#160;

The Developing World 

According to the most recent data published by the World Health Organization (WHO), cervical cancer is the fourth most frequent cancer in women worldwide, with an estimated 530,000 new cases in 2012. For women living in less developed regions, however, cervical cancer is the second most common cancer, with an estimated 445,000 new cases in 2012 (84% of the new cases worldwide). In 2012, approximately 270 000 women died from cervical cancer; more than 85% of these deaths occurring in low- and middle-income countries.

&#160;

As noted by the WHO, in developed countries, programs are in places that enable women to get screened, making most pre-cancerous lesions identifiable at stages when they can easily be treated. Early treatment prevents up to 80% of cervical cancers in these countries. In developing countries, however, limited access to effective screening means that the disease is often not identified until it is further advanced and symptoms develop. In addition, prospects for treatment of such late-stage disease may be poor, resulting in a higher rate of death from cervical cancer in these countries.

&#160;

We believe that the greatest need and market opportunity for LuViva lies in screening for cervical cancer in developing countries where the infrastructure for traditional screening may be limited or non-existent.

&#160;

We are actively working with distributors in the following countries to implement government-sponsored screening programs: Turkey, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Kenya and Nigeria. The number of screening candidates in those countries is approximately 246 million and represents 3 of the 10 most populous countries in the world.

&#160;

&#160;

The Developed World 

The Pap test, which involves a sample of cervical tissue being placed on a slide and observed in a laboratory, is currently the most common form of cervical cancer screening. Since the introduction of screening and diagnostic methods, the number of cervical cancer deaths in the developed world has declined dramatically, due mainly to the increased use of the Pap test. However, the Pap test has a wide variation in sensitivity, which is the ability to detect the disease, and specificity, which is the ability to exclude false positives. A study by Duke University for the U.S. Agency for Health Care Policy and Research published in 1999 showed Pap test performance ranging from a 22%-95% sensitivity and 78%-10% specificity, although new technologies improving the sensitivity and specificity of the Pap test have recently been introduced and are finding acceptance in the marketplace. About 60 million Pap tests are given annually in the United States, at an average price of approximately $26 per test.

&#160;

After a Pap test returns a positive result for cervical cancer, accepted protocol calls for a visual examination of the cervix using a colposcope, usually followed by a biopsy, or tissue sampling, at one or more locations in the cervix. This method looks for visual changes attributable to cancer. There are about two million colposcope examinations annually in the United States and Europe. In 2003, the average cost of a stand-alone colposcope examination in the United States was $185 and the average cost of a colposcopy with biopsy was $277.

&#160;

Given this landscape, we believe that there is a material need and market opportunity for LuViva as a triage device in the developed world where LuViva represents a more cost-effective method of verifying a positive Pap test than the alternatives.

&#160;

The LuViva Advanced Cervical Scan 

&#160;

LuViva is designed to identify cervical cancers and precancers painlessly, non-invasively and at the point of care by scanning the cervix with light, then analyzing the light reflected from the cervix. The information presented by the light would be used to indicate the likelihood of cervical cancer or precancers. Our product, in addition to detecting the structural changes attributed to cervical cancer, is also designed to detect the biochemical changes that precede the development of visual lesions. In this way, cervical cancer may be detected earlier in its development, which should increase the chances of effective treatment. In addition to the device itself, operation of LuViva requires employment of our single-use, disposable calibration and alignment cervical guide.

&#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

To date, thousands of women in multiple international clinical settings have been tested with LuViva. As a result, more than 25 papers and presentations have been published regarding LuViva in a clinical setting, the most recent being presented at the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics Congress in 2015.

&#160;

Internationally, we contract with country-specific or regional distributors. We believe that the international market will be significantly larger than the U.S. market due to the international demand for cervical cancer screening. We have formal distribution agreements in place covering 54 countries and plan on adding additional countries in 2016.

&#160;

We have regulatory approval to sell LuViva in Europe under our Edition 3 CE Mark. Additionally, LuViva has marketing approval from Health Canada, COFEPRIS in Mexico, Ministry of Health in Kenya and the Singapore Health Sciences Authority. We currently are seeking regulatory approval to market LuViva in the United States, but have not yet received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). As of March 7, 2016, we have sold 93 LuViva devices and approximately 35,000 single-use-disposable cervical guides to international distributors.

&#160;

We believe our non-invasive cervical cancer detection technology can be applied to the early detection of other cancers as well. From 2008 to early 2013, we worked with Konica Minolta to explore the feasibility of adapting our microporation and biophotonic cancer detection technology to other areas of medicine and to determine potential markets for these products in anticipation of a development agreement. In February 2013, we replaced our existing agreements with Konica Minolta with a new agreement, pursuant to which, subject to the payment of a nominal license fee due upon FDA approval, Konica Minolta has granted us a five-year, world-wide, non-transferable and non-exclusive right and license to manufacture and to develop a non-invasive esophageal cancer detection product from Konica Minolta and based on our biophotonic technology platform. The license permits us to use certain related intellectual property of Konica Minolta. In return for the license, we have agreed to pay Konica Minolta a royalty for each licensed product we sell. We continue to seek new collaborative partners to further develop our biophotonic technology.

&#160;

Manufacturing, Sales Marketing and Distribution 

We manufacture LuViva at our Norcross, Georgia facility. Most of the components of LuViva are custom made for us by third-party manufacturers. We adhere to ISO 13485:2003 quality standards in our manufacturing processes. Our single-use cervical guides are manufactured by a vendor that specializes in injection molding of plastic medical products.

&#160;

We rely on distributors to sell our products. Distributors can be country exclusive or cover multiple countries in a region. We manage these distributors, provide them marketing materials and train them to demonstrate and operate LuViva. We seek distributors that have experience in gynecology and in introducing new technology into their assigned territories.

&#160;

We have only limited experience in the production planning, quality system management, facility development, and production scaling that will be needed to bring production to increased sustained commercial levels. We will likely need to develop additional expertise in order to successfully manufacture, market, and distribute any future products.

&#160;

Research, Development and Engineering 

&#160; 

We have been engaged primarily in the research, development and testing of our LuViva non-invasive cervical cancer detection product and our core biophotonic technology. Since 2013, we have incurred about $7.0 million in research and development expenses, net of about $927,000 reimbursed through collaborative arrangements and government grants. Research and development costs were approximately $1.5 million and $2.8 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively.

&#160;

Since 2013, we have focused our research and development and our engineering resources almost exclusively on development of our biophotonic technology, with only limited support of other programs funded through government contracts or third party funding. Because our research and clinical development programs for other cancers are at a very early stage, substantial additional research and development and clinical trials will be necessary before we can produce commercial prototypes of other cancer detection products.

&#160;

Several of the components used in LuViva are available from only one supplier, and substitutes for these components could not be obtained easily or would require substantial modifications to our products.

&#160; 

Patents 

We have pursued a course of developing and acquiring patents and patent rights and licensing technology. Our success depends in large part on our ability to establish and maintain the proprietary nature of our technology through the patent process and to license from others patents and patent applications necessary to develop our products. As of December 31, 2015, we have 24 granted U.S. patents relating to our biophotonic cancer detection technology and six pending U.S. patent applications. We also have three granted patents that apply to our interstitial fluid analysis system.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Competition 

The medical device industry in general and the markets for cervical cancer detection in particular, are intensely competitive. If successful in our product development, we will compete with other providers of cervical cancer detection and prevention products.

&#160;

Current cervical cancer screening and diagnostic tests, primarily the Pap test, HPV test, and colposcopy, are well established and pervasive. Improvements and new technologies for cervical cancer detection and prevention, such as Thin-Prep from Hologic and HPV testing from Qiagen, have led to other new competitors. In addition, there are other companies attempting to develop products using forms of biophotonic technologies in cervical cancer detection, such as Spectrascience, which has a very limited FDA approval to market its device for detection of cervical cancers, but has not yet entered the market. The approval limits use of the Spectrascience device only after a colposcopy, as an adjunct. In addition to the Spectrascience device, there are other technologies that are seeking to enter the market as adjuncts to colposcopy, including devices from Dysis and Zedco. While these technologies are not direct competitors to LuViva, modifications to them or other new technologies will require us to develop devices that are more accurate, easier to use or less costly to administer so that our products have a competitive advantage.

&#160;

In April 2014, the FDA approved the use of the Roche cobas HPV test as a primary screener for cervical cancer. Using a sample of cervical cells, the cobas HPV test detects DNA from 14 high-risk HPV types. The test specifically identifies HPV 16 and HPV 18, while concurrently detecting 12 other types of high-risk HPVs. This could make HPV testing a competitor to the Pap test. However, due to its lower specificity, we believe that screening with HPV will increase the number of false positive results if widely adopted.

&#160;

In June 2006, the FDA approved the HPV vaccine Gardasil from drug maker Merck. Gardasil is a prophylactic HPV vaccine, meaning that it is designed to prevent the initial establishment of HPV infections. For maximum efficacy, it is recommended that girls receive the vaccine prior to becoming sexually active. Since Gardasil will not block infection with all of the HPV types that can cause cervical cancer, the vaccine should not be considered a substitute for routine Pap tests. On October 16, 2009, GlaxoSmithKline PLC was granted approval in the United States for a similar preventive HPV vaccine, known as Cervarix. Due to the limited availability and lack of 100% protection against all potentially cancer-causing strains of HPV, we believe that the vaccines will have a limited impact on the cervical cancer screening and diagnostic market for many years.

&#160;

Government Regulation 

&#160;

The medical devices that we manufacture are subject to regulation by numerous regulatory bodies, including the FDA and comparable international regulatory agencies. These agencies require manufacturers of medical devices to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing and distribution of medical devices. Devices are generally subject to varying levels of regulatory control, the most comprehensive of which requires that a clinical evaluation program be conducted before a device receives approval for commercial distribution.

&#160;

In the European Union, medical devices are required to comply with the Medical Devices Directive and obtain CE Mark certification in order to market medical devices. The CE Mark certification, granted following approval from an independent &#8220;Notified Body,&#8221; is an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards and compliance with applicable European Medical Devices Directives. We maintain ISO 13485:2003 certification, which since 2014 has allowed us to issue our Edition 3 CE Mark and sell LuViva in the European Union and other markets.

&#160;

Distributors of medical devices may also be required to comply with other foreign regulatory agencies, and we or our distributors currently have marketing approval for LuViva from Health Canada, COFEPRIS in Mexico, the Ministry of Health in Kenya, and the Singapore Health Sciences Authority. The time required to obtain these foreign approvals to market our products may be longer or shorter than that required in the United States, and requirements for those approvals may differ from those required by the FDA.

&#160;

In the United States, permission to distribute a new device generally can be met in one of two ways. The first process requires that a pre-market notification (510(k) Submission) be made to the FDA to demonstrate that the device is as safe and effective as, or substantially equivalent to, a legally marketed device that is not subject to premarket approval (PMA). A legally marketed device is a device that (1) was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976, (2) has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or I, or (3) has been found to be substantially equivalent to another legally marketed device following a 510(k) Submission. The legally marketed device to which equivalence is drawn is known as the &#8220;predicate&#8221; device. Applicants must submit descriptive data and, when necessary, performance data to establish that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device. In some instances, data from human clinical studies must also be submitted in support of a 510(k) Submission. If so, these data must be collected in a manner that conforms with specific requirements in accordance with federal regulations. The FDA must issue an order finding substantial equivalence before commercial distribution can occur. Changes to existing devices covered by a 510(k) Submission which do not significantly affect safety or effectiveness can generally be made by us without additional 510(k) Submissions.

&#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The second process requires that an application for premarket approval (PMA) be made to the FDA to demonstrate that the device is safe and effective for its intended use as manufactured. This approval process applies to most Class III devices, including LuViva. In this case, two steps of FDA approval are generally required before marketing in the United States can begin. First, investigational device exemption (IDE) regulations must be complied with in connection with any human clinical investigation of the device in the United States. Second, the FDA must review the PMA application, which contains, among other things, clinical information acquired under the IDE. The FDA will approve the PMA application if it finds that there is a reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended purpose.

&#160;

We completed enrollment in our FDA pivotal trial of LuViva in 2008 and on November 18, 2010, the FDA accepted our completed PMA application, effective September 23, 2010, for substantive review. On March 7, 2011, we announced that the FDA had inspected two clinical trial sites as part of its review process and raised no formal compliance issues. On January 20, 2012, we announced our intent to seek an independent panel review of our PMA application after receiving a &#8220;not-approvable&#8221; letter from the FDA. On November 14, 2012 we filed an amended PMA with the FDA. On September 6, 2013, we received a letter from the FDA with additional questions and met with the FDA on May 8, 2014 to discuss our response. On July 25, 2014, we announced that we had responded to the FDA&#8217;s most recent questions

&#160;

We received a &#8220;not-approvable&#8221; letter from the FDA on May 15, 2015. We had a follow up meeting with the FDA to discuss a path forward on November 30, 2015, at which we agreed to submit a detailed clinical protocol for FDA review so that additional studies can be completed. These studies will not be completed in 2016. We remain committed to obtaining FDA approval, but we are focused on international sales growth, where we believe the commercial opportunities are larger and the clinical need is more significant.

&#160;

The process of obtaining clearance to market products is costly and time-consuming in virtually all of the major markets in which we sell, or expect to sell, our products and may delay the marketing and sale of our products. Countries around the world have recently adopted more stringent regulatory requirements, which are expected to add to the delays and uncertainties associated with new product releases, as well as the clinical and regulatory costs of supporting those releases. No assurance can be given that our products will be approved on a timely basis in any particular jurisdiction, if at all. In addition, regulations regarding the development, manufacture and sale of medical devices are subject to future change. We cannot predict what impact, if any, those changes might have on our business. Failure to comply with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

&#160;

Noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in import detentions, fines, civil penalties, injunctions, suspensions or losses of regulatory approvals or clearances, recall or seizure of products, operating restrictions, denial of export applications, governmental prohibitions on entering into supply contracts, and criminal prosecution. Failure to obtain regulatory approvals or the restriction, suspension or revocation of regulatory approvals or clearances, as well as any other failure to comply with regulatory requirements, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

&#160;

Regulatory approvals and clearances, if granted, may include significant labeling limitations and limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed. In addition, to obtain regulatory approvals and clearances, the FDA and some foreign regulatory authorities impose numerous other requirements with which medical device manufacturers must comply. FDA enforcement policy strictly prohibits the marketing of approved medical devices for unapproved uses. Any products we manufacture or distribute under FDA clearances or approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA. The FDA also requires us to provide it with information on death and serious injuries alleged to have been associated with the use of our products, as well as any malfunctions that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury.

&#160;

The FDA requires us to register as a medical device manufacturer and list our products. We are also subject to inspections by the FDA and state agencies acting under contract with the FDA to confirm compliance with good manufacturing practice. These regulations require that we manufacture our products and maintain documents in a prescribed manner with respect to manufacturing, testing, quality assurance and quality control activities. The FDA also has promulgated final regulatory changes to these regulations that require, among other things, design controls and maintenance of service records. These changes will increase the cost of complying with good manufacturing practice requirements.

&#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

We are also subject to a variety of other controls that affect our business. Labeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the FDA and, in some instances, by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. The FDA actively enforces regulations prohibiting marketing of products for unapproved users. We are also subject, as are our products, to a variety of state and local laws and regulations in those states and localities where our products are or will be marketed. Any applicable state or local regulations may hinder our ability to market our products in those regions. Manufacturers are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to matters such as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. We may be required to incur significant costs to comply with these laws and regulations now or in the future. These laws or regulations may have a material adverse effect on our ability to do business.

&#160;

We will be responsible for obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals for our products. The inability or failure to comply with the varying regulations or the imposition of new regulations would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

&#160;

Employees and Consultants 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 24 regular employees and 2 Consultants to provide services to us on a full- or part-time basis. Of the 26 people employed or engaged by us, 15 are engaged in engineering, manufacturing and development, 3 are engaged in sales and marketing activities, 1 is engaged in clinical testing and regulatory affairs, 2 are engaged in research and development activities, and 5 are engaged in administration and accounting. No employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and we believe we maintain good relations with our employees.

&#160;

Our ability to operate successfully and manage our potential future growth depends in significant part upon the continued service of key scientific, technical, managerial and finance personnel, and our ability to attract and retain additional highly qualified personnel in these fields. Two of these key employees have an employment contract with us; none are covered by key person or similar insurance. In addition, if we are able to successfully develop and commercialize our products, we likely will need to hire additional scientific, technical, marketing, managerial and finance personnel. We face intense competition for qualified personnel in these areas, many of whom are often subject to competing employment offers. The loss of key personnel or our inability to hire and retain additional qualified personnel in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

&#160;
