 Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties 

OVERVIEW 

LyondellBasell Industries N.V. is a global, independent chemical company and was incorporated under Dutch law on October 15, 2009. Unless otherwise indicated, the &#147;Company,&#148; &#147;we,&#148; &#147;our,&#148; &#147;us&#148; and &#147;LyondellBasell&#148; are used in this report to refer to the businesses of LyondellBasell Industries N.V. and its consolidated subsidiaries. We are one of the world&#146;s top five independent chemical companies based on revenues. 

We participate globally across the petrochemical value chain and are an industry leader in many of our product lines. Our chemicals businesses consist primarily of large processing plants that convert large volumes of liquid and gaseous hydrocarbon feedstocks into plastic resins and other chemicals. Our chemical products tend to be basic building blocks for other chemicals and plastics, while our plastic products are typically used in large volume applications. Our customers use our plastics and chemicals to manufacture a wide range of products that people use in their everyday lives including food packaging, home furnishings, automotive components, paints and coatings. Our refining business consists of our Houston refinery, which processes crude oil into products such as gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. 

Our financial performance is influenced in general by the supply and demand for the products that we produce, the cost and availability of feedstocks, global and regional competitor capacity, our operational efficiency and our ability to control costs. We have a strong operational focus and, as a producer of large volume commodities, continuously strive to differentiate ourselves through safe, reliable and low-cost operations in all our businesses. During recent years the cost of natural gas-derived raw materials in the U.S. versus the global cost of crude oil-derived raw materials has had a significant positive influence on the profitability of our North American operations. While the North American feedstock advantage declined with lower oil prices in 2015, improved product supply and demand fundamentals in several businesses, notably global polyolefins products, more than offset the decline. To a lesser extent, our differentiated assets and technology also positively influence our performance as compared to our peers and competitors. These include our propylene oxide and polypropylene technologies; flexible feedstock olefins plants in the U.S.; joint venture olefins and polyolefins plants with access to low-cost feedstock, particularly in Saudi Arabia; and our Houston refinery, which is capable of processing heavy, high-sulfur crude. 

SEGMENTS 

We manage our operations through five operating segments. Our reportable segments are: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Olefins and Polyolefins&#151;Americas (&#147;O&#38;P&#151;Americas&#148;). Our O&#38;P&#151;Americas segment produces and markets olefins, including ethylene and ethylene co-products, and polyolefins. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Olefins and Polyolefins&#151;Europe, Asia, International (&#147;O&#38;P&#151;EAI&#148;). Our O&#38;P&#151;EAI segment produces and markets olefins, including ethylene and ethylene co-products, polyolefins and specialty products, including polybutene-1 and polypropylene compounds. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Intermediates and Derivatives (&#147;I&#38;D&#148;). Our I&#38;D segment produces and markets propylene oxide and its co-products, including isobutylene and styrene monomer, and derivatives, acetyls including methanol, ethylene oxide and its derivatives, ethanol and oxygenated fuels, or oxyfuels. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Refining . Our Refining segment refines heavy, high-sulfur crude oil and other crude oils of varied types and sources available on the U.S. Gulf Coast into fuel products including gasoline and distillates (diesel and jet fuels). 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Technology . Our Technology segment develops and licenses chemical and polyolefin process technologies and manufactures and sells polyolefin catalysts. 

&#160; 

We regularly review our segments and the approach used by management to evaluate performance and resource allocation. At the beginning of 2014, management began using EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization) as the primary measure for reviewing our segments&#146; profitability. Our comparisons to the prior periods presented were revised to reflect this change. 

Financial information about our business segments and geographical areas can be found in Note 22, Segment and Related Information , to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Information about the locations where we produce our primary products can be found under &#147;Description of Properties.&#148; 

In 2015, 2014 and 2013, no single customer accounted for 10% or more of our total revenues. 

Olefins and Polyolefins Segments Generally 

We are one of the leading worldwide producers of olefins, including ethylene and propylene, and polyethylene (&#147;PE&#148;). We are the world&#146;s largest producer of polypropylene (&#147;PP&#148;) and PP compounds. We manage our olefin and polyolefin business in two reportable segments, O&#38;P&#151;Americas and O&#38;P&#151;EAI. 

Olefins &#151;Ethylene is the most significant petrochemical in terms of worldwide production volume and is the key building block for PE and a large number of other chemicals, plastics and synthetics. The production of ethylene results in co-products such as aromatics and other olefins, including propylene and butadiene. Ethylene and its co-products are fundamental to many parts of the economy, including the production of consumer products, packaging, housing and automotive components and other durable and nondurable goods. In 2015, we completed an expansion project at our Channelview, Texas facility that added 250 million pounds to our annual ethylene capacity, and we further benefited from an 800 million pound per year expansion of our La Porte, Texas ethylene facility that was completed in 2014. 

Polyolefins &#151;Polyolefins are thermoplastics and comprise approximately two-thirds of worldwide thermoplastics demand. Since their industrial commercialization, thermoplastics have been used in wide-ranging applications and products that improve safety and comfort and enhance the everyday quality of life. Our products are used in consumer, automotive and industrial applications ranging from food and beverage packaging to housewares and construction materials. We produce high density polyethylene (&#147;HDPE&#148;), low density polyethylene (&#147;LDPE&#148;) and linear low density polyethylene (&#147;LLDPE&#148;). We also produce PP homopolymers, PP impact copolymers and PP random copolymers. We produce and market several specialty product lines, including PP compounds, Catalloy process resins and polybutene-1 (&#147;PB-1&#148;), focusing on unique polyolefins and compounds that offer a wide range of performance characteristics. Typical properties of such specialty polyolefins and compounds include impact-stiffness balance, scratch resistance, soft touch and heat sealability. End uses include automotive and industrial products and materials. PP compounds are produced from blends of polyolefins and additives and are sold mainly to the automotive and home appliances industries. The Catalloy process is proprietary technology that is not licensed to third parties. As a result, we are the only manufacturer of Catalloy process resins, which are used primarily in roofing, packaging and automotive applications. PB-1 is a family of butane-based polymers and is mainly used in pipe applications and under-floor heating systems and sanitary water heating systems. 

PE sales, including HDPE, LDPE and LLDPE, accounted for approximately 21%, 18% and 17% of our total revenues in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In 2014, we completed an expansion project at our Matagorda plant in Texas, which added 220 million pounds of HDPE production. PP sales, including Catalloy , accounted for approximately 17%, 16% and 16% of our total revenues in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 

&#160;

Overview 

Our O&#38;P&#151;Americas segment produces and markets olefins, polyolefins, aromatics, specialty products and ethylene co-products. In addition, we produce specialty products including Catalloy and Plexar resins. 

Sales &#38; Marketing / Customers 

Our ethylene production is consumed internally as a raw material in the production of polymers and other derivatives, with the balance sold to third party customers under multi-year contracts or on a spot basis. In 2015 we completed a 250 million pound per year expansion at our Channelview, Texas facility, following an 800 million pound per year expansion of our La Porte, Texas facility completed in mid-2014. We have also announced ethylene expansion projects for our Corpus Christi, Texas facility in 2016. 

We are a net purchaser of propylene, a raw material used in the production of PO, PP and other derivatives. Our butadiene production is sold to the external market under multi-year contracts. All of our benzene production is used as a raw material in the production of styrene by our I&#38;D segment. 

In addition to purchases of propylene, at times we purchase ethylene and butadiene for resale, when necessary, to satisfy customer demand above our own production levels. Volumes of any of these products purchased for resale can vary significantly from period to period. However, purchased volumes have not historically had a significant impact on profits. 

In the U.S., most of the ethylene and propylene production of our Channelview, Corpus Christi and La Porte, Texas facilities is shipped via a pipeline system, which has connections to numerous U.S. Gulf Coast consumers. This pipeline extends from Corpus Christi to Mont Belvieu, Texas. In addition, exchange agreements with other ethylene and co-products producers allow access to customers who are not directly connected to this pipeline system. Some ethylene is shipped by rail car from Clinton, Iowa to Morris, Illinois and some is shipped directly to customers. A pipeline owned and operated by an unrelated party is used to transport ethylene from Morris, Illinois to Tuscola, Illinois where it is used as a raw material in the production of ethanol. Some propylene is shipped by ocean going vessel. Butadiene, benzene, toluene and other products are distributed by pipeline, rail car, truck, barge or ocean going vessel. 

Our PP and PE production is typically sold through our sales organization to an extensive base of established customers and distributors servicing both the domestic and export markets either under annual contracts or on a spot basis. We have regional sales offices in various locations in North America and our polyolefins primarily are transported in North America by railcar or truck. Export sales are generally to customers in Central and South America. We also sell PP to our PP compounds business, which is managed worldwide by our O&#38;P&#151;EAI segment. 

Joint Venture Relationships 

We participate in a joint venture arrangement in Mexico, which provides us with capacity for approximately 640 million pounds of PP production. The capacity is based on our percentage ownership of the joint ventures&#146; total capacity. We do not hold a majority interest in or have operational control of this joint venture. 

&#160; 

Raw Materials 

Raw material cost is the largest component of the total cost for the production of ethylene and its co-products. The primary raw materials that can be used in our Americas olefin facilities are heavy liquids and natural gas liquids (&#147;NGLs&#148;). Heavy liquids include crude oil-based naphtha and other refined products, as well as domestically sourced condensate, a very light crude oil resulting from natural gas production (collectively referred to as &#147;heavy liquids&#148;). NGLs include ethane, propane and butane. The use of heavy liquid raw materials results in the production of a significant amount of co-products such as propylene, butadiene and benzene, as well as gasoline blending components, while the use of NGLs results in the production of a smaller amount of co-products. 

Our ability to pass through raw material price increases to our customers is dependent upon market-driven demand for olefins and polyolefins. Sales prices for products sold in the spot market are determined by market forces. Our contract prices are influenced by spot prices, indices published in industry publications and cost recovery formulas in the contracts. 

Prior to 2010, facilities using heavy liquids as feedstock usually generated higher margins than those using NGLs. However, in recent years NGLs, particularly in the United States, have had a significant cost advantage over heavy liquids due to technological advances for extracting shale gas which have led to an increased supply of NGLs. This cost advantage was lower in 2015 than in prior years, but was still significant. A plant&#146;s flexibility to consume a wide range of raw materials generally will provide an advantage over plants that are restricted in their processing capabilities. Our Americas facilities can process significant quantities of either heavy liquids or NGLs. We estimate that in the U.S. we can produce up to approximately 90% of our total ethylene output using NGLs. Changes in the raw material feedstock utilized in the production process will result in variances in production capacities among products. We believe our raw material flexibility in the U.S. is a key advantage in our production of ethylene and its co-products. 

In North America, we also purchase large amounts of natural gas that is used primarily as an energy source in our business and as the primary feedstock for methanol production by our I&#38;D segment. The purchases are generally market-based contractual arrangements with multiple suppliers. 

Industry Dynamics / Competition 

With respect to olefins and polyolefins, competition is based on price, product quality, product delivery, reliability of supply, product performance and customer service. Industry consolidation in North America has led to fewer, although larger, competitors. Profitability is affected not only by supply and demand for olefins and polyolefins, but also by raw material costs and price competition among producers, which may intensify due to, among other things, the addition of new capacity. In general, demand is a function of worldwide economic growth, including the regional dynamics that underlie global growth trends. 

We compete in North America with other large marketers and producers, including global chemical companies, chemical divisions of large oil companies and regional marketers and producers. 

Based on published data, we believe we were, as of December 31, 2015: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the second largest producer of ethylene in North America, with ethylene rated capacity of 10.9 billion pounds per year, or approximately 14% of total North American ethylene production capacity; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the third largest producer of PE in North America with 6.2 billion pounds per year of capacity, or approximately 14% of North American capacity; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the largest producer of PP in North America, including our share of our Indelpro joint venture capacity, with 3.3 billion pounds, or approximately 18% of the North American capacity. 

&#160; 

Olefins and Polyolefins&#151;Europe, Asia, International Segment 

Overview 

Our O&#38;P&#151;EAI segment produces and markets olefins, including ethylene and ethylene co-products, and polyolefins. In addition, we produce significant quantities of specialty products such as Catalloy process resins and PB-1. Our O&#38;P&#151;EAI segment manages our worldwide PP compound business (including our PP compounds facilities in North and South America), our worldwide PB-1 business, and our Catalloy process resins produced in Europe. 

Sales &#38; Marketing / Customers 

Our ethylene production is primarily consumed internally as a raw material in the production of polymers and we purchase additional ethylene to meet our production needs. Our propylene production is used as a raw material in the production of PO and PP, and we purchase propylene because our internal needs exceed our internal production. European ethylene production is generally fully integrated with our downstream facilities in Europe. 

We produce and sell butadiene to external customers under multi-year contracts and on a spot basis. 

With respect to PP and PE, our production is typically sold through our sales organization to an extensive base of established customers under annual contracts or on a spot basis and is also sold through distributors. Our polyolefins are transported in Europe primarily by railcar or truck. We believe that, over a business cycle, average sales prices and profit margins for specialty polymers tend to be higher than average sales prices and profit margins for higher-volume commodity polyolefins or polymers. 

Our regional sales offices are in various locations, including The Netherlands, Hong Kong, China, India, Australia and the United Arab Emirates. We also operate through a worldwide network of local sales and representative offices in Europe, Asia and Africa. Our joint ventures described below typically manage their domestic sales and marketing efforts independently, and we typically operate as their agent/distributor for all or a portion of their exports. 

Joint Venture Relationships 

We participate in several manufacturing joint ventures in Saudi Arabia, Thailand, Poland, Australia, Japan and South Korea. We do not hold majority interests in any of these joint ventures, nor do we have operational control. These ventures provide us with additional production capacity of approximately 2,630 million pounds of PP, approximately 810 million pounds of propylene, approximately 550 million pounds of ethylene, approximately 570 million pounds of HDPE, approximately 340 million pounds of LDPE and approximately 160 million pounds of PP compounds. These capacities are based on our percentage ownership interest in the joint ventures&#146; total capacities. We realize profits or losses from these ventures as income (or loss) on the equity basis of accounting. 

We generally license our polyolefin process technologies and supply catalysts to our joint ventures through our Technology segment. Some of our joint ventures are able to source cost advantaged raw materials from their local shareholders. 

Raw Materials 

Raw material cost is the largest component of the total cost for the production of ethylene and its co-products. The primary raw materials used in our European olefin facilities are naphtha streams, which are heavier than NGLs; however, in recent years we have sourced increased amounts of advantaged NGLs when the opportunity arises. For our Saudi joint venture facilities, locally sourced and cost advantaged NGLs, including 

&#160; 

ethane, propane and butane are used. The principal raw materials used by our polyolefin and Catalloy process resin businesses are propylene and ethylene. In Europe, we have the capacity to produce approximately 50% of the propylene requirements of our European PP business and all of the ethylene requirements of our European PE business. Propylene and ethylene requirements that are not produced internally are generally acquired pursuant to long-term contracts with third party suppliers or via spot purchases. 

Our PP compounds facilities generally receive their PP and other polymer raw materials from one of our wholly owned or joint venture facilities. PB-1 raw materials are sourced solely from external supply. Some of our joint ventures receive propylene and ethylene from their local shareholders under long-term contracts. 

Our ability to pass through the increased cost of raw materials to customers is dependent on global market demand for olefins and polyolefins. In general, the pricing for purchases and sales of most products is determined by global market forces, including the impacts of foreign exchange on the pricing of the underlying heavy liquid raw materials, most of which are priced in U.S. dollars. There can be a lag between observed naphtha raw material price changes in a given month and contract product price changes that were settled prior to the beginning of that month. In such cases, volatility in our product margins may occur. 

Industry Dynamics / Competition 

With respect to olefins and polyolefins, competition is based on price, product quality, product delivery, reliability of supply, product performance and customer service. We compete with regional and multinational chemical companies and divisions of large oil companies. The petrochemical market in the European Union (&#147;EU&#148;) has been affected by the price volatility of naphtha, the primary feedstock for olefins in the region, as well as fluctuating demand as a result of uncertain European and global economic conditions. 

Based on published data and including our proportionate share of our joint ventures, we believe we were, as of December 31, 2015: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the fifth largest producer of ethylene in Europe with an ethylene rated capacity in Europe of 4.3 billion pounds per year, or approximately 8% of total European ethylene capacity; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the largest producer of PP in Europe with 5.2 billion pounds per year of capacity, or approximately 22% of European PP capacity; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the largest producer of PE in Europe with 4.8 billion pounds per year of capacity, or approximately 22% of HDPE and 13% of LDPE European capacity; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the largest PP compounds producer in the world with 2.6 billion pounds per year of capacity, with approximately 51% of that capacity in Europe, 21% in North America, and 27% in the rest of the world. 

Intermediates and Derivatives Segment 

Overview 

Our I&#38;D segment produces and markets PO and its co-products and derivatives; acetyls including methanol, ethylene oxide (&#147;EO&#148;) and its derivatives; ethanol; and oxyfuels (methyl tertiary butyl ether (&#147;MTBE&#148;) and ethyl tertiary butyl ether (&#147;ETBE&#148;)). PO co-products include styrene monomer (&#147;SM&#148;) and tertiary butyl alcohol (&#147;TBA&#148;), most of which is used to make oxyfuels, isobutylene and tertiary butyl hydro peroxide (&#147;TBHP&#148;). TBA and its products other than oxyfuels are sometimes referred to as C4 chemicals. PO derivatives include propylene glycol (&#147;PG&#148;), propylene glycol ethers (&#147;PGE&#148;) and butanediol (&#147;BDO&#148;). We believe that our proprietary PO and acetyls production process technologies provide us with a cost advantaged position for these products and their derivatives. 

&#160; 

We produce PO through two distinct technologies, one of which yields TBA as the co-product and the other of which yields SM as the co-product. The two technologies are mutually exclusive, meaning that a manufacturing facility must be dedicated to either PO/TBA or to PO/SM. 

The following table outlines the primary products, annual capacities, and primary uses for the I&#38;D segment&#146;s products. Capacities, which are presented in pounds unless otherwise indicated, include 100% of the capacity of joint venture facilities.

We sell most of our SM production into the North American, European, Asian, and South American export markets through spot sales and contracts. We purchase SM for resale when necessary to satisfy customer demand that exceeds our production levels. Volumes of SM purchases made for resale can vary significantly from period to period. However, purchased volumes have not historically had a significant impact on profits. PO and its derivatives and SM are transported by barge, ocean going vessel, pipeline, railcar, and tank truck. 

Our I&#38;D segment converts most of its TBA, which is produced as a co-product of the PO process, to isobutylene. Over half of the isobutylene is reacted with methanol or ethanol to produce either MTBE or ETBE. The remaining isobutylene is sold into the external market as high-purity grade isobutylene. 

In August of 2014, we announced our intention to build a world scale PO/TBA plant on the U.S. Gulf Coast with an annual capacity of 1 billion pounds of PO and 2 billion pounds of TBA and its derivatives. The preliminary timetable is to have the plant operational in 2020. 

We sell our MTBE and ETBE production under market and cost-based sales agreements and in the spot market. MTBE and ETBE are transported by barge, ocean going vessel and tank truck. MTBE and ETBE are widely used octane gasoline blending components worldwide outside of the United States due to their blending characteristics and environmental benefits. For example, Japan has elected to use ETBE as a means of meeting its carbon dioxide reduction commitments under the Kyoto Protocol, and we source a significant portion of Japan&#146;s bio-fuels needs. The majority of our plants have the flexibility to produce either MTBE or ETBE to accommodate market needs. 

Sales of MTBE, ETBE, acetyls, PO and PO co-products and derivatives are made by our marketing and sales personnel, and also through distributors and independent agents in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and the Asia Pacific region. 

Acetyls, including acetic acid and VAM, are consumed internally and sold worldwide under multi-year contracts and on a spot basis. Acetic acid and VAM are shipped by barge, ocean going vessel, pipeline, railcar 

&#160; 

and tank truck. Sales are made through a direct sales force, agents and distributors. Our acetyls business uses methanol, which we produce internally, as a raw material for our production of acetic acid, solvents and MTBE. We also sell methanol under annual contracts and on a spot basis to large U.S. customers. Methanol is shipped by barge, railcar and pipeline. 

EO and EG typically are sold under multi-year contracts and on a spot basis, with market and cost-based pricing. Ethylene glycol ethers are EO derivatives sold primarily into the solvent and distributor segments at market prices. The vast majority of EO and its derivative products are sold in North America, Europe and Asia, primarily through our sales organizations. EO is shipped by railcar or consumed on site. The derivatives are shipped by railcar, truck, isotank, and ocean going vessel. 

Joint Venture Relationships 

We have two PO joint ventures with Covestro AG (the new holding company under which Bayer AG consolidated its polymer activities), one in the U.S. and one in Europe. We operate four of our U.S. operating units for the U.S. PO joint venture. Covestro&#146;s interest represents ownership of an in-kind portion of the PO production of 1.5 billion pounds per year. We take, in-kind, the remaining PO production and all co-product production. The parties&#146; rights in the joint venture are based on off take volumes related to actual production of PO as opposed to ownership percentages. Covestro also has the right to 50% of the PO and SM production of our European PO joint venture. Our proportional production capacity provided through this venture is approximately 340 million pounds of PO and approximately 750 million pounds of SM. We do not share marketing or product sales with Covestro under either of these PO joint ventures. 

We also have joint venture manufacturing relationships in China. These ventures provide us with additional production capacity of approximately 115 million pounds of PO. This capacity is based on our operational share of the joint ventures&#146; total capacities. 

Raw Materials 

The cost of raw materials is generally the largest component of total production cost for PO, its co-products, and its derivatives. Propylene, isobutane or mixed butane, ethylene, and benzene are the primary raw materials used in the production of PO and its co-products. The market prices of these raw materials historically have been related to the price of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas, as well as supply and demand for the raw materials. 

In the U.S., we obtain a large portion of our propylene, benzene and ethylene raw materials needed for the production of PO and its co-products from our O&#38;P&#151;Americas segment and a lesser amount from third parties. Raw materials for the non-U.S. production of PO and its co-products are obtained from our O&#38;P&#151;EAI segment and from third parties. We consume a significant portion of our internally-produced PO in the production of PO derivatives. 

The raw material requirements not sourced internally are purchased at market-based prices from numerous suppliers in the U.S. and Europe with which we have established contractual relationships, as well as in the spot market. 

We purchase our ethanol requirements for the production of ETBE from third parties; the methanol for our MTBE production comes from internal production. Carbon monoxide and methanol are the primary raw materials required for the production of acetic acid. We purchase carbon monoxide pursuant to a long-term contract with pricing primarily based on the cost of production. All methanol required for our production of acetyls is internally sourced. Natural gas is the primary raw material required for the production of methanol. 

In addition to ethylene, acetic acid is a primary raw material for the production of VAM. For the production of VAM, we obtain our entire requirements for acetic acid and ethylene from our internal production. Historically, we have used a large percentage of our acetic acid production to produce VAM. 

&#160; 

Industry Dynamics / Competition 

With respect to PO, its co-products and derivatives, competition is based on a variety of factors, including product quality, price, reliability of supply, technical support, customer service and potential substitute materials. Profitability is affected by the worldwide level of demand along with price competition, which may intensify due to, among other things, new industry capacity and industry outages. PO demand growth could be impacted by further development of alternative bio-based PO derivatives. It is not possible to predict accurately the changes in raw material costs, market conditions and other factors that will affect industry profitability in the future. Our major worldwide competitors for sales of PO, its co-products and derivatives include other multinational chemical companies as well as some regional marketers and producers. 

Based on published data, excluding our partners&#146; shares of joint venture capacity, we believe as of December 31, 2015 we were: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the second largest producer of PO worldwide, with approximately 13% of total worldwide capacity; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the largest producer of MTBE/ETBE worldwide, with approximately 10% of total worldwide production capacity for these combined oxyfuels; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the fifth largest producer of SM worldwide, with approximately 5% of total worldwide capacity; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the ninth and eighth largest producer of acetic acid and VAM, respectively, each with approximately 3% and 4% of total worldwide capacity. 

Refining Segment 

Overview 

Our Houston refinery, which is located on the Houston Ship Channel in Houston, Texas, has a heavy, high-sulfur crude oil processing capacity of approximately 268,000 barrels per day on a calendar day basis (normal operating basis), or approximately 292,000 barrels per day on a stream day basis (maximum achievable over a 24 hour period). The Houston refinery has a Nelson Complexity Index, a relative measure of the construction costs of a particular refinery based on its crude and upgrading capacity, of 12.5. The Houston refinery is a full conversion refinery designed to refine heavy, high-sulfur crude oil. This crude oil is more viscous and dense than traditional crude oil and contains higher concentrations of sulfur and heavy metals, making it more difficult to refine into gasoline and other high-value fuel products. However, this crude oil has historically been less costly to purchase than light, low-sulfur crude oil such as Brent. In the recent past, certain domestic crude oils such as West Texas Intermediate (&#147;WTI&#148;) and West Texas Sour (&#147;WTS&#148;) have been priced lower than normal trends due to transportation constraints; however, since 2014 these price differentials have narrowed. 

On January 4, 2012, we ceased refinery operations at our Berre refinery in France. The cessation of operations was in accordance with an agreement executed in the fourth quarter of 2011 by certain of our French subsidiaries and union representatives. Additional information about the cessation of operations can be found in &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#148; and Note 3, Discontinued Operations , to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

&#160; 

The following table outlines the primary products of our Refining segment, annual processing capacities as of as of December 31, 2015, and the primary uses for those products. Capacities are presented in barrels per day.

(1) Only key products for the Houston refinery are identified and, therefore, the sum of capacities shown does not equal the facility&#146;s total capacity. Sales &#38; Marketing / Customers 

The Houston refinery&#146;s products primarily are sold in bulk to other refiners, marketers, distributors and wholesalers at market-related prices. Most of the Houston refinery&#146;s products are sold under contracts with a term of one year or less or are sold in the spot market. The Houston refinery&#146;s products generally are transported to customers via pipelines and terminals owned and operated by other parties. 

Raw Materials 

We purchase the crude oil used as a raw material for the Houston refinery on the open market on a spot basis and under a number of supply agreements with regional producers, generally with terms varying from one to two years. 

Industry Dynamics / Competition 

Our refining competitors are major integrated oil companies, refineries owned or controlled by foreign governments and independent domestic refiners. Based on published data, as of January 2016, there were 140 operable crude oil refineries in the U.S., and total U.S. refinery capacity was approximately 18.0 million barrels per day. During 2015, the Houston refinery processed an average of approximately 243,000 barrels per day of crude oil, representing approximately 1.4% of all U.S. crude processing capacity. 

Our refining operations compete for the purchases of crude oil based on price and quality. Supply disruptions could impact the availability and pricing. We compete in gasoline and distillate markets as a bulk supplier of fungible products satisfying industry and government specifications. Competition is based on price and location. 

The markets for fuel products tend to be volatile as well as cyclical as a result of the changing global economy and changing crude oil and refined product prices. Crude oil prices are impacted by worldwide political events, the economics of exploration and production and refined products demand. Prices and demand for fuel products are influenced by seasonal and short-term factors such as weather and driving patterns, as well as by longer term issues such as the economy, energy conservation and alternative fuels. Industry fuel products supply is dependent on short-term industry operating capabilities and on long-term refining capacity. 

A crack spread is a benchmark indication of refining margins based on the processing of a specific type of crude oil into an assumed selection of major refined products. The Houston refinery generally tracks the Maya 2-1-1 crack spread, which represents the difference between the current month Gulf Coast price of two 

&#160; 

barrels of Maya crude oil as set by Petr&#243;leos Mexicanos (&#147;Pemex&#148;) and one barrel each of U.S. Gulf Coast Reformulated Gasoline Blendstock for Oxygen Blending (&#147;RBOB&#148;) Gasoline and of U.S. Gulf Coast Ultralow-sulfur Diesel (&#147;ULSD&#148;). While these benchmark refining spreads are generally indicative of the level of profitability at the Houston refinery and similarly configured refineries, there are many other factors specific to each refinery and the industry in general, which influence operating results such as the value of refinery by-products (products other than gasoline and distillates that represent about one third of the total product volume, such as coke, sulfur, and lighter materials such as NGLs and crude olefins streams) and the cost of Renewable Identification Numbers (&#147;RINs&#148;). 

Technology Segment 

Overview 

Our Technology segment develops and licenses chemical, polyolefin and other process technologies and provides associated engineering and other services. Our Technology segment also develops, manufactures and sells polyolefin catalysts. We market our process technologies and our polyolefin catalysts to external customers and also use them in our own manufacturing operations. 

Our polyolefin process licenses are structured to provide a standard core technology, with individual customer needs met by adding customized modules that provide the required capabilities to produce the defined production grade slate and plant capacity. In addition to the basic license agreement, a range of services can also be provided, including project assistance; training; assistance in starting up the plant; and ongoing technical support after start-up. We may also offer marketing and sales services. In addition, licensees may continue to purchase polyolefin catalysts that are consumed in the production process, generally under long-term catalyst supply agreements with us. 

Process Technology Licensing 

We are a leading licensor of polyolefin process technologies. We also license a selective portfolio of chemical process technologies in the fields of olefin recovery, olefin conversion, aromatics extraction and acetyls. 

Polyolefin Catalysts 

We are a leading manufacturer and supplier of polyolefin catalysts. Approximately 25% of our catalyst sales are intercompany as we are a large polyolefin producer. 

Research and Development 

Our research and development (&#147;R&#38;D&#148;) activities are designed to improve our existing products and processes, and discover and commercialize new materials, catalysts and processes. These activities focus on product and application development, process development, catalyst development and fundamental polyolefin focused research. 

In 2015, 2014 and 2013, our research and development expenditures were $102 million, $127 million and $150 million, respectively. A portion of these expenses are related to technical support and customer service and are allocated to the other business segments. In 2015, approximately 45% of all R&#38;D costs were allocated to business segments, other than Technology, while in 2014 and 2013, the allocations approximated 35% and 30%, respectively. 

&#160; 

GENERAL 

Intellectual Property 

We maintain an extensive patent portfolio and continue to file new patent applications in the U.S. and other countries. As of December 31, 2015, we owned approximately 5,200 patents and patent applications worldwide. Our patents and trade secrets cover our processes, products and catalysts and are significant to our competitive position, particularly with regard to PO, intermediate chemicals, petrochemicals, polymers and our process technologies. We own globally registered and unregistered trademarks including marks for &#147;LyondellBasell,&#148; &#147;Lyondell&#148; and &#147;Equistar&#148;. While we believe that our intellectual property provides competitive advantages, we do not regard our businesses as being materially dependent upon any single patent, trade secret or trademark. Some of our heritage production capacity operates under licenses from third parties. 

Environmental 

Most of our operations are affected by national, state, regional and local environmental laws. Matters pertaining to the environment are discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors ; Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings ; Part II, Item 7. Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation s; and Notes 2 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

We have made, and intend to continue to make, the expenditures necessary for compliance with applicable laws and regulations relating to environmental, health and safety matters. We incurred capital expenditures of $177 million in 2015 for health, safety and environmental compliance purposes and improvement programs, and estimate such expenditures to be approximately $291 million in 2016 and $408 million in 2017. 

While capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance, including compliance with potential legislation and potential regulation related to climate change, cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe they will have a material effect on our competitive position. 

While there can be no assurance that physical risks to our facilities and supply chain due to climate change will not occur in the future, we have reviewed the potential for these risks and have concluded that, because of our facility locations and our existing distribution networks, we do not believe these risks are material in the near term. 

Employee Relations 

As of December 31, 2015, we employed approximately 13,000 full-time and part-time employees around the world. Of this total, 6,000 were located in North America and another 6,000 were located in Europe. The remainder of our employees are in other global locations. 

As of December 31, 2015, approximately 820 of our employees in North America were represented by labor unions. The vast majority of our employees in Europe and South America are subject to staff council or works council coverage or collective bargaining agreements. 

In addition to our own employees, we use the services of contractors in the routine conduct of our businesses.
