 ITEM 1. 

Business 

General 

CONSOL Energy Inc, (CONSOL Energy or the Company) is an integrated energy company operated through two primary divisions, oil and gas exploration and production (E&#38;P) and coal mining. The E&#38;P division is focused on Appalachian area natural gas and liquids activities, including production, gathering, processing and acquisition of natural gas properties in the Appalachian Basin. The Coal division is focused on the extraction and preparation of coal, also in the Appalachian Basin. 

CONSOL Energy was incorporated in Delaware in 1991, but its predecessors had been mining coal, primarily in the Appalachian Basin, since 1864. CONSOL Energy entered the natural gas business in the 1980s initially to increase the safety and efficiency of our coal mines by capturing methane from coal seams prior to mining, which makes the mining process safer and more efficient. Over the past ten years, CONSOL Energy's natural gas business has grown by approximately 498% to produce &#32; 328.7 net Bcfe in 2015. This business has grown from coalbed methane production in Virginia into other unconventional production, such as the Marcellus Shale and Utica Shale, in the Appalachian Basin. This growth was accelerated with the 2010 asset acquisition of the Appalachian Exploration &#38; Production business of Dominion Resources, Inc. Subsequently, on December 5, 2013 we sold Consolidation Coal Company and certain subsidiaries, including five active coal mines in West Virginia. 

Our E&#38;P division operates, develops and explores for natural gas primarily in Appalachia (Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, Virginia and Tennessee). Currently, our primary focus is the continued development of our Marcellus Shale acreage and the delineation and development of our Utica Shale acreage. We believe that our concentrated operating area, our legacy surface acreage position, our regional operating expertise, our extensive data set from development, joint ventures, non-operated participation wells, our held by production acreage position and our ability to coordinate gas drilling with coal mining activity gives us a significant operating advantage over our competitors. We expect to achieve production growth of approximately 15% in 2016. 

We are also party to two strategic joint ventures, one with Noble Energy, Inc. (Noble) in the Marcellus Shale and one with a subsidiary of Hess Corporation (Hess) in the Utica Shale. The Noble Energy joint venture requires our partner to pay a portion of our qualifying drilling and completion costs in certain circumstances, which could improve drilling economics and enable the acceleration of development of these assets in the future. 

&#32;&#32;Our land holdings in the Marcellus Shale and Utica Shale plays cover large areas, provide multi-year drilling opportunities and, collectively, have sustainable lower risk growth profiles. We currently control approximately 436,000 net acres in the Marcellus Shale and approximately 622,000 net acres that have Utica Shale potential in Ohio, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania. In addition, we estimate that approximately 345,000 net acres of our Marcellus Shale acreage in Pennsylvania and West Virginia are prospective for the slightly shallower Upper Devonian Shale. We also have approximately 2.3 million net acres in our coalbed methane play. 

Highlights of our 2015 &#32;production include the following: 

&#8226; 

Total average production of 900,430 Mcfe per day, an increase of 39% over 2014 ; 

&#8226; 

87% Natural Gas, 13% Liquids; and 

&#8226; 

51% Marcellus, 23% coalbed methane, 17% Utica, and 9% other. 

&#32;At December 31, 2015 , our proved natural gas reserves had the following characteristics: 

&#8226; 

5.6 Tcfe of proved reserves; 

&#8226; 

89.7% natural gas; 

&#8226; 

65.5% proved developed; 

&#8226; 

66.3% operated; and 

&#8226; 

A reserve life ratio of 17.17 years (based on 2015 &#32;production). 

Highlights of coal activities in 2015 &#32;include the following: 

&#8226; 

Underground mining complexes are among the safest in the United States of America; 

&#8226; 

Production of 29.3 million tons of coal; 

&#8226; 

Coal reserve holdings of 3.0 billion tons; 

&#8226; 

67% of coal sales to domestic utilities; and 

&#8226; 

In July 2015, CNX Coal Resources LP (CNXC) closed its initial public offering. 

Additionally, we provide energy services, including coal terminal services (the Baltimore Terminal), water services and land resource management services. 

The following map provides the location of CONSOL Energy's gas and coal operations by region: 

CONSOL Energy defines itself through its core values which are: 

&#8226; 

Safety, 

&#8226; 

Compliance, and 

&#8226; 

Continuous Improvement. 

These values are the foundation of CONSOL Energy's identity and are the basis for how management defines continued success. We believe CONSOL Energy's rich resource base, coupled with these core values, allows management to create value for the long-term. The electric power industry generates approximately two-thirds of its output by burning natural gas or coal, the two fuels we produce. We believe that the use of natural gas and coal will continue for many years as the principal fuel sources for electricity in the United States. Additionally, we believe that as worldwide economies grow, the demand for electricity from fossil fuels will grow as well, resulting in expansion of worldwide demand for our coal and potentially for our natural gas. 

CONSOL Energy's Strategy 

CONSOL Energy's strategy is to increase shareholder value through the development and growth of its existing natural gas assets, selective acquisition of natural gas and natural gas liquid acreage leases within its footprint, and through the participation in global thermal and metallurgical coal markets. Ultimately, we intend to separate our E&#38;P division and our Coal division and to focus on the growth of our E&#38;P division. We also will continue to focus on monetization of assets to accelerate value creation and to minimize the shortfall between operating cash flows and our growth capital requirements. 

We expect natural gas to become a more significant contributor to the domestic electric generation mix as well as fueling industrial growth in the U.S. economy. Also, the United States is expected to become a net exporter of natural gas in the next few years. Our increasing gas production, which we expect to grow by approximately 15% in 2016, will allow CONSOL Energy to participate in these markets. Production growth will come from three areas in 2016: new wells turned-in-line, non-operated production outside of the joint ventures with Hess and Noble Energy, and additional midstream debottlenecking projects. 

CONSOL Energy&#8217;s coal assets align with the Coal division long-term strategic objectives. The production from the company&#8217;s Pennsylvania (PA) Operations, which include the Bailey, Enlow Fork, and Harvey mines, can be sold domestically or abroad, as either thermal coal or high volatile metallurgical coal. These low-cost mines, with five longwalls, produce a high-Btu Pittsburgh-seam coal that is lower in sulfur than many Northern Appalachian coals. Also, the company&#8217;s Buchanan Mine which is in our Virginia Operations produces a premium low volatile metallurgical coal for the steel industry. Our Other Coal operations primarily includes our Miller Creek Complex. The 2016 coal sales volumes &#32;guidance range is 27 .0-32.0 million tons. 

Our PA Operations has a 2016 sold position of 24.1 million tons. Although the timing of shipments creates quarter to quarter volatility, CONSOL Energy expects that the committed tons will get shipped in 2016. In addition, we continue to seek opportunities for additional incremental sales to offset any potential delays from contracted customers. 

These mines, along with the 100%-owned Baltimore Terminal, will continue to allow CONSOL Energy to participate in the world&#8217;s thermal and metallurgical coal markets. The ability to serve both domestic and international markets with premium thermal and metallurgical coal provides tremendous optionality. 

On December 31, 2014, in connection with our strategy to separate our E&#38;P division from our Coal division, CONSOL Energy announced that its Board of Directors authorized management to pursue the formation of a master limited partnership (MLP) for the company&#8217;s thermal coal business, which would own interests in CONSOL Energy&#8217;s thermal coal properties and related mining operations located in Pennsylvania, including its Bailey Mine, Enlow Fork Mine, Harvey Mine and the related preparation plant. On July 7, 2015, CNX Coal Resources LP (CNXC) closed its initial public offering. Additionally, Greenlight Capital entered into a common unit purchase agreement with CNXC pursuant to which Greenlight Capital agreed to purchase, and CNXC agreed to sell, 5,000,000 common units at a price per unit equal to $15.00, which equates to $75 million in net proceeds. CNXC's general partner is CNX Coal Resources GP, a wholly owned subsidiary of CONSOL Energy. The underwriters of the IPO filing exercised an over-allotment option of 561,067 common units to the public at $15.00 per unit. The total net proceeds distributed to CONSOL Energy related to this transaction, along with CNXC entering into a new senior secured revolving credit facility, were $343 million. 

CONSOL Energy's E&#38;P Capital Expenditure Budget &#160; 

In 2016, the E&#38;P division expects capital expenditures between $205 and $325 million. The E&#38;P division capital expenditures are comprised of the following: $110-$210 million for drilling and completion activity, which includes $10-$15 million for coalbed methane (CBM) activity; $40-$50 million for midstream, including approximately $22 million associated with expected CONE Midstream Partners, LP capital contributions; and $55-$65 million for other activities related to land, permitting, and business development. 

The 2016 E&#38;P capital reflects continued benefits from drilling and completion efficiencies and the deferral of mainly wet gas completions until market conditions improve economic viability. CONSOL Energy believes that it can partially offset this deferral of activity through potential production benefits related to additional gathering system debottlenecking projects in the second half of 2016. These additional debottlenecking projects are expected to provide upside benefits to 2017 natural gas sales volumes. 

The lower end of the E&#38;P capital expenditure range mainly reflects capital associated with completing approximately 37% of the company's inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells. The higher end of the range encompasses adding back a modest level of drilling activity, which could commence around mid-year. The extent of drilling activity in 2016, if any, will primarily be a function of rates of return, commodity prices, and the assessment of the dry Utica wells drilled in 2015. The Company expects to make a decision regarding drilling capital allocation before mid-year 2016. 

DETAIL NATURAL GAS OPERATIONS 

Our Gas operations are located throughout Appalachia and include the following plays: 

Marcellus Shale 

We have the rights to extract natural gas in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Ohio from approximately 436,000 net Marcellus Shale acres at December 31, 2015 . 

CONSOL Energy and Noble Energy, our joint venture partner, drilled 79 gross wells in the Marcellus Shale in 2015 . CONSOL Energy drilled 44 of those wells in the dry gas area of the formation. The geographic breakdown was as follows: 

&#8226; 

24 wells in Southwestern Pennsylvania, 

&#8226; 

13 wells in Central Pennsylvania, 

&#8226; 

7 wells in Northern West Virginia, and 

&#8226; 

35 wells drilled by Noble Energy in the wet gas area of the play. 

CONSOL Energy completed 44 Marcellus Shale wells in 2015. The average completed lateral length was 7,019 feet with an average of 39 "frac" stages. 

In 2016, the Company expects Marcellus Shale and Utica Shale completion activity to be the primary driver of gas production growth. In both the Noble Energy and Hess joint ventures, CONSOL Energy and its partners continue to work together to optimize their activity levels for 2016 in light of the rapidly changing commodity price environment. 

We also hold a 50% interest in an entity that constructs and operates the gathering system for most of our Marcellus shale production. As of September 30, 2011, we contributed our existing Marcellus Shale gathering assets to this company. In September of 2014, the majority of these assets were contributed to CONE Midstream Partners LP. 

CONSOL Energy and Noble Energy have dedicated approximately 516,000 net acres of their jointly owned Marcellus Shale acreage to this partnership for an initial term of 20 years and they have also granted a right of first offer on an additional approximately 186,000 net acres. This master limited partnership formed by us and Noble Energy will continue to build and operate most of our Marcellus Shale gathering systems. CONSOL Energy continues to serve as operator for CONE Midstream Partners LP. See " Midstream Gas Services " for a more detailed explanation. 

Utica Shale 

We control approximately 119,000 net acres of Utica Shale potential in eastern Ohio at December 31, 2015 . Additionally, we control approximately 113,000 net acres in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia that contain the rights to the natural gas in the Utica Shale. We estimate that approximately 391,000 net acres of our Marcellus Shale acreage in Pennsylvania and West Virginia are prospective for the Utica Shale. The thickness of the Utica Shale in these areas ranges from 200 to 450 feet. 

In 2015, a total of 31 gross wells were drilled in the Utica Shale: 

&#8226; 

CONSOL Energy and Hess, our joint venture partner, drilled 24 gross wells. CONSOL Energy drilled seven of those wells, 

&#8226; 

CONSOL Energy and Noble Energy, drilled one gross well, and 

&#8226; 

CONSOL Energy drilled an additional six gross wells in the deep dry Utica area that were not part of either Joint Venture. 

&#32;Coalbed Methane (CBM) 

We have the rights to extract CBM in Virginia from approximately 268,000 net CBM acres, which cover a portion of our coal reserves in Central Appalachia. We produce natural gas primarily from the Pocahontas #3 seam which is the main coal seam mined by our Buchanan Mine. 

We also have the right to extract CBM in West Virginia, southwestern Pennsylvania, and Ohio from approximately 928,000 net CBM acres. In central Pennsylvania we have the right to extract CBM from approximately 260,000 net CBM acres. In addition, we control approximately 652,000 net CBM acres in Illinois, Kentucky, Indiana, and Tennessee. We also have the right to extract CBM on approximately139,000 net acres in the San Juan Basin and approximately 20,000 net acres in the Powder River Basin. We have no plans to drill CBM wells in these areas in 2016. 

Other Gas 

Shallow Oil and Gas 

The shallow oil and gas acreage position of CONSOL Energy is approximately 825,000 net acres mainly in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and New York at December 31, 2015 . The majority of our shallow oil and gas leasehold position is held by production and all of it is extensively overlain by existing third-party gas gathering and transmission infrastructure. The shallow oil and gas assets provide multiple synergies with our CBM and unconventional shale operations and the held by production nature of the shallow oil and gas properties affords CONSOL Energy considerable flexibility to choose when to exploit those and other gas assets including shale assets. 

Upper Devonian 

The Upper Devonian Shale formation, which includes both the Burkett Shale and Rhinestreet Shale, lies above the Marcellus Shale formation in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. The company holds a large number of acres that have Upper Devonian potential; generally these acres have not been disclosed separately, since they are not the primary drilling target. 

In 2015, CONSOL Energy, with our joint venture partner Noble Energy, drilled eight wells in the Burkett Shale and one well in the Rhinestreet Shale. Our Marcellus Shale joint venture partner owns a 50% interest in the Burkett Shale formation within the joint venture area of mutual interest. We control a 100% interest in the Rhinestreet Shale formation that was acquired prior to the joint venture, with the exception of one well drilled in 2015 that Noble Energy opted into. 

Chattanooga 

The Chattanooga Shale in Tennessee is a Devonian-age shale found at a depth of approximately 3,500 feet. The shale thickness is between 40-80 feet, and CONSOL Energy has found it to be rich in total organic content. CONSOL Energy has approximately 116,000 net acres of Chattanooga Shale. This largely contiguous acreage is composed of only a small number of leases, a rarity in Appalachia. CONSOL Energy is the operator of all of its horizontal Chattanooga Shale wells. 

Huron 

We have approximately 380,000 net acres of Huron Shale potential in Kentucky, West Virginia, and Virginia; a portion of this acreage has tight sands potential.

_________ 

(1) 

Net acres include acreage attributable to our working interests in the properties. Additional adjustments (either increases or decreases) may be required as we further develop title to and further confirm our rights with respect to our various properties in anticipation of development. We believe that our assumptions and methodology in this regard are reasonable. See Risk Factors in Section 1A of this Form 10-K. 

(2) 

Acreage amounts are shown under the target strata CONSOL Energy expects to produce, although the reported acres may include rights to multiple gas seams (CBM, Utica, Marcellus, etc.). We have reviewed our drilling plans, our acreage rights and used our best judgment to reflect the acres in the strata we expect to produce. As more information is obtained or circumstances change, the acreage classification may change. 

Producing Wells and Acreage 

Most of our development wells and proved acreage are located in Virginia, West Virginia and Pennsylvania. Some leases are beyond their primary term, but these leases are extended in accordance with their terms as long as certain drilling commitments or other term commitments are satisfied.

The leases reflected above as Net Unproved Acres with expiration dates are included in our current drill plan or active land program. Leases with expiration dates within two years represent less than 2% of our total acres in the above categories and leases with expiration dates beyond two years represent less than 3% of our total acres in the above categories. In each case, we deemed this acreage to not be material to our overall acreage position. Additionally, based on our current drill plans and lease management we do not anticipate any material impact to our consolidated financial statements from the expiration of such leases. 

Development Wells (Net) 

During the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;we drilled 132.8, 180.3 and 139.8 net development wells, respectively. Gob wells and wells drilled by operators other than our primary joint venture partners, Noble Energy and Hess Corporation, are excluded from net development wells. In 2015, there were 189 gross development wells. There were no dry development wells in 2015, 2014, or 2013. As of December 31, 2015, there are 17.7 net development wells still in process.

We calculate our present value at 10% (PV-10) in accordance with the following table. Management believes that the presentation of the non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) financial measure of PV-10 provides useful information to investors because it is widely used by professional analysts and sophisticated investors in evaluating oil and gas companies. Because many factors that are unique to each individual company impact the amount of future income taxes estimated to be paid, the use of a pre-tax measure is valuable when comparing companies based on reserves. PV-10 is not a measure of the financial or operating performance under GAAP. PV-10 should not be considered as an alternative to the 

standardized measure as defined under GAAP. We have included a reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP measure-after-tax discounted future net cash flows.

*Oil, NGLs, and Condensate are converted to Mcfe at the rate of one barrel equals six Mcf based upon the approximate relative energy content of oil and natural gas. 

CONSOL Energy expects 2016 annual gas production to grow by approximately 15% when compared to 2015. Production growth will come from three areas in 2016: new wells turned-in-line, non-operated production outside of the joint ventures with Hess Corporation and Noble Energy, Inc., and additional midstream debottlenecking projects. 

Average Sales Price and Average Lifting Cost 

The following table sets forth the total average sales price and the total average lifting cost for all of our natural gas and liquids production for the periods indicated, including intersegment transactions. Total lifting cost is the cost of raising gas to the gathering system and does not include depreciation, depletion or amortization.

Sales of NGLs, condensates, and oil enhance our reported natural gas equivalent sales price. Across all volumes, when excluding the impact of hedging, sales of liquids added $0.05 per Mcfe, $0.25 per Mcfe, and $0.14 per Mcfe for 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, to average gas sales prices. CONSOL Energy expects to continue to realize a liquids uplift benefit as additional wells are brought online in the liquid-rich areas of the Marcellus and Utica shales. We continue to sell the majority of our NGLs through the large midstream companies that process our natural gas. This approach allows us to take advantage of the processors&#8217; transportation efficiencies and diversified markets. CONSOL Energy&#8217;s processing contracts provide for the ability to take our NGLs &#8220;in kind&#8221; and market them directly if desired. The processed purity products are ultimately sold to industrial, commercial, and petrochemical markets. 

We enter into physical natural gas sales transactions with various counterparties for terms varying in length. Reserves and production estimates are believed to be sufficient to satisfy these obligations. In the past, we have delivered quantities required under these contracts. We also enter into various natural gas swap transactions. These gas swap transactions exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions and represented approximately 173.1 Bcf of our produced gas sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2015 &#32;at an average price of $3.68 per Mcf. These gas swaps represented approximately 159.9 Bcf of our produced gas sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2014 &#32;at an average price of $4.58 per Mcf. As of January 13, 2016 , we expect these transactions will represent approximately 223.6 &#32;Bcf of our estimated 2016 production at an average price of $ 3.26 per Mcf, 156.7 &#32;Bcf of our estimated 2017 production at an average price of $ 3.08 &#32;per Mcf, and approximately 75.8 &#32;Bcf of our estimated 2018 production at an average price of $ 3.07 per Mcf. 

&#160; 

The hedging strategy and information regarding derivative instruments used are outlined in Part II, Item 7A Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures About Market Risk and in Note 23 - Derivative Instruments in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 

Midstream Gas Services 

CONSOL Energy has traditionally designed, built and operated natural gas gathering systems to move gas from the wellhead to interstate pipelines or other local sales points. In addition, CONSOL Energy has acquired extensive gathering assets. CONSOL Energy now owns or operates approximately 5,000 miles of natural gas gathering pipelines as well as 250,000 horsepower of compression, of which, approximately 75% is wholly owned with the balance being leased. Along with this compression capacity, CONSOL Energy owns and operates a number of natural gas processing facilities. This infrastructure is capable of delivering approximately 750 billion cubic feet per year of pipeline quality gas. 

CONSOL Energy owns 50% of CONE Gathering LLC ("CONE" or "CONE Gathering") along with Noble Energy owning the other 50% interest. CONE Gathering develops, operates and owns substantially all of Noble Energy's and CONSOL Energy's Marcellus Shale gathering systems. CONSOL Energy operates this equity affiliate. We believe that the network of right-of-ways, vast surface holdings and experience in building and operating gathering systems in the Appalachian basin will give CONE Gathering an advantage in building the midstream assets required to develop the joint venture's Marcellus Shale position. On September 30, 2014, CONE Midstream Partners LP (the Partnership) closed its initial public offering of 20,125,000 common units representing limited partnership interests at a price to the public of $22.00 per unit, which included a 2,625,000 common unit over-allotment option that was exercised in full by the underwriters. The Partnership's general partner is CONE Midstream GP LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of CONE Gathering LLC. 

As a result of the IPO transaction, the Partnership received net proceeds of $412.7 million from the offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, and structuring fees of $28.8 million along with additional estimated offering expenses of approximately $1.2 million. Of the proceeds received, $204.0 million was distributed to each of CNX Gas Company LLC ("CNX Gas Company"), and Noble Energy on September 30, 2014. 

In the Utica Shale, we and our joint venture partner, Hess, are primarily contracting with third-parties for gathering services. 

CONSOL Energy has developed a diversified portfolio of firm transportation capacity options to support its production growth plan. CONSOL Energy plans to selectively acquire as needed firm capacity while minimizing transportation costs and long-term financial obligations and, in the near term if appropriate, plans to optimize and/or release firm transportation to others to enhance revenues. CONSOL Energy also benefits from the strategic location of our primary production areas in Southwest Pennsylvania, Northern West Virginia, and Eastern Ohio. These areas are served by a large concentration of major pipelines that provide us with the capacity to move our production to the major gas markets. In addition to firm transportation capacity, CONSOL Energy has developed a processing portfolio to support the projected volumes from its wet production areas and has operational and contractual flexibility to potentially convert a portion of currently processed wet gas volumes to be marketed as dry gas volumes. 

CONSOL Energy has the advantage of having gas production from CBM, which can be lower Btu than pipeline specification, as well as higher Btu Marcellus Shale production. These two types of gas can complement each other by reducing and in some cases eliminating the need for the costly processing of CBM. In addition, both our lower Btu CBM and dry Marcellus production offer an opportunity to blend ethane back into the gas stream when pricing or capacity for ethane markets dictate. In developing a diversified approach to managing ethane, CONSOL Energy has entered into ethane supply agreements and is discussing future outlet opportunities with ethane customers and midstream companies. These measures will allow us more flexibility in bringing Marcellus Shale wells on-line at qualities that meet interstate pipeline specifications. 

Natural Gas Competition 

The United States natural gas industry is highly competitive and more diversified than the coal industry. CONSOL Energy competes with other large producers, as well as a myriad of smaller producers, marketers, pipeline imports from Canada, and Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) from around the globe. According to data from the Natural Gas Supply Association and the Energy Information Agency (EIA), the five largest U.S. producers of natural gas produced about 16% of dry natural gas production in the first six months of 2015. The EIA reported 513,386 producing natural gas wells in the United States at December 31, 2014, the latest year for which government statistics are available. 

Natural gas increased market share in the U.S. electric generation market by about 5% compared to 2014 (based on preliminary 2015 results). We expect natural gas to be a significant contributor to the domestic electric generation mix in the long-term, as well as fuel industrial growth in the U.S. economy. There is potential for natural gas to become a significant contributor to the transportation market. Additionally, the U.S. is expected to become a net exporter of gas in the next few years due to the expansion of exports to Mexico, waning imports from Canada, and completion of new liquefaction facilities with long-term export contracts including Cheniere&#8217;s Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi projects. Our increasing gas production will allow CONSOL Energy to participate in these growing markets. 

CONSOL Energy's gas operations are primarily located in the eastern United States. The gas market is highly fragmented and not dominated by any single producer. We believe that competition within our market is based primarily on natural gas commodity trading fundamentals and pipeline transportation availability to the various markets. 

Continued demand for CONSOL Energy's natural gas and the prices that CONSOL Energy obtains are affected by natural gas use in the production of electricity, U.S. manufacturing and the overall strength of the economy, environmental and government regulation, technological developments, the availability and price of competing alternative fuel supplies, and national and regional supply/demand dynamics. 

DETAIL COAL OPERATIONS 

Coal Reserves 

At December 31, 2015 , CONSOL Energy had an estimated 3.0 billion tons of proven and probable coal reserves. Reserves are the portion of the proven and probable tonnage that meet CONSOL Energy's economic criteria regarding mining height, preparation plant recovery, depth of overburden and stripping ratio. Generally, these reserves would be commercially mineable at year-end price and cost levels. 

Spacing of points of observation for confidence levels in reserve calculations is based on guidelines in U.S. Geological Survey Circular 891 (Coal Resource Classification System of the U.S. Geological Survey). Our estimates for proved reserves have the highest degree of geologic assurance. Estimates for proved reserves are based on points of observation that are equal to or less than 0.5 miles apart. Estimates for probable reserves have a moderate degree of geologic assurance and are computed from points of observation that are between 0.5 to 1.5 miles apart. 

An exception is made concerning spacing of observation points with respect to our Pittsburgh coal seam reserves. Because of the well-known continuity of this seam, spacing requirements are 3,000 feet or less for proved reserves and between 3,000 and 8,000 feet for probable reserves. 

CONSOL Energy's estimates of proven and probable coal reserves do not rely on isolated points of observation. Small pods of reserves based on a single observation point are not considered; continuity between observation points over a large area is necessary for proved or probable reserves. 

Our estimate of proven and probable coal reserves has been determined by CONSOL Energy&#8217;s geologists and mining engineers. CONSOL Energy's geologists and mining engineers completed an extensive re-evaluation of the longwall mineable Pittsburgh and Illinois No. 5 seams during 2014. The re-evaluations included the use of mine specific assumptions and mine plans versus general mine recovery factors and general parameters. To date, approximately 50% of CONSOL Energy&#8217;s reserves have been re-evaluated using mine specific parameters as opposed to an assumed average mining recovery factors. The 2014 re-evaluations resulted in 460 million of the total 471 million additional tons of proven and probable coal reserves added as result of revisions and other changes in 2014 (See Supplemental Coal Data in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K). 

CONSOL Energy's proven and probable coal reserves fall within the range of commercially marketed coals in the United States. The marketability of coal depends on its value-in-use for a particular application, and this is affected by coal quality, such as, sulfur content, ash and heating value. Modern power plant boiler design aspects can compensate for coal quality differences that occur. Therefore, any of CONSOL Energy's coals can be marketed for the electric power generation industry. Additionally, the growth in worldwide demand for metallurgical coal allows some of our proven and probable coal reserves, currently classified as thermal coals, that possess certain qualities to be sold as metallurgical coal. The addition of this cross-over market adds additional assurance to CONSOL Energy that all of its proven and probable coal reserves are commercially marketable. 

CONSOL Energy assigns coal reserves to each of our mining complexes. The amount of coal we assign to a mining complex generally is sufficient to support mining through the duration of our current mining permit. Under federal law, we must renew our mining permits every five years. All assigned reserves have their required permits or governmental approvals, or there is a high probability that these approvals will be secured. 

In addition, our mining complexes may have access to additional reserves that have not yet been assigned. We refer to these reserves as accessible. Accessible reserves are proven and probable coal reserves that can be accessed by an existing mining complex, utilizing the existing infrastructure of the complex to mine and to process the coal in this area. Mining an accessible reserve does not require additional capital spending beyond that required to extend or to continue the normal progression of the mine, such as the sinking of airshafts or the construction of portal facilities. 

Some reserves may be accessible by more than one mining complex because of the proximity of many of our mining complexes to one another. In the table below, the accessible reserves indicated for a mining complex are based on our review of current mining plans and reflect our best judgment as to which mining complex is most likely to utilize the reserve. 

Assigned and unassigned coal reserves are proven and probable coal reserves which are either owned or leased. The leases have terms extending up to 30 years and generally provide for renewal through the anticipated life of the associated mine. These renewals are exercisable by the payment of minimum royalties. Under current mining plans, assigned reserves reported will be mined out within the period of existing leases or within the time period of probable lease renewal periods.

The heat values shown for Assigned Operating reserves are based on the 2015 actual quality and five-year forecasted quality for each mine/reserve, assuming that the coal is washed to an extent consistent with normal full-capacity operation of each mine's/complex's preparation plant. Actual quality is based on laboratory analysis of samples collected from coal shipments delivered in 2015. Forecasted quality is derived from exploration sample analysis results, which have been adjusted to account for anticipated moisture and for the effects of mining and coal preparation. The heat values shown for Accessible Reserves are based on as received, dry values obtained from drill hole analyses, adjusted for moisture, and prorated by the associated Assigned Operating product values to account for similar mining and processing methods. 

(2) 

Recoverable reserves are calculated based on the area in which mineable coal exists, coal seam thickness, and average density determined by laboratory testing of drill core samples. This calculation is adjusted to account for coal that will not be recovered during mining and for losses that occur if the coal is processed after mining. Reserve calculations do not include an adjustment for moisture that may be added during mining or processing, nor do the calculations include adjustments for dilution from rock lying above or below the coal seam. Reserves are reported only for those coal seams that are controlled by ownership or leases. 

The following table sets forth our unassigned proven and probable coal reserves by region:

The heat value estimates for Northern Appalachian and Central Appalachian Unassigned coal reserves include adjustments for moisture that may be added during mining or processing as well as for dilution by rock lying above or below the coal seam. The mining and processing methods currently in use are used for these estimates. The heat value are estimates for the Illinois Basin. Unassigned reserves are based primarily on exploration drill core data that may not include adjustments for moisture added during mining or processing, or for dilution by rock lying above or below the coal seam. 

(2) 

Recoverable reserves are calculated based on the area in which mineable coal exists, coal seam thickness, and average density determined by laboratory testing of drill core samples. This calculation is adjusted to account for coal that will not be recovered during mining and for losses that occur if the coal is processed after mining. Reserve calculations do not include adjustment for moisture that may be added during mining or processing, nor do the calculations include adjustments for dilution from rock lying above or below the coal seam. Reserves are reported only for those coal seams that are controlled by ownership or leases.

140.8 Million tons of the Northern Appalachia leased tons are controlled by Consolidation Coal Company, a former subsidiary of CONSOL Energy that was sold in December 2013. As of filing these tons are still controlled by Consolidation Coal Company but are shown in CONSOL Energy's reserves due to a binding agreement that these tons will be released to CONSOL Energy following the change in name of the Lease Holder. 

The following table classifies CONSOL Energy coals by rank, projected sulfur dioxide emissions and heating value (British thermal units per pound). The table also classifies bituminous coals as high, medium and low volatile which is based on fixed carbon and volatile matter.

143.3 Million tons for the Mason Dixon Project are controlled by Consolidation Coal Company, a former subsidiary of CONSOL Energy that was sold in December 2013. As of this filing, these tons are still controlled by Consolidation Coal Company but are shown in CONSOL Energy's reserves due to a binding agreement that these tons will be released to CONSOL Energy upon consent of the lessor. 

Title to coal properties that we lease or purchase and the boundaries of these properties are verified by law firms retained by us at the time we lease or acquire the properties. Consistent with industry practice, abstracts and title reports are reviewed and updated approximately five years prior to planned development or mining of the property. If defects in title or boundaries of undeveloped reserves are discovered in the future, control of and the right to mine reserves could be adversely affected. 

The following table sets forth, with respect to properties that we lease to other coal operators, the total royalty tonnage, acreage leased and the amount of income (net of related expenses) we received from royalty payments for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 .

Royalty tonnage leased to third parties is not included in the amounts of produced tons that we report. Proven and probable reserves do not include reserves attributable to properties that we lease to third parties. 

Production 

In the year ended December 31, 2015 , 93% of CONSOL Energy's production came from underground mines and 7% from surface mines. CONSOL Energy employs longwall mining systems in our underground mines where the geology is favorable and reserves are sufficient. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , 93% of our production came from mines equipped with longwall mining systems. Underground longwall systems are highly mechanized, capital intensive operations. Mines using longwall systems have a low variable cost structure compared with other types of mines and can achieve high productivity levels compared with those of other underground mining methods. Because CONSOL Energy has substantial reserves readily suitable to these operations, CONSOL Energy believes that these longwall mines can increase capacity at a low incremental cost. 

The following table shows the production, in millions of tons, for CONSOL Energy's mines for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , the location of each mine, the type of mine, the type of equipment used at each mine, method of transportation and the year each mine was established or acquired by us.

Approximately 67% of our 2015 &#32;coal sales were made to U. S. electric generators, 26% of our 2015 &#32;coal sales were priced on export markets and 7% of our coal sales were made to other domestic customers. We had sales to over 40 customers from our 2015 &#32;coal operations. During 2015 , Xcoal Energy Resources and Duke Energy &#32;each comprised over 10% of our revenues, and the top four coal customers accounted for more than 36% of our total revenues. 

Coal Contracts 

We sell coal to an established customer base through opportunities as a result of strong business relationships, or through a formalized bidding process. Contract volumes range from a single shipment to multi-year agreements for millions of tons of coal. The average contract term is between one to three years. As a normal course of business, efforts are made to renew or extend contracts scheduled to expire. Although there are no guarantees, we generally have been successful in renewing or extending contracts in the past. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , over 66% of all the coal we produced was sold under contracts with terms of one year or more. 

The following table sets forth CONSOL Energy's estimated production and sales:

Note: Committed tons are tons that are both committed to be purchased and priced. Committed tons exclude collared tons and tons that are sold but not yet priced. There are no collared tons in 2015 or 2016. Collared tons in 2017 are 4.9 million tons, with a ceiling of $50.98 per ton and a floor of $43.77 per ton. Contracts with certain customers permit the customer to carry a portion of their contracted tons into the following year and/or to take gas instead of coal. For purposes of this table, the estimated price of each committed contract includes the base price stated in the contract and an estimate of the future adjustments to the contracted base price as set forth in such contract. The adjustment mechanisms reflect (i) variances in the quality characteristics of coal delivered to the customer beyond threshold quality characteristics specified in the applicable sales contract, (ii) the actual calorific value of coal delivered to the customer, and/or (iii) changes in electric power prices in the markets in which our customers operate, as adjusted for any factors set forth in the applicable contract. Each customer contract is different and not all contracts contain adjustments described in the preceding sentence. The estimated prices set forth in the table above were based in part on certain assumptions made by management. With respect to clause (i) quality characteristics, we based our assumption on our average monthly estimated quality numbers generated with our production forecast, created using pre-mining geology and analytical work, to determine the likely penalties and premiums associated with each contract using the average mine quality for tons estimated to be shipped during the time period. With respect to clause (ii) actual calorific value, we based our assumption on our average monthly estimated quality numbers generated with our production forecast, created using premining geology and analytical work, to determine the likely penalties and premiums associated with each contract using the average mine quality for tons estimated to be shipped during the time period. With respect to clause (iii), the electric power price-related adjustments, if any, result only in positive monthly adjustments to the contracted base price that we receive for our coal. These adjustments to contracted base prices were estimated using publicly available regional power generation information applicable to the markets in which our customers operate and other internally estimated information regarding contract specific factors that impact pricing. The key assumptions used for the estimated electric power price-related adjustments were derived using PJM Western Hub Day-Ahead Calendar Month (Peak and Off-Peak) prices adjusted using management's judgment and historical results. These derived assumptions were held constant in 2016 and 2017. While management considers the expectations and assumptions regarding estimated prices, including with respect to estimated electric power price-related adjustments, to be reasonable, they are inherently subject to business, economic, competitive, regulatory, and other risks and uncertainties, most of which are beyond our control. 

Coal pricing for contracts with terms of one year or less are generally fixed. Coal pricing for multiple-year agreements generally provide the opportunity to periodically adjust the contract prices through pricing mechanisms consisting of one or more of the following: 

&#8226; 

Fixed price contracts with pre-established prices; 

&#8226; 

Periodically negotiated prices that reflect market conditions at the time; 

&#8226; 

Price restricted to an agreed-upon percentage increase or decrease; or 

&#8226; 

Base-price-plus-escalation methods which allow for periodic price adjustments based on inflation indices, or other negotiated indices. 

The volume of coal to be delivered is specified in each of our coal contracts. Although the volume to be delivered under the coal contracts is stipulated, the parties may vary the timing of the deliveries within specified limits. 

Coal contracts typically contain force majeure provisions allowing for the suspension of performance by either party for the duration of specified events. Force majeure events include, but are not limited to, unexpected significant geological conditions or natural disasters. Depending on the language of the contract, some contracts may terminate upon continuance of an event of force majeure that extends for a period greater than three to twelve months. 

Distribution 

Coal is transported from CONSOL Energy's mining complexes to customers by railroad cars, trucks or a combination of these means of transportation. We employ transportation specialists who negotiate freight and equipment agreements with various transportation suppliers, including railroads, barge lines, terminal operators, ocean vessel brokers and trucking companies for certain customers. 

Coal Competition 

Both the domestic and international coal industries are highly competitive, with numerous producers selling into all markets that use coal. CONSOL Energy competes against several other large producers and numerous small producers in the United States and overseas. Demand for our coal by our principal customers is affected by many factors including: 

&#8226; 

the price of competing coal and alternative fuel supplies, including nuclear, natural gas, oil and 

renewable energy sources, such as hydroelectric power, wind or solar; 

&#8226; 

environmental and government regulation; 

&#8226; 

coal quality; 

&#8226; 

transportation costs from the mine to the customer; 

&#8226; 

the reliability of fuel supply; 

&#8226; 

worldwide demand for steel; 

&#8226; 

natural disasters/weather; and 

&#8226; 

political changes in international governments. 

Continued demand for CONSOL Energy's coal and the prices that CONSOL Energy obtains are affected by demand for electricity, technological developments, environmental and governmental regulation, and the availability and price of competing coal and alternative fuel supplies. We sell coal to foreign electricity generators and to the more specialized metallurgical coal markets, both of which are significantly affected by international demand and competition. 

Other Operations 

CONSOL Energy provides other services both to our own operations and to others. These include land services, coal terminal services and water services. 

Non-Core Mineral Assets and Surface Properties 

CONSOL Energy owns significant gas and coal assets that are not in our short or medium term development plans. We continually explore the monetization of these non-core assets by means of sale, lease, contribution to joint ventures, or a combination of the foregoing in order to bring the value of these assets forward for the benefit of our shareholders. We also control a significant amount of surface acreage. This surface acreage is valuable to us in the development of the gathering system for our Marcellus Shale and Utica Shale production. We also derive value from this surface control by granting rights of way or development rights to third-parties when we are able to derive appropriate value for our shareholders. 

Terminal Services 

In 2015, approximately 8.1 million tons of coal were shipped through CONSOL Energy's subsidiary, CNX Marine Terminals Inc.'s, exporting terminal in the Port of Baltimore. Approximately 67% of the tonnage shipped was produced by CONSOL Energy coal mines. The terminal can either store coal or load coal directly into vessels from rail cars. It is also one of the few terminals in the United States served by two railroads, Norfolk Southern Corporation and CSX Transportation Inc. 

&#160; 

Water Division 

CNX Water Assets LLC, is doing business as CONVEY Water Systems LLC, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of CONSOL Energy and supplies turnkey solutions for water sourcing, delivery and disposal for our E&#38;P operations, supplies solutions for water sourcing, delivery and disposal for third parties and also provides supplemental water sourcing and marketing efforts on behalf of CNXC. In coordination with our midstream operations, CONVEY Water Systems works to develop solutions that coincide with our midstream operations to offer gas gathering and water delivery solutions in one package to third parties. 

Employee and Labor Relations 

At December 31, 2015 , CONSOL Energy had 3,114 employees. Less than 1% of the total workforce is represented by the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA). 

Industry Segments 

Financial information concerning industry segments, as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;is included in Note 25 - Segment Information in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K and incorporated herein. 

Laws and Regulations 

Overview 

Our natural gas and coal mining operations are subject to various types of federal, state and local laws and regulations. Regulations relating to our operations include permitting and other licensing requirements; water withdrawal and procurement for well stimulation purposes; well drilling and casing; well production; well plugging; venting or flaring of natural gas; pipeline compression and transmission of natural gas and liquids; reclamation and restoration of properties after natural gas or coal mining operations are completed; storage, transportation and disposal of materials used or generated by gas and mining operations; the calculation, reporting and disbursement of taxes; gathering of gas production in certain circumstances; surface subsidence from underground mining; discharge of water from coal mining operations; air quality standards; protection of wetlands; endangered plant and wildlife protection; and employee health and safety. Numerous governmental permits and approvals under these laws and regulations are required for gas and mining operations. Lastly, the electric power generation industry is subject to extensive regulation regarding the environmental impact of its power generation activities, which could affect demand for our gas and coal products. 

Compliance with these laws has substantially increased the cost of gas production and mining of coal for all domestic gas and coal producers. We also post performance bonds or letters of credit pursuant to state oil and gas laws and regulations to guarantee reclamation of gas well sites and plugging of gas wells. We post surety performance bonds or letters of credit pursuant to federal and state mining laws and regulations for the estimated costs of reclamation and mine closing, often including the cost of treating mine water discharge. We endeavor to conduct our gas and mining operations in compliance with all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations. However, because of extensive and comprehensive regulatory requirements against a backdrop of variable geologic and seasonal conditions, permit exceedances and violations during gas and mining operations can and do occur. The possibility exists that new legislation or regulations may be adopted which would have a significant impact on our gas and coal mining operations or our customers' ability to use our gas and coal and may require us or our customers to change their operations significantly or incur substantial costs. 

CONSOL Energy is committed to complying with all laws and regulations. This commitment is evident in CONSOL Energy's demonstrated cost and effort to abate and control pollution and/or contamination at its facilities. CONSOL Energy made capital expenditures for environmental control facilities of approximately $18.4 million, $19.0 million, and $1.6 million in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. CONSOL Energy does not expect to have any capital expenditures in 2016 for environmental control facilities. 

Environmental Laws 

Clean Air Act and Related Regulations. &#32;The federal Clean Air Act (CAA) and corresponding state laws and regulations regulate air emissions primarily through permitting and/or emissions control requirements. This affects natural gas production and processing operations as well as coal mining, coal handling, and processing. 

We are required to obtain pre-approval for construction or modification of certain facilities, to meet stringent air permit requirements, or to use specific equipment, technologies or best management practices to control emissions. On August 16, 2012, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published final revisions to the New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) to regulate emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) from various oil and gas exploration, production, processing and transportation facilities. Additionally, revisions were made to the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPS) to further regulate emissions from the oil and natural gas production sector and the transmission and storage of natural gas. Section 111 of the CAA authorized the EPA to develop technology based standards which apply to specific categories of stationary sources. On September 18, 2015, the EPA proposed updates to the New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) that would create new standards for the regulation of methane and VOC emission sources. The proposed rule 

includes requirements for new fugitive emission and leak detection testing and reporting requirements. Also on September 18, 2015, the EPA proposed the Source Determination Rule which would clarify the use of the term &#8220;adjacent&#8221; in determining Title V air permitting requirements as they apply to the oil and natural gas industry for major sources of air emissions. 

The EPA has proposed to amend the Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems source category (Subpart W) of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP). Currently, we are required to annually report greenhouse gas emission from natural gas wells, coal mines and associated facilities. This proposed rule would add reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from certain gathering and boosting systems, completions and workovers of oil wells using hydraulic fracturing, and blowdowns of natural gas transmission pipelines. The rule would also require operators to utilize new monitoring equipment in order to comply with Subpart W. 

The CAA also indirectly and more significantly affects the U.S. coal industry by extensively regulating the air emissions of coal-fired electric power generating plants operated by our customers. Coal contains impurities, such as sulfur, mercury and other constituents, many of which are released into the air when coal is burned. Carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, is also emitted when coal is burned. Environmental regulations governing emissions from coal-fired electric generating plants increase the costs to operate and could affect demand for coal as a fuel source and affect the volume of our sales. Moreover, additional environmental regulations increase the likelihood that existing coal-fired electric generating plants will be decommissioned, including plants to which CONSOL Energy sells coal to, and reduce the likelihood that new coal-fired plants will be built in the future. 

In early 2012, the EPA promulgated or finalized several rules for NSPS for coal- and oil- fired power plants which also have a negative effect on coal-generating facilities. The Utility Maximum Control Technology (UMACT) rule requires more stringent NSPS for particulate matter (PM), SO2 and NOX and the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) rule requires new mercury and air toxic standards. In November 2012, the EPA published a notice of reconsideration of certain aspects of the UMACT and MATS rules. Following reconsideration in April 2013 and again in April 2014, the EPA promulgated final UMACT and MATS rules in November 2014 at which point the standards become applicable to new power plants. The final rules have higher emission limits, but the standards are still stringent and compliance with the rules is expensive. 

On July 6, 2011, the EPA finalized a rule known as the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR). CSAPR regulates cross-border emissions of criteria air pollutants such as SO2 and NOX, as well as byproducts, fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone by requiring states to limit emissions from sources that "contribute significantly" to noncompliance with air quality standards for the criteria air pollutants. If the ambient levels of criteria air pollutants are above the thresholds set by the EPA, a region is considered to be in "nonattainment" for that pollutant and the EPA applies more stringent control standards for sources of air emissions located in the region. In April 2014, the Supreme Court reversed a decision of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals that had vacated the rule. Following remand and briefing the D.C. Circuit Court, in October 2014, granted a motion to lift a stay of the rule and allow the EPA to modify the CSAPR compliance deadline by three-years, setting the stage for issuance of the proposed rule. Implementation of CSAPR Phase 1 began in 2015, with Phase 2 scheduled to begin in 2017. On December 3, 2015, the EPA proposed an update to the CSAPR for the 2008 Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) by issuing the proposed CSAPR Update Rule. The rule will require reductions of seasonal nitrogen oxide emissions from power plants in 23 of the originally proposed 28 Eastern states to address interstate air quality impacts for the 2008 ozone air quality requirements in downwind states. 

In April 2012, the EPA published its proposed NSPS for carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from coal-powered electric generating units. The proposed rules would have applied to new power plants and to existing plants that make major modifications. If the rules had been adopted as proposed, the only new coal-fired power plants that could have met the proposed emission limits would have been coal-fired plants with CO2 capture and storage (CCS). Commercial scale CCS is not likely to be available in the near future, and if available, it may make coal-fired electric generation units uneconomical compared to new gas-fired electric generation units. On January 8, 2014, the EPA re-proposed NSPS for CO2 for new fossil fuel fired power plants and rescinded the rules that were proposed on April 12, 2012. 

On September 20, 2013, the EPA issued a new proposal to control carbon emissions from new power plants. Under the proposal, the EPA would establish separate NSPS for CO2 emissions for natural gas-fired turbines and coal-fired units. The proposed &#8220;Carbon Pollution Standard for New Power Plants&#8221; replaces an earlier proposal released by the EPA in 2012. On August 3, 2015, EPA finalized the Carbon Pollution Standards to cut carbon emissions from new, modified and reconstructed power plants, which became effective on October 23, 2015. 

In another proposed rulemaking related to CO2 emissions, on June 2, 2014, the EPA proposed the Clean Power Plan to cut carbon emissions from existing power plants. Under this proposed rule, the EPA would create emission guidelines for states to follow in developing plans to address greenhouse gas emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units. Specifically, the EPA is proposing state-specific rate-based goals for CO2 emissions from the power sector, as well as guidelines for states to follow in developing plans to achieve the state-specific goals. On August 3, 2015, the EPA finalized the Clean Power Plan Rule to cut carbon pollution from existing power plants, which became effective on December 22, 2015. States, industry, and labor 

organizations have filed at least 17 petitions for review in the D.C. Circuit of Appeals requesting that the Court stay implementation of the Clean Power Plan because they will suffer &#8220;irreparable harm.&#8221; Petitioners also argued that the Final Rule violates the CAA because energy generating units (EGUs) are already subject to hazardous air pollutant limits under Section 112 of the CAA. 

&#160; 

The CAA requires the EPA to set NAAQS for certain pollutants and the CAA identifies two types of NAAQS. Primary standards provide public health protection, including protecting the health of "sensitive" populations such as asthmatics, children, and the elderly. Secondary standards provide public welfare protection, including protection against decreased visibility and damage to animals, crops, vegetation, and buildings. On October 1, 2015, the EPA finalized the NAAQS for ozone pollution and reduced the limit to 70 parts per billion (ppb) from the previous 75 ppb standard. The final rule could have a large impact on both the oil and gas and coal mining industries as states would be required to update their permitting standards to meet these potentially unachievable limits. Six states have now filed a petition for review in the D.C. Circuit of Appeals. 

Clean Water Act. &#32;The federal Clean Water Act (CWA) and corresponding state laws affect our natural gas and coal operations by regulating discharges into surface waters. Permits requiring regular monitoring and compliance with effluent limitations and reporting requirements govern the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters. The CWA and corresponding state laws include requirements for: improvement of designated "impaired waters" (i.e., not meeting state water quality standards) through the use of effluent limitations; anti-degradation regulations which protect state designated "high quality/exceptional use" streams by restricting or prohibiting discharges; requirements to treat discharges from coal mining properties for non-traditional pollutants, such as chlorides, selenium and dissolved solids; requirements to minimize impacts and compensate for unavoidable impacts resulting from discharges of fill materials to regulated streams and wetlands; and requirements to dispose of produced wastes and other oil and gas wastes at approved disposal facilities. In addition, the Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure (SPCC) requirements of the CWA apply to all CONSOL Energy operations that use or produce fluids and require the implementation of plans to address any spills and the installation of secondary containment around all storage tanks. These requirements may cause CONSOL Energy to incur significant additional costs that could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. 

Pursuant to a Congressional requirement in the EPA's 2010 budget appropriation, the EPA must conduct a comprehensive study of the potential adverse impact that hydraulic fracturing may have on water quality and public health. Hydraulic fracturing is a way of producing natural gas from tight rock formations such as the Marcellus shale and Utica shale. The EPA initiated the study in early January 2011 and the final assessment report was published on June 4, 2015. The assessment showed hydraulic fracturing activities have not led to widespread, systemic impacts to drinking water resources. 

CONSOL Energy utilizes pipelines extensively for its natural gas, water and coal businesses, and mitigation permits from the Army Corps of Engineers (ACOE) are typically required for certain impacts to streams and wetlands. On April 21, 2014 the EPA published a proposed rule called &#8220;Definition of &#8216;Waters of the United States&#8217; (WoUS) Under the Clean Water Act.&#8221; The proposal would expand the scope of the CWA to include previously non-jurisdictional streams, wetlands, and waters, making these areas jurisdictional inter-coastal waters of the U.S. In February 2015 the EPA and ACOE issued a memorandum of understanding to withdraw the WoUS Interpretive Rule. The EPA published the latest version of the WoUS rule (the Clean Water Rule) on June 29, 2015, which was to become effective on August 28, 2015. However, on August 27, 2015, the District Court for the District of North Dakota blocked implementation of the rule in 13 states. On October 9, 2015, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit blocked implementation of the rule nationwide. 

In order to obtain a permit for surface coal mining activities, including valley fills associated with steep slope mining, an operator must obtain a permit for the discharge of fill material from the ACOE and a discharge permit from the state regulatory authority under the state counterpart to the Clean Water Act. Beginning in early 2009, the EPA implemented several initiatives that have delayed and obstructed the issuance of surface mining operation permits in the Appalachian states including Pennsylvania and Virginia where our principal mining complexes are located. Increased oversight of delegated state programmatic authority, coupled with individual permit review and additional requirements imposed by the EPA, has resulted in delays in the review and issuance of permits for surface coal mining operations, including applications for surface facilities for underground mines, such as applications for coal refuse disposal areas. The coal industry has had some success challenging the EPA&#8217;s policies but the EPA continues with its initiatives. Thus far, CONSOL Energy&#8217;s subsidiaries have been able to continue operating their existing mines. There is no assurance that permits can be obtained for future mining operations. 

Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. &#32;The federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and corresponding state laws and regulations affect natural gas operations and coal mining by imposing requirements for the treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous wastes. Facilities at which hazardous wastes have been treated, stored or disposed of are subject to corrective action orders issued by the EPA that could adversely affect our results, financial condition and cash flows. In 2010, the EPA proposed options for the regulation of Coal Combustion Residuals (CCRs) from the electric power sector as either hazardous waste or non-hazardous waste. On December 19, 2014, the EPA announced the first national regulations for the disposal of CCRs 

from electric utilities and independent power producers under RCRA. On April 17, 2015, the EPA finalized these regulations under the solid waste provisions (Subtitle D) of RCRA and not the hazardous waste provisions (Subtitle C) which became effective on October 19, 2015. The EPA affirms in the preamble to the final rule that &#8220;this rule does not apply to CCR placed in active or abandoned underground or surface mines.&#8221; Instead, &#8220;the U.S. Department of Interior (DOI) and the EPA will address the management of CCR in mine fills in a separate regulatory action(s).&#8221; On November 3, 2015, the EPA published the final rule Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards (ELG), revising the regulations for the Steam Electric Power Generating category which became effective on January 4, 2016. The rule sets the first federal limits on the levels of toxic metals in wastewater that can be discharged from power plants, based on technology improvements in the steam electric power industry over the last three decades. The combined effect of the CCR and ELG regulations has forced power generating companies to close existing ash ponds and will likely force the closure of certain older existing coal burning power plants that can&#8217;t comply with the new standards. 

Endangered Species Act. &#32;The Federal Endangered Species Act (ESA) and similar state laws protect species threatened with extinction. Protection of endangered and threatened species may cause us to modify natural gas well pad siting or pipeline right of ways, mining plans, or develop and implement species-specific protection and enhancement plans to avoid or minimize impacts to endangered species or their habitats. A number of species indigenous to the areas where we operate are protected under the ESA. On April 2, 2015, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) published the listing of the Northern Long-eared Bat (NLEB) as Threatened with 4(d) Rule status which became effective on May 4, 2015. Other species that are being considered by the FWS for listing and that are found in CONSOL Energy&#8217;s operational area are the Big Sandy Crayfish, the Guyandotte River Crayfish and the Rusty Patched Bumble Bee, all of which have the potential to interfere with operational planning if listed. 

Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act . The federal Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA) establishes minimum national operational and reclamation standards for all surface mines as well as most aspects of underground mines. SMCRA requires that comprehensive environmental protection and reclamation standards be met during the course of and following completion of mining activities. Permits for all mining operations must be obtained from the U.S. Office of Surface Mining (OSM) or, where state regulatory agencies have adopted federally approved state programs under SMCRA, the appropriate state regulatory authority. States that operate federally approved state programs may impose standards which are more stringent than the requirements of SMCRA and OSM's regulations and in many instances have done so. Our active mining complexes are located in states which have achieved primary jurisdiction for enforcement of SMCRA through approved state programs. In addition, SMCRA imposes a reclamation fee on all current mining operations, the proceeds of which are deposited in the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund (AML Fund), which is used to restore unreclaimed and abandoned mine lands mined before 1977. The current per ton fee is $0.28 per ton for surface mined coal and $0.12 per ton for underground mined coal. These fees are currently scheduled to be in effect until September 30, 2021. 

Excess Spoil, Coal Mine Waste, Diversions, and Buffer Zones for Perennial and Intermittent Streams. The OSM has issued final amendments to regulations concerning stream buffer zones, stream channel diversions, excess spoil, and coal mine waste to comply with an order issued by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on February 20, 2014, which vacated the stream buffer zone rule that was published December 12, 2008. On July 27, 2015, OSM published the proposed Stream Protection Rule. The proposed rule includes changes that amount to a rewrite of the existing rule on a nationwide scale and that adds and revises regulations for surface mines, underground mines and ancillary facilities located in every coal producing state. We believe this to be an overreach of jurisdiction by the OSM, particularly into areas under the legal jurisdiction of other federal agencies, particularly the EPA, the Corps of Engineers, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, as well as delegated state programs or state laws (e.g., Clean Water Act authority, PA Clean Streams Law, etc.). Additionally, OSM proposes to extend the impacts of mining to include surrounding areas of the entire reserve, previously not included in assessments submitted with our permits for active mining. The proposed rule would also prohibit mining in or through a perennial, intermittent, or ephemeral stream, even if the effects are temporary, and to require a 100&#8217; buffer zone on each side of a stream, which sterilizes the coal under those streams as unmineable. As drafted, this proposed rule has the potential to impact CONSOL Energy&#8217;s ability to profitably operate longwall coal mines. 

Federal Regulation of the Sale and Transportation of Natural Gas 

&#32;Regulations and orders set forth by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) impact our gas business to a certain degree. Although the FERC does not directly regulate our gas production activities, the FERC has stated that it intends for certain of its orders to foster increased competition within all phases of the natural gas industry. Additionally, the FERC continues to review its transportation regulations, including whether to allocate all short-term capacity on the basis of competitive auctions and whether changes to its long-term transportation policies may also be appropriate to avoid a market bias toward short-term contracts. The FERC has also issued numerous orders confirming the sale and abandonment of natural gas gathering facilities previously owned by interstate pipelines and acknowledging that if the FERC does not have jurisdiction over services provided by these facilities, then such facilities and services may be subject to regulation by state authorities in accordance with state law. 

We own certain natural gas pipeline facilities that we believe meet the traditional tests which the FERC has used to establish a pipeline's status as a gatherer not subject to the FERC jurisdiction. 

Health and Safety Laws 

Occupational Safety and Health Act. &#32;&#32;Our gas operations are subject to regulation under the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) and comparable state laws in some states, all of which regulate health and safety of employees at our natural gas operations. Also, OSHA's hazardous communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced by our gas operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local governments and the public. 

Mine Safety. &#32;&#32;Legislative and regulatory changes have required us to purchase additional safety equipment, construct stronger seals to isolate mined out areas, and engage in additional training. We have also experienced more aggressive inspection protocols and with new regulations the amount of civil penalties has increased. The actions taken thus far by federal and state governments include requiring: 

&#8226; 

the caching of additional supplies of self-contained self-rescuer (SCSR) devices underground; 

&#8226; 

the purchase and installation of electronic communication and personal tracking devices underground; 

&#8226; 

the purchase and installation of proximity detection services on continuous miner machines; 

&#8226; 

the placement of refuge chambers, which are structures designed to provide refuge for groups of miners during a mine emergency when evacuation from the mine is not possible, which will provide breathable air for 96 hours; 

&#8226; 

the replacement of existing seals in worked-out areas of mines with stronger seals; 

&#8226; 

the purchase of new fire resistant conveyor belting underground; 

&#8226; 

additional training and testing that creates the need to hire additional employees; 

&#8226; 

more stringent rock dusting requirements; and 

&#8226; 

the purchase of personal dust monitors for collecting respirable dust samples from certain miners. 

On October 2, 2015, the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) published proposed rules for underground coal mining operations concerning proximity detection systems for coal hauling machines and scoops. On January 15, 2015, MSHA published a final rule requiring underground coal mine operations to equip continuous mining machines, except full-face continuous mining machines, with proximity detection systems. The proximity detection system strengthens protection for miners by reducing the potential of pinning, crushing and striking hazards that result in accidents involving life-threatening injuries and death. The final rule became effective March 15, 2015 and included a phased in schedule for newly manufactured and in-service equipment. In 2010 MSHA rolled out the &#8220;End Black Lung, Act Now&#8221; initiative. As a result, MSHA implemented a new final rule on August 1, 2014 to lower miners&#8217; exposure to respirable coal mine dust including using the new Personal Dust Monitor (PDM) technology. This final rule will be implemented in three phases. The first phase began on August 1, 2014 and utilizes the current gravimetric sampling device to take full shift dust samples from the current designated occupations and areas. It also requires additional record keeping and immediate corrective action in the event of overexposure. The second phase began on February 1, 2016 and requires additional sampling for designated and other occupations using the new continuous personal dust monitor (CPDM) technology, which provides real time dust exposure information to the miner. CONSOL Energy has ordered the necessary CPDM equipment which is required to meet compliance with the new rule at a cost of $2 million. We are also in the process of hiring Dust Coordinators and Dust Technicians to meet the staffing demand to manage compliance with the new rule at an estimated cost of $3 million. The final phase of the rule will take effect on August 1, 2016. The current respirable dust standard will then be reduced from 2.0 to 1.5mg/m3 for designated occupations and from 1.0 to 0.5mg/m3 for Part 90 Miners. 

&#160; 

Black Lung Legislation. &#32;Under federal black lung benefits legislation, each coal mine operator is required to make payments of black lung benefits or contributions to: 

&#8226; 

current and former coal miners totally disabled from black lung disease; 

&#8226; 

certain survivors of a coal miner who dies from black lung disease or pneumoconiosis; and 

&#8226; 

a trust fund for the payment of benefits and medical expenses to claimants whose last mine employment was before January 1, 1970, where no responsible coal mine operator has been identified for claims (where a coal miner's last coal employment was after December 31, 1969), or where the responsible coal mine operator has defaulted on the payment of such benefits. The trust fund is funded by an excise tax on U.S. production of up to $1.10 per ton for deep mined coal and up to $0.55 per ton for surface-mined coal, neither amount to exceed 4.4% of the gross sales price. 

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) made two changes to the Federal Black Lung Benefits Act. First, it provided changes to the legal criteria used to assess and award claims by creating a legal presumption that miners are entitled to benefits if they have worked at least 15 years in underground coal mines, or in similar conditions, and suffer from a totally 

disabling lung disease. To rebut this presumption, a coal company would have to prove that a miner did not have black lung or that the disease was not caused by the miner's work. Second, it changed the law so black lung benefits will continue to be paid to dependent survivors when the miner passes away, regardless of the cause of the miner's death. The changes have increased the cost to CONSOL Energy of complying with the Federal Black Lung Benefits Act. In addition to the federal legislation, we are also liable under various state statutes for black lung claims. 

Other State and Local Laws Related to Our Natural Gas Business 

Regulation Affecting Gas Operations. &#32;Our natural gas operations are also subject to regulation at the state and in some cases, county, municipal and local governmental levels. Such regulation includes requiring permits for the siting and construction of well pads and roads, drilling of wells, bonding requirements, protection of ground water and surface water resources and protection of drinking water supplies, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of well sites, gas flaring, the plugging and abandoning of wells, the disposal of fluids used in connection with operations, and gas operations producing coalbed methane in relation to active mining. A number of states have either enacted new laws or may be considering the adequacy of existing laws affecting gathering rates and/or services. Other state regulation of gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental and in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory take requirements, but does not generally entail rate regulation. Thus, natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny of state agencies in the future. Our gathering operations could be adversely affected should they be subject in the future to increased state regulation of rates or services, although we do not believe that they would be affected by such regulation any differently than other natural gas producers or gatherers. However, these regulatory burdens may affect profitability, and we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such regulations. 

&#32; Ownership of Mineral Rights . CONSOL Energy acquires ownership or leasehold rights to gas and coal properties prior to conducting operations on those properties. As is customary in the gas and coal industries, we have generally conducted only a summary review of the title to gas and coal rights that are not in our development plans, but which we believe we control. This summary review is conducted at the time of acquisition or as part of a review of our land records to determine control of mineral rights. Given CONSOL Energy's long history as a coal producer, we believe we have a well-developed ownership position relating to our coal control; however, our ownership of oil and gas rights, particularly those rights that we acquired in connection with our historic coal operations and some of the rights we acquired in 2010 from Dominion are less developed. As we continue to review our land records and confirm title in anticipation of development, we expect that adjustments to our ownership position (either increases or decreases) will be required. 

Prior to the commencement of development operations on natural gas and coal properties, we conduct a thorough title examination and perform curative work with respect to significant defects. We generally will not commence operations on a property until we have cured any material title defects on such property. We are typically responsible for the cost of curing any title defects. In addition, the acquisition of the necessary rights may not be feasible in some cases. Our discovering natural gas title defects which we are unable to cure may adversely impact our ability to develop those properties and we may have to reduce our estimated gas reserves including our proved undeveloped reserves. We have completed title work on substantially all of our natural gas and coal producing properties and believe that we have satisfactory title to our producing properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the industry.
