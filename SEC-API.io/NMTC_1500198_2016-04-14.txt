 ITEM 1. BUSINESS

&#160;

Original Source Entertainment, Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;, the &#8220;registrant&#8221;, &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221;, &#8220;our&#8221;, or &#8220;Original Source&#8221;) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on August 20, 2009. We are a development stage company, formed to license songs to the television and movie industry. From our inception we have generated very little revenues, and our operations have been primarily limited to organizational, start-up, and capital formation activities. We have historically and currently have no employees other than our officers.

&#160;

We have never declared bankruptcy, have never been in receivership, and have never been involved in any legal action or proceedings. We have not made any significant purchase or sale of assets, nor has the registrant been involved in any mergers, acquisitions or consolidations. We do not believe that we are a blank check registrant as that term is defined in Rule 419(a)(2) of Regulation C of the Securities Act of 1933, because we have a specific business plan and purpose. We do not have any definitive plans, proposals, arrangements or understandings with any representatives of the owners of any operating business or company regarding the possibility of an acquisition or merger.

&#160;

However, on February 5, 2014, our board of directors authorized the spin-off of Original Source Music, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary which holds all of our operations, to our shareholders of record as of February 25, 2014. The spin-off would be done in connection with a prior change of control of our company as described further below. Under the terms of the spin-off, the common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Original Source Music will be distributed on a pro-rata basis to each holder of our common stock on the February 25, 2014 record date without any consideration or action on the part of such holders, and the holders of our common stock as of the February 25, 2014 record date will become owners of 100% of the common stock of Original Source Music. The spin-off will be consummated only upon the satisfactory resolution of all comments from the Securities and Exchange Commission to the Registration Statement on Form 10 filed by Original Source Music and its effectiveness with the SEC. The shares of common stock to be transferred upon completion of the spin-off to our stockholders as of the February 25, 2014 record date are being held in escrow with J.M. Walker &#38; Associates, Attorneys At Law. As we have not yet spun-off the business and operations of Original Source Music, for purposes of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are describing our company as if the spin-off has not been consummated and we are continuing our business plan through Original Source Music.

&#160;

In 2000, Lecia L. Walker assisted in launching Private Wavs, a successful music library which licenses music to television and film, along with her husband at that time. Part of her role in that endeavor was to do the market research, product and packaging design, sales and marketing. In 2007, she sold her interest in Private Wavs and in 2008, started a new music library under a DBA of Original Source Music. Since that time she has placed more than 1,100 songs under contract.

&#160;

On August 21, 2009, Lecia Walker granted to us a license for a period of ten years for the entire list of songs under a License and Assignment Agreement. Pursuant to the License and Assignment Agreement, Ms. Walker was issued 3,000,000 of our shares of common stock. On August 25, 2009, our board of directors authorized the assignment of our rights under the License and Assignment Agreement to Original Source Music, Inc., our subsidiary. Effective May 31, 2010, Ms. Walker granted us an option to extend the term of the original license for an additional 10 year period to expire August 25, 2029.

&#160;

3&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

On March 5, 2014, Ms. Walker and E. Lynn Atwood, a former director, sold an aggregate of 3,500,000 shares of our common stock, representing approximately 69% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock, to Amer Samad. As a result, Mr. Samad was appointed our Chief Executive Officer, and Ms. Walker resigned from all officer positions but remained a director until May 18, 2015, at which time she resigned as a director but remains an officer and director of Original Source Music.

&#160;

Operations 

&#160;

Our business plan is to review music tracks written, produced, and performed by artists who have not already signed away their rights to their original works, then to attempt to contract those songs that we believe have the highest quality and potential for placement in television and film. The registrant intends to offer a wide variety of instrumental and vocal genres including pop, rock, R&#38;B, jazz, country, singer/songwriter, new age, electronic, dance, funk, children's, adult contemporary, and more.

&#160;

We contract with artists of all musical genres who own the publishing rights to their songs. We expect to sell the songs to television companies that produce shows for major television networks. We have signed contracts with approximately 217 artist/composers. The contracts give the registrant non-exclusive licensing rights and publishing rights in perpetuity. The artists retain writer's rights and are given exposure to television and film through the registrant's catalog.

&#160;

Artists are referred to the registrant through advertisement, A&#38;R companies, and referrals from friends, registrant signed artists, and other music industry acquaintances.

&#160;

Customers have included the CBS, NBC and Warner Bros. television networks in Los Angeles, California (the home networks, not the local affiliates). Historically, Warner Bros. generated approximately 90% of our revenues, NBC generated approximately 5% of our revenues, and CBS generated approximately 5% of our revenues. A major production company whose name is proprietary has assisted in placing our music in these major networks and their efforts account for approximately 80% of the revenue received from those major networks. Our target customer includes all other major and minor television networks, production companies and film makers. We intend to reach such customer bases through marketing, advertising, and direct sales calls.

&#160;

Our website's main purpose is to provide customers with immediate access to the registrant's catalog. To prevent illegal art exploitation, customers must have a login and password to access the registrant's website. Customers are given access to the website only after verification of their role in the professional production industry.

&#160;

4&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

We intend to:

&#160;

&#183; Advertise through the placement of advertisements in film, television and music industry magazines and on film, television and music industry websites &#160;

&#183; Market and promote the catalog by sending out regular e-mails and snail-mails highlighting particular artists, songs, or genres of music, and send out promotional products to promote branding and &#160;

&#183; Create a sales team through the hiring of salespeople to research, contact and develop service relationships with new customers. &#160;

Typical initial revenues per use in a production vary from $500 to $5,000 or more depending on the potential exposure and audience reach. Royalty revenues have the same value range for the first public airing and are reduced for each re-run, but continue for every public airing forever.

&#160;

We believe we will be able to attract recording artists to our development stage company as artists want public exposure for their original works and payment for that exposure, which we offer the potential of providing at no cost to the artist.

&#160;

We intend to focus on the source music niche of music licensing, but provide music for background, and transitional uses as well. The source music niche is music that is coming from a source in the production and is heard by the characters in the production; such as music being played in a coffee house that the characters are in, or music being played on a radio in the production. Currently the registrant has more than 1,100 songs available for licensing, and expects to sign more songs to be added to the catalog to be made available for television and film applications. All genres of music are considered for addition to our catalog with a focus on vocal tracks. Signing new songs is a process which involves artist relations such as discussing the contract with the artist, and familiarizing the artist with royalties, performing rights organizations, and rights to their art. It also involves reviewing the songs submitted by the artist, deciding which songs to contract, making a contract offer to the artist, preparing, sending and signing the contracts, obtaining specific descriptions and details of the songs from the artists, converting the songs into a variety of digital formats and cataloguing the songs with the appropriate performing rights organization and the registrant's music catalog.

&#160;

The customer has access to these songs in a variety of ways, including logging into our website at www.originalsourcemusic.com where they may search for several songs that are appropriate for their needs and download them directly into their production editing program.

&#160;

Growth Strategy 

&#160;

We intend to focus on the addition of cues and transitional music for commercials and television programming transitions, something we believe our major competitors do not seem to do at present. Cues and transitional music is instrumental music that is played when commercials segue into and out of a program. Television programming transitions are the programming that transitions one show into another show or into or out of a commercial. By becoming more established in the source music niche, we expect that our company will be well known by key decision makers in the purchasing and licensing departments employed by our customers. By fostering such relationships, these decision makers may readily approve potential licenses in other areas of music placement such as cues and transitional music. Once we gain access to this market, our sales force is expected to begin to target potential customers such as news programs, weather programs, and advertising agencies.

&#160;

5&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

We intend to examine signing genres of music that are in demand by potential customers but are not available from its competitors at present. We will also examine the creation of a recording label to give the general public access to purchasing the songs in its catalog.

&#160;

Revenue 

&#160;

We receive revenues in two ways:

&#160;

&#183; Commercial productions pay licensing fees to place a track into their production. 

&#183; We own the publishing rights to all of our songs, and when a production containing a track licensed from the registrant is aired through a public venue, royalties are paid to the registrant by the assigned performing rights organization, such as American Society of Authors and Composers, Broadcast Music, Inc. or Society of European Stage Authors &#38; Composers. These three performing rights organizations represent songwriters and publishers in the U.S. and their right to be compensated for having their music performed in public. &#160;

We do not anticipate that revenues will significantly increase until we are able to heavily market our catalog. If we are unable to raise the funds needed, which may be substantial, we may be unable to generate any material revenues.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The music industry is intensely competitive and fragmented. We intend to compete on the basis of price and selection against other small companies like ours, as well as large companies that have a similar business and large marketing companies.

&#160;

Some of our major competitors are:

&#160;

Heavy Hitters Music: Heavy Hitters Music has been in the music licensing business for over 30 years and we believe to be the pioneer of the source music niche. Their website boasts a catalog of over 10,000 music tracks.

&#160;

MasterSource: We believe that MasterSource became the first real source music competitor for Heavy Hitters when it was formed in 1992 by Marc Ferrari. MasterSource seems to be the first and only competitor with tracks available to the general public.

&#160;

Killer Tracks: Killer Tracks has been in business for twenty years according to their website, and offers over 2,200 digital albums from more than 20 global libraries. We believe only a small fraction of such digital albums includes source music.

&#160;

6&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Free Play Music: Free Play Music has a large variety of production music, and a growing number of source music tracks.

&#160;

Sync Free Music: Sync Free Music has a large variety of production music, and a growing number of source music tracks.

&#160;

Pump Audio: Pump Audio started in 2001 and is now part of Getty Images Music.

&#160;

Patents and Trademarks 

&#160;

We do not, at this time, have any patents or trademarks.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

At this time, we have no employees other than our executive officer who is also a director, and Ms. Walker performs services for our subsidiary Original Source Music. We retain consultants from time to time to assist with administrative functions.

&#160;

We do not foresee any significant changes in the number of employees or consultants we will have over the next twelve months.

&#160;

Reports to Security Holders 

&#160;

We file annual, quarterly and other reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Although we will not be required to deliver our annual or quarterly reports to security holders, we intend to forward this information to security holders upon receiving a written request to receive such information. The reports and other information filed by us will be available for inspection and copying at the public reference facilities of the Securities and Exchange Commission located at 100 F Street N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549.

&#160;

Copies of such material may be obtained by mail from the Public Reference Section of the Securities and Exchange Commission at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549, at prescribed rates. Information on the operation of the Public Reference Room may be obtained by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. In addition, the Commission maintains a World Wide Website on the Internet at: http://www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding registrants that file electronically with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
