 Item 1. Business 

Cooper-Standard Holdings Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;Cooper Standard,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our&#8221; or &#8220;us&#8221;) is a leading manufacturer of sealing, fuel and brake delivery, fluid transfer and anti-vibration systems. Our products are primarily for use in passenger vehicles and light trucks that are manufactured by global automotive original equipment manufacturers (&#8220;OEMs&#8221;) and replacement markets. We conduct substantially all of our activities through our subsidiaries. 

Cooper Standard is a New York Stock Exchange (&#8220;NYSE&#8221;) listed company under the ticker symbol &#8220;CPS&#8221;. The Company has more than 29,000 &#32;employees with 98 &#32;facilities in 20 &#32;countries. We believe we are the largest global producer of sealing systems, the second largest global producer of the types of fuel and brake delivery products that we manufacture, the third largest global producer of fluid transfer systems, and one of the largest North American producers of anti-vibration systems. We design and manufacture our products in each major region of the world through a disciplined and sustained approach to engineering and operational excellence. We operate in 79 manufacturing locations and 19 &#32;design, engineering, and administrative locations. 

The Company has four operating segments: North America, Europe, Asia Pacific and South America. This operating structure allows us to offer our full portfolio of products and support our regional and global customers with complete engineering and manufacturing expertise in all major regions of the world. We have implemented a number of operational restructuring and expansion initiatives this year and in recent years to improve competitiveness, primarily related to footprint optimization in Europe and expansion in Asia and Mexico. See &#8220;Segment Results of Operations&#8221; under Item 7. &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; and Note 19. &#8220;Business Segments&#8221; to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our segments. 

Approximately 82% &#32;of our sales in 2015 &#32;were to OEMs, including Ford Motor Company (&#8220;Ford&#8221;), General Motors Company (&#8220;GM&#8221;), Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (&#8220;FCA&#8221;), PSA Peugeot Citro&#235;n, Volkswagen Group, Daimler, Renault-Nissan, BMW, Toyota, Volvo, Jaguar/Land Rover, Honda and various other OEMs based in India and China. The remaining 18% &#32;of our 2015 &#32;sales were primarily to Tier I and Tier II automotive suppliers, non-automotive manufacturers, and replacement market distributors. 

Corporate History and Business Developments 

Cooper-Standard Holdings Inc. was established in 2004 as a Delaware corporation and began operating on December 23, 2004 when it acquired the automotive segment of Cooper Tire &#38; Rubber Company (the &#8220;2004 Acquisition&#8221;). Cooper-Standard Holdings Inc. operates the business primarily through its principal operating subsidiary, Cooper-Standard Automotive Inc. (&#8220;CSA U.S.&#8221;). Since the 2004 Acquisition, the Company has expanded and diversified its customer base through a combination of organic growth and strategic acquisitions. 

In August 2009, following the onset of the financial crisis and economic downturn that severely impacted the global 

automotive industry, Cooper-Standard Holdings Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries in the United States and Canada commenced reorganization proceedings in the United States (the &#8220;Chapter 11 proceedings&#8221;) and Canada. In May 2010, the Company consummated its reorganization pursuant to a court-confirmed plan of reorganization and emerged from the Chapter 11 proceedings and the Canadian proceedings. 

In October 2013, Cooper Standard&#8217;s common stock was listed on the NYSE and began trading under the ticker symbol &#8220;CPS.&#8221; Prior to the NYSE listing, the Company&#8217;s common stock was traded on the Over-the-Counter (&#8220;OTC&#8221;) Bulletin Board under the symbol &#8220;COSH.&#8221; 

From 2006 to 2013, the Company accelerated its growth through a number of strategic acquisitions including the Fluid Handling Systems Operations in North America, Europe and China (collectively, &#8220;FHS&#8221;) from ITT Industries, Inc.; Metzeler Automotive Profile Systems; a hose manufacturing operation in Mexico from the Gates Corporation; USi, Inc.; the sealing business of Sigit S.p.A.; a joint venture with Fonds de Modernisation des Equipementiers Automobiles (&#8220;FMEA&#8221;); and Jyco Sealing Technology. 

We continued strategic acquisitions and partnerships in 2014 and 2015 with the acquisition of Cikautxo Borja, S.L.U. in Spain, a manufacturer of heating and cooling hoses; the purchase of an additional 47.5% of Huayu-Cooper Standard Sealing Systems Co. (&#8220;Shenya&#8221;), increasing our equity ownership to 95% and positioning the Company as a leader in sealing systems in the Chinese automotive market; the formation of a joint venture with Polyrub Extrusions (India) Private Limited to grow the 

Company&#8217;s fluid transfer systems business in Asia; and a joint venture with INOAC Corporation of Japan accelerating our fluid transfer systems strategy in Asia. 

In 2014 and 2015, the Company divested its thermal and emissions product line and hard coat plastic exterior trim business, respectively, to focus on the product lines where Cooper Standard holds leading market positions. 

Business Strategy 

Cooper Standard has a well-defined and broadly communicated corporate vision: to drive for profitable growth and become one of the thirty largest global automotive suppliers in terms of sales, and among the top 5% in terms of return on invested capital (Top 30 / Top 5). The Company&#8217;s strategic plan is geared to realize this vision by matching our priorities and strengths to the emerging global industry environment. To this end, we continue to: 

&#8226; 

Focus on our core product lines; 

&#8226; 

Produce superior products as a recognized innovation leader; 

&#8226; 

Create an advantaged global manufacturing footprint to support customers; and 

&#8226; 

Commonize and standardize world-class engineering and manufacturing operations. 

As the Company continues to grow, we will look to further evolve our strategy to create additional opportunities to drive shareholder value. 

Operational and Strategic Initiatives 

As part of its profitable growth strategy, the Company implemented the Cooper Standard Operating System (&#8220;CSOS&#8221;) to fully position the Company for growth and ensure global consistency in engineering design, program management, manufacturing process, purchasing and IT systems. Standardization across all regions is especially critical in support of customers&#8217; global platforms that require the same design, quality and delivery standards everywhere across the world. 

The CSOS consists of the following areas, with a strategic focus that aligns with the Company&#8217;s growth strategy: 

CSOS Function 

Strategic Focus 

World-Class Safety 

Implement globally consistent measurement system with zero incidents goal. 

World-Class Operations 

Optimize global performance by implementing best business practices across the organization. 

Continuous Improvement 

Implement lean manufacturing tools across all facilities to achieve cost savings and increased performance. 

Global Purchasing 

Develop an advantaged supply base to effectively leverage scale and optimize supplier quality. 

Innovation Management 

Focused innovation processes to create breakthrough technologies for market differentiation. 

Global Program Management 

Ensure consistent and flawless product launch process across all regions. 

IT Systems 

Implement common systems to effectively communicate information throughout the business. 

Leverage Technology for Innovative Solutions &#160; 

We utilize our technical expertise to provide customers with innovative solutions. Our engineers combine product design with a broad understanding of material characteristics for enhanced vehicle performance. We believe our reputation for successful innovation in product design and materials is the reason our customers consult us early in their vehicle development and design process of their next generation vehicles. 

Cooper Standard has evolved and further energized its approach to innovation with its i 3 &#32;Innovation Process (Imagine, Initiate, Innovate). This approach is used as a mechanism to capture ideas from across our Company and supply partners while promoting a culture of innovation. 

Ideas are carefully evaluated by a Global Technology Council and those that are selected are put on an accelerated development cycle with a dedicated innovation team focused on breakthrough ideas. This team is developing game-changing technologies based on materials expertise, process know-how, and application vision, which will drive future product direction. Among recently announced technologies is ArmorHose&#8482;, a breakthrough technology which results in significantly more durable coolant hoses and eliminates the need for separate abrasion sleeves on under-hood hose assemblies. Several other significant technologies, especially related to advanced materials, processing and weight reduction, have recently been realized. These include: Fortrex&#8482;, a revolutionary material that provides higher performance and lower weight to weather seals; and MagAlloy&#8482;, a new processing technology for brake lines that increases long term durability through superior corrosion resistance. 

Continued Emphasis on Global Platforms 

We believe global platforms, which require the same design, quality and delivery standards globally, will drive increased growth for capable global suppliers. It is predicted that the top ten global platforms produced by automakers will account for about 30% of the world&#8217;s light vehicle volume by 2021, highlighting the importance of being well-positioned to participate in these high volume global programs. Based on our 2015 &#32;revenue, six of the top ten vehicle platforms on which we provide content are global platforms, which demonstrates that customers already look to us to support global platforms. Our global presence and technological capabilities ideally position us to continue to win business on global platforms. 

Pursue Acquisitions and Alliances to Enhance Capabilities and Accelerate Growth 

We intend to continue to selectively pursue complementary acquisitions and joint ventures to enhance our customer base, geographic penetration, scale and technology. Consolidation is an industry trend and is encouraged by the OEMs desire for global automotive suppliers. We believe we have a strong platform for growth through acquisitions based on our past integration successes, experienced management team, global presence and operational excellence. Our operations currently include several successful joint ventures. 

Industry 

The automotive industry is one of the world&#8217;s largest and most competitive. Consumer demand for new vehicles largely determines sales and production volumes of global OEMs. 

The automotive supplier industry is generally characterized by high barriers to entry, significant start-up costs and long-standing customer relationships. The criteria by which OEMs judge automotive suppliers include quality, price, service, performance, design and engineering capabilities, innovation, timely delivery, financial stability and global footprint. Over the last decade, suppliers that have been able to achieve manufacturing scale, reduce structural costs, diversify their customer base and establish a global manufacturing footprint have been successful. 

Markets Served 

The passenger car and light truck market, better known as the light vehicle market, is our largest market and accounts for approximately 95% &#32;of our global sales. The focus of this market is on passenger cars and light trucks, up to and including Class 3 Full Size Frame trucks. 

In addition to the global team focused on the light vehicle market, we also established dedicated sales and engineering teams in North America and Europe to leverage core product technology into adjacent markets to profitably grow Cooper Standard. The adjacent markets include: commercial vehicle (on-highway and off-highway), specialty markets and technical rubber. &#160;

Our anti-vibration systems compete with Trelleborg/Vibracoustic, Hutchinson, Tokai Rubber, Bridgestone and ContiTech. 

Joint Ventures and Strategic Alliances 

Joint ventures represent an important part of our business, both operationally and strategically. We have utilized joint ventures to enter into new geographic markets such as China, India and Thailand, to acquire new customers and to develop new technologies. In entering new geographic markets, teaming with a local partner can reduce capital investment by leveraging pre-existing infrastructure. In addition, local partners in these markets can provide knowledge and insight into local practices and access to local suppliers of raw materials and components.

Research and Development 

We have a dedicated team of technical and engineering resources in each global region, some of which are located at our customers' facilities. We utilize Design for Six Sigma and other methodologies that emphasize manufacturability and quality. Our development teams work closely with our customers to design and deliver innovative solutions. We continue to add technical resources throughout the world as required to support our customers, including a technical center in Shanghai, China and, with the Sujan Cooper Standard joint venture, in Maharashtra, India. We spent $108.8 million , &#32; $102.0 million , and $103.5 million &#32;in 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively, on engineering, research and development. 

Patents and Trademarks 

We believe that one of our key competitive advantages is our ability to translate customer need into innovative solutions through the development of intellectual property. We hold a significant number of patents and trademarks worldwide. Our patents relate to our product lines and are grouped into two major categories: (1) specific product invention claims and (2) specific manufacturing processes that are used for producing products. The vast majority of our patents fall within the product invention category. We consider these patents to be of value and seek to protect our rights throughout the world against infringement. While in the aggregate these patents are important to our business, we do not believe that the loss or expiration of any one patent would materially affect our Company. We continue to seek patent protection for our new products and have an incentive program to recognize employees whose inventions are patented. Additionally, we develop significant technologies that we treat as trade secrets and choose not to disclose to the public through the patent process, but which nonetheless provide significant competitive advantages and contribute to our global leadership position in various markets. We believe that our trademarks, including ArmorHose&#8482;, Ultra Pro Coat&#8482;, MagAlloy&#8482; and Fortrex&#8482;, help differentiate us and lead customers to seek our partnership. 

We also have technology sharing and licensing agreements with various third parties, including Nishikawa Rubber Company, one of our joint venture partners in sealing products. We have mutual agreements with Nishikawa Rubber Company for sales, marketing and engineering services on certain sealing products. Under those agreements, each party pays for services provided by the other and royalties on certain products for which the other party provides design or development services. 

Supplies and Raw Materials 

The principal raw materials for our business include ethylene propylene diene monomer M-Class rubber (&#8220;EPDM&#8221;) and synthetic rubber, components manufactured from carbon steel, plastic resins and components, carbon black, process oils, 

components manufactured from aluminum and natural rubber. Raw material prices have fluctuated greatly in recent years. We have implemented strategies with both our suppliers and our customers to help manage fluctuations in raw material prices. These actions include material substitutions and leveraging global purchases. Global supply chain optimization includes using benchmarks and selective sourcing from low cost regions. We have also made process improvements to ensure the efficient use of materials through scrap reduction, as well as standardization of material specifications to maximize leverage over higher volume purchases. With some customers, on certain raw materials, we have implemented indexes that allow price changes as underlying material costs fluctuate. 

Geographic Information 

See Note 19. &#8220;Business Segments&#8221; to the consolidated financial statements for geographic information. 

Seasonality 

Historically, sales to automotive customers are lowest during the months prior to model changeovers and during assembly plant shutdowns. However, economic conditions and consumer demand may change the traditional seasonality of the industry and lower production may prevail without the impact of seasonality. In the past, model changeover periods have typically resulted in lower sales volumes during July, August and December. During these periods of lower sales volumes, profit may decline but working capital often improves due to the continued collection of accounts receivable. 

Backlog 

Our OEM sales are generally based upon purchase orders issued by the OEMs, with updated releases for volume adjustments, and as such we typically do not have a backlog of orders at any point in time. Once selected to supply products for a particular platform, we typically supply those products for the platform life, which is normally three to five years, although there is no guarantee that this will occur. In addition, when we are the incumbent supplier to a given platform, we believe we have a competitive advantage in winning the redesign or replacement platform. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had more than &#32; 29,000 &#32; full-ti me and temporary employees. We maintain good relations with both our union and non-union employees and, in the past ten years, have not experienced any major work stoppages. We renegotiated some of our domestic and non-domestic union agreements in 2015 &#32;and have several contracts set to expire in the next twelve months. As of December 31, 2015 , approximately 28% &#32;of our employees were represented by unions, and approximately 9% &#32;of the unionized employees were located in the United States. 

Environmental 

We are subject to a broad range of federal, state, and local environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations in the United States and other countries, including regulations governing: emissions to air, discharges to water, noise and odor emissions; the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment, reclamation and disposal of chemicals and waste materials; the cleanup of contaminated properties; and human health and safety. We have made and will continue to make expenditures to comply with environmental requirements. While our costs to defend and settle known claims arising under environmental laws are not currently estimated to be material, such costs may be material in the future. 

Market Data 

Some market data and other statistical information used throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K is based on data from independent firms such as IHS Automotive and Booz &#38; Co. Other data is based on good faith estimates, which are derived from our review of internal analyses, as well as third party sources. Although we believe these third party sources are reliable, we have not independently verified the information and cannot guarantee its accuracy and completeness. To the extent that we have been unable to obtain information from third party sources, we have expressed our belief on the basis of our own internal analyses of our products and capabilities in comparison to our competitors. 

Available Information
