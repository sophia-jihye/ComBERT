 ITEM 1. 

BUSINESS 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

Our vision is to enrich the world through the best of nutrition. 

&#160; 

We are a leading formulator, manufacturer and marketer of nutritional supplements. Our comprehensive strategic partnerships with our customers offer a wide range of innovative nutritional products and services to our clients including the following: scientific research, clinical studies, proprietary ingredients, customer-specific nutritional product formulation, product testing and evaluation, marketing management and support, packaging and delivery system design, regulatory review, and international product registration assistance. 

&#160; 

As our primary business activity, we provide private-label contract manufacturing services to companies that market and distribute vitamins, minerals, herbal and other nutritional supplements, as well as other health care products, to consumers both within and outside the U.S. We also own a patent estate related to the ingredient known as beta-alanine, which is primarily commercialized through the direct sale of this raw material under our CarnoSyn&#174; trademark. 

&#160; 

History 

&#160; 

Originally founded in 1980, Natural Alternatives International, Inc. reorganized as a Delaware corporation in 1989. Our principal executive offices were located at 1185 Linda Vista Drive, San Marcos, California, 92078 until relocating to 1535 Faraday Ave, Carlsbad, CA 92008 during August 2016. 

&#160; 

In January 1999, we formed Natural Alternatives International Europe S.A. (NAIE) as our wholly owned subsidiary, based in Manno, Switzerland. In September 1999, NAIE opened its manufacturing facility which has grown over the ensuing years and currently possesses manufacturing capability in encapsulation, powders, and tablets, finished goods packaging, quality control, laboratory testing, warehousing, distribution and administration. 

&#160; 

Historically, as part of our business strategy, we have sought to commercialize our patent estate through contract manufacturing, royalty and license agreements. From March 2009 through March 31, 2015, we had an agreement with Compound Solutions, Inc. (CSI) to grant a license to manufacture, offer for sale and/or sell products incorporating, using or made in accordance with our patent rights to CSI and customers of CSI who purchased beta-alanine from CSI under the CarnoSyn&#174; trademark. During the term of this relationship, we received a fee from CSI that varied based on the quantity and source of beta-alanine sold by CSI. We terminated our relationship with CSI effective April 1, 2015 and began directly selling beta-alanine, and licensing our related patent and trademark rights, in order to take advantage of strategic opportunities, including opportunities to provide additional contract manufacturing services, further commercialize our patent estate, and to increase our top-line revenue and profit profile. 

&#160; 

Additionally, we have historically developed, manufactured and marketed our own branded products under the Pathway to Healing &#174; product line, which was aimed at restoring, maintaining and improving the health of the users. However, due to the steady decline in sales of this product line over the prior several years, we decided to discontinue the product line. All termination activities related to the Pathway to Healing&#174; product line were substantially completed by December 31, 2014. We did not change the financial presentation in this report to reflect the branded products segment as &#8220;Discontinued Operations&#8221; as the wind down of this product line did not meet the criteria for discontinued operations presentation as prescribed by applicable accounting regulations (ASC 205-20). 

&#160; 

Unless the context requires otherwise, all references in this report to the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;NAI,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; and &#8220;us&#8221; refer to Natural Alternatives International, Inc. and, as applicable, and NAIE. 

&#160; 

Overview of our Facilities and Operations 

&#160; 

Our U.S.-based operations are located in Vista and Carlsbad, California and include manufacturing and distribution, sales and marketing, in-house formulation, laboratory, and other research and development services. Our manufacturing facilities were recertified on December 20, 2012 by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) of Australia after its audit of our GMP. TGA evaluates new therapeutic products, prepares standards, develops testing methods and conducts testing programs to ensure that products are high in quality, safe and effective. TGA also conducts a range of assessment and monitoring activities including audits of the manufacturing practices of companies who export and sell products to Australia. TGA certification enables us to manufacture products for export into countries that have signed the Pharmaceutical Inspection Convention, which include most European countries as well as several Pacific Rim countries. TGA certifications are generally reviewed every eighteen to thirty six months. During August 2016, TGA completed an inspection of our facility and quality systems for compliance with good manufacturing practices, and a renewed 36 months GMP clearance is expected in the coming months. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Our California facilities also have been awarded GMP registration annually since October 2002 by NSF International (NSF) through the NSF Dietary Supplements Certification Program and received &#8220;GMP for Sport&#8221; NSF Certified registration on February 16, 2009. GMP requirements are regulatory standards and guidelines establishing necessary processes, procedures and documentation for manufacturers in an effort to assure the products produced by that manufacturer have the identity, strength, composition, quality and purity they are represented to possess. The NSF Certified for Sport program focuses on minimizing the risk that a dietary supplement or sports nutrition product contains banned substances and was developed due to growing demand from athletes and coaches concerned about banned substances in sports supplements. The program focuses primarily on manufacturing and sourcing processes, embedding preventative measures throughout. NAI&#8217;s participation in the program allows us to produce products bearing the NSF Sport logo. 

&#160; 

Our U.S. operations have also been certified by Health Canada as compliant with GMP requirements as outlined in Part 3 of the Canadian Natural Health Products Regulations. Health Canada is the department of the Canadian government with responsibility for national public health. Health Canada has initiated work to modernize its regulatory system for food and health products. Health Canada plays an active role in ensuring access to safe and effective drugs and health products while giving high priority to public safety and striving to provide information needed to make healthy choices and informed decisions regarding one&#8217;s health. NAI was issued its initial certification in December 2011 and received its most recent renewal in November 2015. Not only does this approval demonstrate another level of regulatory compliance for NAI, it may also ease the approval process for our customers who import products into Canada. 

&#160; 

During March 2015, our California facilities became certified as Organic Processor and Handler by Natural Food Certifiers (NFC). This certification demonstrates that we meet the USDA National Organic Program standards and allows us to expand our contract manufacturing and packaging services to include Organic labeled products. The certification requires annual renewal and we believe we will obtain renewals annually. We are registered with the State of California, Department of Public Health Food and Drug Branch as an organic processor. Additionally, we are certified by various Rabbinical and Halal authorities to produce Kosher and Halal certified products. These certifications guarantee that the facility, processes, and ingredients of certified products have been reviewed and found to be in compliance with the strict dietary laws of the respective Jewish and Muslim communities 

&#160; 

NAIE also operates a manufacturing, warehousing, packaging and distribution facility in Manno, Switzerland. In January 2004, NAIE obtained a pharmaceutical license to process pharmaceuticals for packaging, import, export and sale within Switzerland and other countries from the Swissmedic Authority of Bern, Switzerland. In March 2007, following the expansion of NAIE&#8217;s manufacturing facilities to include powder filling capabilities, NAIE obtained an additional pharmaceutical license from the Swissmedic Authority certifying that NAIE&#8217;s expanded facilities conform to GMP. In January 2013, following the additional upgrade of NAIE&#8217;s manufacturing facilities to include the manufacture of pharmaceuticals, NAIE obtained an additional pharmaceutical approval from the Swissmedic Authority certifying that NAIE&#8217;s upgraded facilities conform to GMP. We believe these licenses and NAIE&#8217;s manufacturing capabilities help strengthen our relationships with existing customers and improve our ability to develop relationships with new customers. Our Swissmedic licenses are valid until February 2019. 

&#160; 

In addition to our operations in the U.S. and Switzerland, we have had a representative in Japan for many years who provides a range of services to our customers currently present in or seeking to expand into the Japanese market and other markets in the Pacific Rim. These services include regulatory and marketing assistance along with guidance and support in adapting products to these markets. 

&#160; 

Business Strategy 

&#160; 

Our goals are to achieve long-term growth and profitability and to diversify our sales base. To accomplish these goals, we have and intend to continue to seek to do the following: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

leverage our state-of-the-art, certified facilities to increase the value of the goods and services we provide to our highly valued private-label contract manufacturing customers and assist in developing relationships with additional quality oriented customers; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

expand the commercialization of our beta-alanine patent estate through raw material sales, introduction of new products, new contract manufacturing opportunities, license and sub-license agreements, and protecting our proprietary rights; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

provide strategic partnering services to our private-label contract manufacturing customers, as described below under &#8220;Products, Principal Markets and Methods of Distribution&#8221;; and 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

improve operational efficiencies and manage costs and business risks to improve profitability. 

&#160; 

Overall, we believe there is an opportunity to enhance consumer confidence in the quality of our nutritional supplements and their adherence to label claims through the education provided by direct sales and direct-to-consumer marketing programs. We believe our GMP and TGA certified manufacturing operations, science based product formulations, peer-reviewed clinical studies and regulatory expertise provide us with a sustainable competitive advantage by providing our customers with a high degree of confidence in the products we manufacture. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

While today&#8217;s consumer may have access to a variety of information, we believe many consumers remain uneducated about nutrition and nutritional supplementation, uncertain about the relevance or reliability of the information available to them, or confused about conflicting claims or information. We believe this state of the market creates a significant opportunity for the direct sales marketing channel. The direct sales marketing channel has proved, and we believe will continue to prove, to be a highly effective method for marketing high-quality nutritional supplements as associates or other individuals educate consumers on the benefits of science based nutritional supplements. Our largest customers operate in the direct sales marketing channel. Thus, the majority of our business has relied primarily on the effectiveness of our customers in this marketing channel. 

&#160; 

We also believe there is significant opportunity with the commercialization of our patent estate through the introduction of CarnoSyn&#174; beta-alanine into additional markets and with the introduction of new beta-alanine product offerings. Currently, a majority of our sales of CarnoSyn&#174; are to companies that operate in the sports nutrition channel and are focused on products containing the instant release form of beta-alanine. We believe that there are several other markets and distribution channels that represent growth opportunities for the distribution of CarnoSyn&#174; beta-alanine. We have also recently introduced SR CarnoSyn&#174;, which we believe is a superior form of beta-alanine based on its sustained release profile that allows for increased daily dosing and improved muscle retention of carnosine. We believe the introduction of SR CarnoSyn&#174; beta-alanine is an important step in the further commercialization of our patent estate and is even more important because our patents related to instant release beta-alanine expire in August 2017 while our patents for SR CarnoSyn&#174; extend through 2026. 

&#160; 

We believe our comprehensive approach to customer service is unique within our industry. We believe this comprehensive approach, together with our commitment to high quality, product development and manufacturing capabilities, will provide the means to implement our strategies and achieve our goals. There can be no assurance, however, that we will successfully implement any of our business strategies or that we will increase or diversify our sales, successfully commercialize our patent estate, or improve our overall financial results. 

&#160; 

Products, Principal Markets and Methods of Distribution 

&#160; 

Our primary business activity is to provide private-label contract manufacturing services to companies that market and distribute vitamins, minerals, herbs, and other nutritional supplements, as well as other health care products, to consumers both within and outside the U.S. Our private-label contract manufacturing customers include companies that market nutritional supplements through direct sales marketing channels, direct response television and retail stores. We manufacture products in a variety of forms, including capsules, tablets, chewable wafers, and powders to accommodate a variety of our customer&#8217;s preferences. 

&#160; 

We provide strategic partnering services to our private-label contract manufacturing customers, including the following: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

customized product formulation; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

clinical studies; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

manufacturing; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

marketing support; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

international regulatory and label law compliance; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

international product registration; and 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

packaging in multiple formats and labeling design. 

&#160; 

We also seek to commercialize our patent and trademark through direct distribution and sale of CarnoSyn&#174; and SR CarnoSyn&#174;, new contract manufacturing opportunities, and various license and similar arrangements. 

&#160; 

For the last two fiscal years ended June 30, our net sales were derived from the following (in thousands):

Research and Development 

&#160; 

We are committed to quality research and development. We focus on the development of new science based products and the improvement of existing products. We periodically test and validate our products to help ensure their stability, potency, efficacy and safety. We maintain quality control procedures to verify that our products comply with applicable specifications and standards established by the FDA and other regulatory agencies. We also direct and participate in clinical research studies, often in collaboration with scientists and research institutions, to validate the benefits of a product and provide scientific support for product claims and marketing initiatives. We believe our commitment to research and development, as well as our facilities and strategic alliances with our suppliers and customers, allow us to effectively identify, develop and market high-quality and innovative products. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

As part of the services we provide to our private-label contract manufacturing customers, we may perform, but are not required to perform, certain research and development activities related to the development or improvement of their products. While our customers often do not pay directly for this service, the cost of this service is included as a component of the price we charge to manufacture and deliver their products. Research and development costs, which include costs associated with international regulatory compliance services we provide to our customers, are expensed as incurred. 

&#160; 

Our research and development expenses for the last two fiscal years ended June 30 remained consistent at $1.1 million in each fiscal period. 

&#160; 

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials 

&#160; 

We use raw materials in our operations including powders, excipients, empty capsules, and components for packaging and distributing our finished products. In addition, the commercialization of our beta-alanine patent estate depends on the availability of the raw material beta-alanine. We conduct identity testing for all raw materials we purchase and, on a predetermined testing protocol basis, we evaluate raw materials to ensure their quality, purity and potency before we use them in our products. We typically buy raw materials in bulk from qualified vendors located both within and outside the U.S. During fiscal 2016, we did not have any suppliers that represented more than 10% of our total raw material purchases. 

&#160; 

Our contract manufacturing business did not experience any significant shortages or difficulties obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials during fiscal 2016. However, there continues to be significant pricing pressures associated with various vitamins, minerals and herbs in the raw material marketplace. In early March 2011, the factory that produces the major supply of beta-alanine sold under our CarnoSyn&#174; trade name was damaged as a result of the massive earthquake off the coast of Sendai, Japan resulting in a significant beta-alanine supply interruption. While this Japanese factory resumed operations in June 2011 and was able to produce beta-alanine at historical levels during fiscal 2012, there is no assurance this or any other facility will not incur future production interruptions as a result of causes outside our control. Throughout fiscal 2017, we expect to continue to experience difficulties in sourcing various raw materials as a result of worldwide shortages, and other supply constraints. We also believe raw material and product cost pricing pressures will continue throughout fiscal 2017 as a result of limited supplies of various ingredients and the effects of higher labor and transportation costs. 

&#160; 

Customers 

&#160; 

We have two private-label contract manufacturing customers that individually represent more than 10% of our consolidated net sales. The loss of any one of these customers could result in a significant negative impact to our financial position and results of operations. We continue to focus on obtaining new private-label contract manufacturing customers to reduce the risks associated with deriving a significant portion of our sales from a limited number of customers. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

We compete with other manufacturers, distributors and marketers of vitamins, minerals, herbs, and other nutritional supplements both within and outside the U.S. The nutritional supplement industry is highly fragmented and competition for the sale of nutritional supplements comes from many sources. These products are sold primarily through retailers (drug store chains, supermarkets, and mass market discount retailers), health and natural food stores, and direct sales channels (network marketing, internet marketing and mail order). 

&#160; 

We believe private-label contract manufacturing competition in our industry is based on, among other things, customized services offered, product quality and safety, innovation, price and customer service. We believe we compete favorably with other companies because of our ability to provide comprehensive solutions for customers, our certified manufacturing operations, our commitment to quality and safety, and our research and development activities. 

&#160; 

Our future competitive position for private-label contract manufacturing and patent and trademark licensing will likely depend on, but not be limited to, the following: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

the continued acceptance of our products by our customers and consumers; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our patent estate and the continued validity of such patents; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

our ability to successfully expand our product offerings related to our patent and trademark estate; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

our ability to maintain adequate inventory levels to meet our customer&#8217;s demands; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

our ability to expand; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

our ability to continue to manufacture high quality products at competitive prices; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; &#8226; 

the effect of any future governmental regulations on our products and business; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

the results of, and publicity from, product safety and performance studies performed by governments and other research institutions; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

the continued growth of the global nutrition industry; and 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

our ability to respond to changes within the industry and consumer demand, financially and otherwise. 

&#160; 

The nutritional supplement industry is highly competitive and we expect the level of competition to remain high over the near term. We do not believe it is possible to accurately estimate the total number or size of our competitors. The nutritional supplement industry has undergone consolidation in the recent past and we expect that trend may continue in the near term. 

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

Our business is subject to varying degrees of regulation by a number of government authorities in the U.S., including the FDA, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the Environmental Protection Agency. Various state and local agencies where we operate and in which our products are sold also regulate our business, such as the California Department of Health Services, Food and Drug Branch. The areas of our business these and other authorities regulate include, among others: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

product claims and advertising; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

product labels; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

product ingredients; and 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

how we manufacture, package, distribute, import, export, sell and store our products. 

&#160; 

The FDA, in particular, regulates the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, storage, labeling, promotion, distribution and sale of vitamins and other nutritional supplements in the U.S., while the FTC regulates marketing and advertising claims. In August 2007, a new rule issued by the FDA went into effect requiring companies that manufacture, package, label, distribute or hold nutritional supplements to meet certain GMP&#8217;s to ensure such products are of the quality specified and are properly packaged and labeled. We are committed to meeting or exceeding the standards set by the FDA and believe we are currently operating within the FDA mandated GMP. 

&#160; 

The FDA also regulates the labeling and marketing of dietary supplements and nutritional products, including the following: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

the identification of dietary supplements or nutritional products and their nutrition and ingredient labeling; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

requirements related to the wording used for claims about nutrients, health claims, and statements of nutritional support; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

labeling requirements for dietary supplements or nutritional products for which &#8220;high potency&#8221; and &#8220;antioxidant&#8221; claims are made; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

notification procedures for statements on dietary supplements or nutritional products; and 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

premarket notification procedures for new dietary ingredients in nutritional supplements. 

&#160; 

The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA) revised the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act concerning the composition and labeling of dietary supplements and defined dietary supplements to include vitamins, minerals, herbs, amino acids and other dietary substances. DSHEA generally provides a regulatory framework to help ensure safe, quality dietary supplements and the dissemination of accurate information about such products. The FDA is generally prohibited from regulating active ingredients in dietary supplements as drugs unless product claims, such as claims that a product may heal, mitigate, cure or prevent an illness, disease or malady, trigger drug status. 

&#160; 

In December 2006, the Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act was passed, which further revised the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Under the act, manufacturers, packers or distributors whose name appears on the product label of a dietary supplement or nonprescription drug are required to include contact information on the product label for consumers to use in reporting adverse events associated with the product&#8217;s use and for us to notify the FDA of any serious adverse event report within 15 business days of receiving such report. Events reported to the FDA would not be considered an admission from a company that its product caused or contributed to the reported event. We are committed to meeting or exceeding the requirements of this Act. 

&#160; 

We are also subject to a variety of other regulations in the U.S., including those relating to bioterrorism, taxes, labor and employment, import and export, the environment and intellectual property. All of these regulations require significant financial and operational resources to ensure compliance, and we cannot assure you we will always be in compliance despite our best efforts to do so. 

&#160; 

Our operations outside the U.S. are similarly regulated by various agencies and entities in the countries in which we operate and in which our products are sold. The regulations of these countries may conflict with those in the U.S. and may vary from country to country. The sale of our products in certain European countries is subject to the rules and regulations of the European Union, which may be interpreted differently among the countries within the European Union. In other markets outside the U.S., we may be required to obtain approvals, licenses or certifications from a country&#8217;s ministry of health or comparable agency before we begin operations or the marketing of products in that country. Approvals or licenses may be conditioned on reformulation of our products for a particular market or may be unavailable for certain products or product ingredients. These regulations may limit our ability to enter certain markets outside the U.S. As with the costs of regulatory compliance in the U.S., foreign regulations require significant financial and operational resources to ensure compliance, and we cannot assure you we will always be in compliance despite our best efforts to do so. Our failure to maintain regulatory compliance within and outside the U.S. could impact our ability to sell our products and thus, adversely impact our financial position and results of operations. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

Trademarks. We have developed and use registered trademarks in our business, particularly relating to corporate, brand and product names. We own 30 trademark registrations, including thirteen incontestable registrations, in the U.S. Federal registration of a trademark affords the owner nationwide exclusive trademark rights in the registered mark and the ability to prevent others from using the same or similar marks. However, to the extent a common law user has made prior use of the mark in connection with similar goods or services in a particular geographic area, the nationwide rights conferred by federal registration can be subject to that user&#8217;s rights in that geographic area. 

&#160; 

We have sixteen foreign trademark registrations. One trademark is registered with the Australian Patent and Trademark Office, two with the Canadian Patent and Trademark Office, two with the Chinese Patent and Trademark Office, two with the Trademarks and Designs Registration Office of the European Union, two with the Hong Kong Patent and Trademark Office, three with the Japanese Patent and Trademark Office, two with the South Korean Patent and Trademark Office, and two with the Swiss Patent and Trademark Office. We currently have no additional trademark applications pending in any other jurisdictions outside of the United States. We also claim common law ownership and protection of certain unregistered trademarks and service marks. Trademark rights are based on use of a mark. Common law use of a mark offers protection of a mark within the particular geographic area in which it is used. We believe our registered and unregistered trademarks constitute valuable assets, adding to the recognition of our products and services in the marketplace. These and other proprietary rights have been and will continue to be important in enabling us to compete; however, we cannot assure you that our future trademark applications will be granted or our current trademarks will be maintained. 

&#160; 

Trade Secrets . We own certain intellectual property, including trade secrets, which we seek to protect, in part, through confidentiality agreements with employees and other parties. We regard our proprietary technology, trade secrets, trademarks and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely on a combination of trade secrets, contract, patent, copyright and trademark law to establish and protect the rights in our products and technology. The laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. 

&#160; 

Patents and Patent Licenses . We currently own fourteen U.S. patents and thirty-two corresponding patents registered in countries throughout North America, Europe and Asia. We also have pending applications in several countries. All of these patents and patent rights relate to the ingredient known as beta-alanine. Certain of these patents were assigned to NAI and we make certain ongoing royalty payments to the prior owners of the patents. We also license rights to certain uses that are covered by the patents to the prior owners. The royalty payments and license continue until the expiration of the patents. We also sell beta-alanine, and license our patent and trademark rights related to beta-alanine. Twenty-four of our patents expire in 2017, 1 patent expires in 2024 and twenty-one patents expire in 2026. 

&#160; 

Beginning in fiscal 2009, the licensing, raw material sales, and revenues we have received associated with the sale and license of beta-alanine under the CarnoSyn&#174; trade name have grown steadily from $515,000 in fiscal 2009 to $21.8 million in fiscal 2016. During fiscal 2016, our revenues included $235,000 of royalties and $21.6 million related to the direct sale of beta-alanine. We incurred intellectual property litigation and patent compliance expenses of approximately $2.0 million during fiscal 2016 primarily in connection with our efforts to protect our proprietary rights and patent estate. We expect to continue to incur these types of litigation expenses during fiscal 2017. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of June 30, 2016, we employed 177 full-time employees in the U.S., three of whom held executive management positions. Of the remaining full-time employees, 39 were employed in research, laboratory and quality control, 16 in sales and marketing, and 119 in manufacturing and administration. From time to time we use temporary personnel to help us meet short-term operating requirements. These positions typically are in manufacturing and manufacturing support. As of June 30, 2016, we had 39 temporary personnel. 

&#160; 

As of June 30, 2016, NAIE employed an additional 42 full-time employees and 27 temporary personnel. Most of these positions were in the areas of manufacturing and manufacturing support. 

&#160; 

Our employees are not represented by a collective bargaining agreement and we have not experienced any work stoppages as a result of labor disputes. We believe our relationship with our employees is good. 

&#160;

Although we believe there is little if any material impact on our business or results of operations from seasonal factors, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience variations in quarterly net sales due to the timing of private-label contract manufacturing and CarnoSyn&#174; beta-alanine raw material orders.

Financial Information about Our Business Segments and Geographic Areas 

&#160; 

Our operations are comprised of three reportable segments: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

Private-label contract manufacturing, in which we primarily provide manufacturing services to companies that market and distribute nutritional supplements and other health care products. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

Royalty, licensing, and raw material sales associated with the sale and license of beta-alanine under our CarnoSyn&#174; trademark. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

Branded products, in which we marketed and distributed branded nutritional supplements through direct-to-consumer marketing programs, and under which we developed, manufactured and marketed our own products and worked with nationally recognized persons to develop brand name products that reflected their individual approach to restoring, maintaining or improving health. We discontinued the sole remaining product line in this segment effective September 15, 2014. All termination activities related to the last remaining product line were substantially completed by December 31, 2014. We did not change the financial presentation in this report to reflect the branded products segment as &#8220;Discontinued Operations&#8221; as the wind down of this product line did not meet the criteria for discontinued operations presentation as prescribed by applicable accounting regulations (ASC 205-20). 

&#160; 

Our private-label contract manufacturing products are sold both in the U.S. and in markets outside the U.S., including Europe, Australia and Asia, as well as Canada, Mexico and South Africa. Our primary market outside the U.S. is Europe. Our patent and trademark licensing activities are primarily based in the U.S. 

&#160; 

For additional financial information, including financial information about our business segment and geographic areas, please see the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this report. 

&#160; 

Our activities in markets outside the U.S. are subject to political, economic and other risks in the countries in which our products are sold and in which we operate. For more information about these and other risks, please see Item 1A in this report.
