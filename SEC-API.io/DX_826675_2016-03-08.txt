 ITEM 1. 

BUSINESS 

COMPANY OVERVIEW 

We are an internally managed mortgage real estate investment trust, or mortgage REIT, which invests in residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities on a leveraged basis. Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the symbol "DX". We also have two series of preferred stock outstanding, our 8.50% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the "Series A Preferred Stock") which is traded on the NYSE under the symbol "DXPRA", and our 7.625% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the "Series B Preferred Stock") which is traded on the NYSE under the symbol "DXPRB". Our objective is to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders over the long term that are reflective of a leveraged, high quality fixed income portfolio with a focus on capital preservation. We seek to provide returns to our shareholders primarily through regular quarterly dividends, and also through capital appreciation. 

&#32;We invest in Agency and non-Agency mortgage-backed securities (&#8220;MBS&#8221;) consisting of residential MBS (&#8220;RMBS&#8221;), commercial MBS (&#8220;CMBS&#8221;) and CMBS interest-only ("IO") securities. Agency MBS have a guaranty of principal payment by an agency of the U.S. government or a U.S. government-sponsored entity ("GSE") such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Non-Agency MBS have no such guaranty of payment. Due to the guaranty of principal payment by a GSE, Agency MBS are the highest credit quality MBS available for investment. We seek to invest in Agency MBS and higher quality MBS (typically rated 'A' or better by one or more of the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations) to limit our exposure to credit losses and to minimize fluctuations in fair value from widening in credit spreads. In addition, Agency MBS and higher-rated MBS are typically more liquid (i.e., they are more easily converted into cash either through sales or pledges as collateral for repurchase agreement borrowings) than lower-rated MBS. 

Our primary source of income is net interest income, which is the excess of the interest income earned on our investments over the cost of financing these investments. We invest our capital pursuant to our Operating Policies as approved by our Board of Directors which include an Investment Policy and Investment Risk Policy as discussed further below. We use leverage to enhance the returns on our invested capital by pledging our investments as collateral for borrowings such as repurchase agreements as discussed further below. 

RMBS. Our Agency RMBS investments include MBS collateralized by adjustable-rate mortgage loans ("ARMs"), which have interest rates that generally will adjust at least annually to an increment over a specified interest rate index, and hybrid adjustable-rate mortgage loans ("hybrid ARMs"), which are loans that have a fixed rate of interest for a specified period (typically three to ten years) and then adjust their interest rate at least annually to an increment over a specified interest rate index. Agency ARMs also include hybrid Agency ARMs that are past their fixed-rate periods or within twelve months of their initial reset period. We may also invest in fixed-rate Agency RMBS from time to time. 

We also invest in non-Agency RMBS, which do not carry a principal guarantee from the U.S. government or a GSE. Non-Agency RMBS are collateralized by non-conforming residential mortgage loans and are tranched into different credit classes of securities with payments to junior classes subordinate to senior classes. Some of the non-Agency RMBS that we invest in may be collateralized by loans which are delinquent, the repayment of which is expected to come from foreclosure and liquidation of 

&#32;1 

the underlying real estate. We generally invest in senior classes of non-Agency RMBS which may include unrated securities. We seek to invest in non-Agency RMBS that we judge to have sufficiently high collateralization to be likely to protect the principal balance of our investment from credit losses on the underlying loans. 

CMBS. &#32;Our Agency and non-Agency CMBS are collateralized by first mortgage loans and are primarily fixed-rate securities backed by multifamily housing and other commercial real estate property types such as office building, retail, hospitality, and health care. Loans underlying CMBS generally are geographically diverse, are fixed-rate, mature in ten to twelve years and have amortization terms of up to 30 years. Typically these loans have some form of prepayment protection provisions (such as prepayment lock-out) or prepayment compensation provisions (such as yield maintenance or prepayment penalty). Yield maintenance and prepayment penalty requirements are intended to create an economic disincentive for the loans to prepay. Non-Agency CMBS also includes securities that are backed by pools of single-family rental homes which have variable-rates that reset monthly based on an index rate, such as LIBOR. 

CMBS IO . CMBS IO are interest-only securities issued as part of a CMBS securitization and represent the right to receive interest payments (but not principal cash flows) based on the unpaid principal balance of the underlying pool of commercial mortgage loans. We invest in both Agency-issued and non-Agency issued CMBS IO. The loans collateralizing CMBS IO pools are very similar in composition to the pools of loans that generally collateralize CMBS as discussed above. Since CMBS IO securities have no principal associated with them, the interest payments received are based on the unpaid principal balance of the underlying pool of mortgage loans, which is often referred to as the notional amount. Because CMBS IO receive no principal payments, CMBS IO securities generally have some form of prepayment protection including absolute loan prepayment lock-outs, loan prepayment penalties, or yield maintenance requirements associated with the underlying loans similar to CMBS described above. 

Operating Policies and Restrictions 

Our Operating Policies, which are reviewed and approved by the Board, set forth investment and risk limitations as they relate to the Company's investment activities and set parameters for the Company's investment and capital allocation decisions. Our Operating Policies require that we manage our operations and investments to comply with various REIT limitations (as discussed further below in &#8220;Federal Income Tax Considerations&#8221;) and to avoid qualifying as an investment company as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act") or as a commodity pool operator under the Commodity Exchange Act. 

As of December 31, 2015, our Operating Policies target an asset allocation of 60% to Agency MBS and 40% to non-Agency MBS. For securities rated BBB+ or lower at the time of purchase by any of the nationally recognized statistical ratings organizations, our Operating Policies limit our investment in these securities to $250 million in market value and limit our shareholders&#8217; equity at risk to $50 million. We also conduct our own independent evaluation of the credit risk on any non-Agency MBS, such that we do not rely solely on the security&#8217;s credit rating. In addition, our purchases of non-rated MBS in recent years have been shorter duration securities which we believe to have minimal credit risk. 

Our Operating Policies also limit the overall leverage of the Company to seven times our shareholders&#8217; equity capital and place limits on certain risks to which we are exposed, such as interest rate and convexity risk, our earnings at risk, and our shareholders&#8217; equity at risk from changes in fair value of our investment securities as a result of changes in interest rates, prepayment rates, investment prices and spreads, and others items. Our Operating Policies require us to perform a variety of stress tests to model the effect on the investment portfolio value and our liquidity of adverse market conditions. 

Within the overall limits established by our Operating Policies, our investment and capital allocation decisions depend on prevailing market conditions and other factors and may change over time in response to opportunities available in different economic and capital market environments. 

Investment Philosophy and Strategy 

&#160; 

Our investment philosophy encompasses a macroeconomic, top-down approach that focuses on the expected risk-adjusted outcome of any investment. Key points of our investment philosophy include the following: 

&#32;2 

&#8226; 

understanding macroeconomic conditions including the current state of the U.S. and global economies; 

&#8226; 

understanding the regulatory environment, competition for assets, and the terms and availability of financing; 

&#8226; 

sector analysis including understanding absolute returns, relative returns and risk-adjusted returns; 

&#8226; 

security and financing analysis including sensitivity analysis on credit, interest rate volatility, and market value risk; and 

&#8226; 

managing performance and portfolio risks, including interest rate, credit, prepayment, and liquidity risks. 

&#160; 

Our investment philosophy will dictate our investment strategy. In executing our strategy, we seek to balance the risks of owning various types of mortgage assets with the earnings opportunity on the investments. We believe our investment strategy provides superior diversification of these risks across our investment portfolio and therefore provides ample opportunities to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns while protecting our shareholders&#8217; capital. 

The performance of our investment portfolio will depend on many factors including but not limited to interest rates, trends of interest rates, the steepness of interest rate curves, prepayment rates on our investments, demand for our investments, general market liquidity, and economic conditions and their impact on the credit performance of our investments. In addition, our business model may be impacted by other factors such as the state of the overall credit markets, which could impact the availability and costs of financing. See &#8220;Factors that Affect Our Results of Operations and Financial Condition&#8221; below and "Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business" in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion . 

Our Financing Strategy 

We finance our investment activities primarily by pledging investment securities to lending counterparties under short-term recourse repurchase agreements. These repurchase agreements generally have original terms to maturity of 30 days to one year, though in some instances we may enter into longer-dated maturities depending on market conditions. We pay interest on our repurchase agreement borrowings at a rate usually based on a spread to LIBOR and fixed for the term of the borrowing. Borrowings under these repurchase agreements are renewable at the discretion of our lenders and do not contain guaranteed roll-over terms. One of our repurchase agreement lenders provides a committed repurchase agreement financing facility to us with an aggregate borrowing capacity of $300.0 million that expires on August 6, 2016. 

The amount borrowed under a repurchase agreement is limited by the lender to a percentage of the estimated market value of the pledged collateral, which is generally up to 95% of the estimated market value for Agency MBS, up to 90% for higher credit quality non-Agency MBS, and up to 85% for CMBS IO and for non-rated or lower credit quality non-Agency MBS. The difference between the market value of the pledged MBS collateral and the amount of the repurchase agreement is the amount of equity we have in the position (or "haircut") and is intended to provide the lender some protection against fluctuations of value in the collateral and/or the failure by us to repay the borrowing at maturity. 

Repurchase agreement financing is provided principally by major financial institutions and broker-dealers acting as financial intermediaries for money market funds and securities lenders that provide funds for the repurchase agreement markets. Repurchase agreement financing exposes us to counterparty risk, principally related to the excess of our collateral pledged over the amount borrowed. To mitigate this risk, we enter into repurchase agreement financings with multiple lenders. In very limited circumstances, a money market fund or securities lender has directly provided funds to us without the involvement of a financial intermediary typically at a lower cost than we would incur borrowing from the financial intermediary. Borrowing directly from these sources also reduces our risk to the financial intermediaries. 

The fair value of MBS fluctuates primarily as a result of principal payments and changes in market interest rates and spreads, prevailing market yields, actual or anticipated prepayment speeds, and other market conditions. If the fair value of the MBS pledged as collateral declines below the lender's required haircut, the lender has the right to initiate a margin call which requires us to pledge additional assets to collateralize the outstanding repurchase agreement borrowings. Lenders may also initiate margin calls during periods of market stress as a result of actual or expected volatility in asset prices. If we fail to meet any margin call, our lenders also have the right to terminate the repurchase agreement and sell any collateral pledged. Therefore, we attempt to maintain cash and other liquid securities in sufficient amounts to manage our exposure to margin calls by lenders. 

During 2015, our captive insurance subsidiary, Mackinaw Insurance Company, LLC ("Mackinaw"), became a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") of Indianapolis. As a member of the FHLB system, Mackinaw had access to a variety 

&#32;3 

of services and products offered by the FHLB of Indianapolis, including the ability to secured advances against collateral pledged under an advances, pledge and security agreement which includes collateral requirements similar to our repurchase agreement borrowings. In January 2016, the Federal Housing Finance Administration ("FHFA") released a final rule on FHLB membership which excludes captive insurance entities from FHLB membership on a going-forward basis and provides termination rules for current captive insurance members. Because Mackinaw's membership in the FHLB became effective after the FHFA issued its proposed rule in September 2014, Mackinaw will be required to terminate its membership within one year of the rule's effective date of February 19, 2016 and will not be permitted new advances or renewals of existing advances during the transition period. Because we maintain excess borrowing capacity at our repurchase agreement financing counterparties, we do not anticipate any difficulties in replacing the FHLB advances at or before their respective maturities. We along with other mortgage REITs are pursuing federal legislation to preserve the membership of captive insurers in the FHLB system by reversing the FHFA's final rule, or to explicitly admit mortgage REITs into the FHLB system. 

Please refer to "Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business" in Item 1A of Part 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding significant risks related to our repurchase agreement financing. 

Our Hedging Strategy 

&#160; 

We use a variety of derivative instruments to mitigate our exposure to market events outside of our control which could impact our earnings, cash flow or book value. Our hedging activities attempt primarily to reduce our exposure to adverse effects of changes in interest rates. For example, given the nature of our investing and financing activities, in a period of rising interest rates our earnings and cash flow may be negatively impacted by borrowing costs increasing faster than income from our assets, and our book value may decline as a result of declining market values of our MBS. We enter into derivative instruments in an attempt to partially or fully mitigate our exposure to these changes in interest rates. We typically utilize interest rate swap agreements and Eurodollar futures to hedge interest rate risk, but may also utilize interest rate cap or floor agreements, put and call options on securities or securities underlying futures contracts, forward rate agreements, or swaptions. 

In conducting our hedging activities, we intend to comply with REIT and tax limitations on our hedging instruments which could limit our activities and the instruments that we may use. We also intend to enter into derivative contracts only with the counterparties that we believe have a strong credit rating to help mitigate the risk of counterparty default or insolvency. 

Factors that Affect Our Results of Operations and Financial Condition 

Our financial performance is driven by the performance of our investment portfolio and related funding and derivative hedging activity which are impacted by multiple factors, many of which are related to macroeconomic conditions and other factors beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, the absolute level of interest rates, the relative steepness of interest rate curves, changes in market expectations of future interest rates, actual and estimated future prepayment rates on our investments, competition for investments, economic conditions and their impact on the credit performance of our investments, and market required yields as reflected by market credit spreads. All of these factors are influenced by market forces and generally are exacerbated during periods of market volatility as we experienced at the end of 2015 and the beginning of 2016. 

In addition, the performance of our investment portfolio, the cost and availability of financing and the availability of investments at acceptable risk-adjusted returns could be influenced by actions and policy measures of the U.S. government including, but not limited to, the FHFA, the U. S. Department of the Treasury (the "Treasury"), and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve") and could also be influenced by reactions in U.S. markets from activities of central banks around the world. 

Our business model may also be impacted by other factors such as the availability and cost of financing and the state of the overall credit markets. Reductions in the availability of financing for our investments could significantly impact our business and force us to sell assets that we otherwise would not sell, potentially at losses depending on market conditions. Regulatory developments since the 2008 financial crisis have impacted large U.S. domiciled banks and their broker dealer subsidiaries by requiring such entities to hold more capital against their assets, including reverse repurchase agreements. In general, this has led to reduced lending capacity in the repurchase agreement market, though we have not yet experienced a reduction in the availability of repurchase agreement financing. Other factors that could also impact our business include changes in regulatory requirements, including requirements to qualify for registration under the 1940 Act, and REIT requirements. 

&#32;4 

We believe that regulatory impacts on financial institutions, many of which are our trading and financing counterparties, continue to pose a threat to the overall liquidity in the capital markets. In particular, higher capital requirements under U.S. banking regulations adopted in 2013 and 2014 and limitations on the proprietary trading activities of large U.S. financial institutions under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ("the "Dodd-Frank Act") could result in reduced liquidity in times of market stress. U.S. federal banking regulators continue to explore further increasing regulatory and capital requirements for large U.S. financial institutions. While the Federal Reserve continues to reinvest principal payments received on its Agency RMBS portfolio, it is unlikely that this activity will provide enough liquidity to the market in times of stress, which could result in volatile asset prices. Further, the impact on market liquidity of our investments and the financing markets could be negatively impacted if the Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee (or "FOMC") suddenly changes market expectations of the targeted Federal Funds Rate or takes other actions which have the effect of tightening monetary policy. 

As discussed above, investing in mortgage-related securities on a leveraged basis subjects us to a number of risks including interest rate risk, prepayment and reinvestment risk, credit risk, market value risk and liquidity risk. Please refer to Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" as well as Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of these factors and others that have the potential to impact our results of operations and financial condition. 

INDUSTRY OVERVIEW 

Mortgage REITs provide liquidity to the U.S. real estate markets through the purchase of RMBS and CMBS and through the origination or purchase of mortgage loans. The business models of mortgage REITs range from investing only in Agency MBS to investing substantially in non-investment grade MBS and originating and securitizing mortgage loans. Each mortgage REIT will assume risks in its investment strategy. Whereas we invest in shorter-duration and higher quality MBS in order to mitigate interest rate risk and credit risk, other mortgage REITs may be willing to accept more of these risks than we are and invest in mortgage assets that we do not. 

As a continuing consequence of the 2008 financial crisis, the U.S. Congress is exploring ways to reform the housing finance system, and in particular the roles of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae in this system, and to move toward a housing finance system with larger participation by private entities. Based on political and regulatory proposals and discussions, we believe that an immediate or near-term resolution of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or Ginnie Mae is very unlikely. However, under the terms of their federal conservatorship, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac must continue to reduce their investment portfolios of mortgage assets but may continue issuing guarantees on pools of qualified loans. Over the longer term, however, we believe the GSE's role in the housing finance system will change and could evolve in such a way that will present opportunities for industry participants who understand and are willing to hold long-term credit and assume interest rate risk of the U.S. housing market. Ultimately, we believe the cost of credit to the U.S. housing market may increase which will improve yields on investments in RMBS and CMBS. 

Uncertainty around regulation of financial institutions under the Dodd-Frank Act, minimum capital standards implemented under the Basel III Accord (and associated implementing regulations) and related regulatory reform initiatives, increased risk-weightings for certain types of mortgage loans held by depository institutions, increased regulatory requirements related to origination of certain types of residential mortgage loans, and other potential regulatory changes, may further impact capital formation in the U.S. mortgage market in ways that could favor mortgage REITs. There are potential negative consequences to increased regulation of financial institutions, however, including increasing borrowing costs or reduced availability of repurchase agreement financing and the need to post more capital to leverage our investments and/or enter into derivative instruments. 

COMPETITION 

The financial services industry in which we compete is a highly competitive market. In purchasing investments and obtaining financing, we compete with other mortgage REITs, broker dealers and investment banking firms, mutual funds, banks, hedge funds, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, governmental bodies, and other entities, many of which have greater financial resources and a lower cost of capital than we do. Increased competition in the market may reduce the available supply of investments and may drive prices of investments to unacceptable levels which would negatively impact our ability to earn an acceptable amount of income from these investments. Competition can also reduce the availability of borrowing capacity at our repurchase agreement 

&#32;5 

counterparties as such capacity is not unlimited, and many of our repurchase agreement counterparties limit the amount of financing they offer to the mortgage REIT industry. 

FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS 

As a REIT, we are required to abide by certain requirements for qualification as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#8220;Code&#8221;). To retain our REIT status, the REIT rules generally require that we invest primarily in real estate-related assets, that our activities be passive rather than active and that we distribute annually to our shareholders substantially all of our taxable income, after certain deductions, including deductions for our tax net operating loss (&#8220;NOL&#8221;) carryforward. We could be subject to income tax if we failed to satisfy those requirements. We use the calendar year for both tax and financial reporting purposes. 

We utilize our NOL carryforward to offset our taxable earnings after taking the REIT distribution requirements into account. As a result of our public offering of common stock in February 2012, we incurred an "ownership change" as such term is defined in Section 382 of the Code. Because of this ownership change, the amount of the NOL carryforward that we may use each year is limited to approximately $13.5 million, and portions of this amount not utilized are accumulated and rolled forward to the following year. Our NOL carryforward begins to expire substantially in 2020. The following table provides a rollforward of our NOL carryforward for the periods indicated:

(1) Subject to completion of our 2015 federal income tax return. 

There may be differences between taxable income and net income computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;). These differences primarily arise from timing differences in the recognition of revenue and expense for tax and GAAP purposes. 

Failure to satisfy certain Code requirements could cause us to lose our status as a REIT. If we failed to qualify as a REIT for any taxable year, we may be subject to federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) at regular corporate rates and would not receive deductions for dividends paid to shareholders. We could, however, utilize our NOL carryforward to offset all or part of our taxable income to the extent the NOL is available to us based on the limitations described above. If we lost or otherwise surrendered our status as a REIT, we could not elect REIT status again for five years. Several of our investments in securitized mortgage loans have ownership restrictions limiting their ownership to REITs. Therefore, if we fail to maintain our REIT status, we would have to sell these investments or otherwise provide for REIT ownership of these investments. In addition, many of our repurchase agreement lenders and interest rate swap counterparties require us to maintain our REIT status. If we were to lose our REIT status, these lenders would have the right to terminate any repurchase agreement borrowings and interest rate swaps outstanding at that time. 

&#32;6 

Qualification as a REIT 

Qualification as a REIT requires that we satisfy a variety of tests relating to our income, assets, distributions and ownership. The significant tests are summarized below. 

Sources of Income . To continue qualifying as a REIT, we must satisfy two distinct tests with respect to the sources of our income: the &#8220;75% income test&#8221; and the &#8220;95% income test.&#8221; The 75% income test requires that we derive at least 75% of our gross income (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions) from certain real estate-related sources. In order to satisfy the 95% income test, 95% of our gross income for the taxable year must consist of either income that qualifies under the 75% income test or certain other types of passive income. 

If we fail to meet either the 75% income test or the 95% income test, or both, in a taxable year, we might nonetheless continue to qualify as a REIT, if our failure was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect and the nature and amounts of our items of gross income were properly disclosed to the Internal Revenue Service. However, in such a case we would be required to pay a tax equal to 100% of any excess non-qualifying income. 

Nature and Diversification of Assets . At the end of each calendar quarter, we must meet multiple asset tests. Under the &#8220;75% asset test&#8221;, at least 75% of the value of our total assets must represent cash or cash items (including receivables), government securities or real estate assets. Under the &#8220;10% asset test,&#8221; we may not own more than 10% of the outstanding voting power or value of securities of any single non-governmental issuer, provided such securities do not qualify under the 75% asset test or relate to taxable REIT subsidiaries. Under the &#8220;5% asset test,&#8221; ownership of any stocks or securities that do not qualify under the 75% asset test must be limited, in respect of any single non-governmental issuer, to an amount not greater than 5% of the value of our total assets (excluding ownership of any taxable REIT subsidiaries). 

If we inadvertently fail to satisfy one or more of the asset tests at the end of a calendar quarter, such failure would not cause us to lose our REIT status, provided that (i) we satisfied all of the asset tests at the close of the preceding calendar quarter and (ii) the discrepancy between the values of our assets and the standards imposed by the asset tests either did not exist immediately after the acquisition of any particular asset or was not wholly or partially caused by such an acquisition. If the condition described in clause (ii) of the preceding sentence was not satisfied, we still could avoid disqualification by eliminating any discrepancy within 30 days after the close of the calendar quarter in which it arose. 

Ownership . In order to maintain our REIT status, we must not be deemed to be closely held and must have more than 100 shareholders. The closely held prohibition requires that not more than 50% of the value of our outstanding shares be owned by five or fewer persons at any time during the last half of our taxable year. The "more than 100 shareholders" rule requires that we have at least 100 shareholders for 335 days of a twelve-month taxable year. In the event that we failed to satisfy the ownership requirements we would be subject to fines and be required to take curative action to meet the ownership requirements in order to maintain our REIT status. 

EMPLOYEES 

As of December 31, 2015, we have 20 employees and one corporate office in Glen Allen, Virginia. None of our employees are covered by any collective bargaining agreements, and we are not aware of any union organizing activity relating to our employees.
