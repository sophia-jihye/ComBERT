BUSINESS. 

General 

DSW is the destination for fabulous brands at a great value every single day. With a breathtaking assortment of shoes, handbags and accessories for women, men and children in 468 &#32;stores nationwide and on dsw.com, DSW strives to delight customers with finding the perfect shoe at an incredible price. Our DSW stores average approximately 21,000 &#32;square feet and carry approximately 21,500 &#32;pairs of shoes. In addition, our DSW Rewards loyalty program means shopping comes with perks; members earn points towards certificates every time they purchase. We believe this combination of assortment, convenience and value differentiates us from our competitors and appeals to consumers from a broad range of socioeconomic and demographic backgrounds. 

As a segment of DSW Inc., the Affiliated Business Group ("ABG") partners with multi-category retailers to develop strategies and business models for targeted shoe assortments. ABG provides service to 379 &#32;store locations and e-commerce channels through leased partnerships with Stein Mart, Gordmans and Frugal Fannie's. 

DSW Inc. also has an equity investment in Town Shoes Limited ("Town Shoes"). Town Shoes is the market leader in branded footwear in Canada, with sales of over $330 million &#32;CAD in its fiscal year ended January 2016. As of January 30, 2016, Town Shoes operated 185 &#32;locations across Canada under The Shoe Company, Shoe Warehouse, Town Shoes and DSW banners, as well as an e-commerce site. In 2014, DSW Inc. entered into a licensing agreement with Town Shoes, which allows Town Shoes to use the DSW Designer Shoe Warehouse tradename for their new larger concept Canadian stores. As of January 30, 2016 , there are 13 &#32;DSW Designer Shoe Warehouse stores in Canada. 

See our consolidated financial statements &#32;and the notes thereto in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for financial information about our two segments: the DSW segment, which includes DSW stores and dsw.com, and the ABG segment. Additionally, a five year summary of certain financial and operational information is included in Item 6 of this Annual Report. 

We follow a 52/53-week fiscal year that ends on the Saturday nearest to January 31 in each year. The periods presented in these financial statements and selected financial data are the fiscal years ended January 30, 2016 &#32;(" fiscal 2015 "), January 31, 2015 &#32;(" fiscal 2014 "), February 1, 2014 &#32;(" fiscal 2013 "), February 2, 2013 &#32;(" fiscal 2012 ") and January 28, 2012 &#32;(" fiscal 2011 "). Fiscal 2015 , 2014 , 2013 &#32;and 2011 &#32;each consisted of 52 weeks, while fiscal 2012 &#32;consisted of 53 weeks. 

Corporate History 

We were incorporated in the state of Ohio on January 20, 1969 and opened our first DSW store in Dublin, Ohio in 1991. In 1998, a predecessor of RVI purchased DSW and affiliated shoe businesses from Schottenstein Stores Corporation and Nacht Management, Inc. In July 2005, we completed an initial public offering of our Class A Common Shares, selling approximately 32.4 million shares at an offering price of $9.50 per share. On May 26, 2011, RVI merged (the "Merger") with and into DSW MS LLC ("Merger Sub"), with Merger Sub surviving the merger and continuing as a wholly owned subsidiary of DSW Inc. Upon the closing of the Merger, each outstanding RVI common share was converted into 0.435 &#32;DSW Class A Common Shares, unless the holder properly and timely elected to receive a like amount of DSW Class B Common Shares. On October 14, 2013 , the shareholders of DSW Inc. approved a two-for-one stock split of DSW Common Shares. The stock split became effective on November 4, 2013 &#32; and provided for the issuance of one Class A Common Share for each Class A and Class B Common Share outstanding. 

Competitive Strengths 

DSW Inc. is a leading footwear retailer with a history of growth and financial strength that is leveraging its operating model to gain market share. We believe that having a leading market position is driven by our competitive strengths: assortment, convenience and value. 

Assortment 

Our goal is to excite our customers with a competitive, compelling assortment of shoes and complementary accessories that fulfill a broad range of style and fashion preferences. DSW sells a large assortment of brand name, designer and private brand merchandise. We purchase directly from over 400 &#32;domestic and foreign vendors, primarily in-season footwear found in specialty and department stores and branded make-ups (shoes made exclusively for a retailer). We also make opportunistic and close-out purchases to offer value to our customers. Through our stores, fulfillment center and expanding drop ship network, 

we offer thousands of shoes for women, men and children and a complementary assortment of handbags, hosiery, jewelry and other accessories which appeal to our brand and fashion conscious customers. 

Our vendors include suppliers who either manufacture their own merchandise or supply merchandise manufactured by others, or both. Most of our domestic vendors import a large portion of their merchandise from abroad. We have quality control programs under which our buyers are involved in establishing standards for quality and fit, and our personnel examine incoming merchandise in regards to color, material and overall quality. As our sales volumes continue to grow, we believe there will continue to be adequate sources available to acquire a sufficient supply of quality merchandise in a timely manner and on satisfactory economic terms. During fiscal 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , our top three vendors supplied approximately 18% , 18% &#32;and 19% &#32;of our merchandise, respectively. 

Our merchandising group continuously monitors current fashion trends, as well as historical sales trends, to identify popular styles and styles that may become popular in the upcoming season. We track performance and sales trends on a weekly basis and have a flexible buying process that allows us to reorder successful styles and cancel underperforming styles throughout each season. To keep our product mix fresh and on target, we test new fashions and actively monitor sell-through rates. We also aim to improve the quality and breadth of existing vendor offerings and identify new vendor and category opportunities. 

We separate our DSW merchandise into four primary categories: women&#8217;s footwear; men&#8217;s footwear; athletic footwear; and accessories and other (which includes kids' footwear). The following table sets forth the approximate percentages of DSW segment sales attributable to each merchandise category for the fiscal years below:

Convenience 

We provide our customers with the highest level of convenience based on our belief that customers should be empowered to control and personalize their shopping experiences. 

In stores, our merchandise is displayed on the selling floor with self-service fixtures to enable customers to view and touch the merchandise. We believe this shopping experience provides our customers with maximum convenience as they are able to browse and try on merchandise without feeling rushed or pressured to make a purchasing decision. Our traditional and mobile points of sale allow us to interact and transact with customers on the selling floor. Merchandise is organized in a logical manner that groups together similar styles, such as dress, casual, seasonal and athletic merchandise, for easy browsing. 

Our goal is to create an endless aisle for the customer. Customers can order additional styles, sizes, widths and categories that can be fulfilled from other stores, our fulfillment center or the suppliers' warehouse. To further meet customer demand of how they receive products, we launched the additional capabilities for buy online, pickup in store and buy online, ship to store options in 2015. 

Value For Our Customers 

Through our buying organization, we are able to provide customers with high quality, in-season fashion styles at attractive prices compared to the sale prices found at specialty retailers and department stores. We have historically employed a consistent pricing strategy that provides customers with the same price on our merchandise from the day it arrives in store until it enters our planned clearance rotation. Our pricing strategy differentiates us from our competitors who usually price and promote merchandise at discounts available only for limited time periods. We find that customers appreciate shopping for value when it is most convenient for them, rather than waiting for a sale event. 

In order to provide additional value to our customers, we maintain a loyalty program, DSW Rewards, which rewards customers for shopping, both in DSW stores and at dsw.com. DSW Rewards members earn reward certificates that offer discounts on future purchases. Reward certificates expire three &#32;months after being issued. Members also receive promotional offers and gifts 

with purchase. We employ a variety of methods, including email, direct mail and social media, to communicate exclusive offers to our rewards customers. In fiscal 2014, we also introduced a co-branded credit card that allows DSW Rewards members to earn points for purchases made at DSW, as well as other locations that accept Visa. 

&#160; 

As of January 30, 2016 , approximately 24 million &#32;members were enrolled in our DSW Rewards program and have made at least one purchase over the course of the last two years as compared to approximately 23 million &#32;members as of January 31, 2015 . In fiscal 2015 &#32;and 2014 , shoppers in the loyalty program generated approximately 89% &#32;and 90% &#32;of DSW segment sales, respectively. 

Growth Strategy 

&#160; 

Our growth strategy is to continue to strengthen our position as a leading footwear and accessories retailer by: expanding into new markets with the right banners and store format, extending our customer reach through new categories, and acquiring new strengths to compete in ways and places that are relevant to the customer, such as our recent acquisition of Ebuys, Inc. We will also continue expanding our physical and digital presence in relevant markets through existing and new formats, investing in our infrastructure, and utilizing our financial strength to invest in key initiatives. 

Expanding Our Physical and Digital Presence 

We opened 40 &#32;DSW stores and closed 3 DSW stores in fiscal 2015 . Of the store openings in fiscal 2015, 9 were small format stores. Our small format stores average approximately 12,000 square feet and, if successful, could pave the way for more small format stores. As of January 30, 2016 , the Company has a total of 16 small format stores. We plan to open approximately 30 to 35 &#32;DSW stores in fiscal 2016 &#32;and an additional 15 &#32;to 20 &#32;DSW stores in each of the following three to five years. We believe we have the potential to operate more than 550 &#32;stores, which excludes small format stores. We are evaluating our real estate strategy to optimize how we can best serve the customers' shopping preferences in store and online. Our plan is to open stores in both new and existing markets, with the primary focus on power strip centers and to reposition existing stores as opportunities arise. Depending on the market, we also consider regional malls, lifestyle centers and urban street locations. In general, our evaluation of potential new stores integrates information on demographics, co-tenancy, retail traffic patterns, site visibility and accessibility, store size and configuration and lease terms. Our real estate decision-making entails an analysis of underlying demand for our products through both physical and digital channels. Our analysis also looks at current penetration levels in markets we serve and our ability to deepen our market share and acquire new customers. 

As of January 30, 2016 , we operated 468 &#32;DSW stores in 42 &#32;states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. The following table shows the number of our DSW stores by state and territory:

Total 

In addition to store growth, we are enhancing our omni-channel capabilities. We expanded our drop ship program, have made previously store-only product available online and increased availability of our accessories online. Our omni-channel capabilities allow customers to purchase shoes from a location other than from where the customer originally demanded the item. Our mobile application provides another opportunity for customers to interact with us. In fiscal 2015, we launched buy online, pick up in store and buy online, ship to store. 

In our Affiliated Business Group, we leverage our sourcing network to produce a merchandise assortment that meets the needs of our affiliated business customers. We pursue opportunities for new affiliated business partners. 

Through our investment in Town Shoes, we serve Canadian customers with great values on branded footwear and accessories within a variety of concepts, including DSW Designer Shoe Warehouse stores. As of January 30, 2016, there are 13 DSW Designer Shoe Warehouse stores in Canada, and Town Shoes plans to open approximately 10 DSW Designer Shoe Warehouse stores in fiscal 2016. 

Investment in Our Infrastructure 

We have invested in systems that will enhance our operating efficiency in areas such as supply chain, merchandise planning and allocation, inventory management, distribution and labor management. 

Over the past few years, we completed investments in our supply chain to support assortment planning, size replenishment and size optimization. All categories are planned using an enterprise-wide assortment planning system that allows us to build assortments based on local customer profiles rather than just based on store volume. Size replenishment focuses on replenishing core styles at a size level; size optimization allows us to effectively allocate sizes by store. 

Our primary distribution center is located in an approximately 700,000 square foot facility in Columbus, Ohio. The distribution center operates to facilitate the prompt delivery of purchases and fast-selling footwear so we can take full advantage of each selling season. To further ensure prompt delivery, we engage a logistics service provider to receive orders originating from suppliers on the West Coast and some imports entering at a West Coast port of entry through a West Coast facility we utilize. Merchandise is transported either from the West Coast facility or our primary distribution center to our pool points and then on to stores. 

Order routing optimization determines the best location to ship certain digitally demanded products from, to optimize our operating profit. Orders originating online can be fulfilled from a store or our fulfillment center, which is also located in Columbus, Ohio. The fulfillment center processes orders which are shipped to a customer's home or to a store when an order is placed through buy online, ship to store. Orders originating from a store that cannot be fulfilled in that store can either be fulfilled from our ship from store capability, from the fulfillment center, or drop shipped from a vendors' warehouse. 

Utilizing Our Financial Strength 

Our operating model is focused on assortment, convenience and value. Over the past five years, our net sales have grown at a compounded annual growth rate of 8% . In addition, we have consistently generated positive operating cash flows and profitable operating results. Our liquidity, strong vendor relationships and talented associates enable DSW to differentiate our assortment and run a profitable business compared to our peers. 

We are committed to a disciplined process in capital allocation. We believe cash generated from operations, together with our cash and investments of approximately $330 million &#32;as of January 30, 2016 , is sufficient to maintain our ongoing operations, support seasonal working capital requirements, fund capital expenditures, and make quarterly dividend payments and opportunistic share repurchases. In addition, our strong balance sheet allows us to pursue investments like Town Shoes and Ebuys, Inc. 

Additional Information 

Affiliated Business Group 

As a division of DSW Inc., ABG partners with multi-category retailers to develop strategies and business models for targeted shoe assortments. We have renewable supply agreements to provide merchandise for the shoe departments in Stein Mart, Gordmans, and Frugal Fannie&#8217;s stores through December 2016 , January 2019 &#32;and April 2017 , respectively. As of January 30, 2016 , we supplied merchandise to 276 &#32;Stein Mart stores and Steinmart.com, 102 &#32;Gordmans stores and Gordmans.com, and one &#32;Frugal Fannie&#8217;s store. 

Competition 

We view our primary competitors to be department stores, online shoe retailers and brand-oriented discounters. We also compete with mall-based shoe stores, national chains, independent shoe retailers, single-brand specialty retailers and multi- 

channel specialty retailers. Many of our competitors generally offer a more limited assortment at higher initial prices in a less convenient format than DSW and without the benefits of the DSW Rewards program. In addition, we believe we successfully compete against retailers who have attempted to duplicate our format because they typically offer assortments with fewer recognizable brands and more styles from prior seasons, unlike DSW&#8217;s current on-trend merchandise. We believe that our brick and mortar stores provide a competitive advantage by stimulating digital sales, driving growth in DSW segment sales and providing a convenient location for customers to pick up and return products ordered online. 

Intellectual Property 

We have registered a number of trademarks, service marks and domain names in the United States and internationally, including DSW&#174;, DSW Shoe Warehouse&#174; and DSW Designer Shoe Warehouse&#174;. We licensed our DSW Designer Shoe Warehouse trademark to Town Shoes. We believe our trademarks and service marks, especially those related to the DSW concept, have significant value and are important to building our name recognition. To protect our brand identity, we have also protected the DSW trademark in several foreign countries. We also hold patents related to our unique store fixtures, which gives us greater efficiency in stocking and operating those stores that currently have the fixtures. We aggressively protect our patented fixture designs, as well as our packaging, private brand names, store design elements, marketing slogans and graphics. 

Associates 

As of January 30, 2016 , we employed approximately 11,900 &#32;associates. None of our associates are covered by any collective bargaining agreements. We offer competitive wages, paid time off, comprehensive medical and dental insurance, vision care, company-paid and supplemental life insurance programs, associate-paid long-term disability and company-paid short-term disability insurance and a 401(k) plan to our full-time associates and some of our part-time associates. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our associates to be good. 

Seasonality 

&#160; 

Our business is subject to seasonal merchandise trends when our customers&#8217; interest in new seasonal styles increases. New spring styles are primarily introduced in the first quarter, and new fall styles are primarily introduced in the third quarter.
