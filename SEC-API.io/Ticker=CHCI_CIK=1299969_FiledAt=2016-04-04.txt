Our Operating Market 

We are primarily focused on the Washington, D.C. market (Washington D.C. and the Northern Virginia and Maryland suburbs of Washington D.C.), which is the seventh largest metropolitan statistical area in the United States. Our expertise in developing traditional and non-traditional housing products enables us to focus on a wide range of opportunities within our core market. We build homes and multi-family buildings in suburban communities, where we focus on low density products such as single-family detached homes, townhomes and mid-rise multi-family buildings, and in urban areas, where we focus on high density multi-family and mixed use products. For our homebuilding operations, we develop properties with the intent to sell either as fee-simple properties or condominiums to individual unit buyers or as investment properties to investors. Our homebuilding products are designed to attract first-time, early move-up and secondary move-up buyers. We focus on products that we are able to offer for sale in the middle price points within the markets where we operate, avoiding the very low-end and high-end products. We believe our middle market strategy positions our products such that they are affordable to a significant segment of potential home buyers in our market. 

&#160;

Our multi-family buildings are developed as rental properties to be held and operated for our own purposes, converted at some point to for-sale condominium units or sold on a merchant build basis. When developing rental communities, we design our products to be readily convertible to condominiums. Our multi-family communities primarily target two groups: (i) young first time tenants and (ii) renters by choice. 

We believe that our significant experience over the past 30 years in the Washington, D.C. market provides us with the experience necessary to identify attractive opportunities in our core market. We believe that our focus in the Washington, D.C. market, which has historically been characterized by economic conditions less volatile than many other major homebuilding markets, should provide us with an opportunity to generate attractive returns on investment and for growth. 

Financial information for each of our reportable business segments is included in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. 

Our Business Strategy 

Our business strategy is designed to leverage our extensive capabilities and market knowledge to maximize returns on invested capital on our various real estate related activities. We execute our strategy through three related business segments: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Homebuilding &#150; We target new homebuilding opportunities where our building experience and ability to manage highly complex entitlement, development and related issues provides us with a competitive advantage. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Multi-family &#150; We seek opportunities in the multi-family rental market where our experience and core capabilities can be leveraged. We will either position the assets for sale to institutional buyers when completed or operate the asset within our own portfolio. Operating the asset for our own account affords us the flexibility of converting the units to condominiums in the future. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Real Estate Services &#150; Our management team has significant experience in all aspects of real estate management, including strategic planning, land development, entitlement, property management, sales and marketing, workout and turnaround strategies, financing and general construction. We are able to provide a wide range of construction management, general contracting and real estate related services to other property owners. This business line not only allows us to generate positive fee income from our highly qualified personnel but also serves as a potential catalyst for joint venture and acquisition opportunities. These business units work in concert to leverage the collective skill sets of our organization. The talent and experience of our personnel allows workflow flexibility and a multitasking approach to managing various projects. In a capital constrained environment, we use creative problem solving and financing approaches by working closely with land owners, banks, borrowers and other parties in an effort to generate value for all constituents. We believe that our business network in the Washington, D.C. real estate market provides us with a competitive advantage in sourcing and executing investment opportunities. 

Our land acquisition strategy is designed to maximize potential overall returns generated by homebuilding operations. We pursue land acquisition opportunities that generally fit into three categories: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Finished building lots &#150; Whenever practical, we purchase fully developed building lots from sellers that have secured necessary entitlements and permits and have completed the land development process. This enables us to minimize the amount of land we hold in inventory and to time our acquisition of such lots with the sales of homes to be built on such lots, thereby reducing the hold time and carrying costs associated with holding the lots. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Entitled building lots &#150; We purchase certain development sites after the land seller has secured substantially all entitlements, allowing for prompt development of the land into building lots. This affords us the opportunity to secure building lots in locations where finished building lots are not readily available, or where the price of obtaining finished lots is determined to be unaffordable. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Land options &#150; We contract to purchase certain development sites in advance of entitlements being secured. This affords us the opportunity to design the layout of the building lots to fit our home products, while the land continues to be held by the land seller and minimizes our costs associated with carrying such land in our inventory while development permits are secured. &#160;

With respect to our homebuilding operations, we seek to minimize risk associated with fluctuating market conditions by primarily building pre-sold units and limiting the number of speculative units or &#147;spec units&#148; (units that are under construction without an executed sales contract) held in inventory. In each new community that we develop, we build model homes to demonstrate our products and to house our on-site sales operations. When practical, we execute sale-leaseback transactions on model homes. We limit building spec units in locations where there is a demand for immediate delivery of homes or where a significant number of the units in a multi-family building (such as townhouses or condominiums) have been pre-sold. We believe that by limiting the number of model homes and spec units held in inventory, we reduce our exposure to cyclical fluctuations in market values and minimize costs associated with holding inventory, such as debt service. 

Our Operations 

We believe that we are properly staffed for current market conditions and that we have the ability to manage growth as market conditions warrant. Our operations are focused mainly in the Washington, D.C. market, where we believe our 30 years of market experience provides us the best opportunity to enhance stockholder value. 

Our Communities 

We are currently operating, or developing projects in multiple counties throughout the Washington, D.C. market. The following table summarizes certain information for our owned or controlled communities as of December 31, 2015:

Land/Lot Acquisition and Inventory Management 

As discussed in &#145;Our Business Strategy&#146; section above, we acquire land after we have completed due diligence and generally after we have obtained the rights (entitlements) to begin development or construction work resulting in an acceptable number of residential lots. Before we acquire lots or tracts of land, we complete a feasibility study, which includes soil tests, independent environmental studies, other engineering work and financial analysis. We also evaluate the status of necessary zoning and other governmental entitlements required to develop and use the property for home construction. 

We also enter into land/lot option contracts, in which we obtain the right, but generally not the obligation, to buy land or lots at predetermined prices on a defined schedule commensurate with anticipated home closings or planned development. Our option contracts generally are non-recourse, which limits our financial exposure to our earnest money deposited with land and lot sellers and any pre-acquisition due diligence costs we incur. This enables us to control land and lot positions with limited capital investment in order to substantially reduce the risks associated with land ownership and development. 

&#160;

We directly acquire almost all of our land and lot positions. We are a party to a number of joint ventures, all of which are consolidated in our financial statements. 

We attempt to mitigate our exposure to real estate inventory risks by: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Managing our supply of land/lots controlled (owned and optioned) based on anticipated future home closing levels; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Monitoring market and demographic trends, housing preferences and related economic developments, based on the quality of schools, new job opportunities and local growth initiatives; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Utilizing land/lot option contracts, where possible; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Seeking to acquire developed lots which are substantially ready for home construction, where possible; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Limiting the size of acquired land parcels to smaller tracts, where possible, and controlling our investments in land acquisition, land development and housing inventory to match the anticipated housing demand; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Generally commencing construction of custom features or optional upgrades on homes under contract only after the buyer&#146;s receipt of mortgage approval and receipt of satisfactory deposits from the buyer; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Monitoring and managing the number of speculative units built in each community. Land Development and Home Construction 

Substantially all of our land development and home construction work is performed by subcontractors. Subcontractors typically are selected after a competitive bidding process and retained for a specific community pursuant to a contract that obligates the subcontractor to complete the scope of work at an agreed-upon price. Agreements with the subcontractors and suppliers generally are negotiated for each community. We compete with other homebuilders for qualified subcontractors, raw materials and lots in the markets where we operate. We employ land development supervisors and construction superintendents to monitor land development and home construction activities, participate in major design and building decisions, coordinate the activities of subcontractors and suppliers, review the work of subcontractors for quality and cost control and monitor compliance with zoning and building codes. In addition, our construction superintendents play a significant role in working with our homebuyers by assisting with option selection and home modification decisions, educating buyers on the construction process and instructing buyers on post-closing home maintenance. 

Our home designs are selected or prepared in each of our communities to appeal to the tastes and preferences of local homebuyers. We also offer optional interior and exterior features to allow homebuyers the opportunity to enhance the basic home design and to allow us to generate additional revenue from each home sold. Construction time for our homes depends on the weather, availability of labor, materials and supplies, size of the home, and other factors. We typically complete construction of a home within three to six months. 

We typically do not maintain significant inventories of land development or home construction materials, except for work in progress materials for homes under construction. Generally, the construction materials used in our operations are readily available from numerous sources. 

Marketing and Sales 

We market and sell our homes primarily through commissioned employees. A significant number of our home closings also involve an independent real estate broker representing the buyer. We typically conduct home sales from sales offices and/or furnished model homes in each community. Our sales personnel assist prospective homebuyers by providing floor plans and price information, demonstrating the features and layouts of model homes and assisting with the selection of options and other custom features. We train and inform our sales personnel on the availability of financing, construction schedules, and marketing and advertising plans. As market conditions warrant, to be competitive, we may provide potential homebuyers with one or more of a variety of incentives, including closing cost assistance, discounts and free upgrades. 

&#160;

We market our homes and communities to prospective homebuyers and real estate brokers through electronic media, including email, social networking sites and our company website, as well as brochures, flyers, newsletters and promotional events. We also use billboards, radio, magazine and newspaper advertising as necessary. We attempt to position our communities in locations that are desirable to potential homebuyers and convenient to or visible from local traffic patterns, which helps to reduce advertising costs. Model homes play a substantial role in our marketing efforts, and we expend significant effort and resources to create an attractive atmosphere in our model homes. 

We manage inventory to build a limited number of speculative homes in our communities. Speculative homes enhance our marketing and sales efforts to prospective homebuyers who are relocating to these markets, as well as to independent brokers, who often represent homebuyers requiring a home within a short time frame. We determine our speculative homes strategy based on local market factors, such as new job growth, the number of job relocations, housing demand and supply (including new homes), seasonality, current sales contract cancellation trends and our past experience in the local markets. We maintain a low level of speculative home inventory in each community based on our current and planned sales pace, and we monitor and adjust speculative home inventory on an ongoing basis as conditions warrant. Speculative homes help to provide us with opportunities to compete effectively with existing homes available in the market and improve our profits and returns on our inventory of owned lots. 

Quality Control 

We provide our single-family and townhouse home buyers with a one-year limited warranty covering workmanship and materials. The limited warranty is transferable to subsequent buyers not under direct contract with us and requires that all home buyers agree to the definitions and procedures set forth in the warranty. Typically, we provide our condominium home buyers with a two-year limited warranty, or as required by statute. In addition, we periodically provide structural warranty of longer durations pursuant to applicable statutory requirements. From time to time, we assess the appropriateness of our warranty reserves and adjust accruals as necessary. Based on historical experience and when deemed appropriate by us, we will accrue additional warranty reserves. We require our general contractors and sub-contractors to warrant the work they perform and they are contractually obligated to correct defects in their work that arise during the applicable warranty period. We seek to minimize our risk associated with warranty repairs through our quality assurance program and by selecting contractors with good reputations, sufficient resources and adequate insurance. It is typical that there is a gap in the warranty coverage provided by contractors and by home builders, which we have self-insured in the past. It is our experience that the warranty claims which we have self-insured have not been significant in nature, but we periodically obtain additional insurance to protect against this unquantifiable risk. 

Competition 

The real estate development industry is highly competitive. We compete primarily on the basis of price, location, design, quality, service and reputation. We compete with small private builders and large regional or national builders. In addition to competing for home buyers and renters, builders compete for construction financing, raw materials and skilled labor. Additionally, under normal market conditions, competition exists within the industry for prime development sites, especially those where developed building lots are available under option lot contracts. We compete with other local, regional and national builders in all of these areas. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, sales and marketing and other resources than we have. Some of the national builders that we compete against include Pulte Homes, DR Horton, Toll Brothers, CalAtlantic Homes, NVR, K. Hovnanian and Lennar. 

Competition among home builders and multi-family developers is often specific to product types being offered in a particular area. Often we do not find ourselves competing with the large national developers in the urban communities where we develop high-rise and mixed use products. This is primarily because most national builders tend to focus on a narrower range of products than what we offer. We believe this provides us with a distinct advantage in terms of attracting potential home buyers and renters in certain areas. We believe the factors that home buyers consider in deciding whether to purchase or rent from us include the product type, location, value quality, and reputation of the developer. We believe that our projects and product offerings compare favorably on these factors, and we continually strive to maintain our reputation of building quality products. 

Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters 

We are subject to various local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning zoning, building design, construction, density requirements and similar matters. We and our competitors may also be subject to periodic delays or may be precluded entirely from developing in certain communities due to building moratoriums or &#147;slow-growth&#148; or &#147;no-growth&#148; initiatives that could be implemented in the future in the states where we operate. Local and state governments also have broad discretion regarding the imposition of development fees for projects in their jurisdiction. 

&#160;

We and our competitors are also subject to a variety of local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning protection of the environment. Some of the laws to which we and our properties are subject to may impose requirements concerning development in waters of the United States, including wetlands, the closure of water supply wells, management of asbestos-containing materials, exposure to radon and similar issues. The particular environmental laws that apply to any given community vary based on several factors, including but not limited to the environmental conditions related to a particular property and the present and former uses of the property. These environmental laws may result in delays, may cause us and our competitors to incur substantial compliance related costs, and may prohibit or severely restrict development in certain environmentally sensitive areas. To date, environmental laws have not had a material adverse impact on our operations. 

Technology and Intellectual Property 

We utilize our technology infrastructure to facilitate marketing of our projects. Through our web site, www.comstockhomes.com, our customers and prospective customers receive automatic electronic communications from us on a regular basis. Our corporate marketing directors work with in-house marketing and technology specialists to develop advertising and public relations programs for each project that leverage our technology capabilities. During 2015, we continued utilization of media and internet based marketing platforms, primarily in lieu of print advertisements. We believe that the home buying population will continue to increase its reliance on information available on the internet to help guide its home buying decision. Accordingly, through our marketing efforts, we will continue to seek to leverage this trend to lower per sale marketing costs while maximizing potential sales. 

Our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, Christopher Clemente, has licensed his ownership interest in the &#147;Comstock&#148; brand and trademark to us in perpetuity and free of charge. We routinely take steps, and occasionally take legal action, to protect it against infringement from third parties. Mr. Clemente has retained the right to continue to use the &#147;Comstock&#148; brand and trademark including for real estate development projects in our current or future markets that are unrelated to the Company but excluding products developed as for sale homes. 

Although significant changes in market conditions have impacted our seasonal patterns in the past and could do so again in the future, we generally have more homes under construction, close more homes and have greater revenues and operating income in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. The seasonal activity increases our working capital requirements for our homebuilding operations during the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. As a result of seasonal activity, our quarterly results of operations and financial position at the end of a particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily representative of the balance of our fiscal year. 

Employees 

At December 31, 2015, we had 51 full-time and 3 part time employees. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreements and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We believe we have good relations with our employees.
