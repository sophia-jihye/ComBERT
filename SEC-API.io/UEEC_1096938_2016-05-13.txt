 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160;

Company Overview 

&#160;

United Health Products, Inc. ("United" or the "Company") develops, manufactures, and markets a patented hemostatic gauze for the healthcare and wound care sectors. The product HemoStyp, is derived from regenerated oxidized cellulose, which is all natural, and designed to absorb exudate/drainage from superficial wounds and helps control bleeding. The Company is focused on identifying new markets and applications for its product as well as ramping up sales in its current markets. The Company has received orders from the dental and medical markets and is pursuing multiple markets for HemoStyp, including the medical, sports, dental, military and veterinary sectors, each of which represents a multi-million dollar market. 

&#160;

&#160; Acquisition of Intellectual Property Rights 

&#160;

In June 2009, the Company acquired the intellectual property rights of Epic Wound Care, LLC, through its former wholly-owned subsidiary, Epic. The intellectual property includes the right to manufacture and distribute innovative gauze to serve the wound care market. The acquisition cost for the rights was 30 million shares of Company's common stock. The Company valued the rights acquired at $500,000 based upon the Company's expectation for commercialization of the rights less costs to effectuate applicable approvals. 

&#160;

Primary Strategy 

&#160;

The Company's gauze products are designed for the wound care market and manufactured to our specifications by a manufacturing agent in China. The gauze can be used on any wound where bleeding is present. Upon contact with moisture, the gauze forms a gel-like substance that acts as a hemostatic agent to address bleeding quickly. The hemostatic gauze derived from regenerated oxidized/cellulose, which is all natural and designed to absorb exudate/drainage from superficial wounds and helps to control bleeding. Once bleeding has ceased and coagulation has occurred, the product can be rinsed away with saline solution or lukewarm water. After acquiring the intellectual property rights, in 2009, we have devoted our time to obtaining necessary approvals to enable the hemostatic gauze product to be sold worldwide as well as attempting to establish an international distribution network. 

&#160;

In August 2012, the Company's manufacturing agent in China of its gauze products under the name HemoStyp, received 510(k) approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") to be sold as a Class I device. The Company has the ability to represent to distributors and customers that its gauze products meet all FDA requirements as a Class I device. This approval now allows us to expand our potential customer base and pursue accounts that requested a current 510(k) FDA approval, including the prescription based medical arena, retail, hospital, EMS, military, state and national governmental agencies and veterinary markets. Our gauze products can be used to stop nose bleeds and for post dialysis treatment and venipuncture. 

&#160;

The Company's strategy is to engage distributors to market the Company's gauze products to the various worldwide markets. The Company has an initial foundation for the distribution of its hemostatic gauze products by entering into agreements with our several distributors/partners (covering the dental, veterinarian, U.S. retail, U.S. military and worldwide equestrian markets and Australasia). In 2016, the Company is seeking to expand on this base and is seeking to enter the international dialysis market. No assurances can be given that the Company will be successful in expanding its distribution market on terms satisfactory to us, if at all.

&#160; &#160; &#160; Our HemoStyp Gauze Products 

&#160;

HemoStyp Hemostatic Gauze is a collagen-like natural substance created from chemically treated cellulose. It is an effective hemostatic agent registered with the FDA to help control bleeding from open wounds and body cavities. The HemoStyp hemostatic material contains no chemical additives, thrombin or collagen, and is hypoallergenic. When it comes in contact with blood it expands slightly and converts to an adhesive gel that subsequently dissolves into glucose and saline. Because of its purity and the fact it simply degradates to these end products, it does not cause significant delay in healing as do other hemostatic materials that may have a similar appearance. Our HemoStyp gauze products are sold in different sizes for use in superficial trauma cases. It is also sold as a dental gauze and as a nasal dressing. 

&#160;

HemoStyp Hemostatic Gauze is applied by simply folding the gauze once or twice, depending on the size of the wound, and then putting it as far into the wound as possible. Putting a bandage on top of the gauze is optional and in many cases unnecessary. On smaller cuts, it may be helpful to first cut the Gauze in half before applying it to the wound. When this is done, it may not be necessary to fold it first. Since EMS work is pre-hospital, rinsing the gauze out with saline or water is not necessary. This is because after the patient reaches the hospital, a wound will be debrided and possibly reopened prior to suturing. 

&#160;

The Company's hemostatic gauze product line includes various configurations. The Company's product line has been developed to address the specific needs of our market segments and our existing customers, including the U.S. military. The Company's hemostatic gauze product line now includes the following products: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Dental gauze for oral surgery; 

&#183; 

Four versions of Trauma Gauze&#8482; for battlefield trauma; and 

&#183; 

Two island dressings to support intravenous procedures. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; In August 2013, we entered into a consulting agreement with Douglas Beplate for the exclusive purpose of retaining his services to develop and market our hemostatic gauze products. In November 2013, our Board of Directors asked Mr. Beplate to become an executive officer of the Company, a position he accepted for the purpose of developing and expanding our business opportunities. As a result of Mr. Beplate's efforts, we have succeeded in obtaining distribution/partner agreements for the dental, veterinarian, equestrian and U.S. military and retail markets as well as Australasia. 

&#160;

Manufacturing and Packaging of our Products 

&#160;

On October 1, 2013, the Company entered into an Operating Agreement with Hemo Manufacturing LLC. Hemo Manufacturing is to act as the exclusive supplier of manufactured products for the Company's products. Hemo Manufacturing is responsible for overseeing quality control of products at our overseas (non-exclusive) manufacturer in China as well as the packaging and labeling of our products for distribution. Pursuant to said agreement, 2,000,000 restricted shares of the Company's Common Stock were issued upon execution of the agreement. Under certain conditions, an additional 2,000,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock would be issued in the event the Company is bought out by a third party. The Company anticipates booking all sales directly to customers and making payment for goods directly to Hemo Manufacturing. The managing member of Hemo Manufacturing will retain 100% of the profits earned by Hemo Manufacturing unless the Company is sold to a third party. In the event of such a sale, the managing member of Hemo Manufacturing and the Company would have equal share in the gross profits. The managing member of Hemo Manufacturing LLC owns 51% of this entity and the Company owns 49% of this entity. 

&#160;

Patents and Trademarks 

&#160;

In September 2012, the Company announced that its hemostatic gauze products were granted patent protection by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. However, if our intellectual property positions are challenged, invalidated, circumvented or expire, or if we fail to prevail in future intellectual property litigation, our business could be adversely affected. Our success depends in part on our ability to defend our intellectual property rights. The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. Third parties may seek to challenge, invalidate or circumvent our intellectual property rights. In addition, our patent positions might not protect us against competitors with similar products or technologies because competing products or technologies may not infringe our patents. Also, there are third parties who have patents or pending patent applications that they may claim necessitate payment of a royalty or prevent us from commercializing our patent in certain territories. Patent disputes are frequent, costly and can preclude, delay or increase the cost of commercialization of products. 

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The disposable medical supply market in the United States is dominated by large companies such as Baxter International, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Johnson &#38; Johnson and 3M Company. Our hemostatic gauze product will directly compete in the gauze markets dominated by these majors. However, the market for hemostatic products, which includes gauzes, gels, bandages and powders, is largely composed of smaller, privately-held companies with the exception of Johnson &#38; Johnson, which manufactures Surgicel &#210; . In this market, competitive factors include price, product offerings, value-added service programs, service and delivery, credit terms, and customer support. 

&#160;

Government Regulation 

&#160;

We are subject to oversight by various federal and state governmental entities and we are subject to, and affected by, a variety of federal and state laws, regulations and policies. 

&#160;

The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration ("DEA"), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") and various state regulatory authorities regulate the purchase, storage, and/or distribution of pharmaceutical products. The DEA, FDA and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers, including the ability to seize or recall products and impose significant criminal, civil and administrative sanctions for violations of applicable laws and regulations. As a wholesale distributor of pharmaceuticals and certain related products, we are subject to these laws and regulations. We have all necessary licenses or other regulatory approvals and believe that we are in compliance with all applicable pharmaceutical wholesale distribution requirements needed to conduct our operations. 

&#160;

&#160; &#160;

On April 29, 2010, the Company's then wholly-owned subsidiary, Epic Wound Care, Inc., submitted a Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market its hemostatic gauze as a Class III device to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA"). On August 3, 2010, the FDA sent Epic a notice that the application was insufficient to allow the FDA to make the determination. In August 2012, our non-affiliated manufacturing agent in China had its Section 510(k) pre-market notification approved as a Class I device as described herein. 

&#160;

In recent years, some states have passed or proposed laws and regulations that are intended to protect the safety of the pharmaceutical supply channel. These laws and regulations are designed to prevent the introduction of counterfeit, diverted, adulterated or mislabeled pharmaceuticals into the distribution system. In addition, the FDA Amendments Act of 2007 (the "2007 Act") requires the FDA to establish standards and identify and validate effective technologies for the purpose of securing the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs. These standards may include track-and-trace or authentication technologies, such as radio frequency identification devices and other technologies. The 2007 Act required the FDA to develop a standardized numerical identifier by April 1, 2010. 

&#160;

As a result of political, economic and regulatory influences, the healthcare delivery industry in the United States is under intense scrutiny and subject to fundamental changes. Although there was substantial Federal legislation enacted during 2010 that impacted our healthcare system in the United States, we expect that the administration, Congress and certain state legislatures will continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery systems and payment methods in order to reform the healthcare system. Thus, we cannot predict the impact on us of the 2010 legislation and/or additional regulation governing the delivery or pricing of healthcare products that may be passed. Nor can we predict the impact on us of potential changes to the structure of the present healthcare delivery system, if any, when they may be adopted. 

&#160;

The costs associated with complying with federal and state regulations could be significant and the failure to comply with any such legal requirements could have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition. 

&#160;

Environmental Matters 

&#160;

Our business activities are subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations relating to water, air, hazardous substances and wastes that may restrict or limit such business activities. Although the Company does not currently directly manufacture its own products, we may still be subject to existing environmental laws by way of regulatory agencies or other third party claimants. Examples of U.S. Federal environmental legislation that may have adverse effects on the Company include the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, Compensation and Liability Act (aka CERCLA or Superfund) and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. By no means do we certify this list as being complete, as there are many laws and regulations that exist or that may come to pass that we cannot foresee that may also have an impact on the Company. The multitude of regulations issued by federal, state, provincial and local administrative agencies can be burdensome and costly and we determined to change our business model as a result. There are currently no pending legal proceedings with any government regulatory agencies. 

&#160;

Research and Development Expenditures 

&#160;

In fiscal 2015 and 2014, we incurred $0 and $0, respectively, in research and development expenditures. 

&#160;

&#160; Employees 

&#160;
