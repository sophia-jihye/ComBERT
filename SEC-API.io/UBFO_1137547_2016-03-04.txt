 Item 1 - Business 

General 

United Security Bancshares (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is a California corporation incorporated during March of 2001 and is registered with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. The Company&#8217;s stock is listed on NASDAQ under the symbol &#8220;UBFO&#8221;. United Security Bank (the &#8220;Bank&#8221;) is a wholly-owned bank subsidiary of the Company and was formed in 1987. United Security Bancshares Capital Trust I (the &#8220;Trust&#8221;) was formed during June of 2001 as a Delaware business trust for the sole purpose of issuing Trust Preferred securities. The Trust was originally formed as a subsidiary of the Company, but was deconsolidated during 2004 pursuant to the adoption of ASC 810 (as revised), &#8220;Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities." During July 2007, the Trust Preferred Securities issued under USB Capital Trust I were redeemed, and upon retirement, the USB Capital Trust I was dissolved. During July 2007, the Company formed United Security Bancshares Capital Trust II and issued $15.0 million in Trust Preferred Securities with terms similar to those originally issued under USB Capital Trust I, except at a lower interest rate. During 2015, $3.0 million in Trust Preferred Securities were redeemed. At present, the Company does not engage in any material business activities other than ownership of the Bank. 

United Security Bank 

On June 12, 2001, the Bank became the wholly-owned subsidiary of United Security Bancshares through a tax-free holding company reorganization, accounted for on a basis similar to the pooling of interest method. In the transaction, each share of Bank stock was exchanged for a share of Company stock on a one-to-one basis. 

The Bank is a California state-chartered bank headquartered in Fresno, California. It is also a member of the Federal Reserve System (&#8220;Fed member&#8221;). The Bank originally commenced business on December 21, 1987, as a national bank and, during the fourth quarter of 1998, filed an application with the California Department of Financial Institutions and other regulatory authorities to become a state-chartered bank. The shareholders approved the conversion in January of 1999, and the Bank was granted approval to operate as a state-chartered bank on February 3, 1999. The Bank&#8217;s operations are currently subject to federal and state laws applicable to state-chartered, Fed member banks, and its deposits are insured up to the applicable limits by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The Bank is also subject to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and regulatory reporting requirements of the FDIC. As a state-chartered bank and a member of the Federal Reserve System, the Bank is subject to supervision and regular examinations by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB) and the California Department of Business Oversight (DBO). In addition, the Bank is required to file reports with the FRB and provide such additional information as the FRB may require. 

USB Investment Trust Inc. was incorporated effective December 31, 2001 as a special purpose real estate investment trust (REIT) under Maryland law. The REIT is a subsidiary of the Bank and was funded with $133.0 million in real estate-secured loans contributed by the Bank. USB Investment Trust was originally formed to give the Bank flexibility in raising capital, and reduce the expenses associated with holding the assets contributed to USB Investment Trust. For further discussion of the REIT, refer to Item 7 &#8211; Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Income Taxes. 

&#160; 

Effective April 23, 2004, the Company completed a merger with Taft National Bank headquartered in Taft, California. Taft National Bank (Taft) was merged into United Security Bank and Taft&#8217;s two branches, one located in Taft and the other located 

in Bakersfield, California, operate as branches of United Security Bank. This transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, and resulted in the purchase price being allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Taft based on the fair value of those assets and liabilities, with resultant goodwill of $1.6 million and core deposits intangibles of $1.9 million. Goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed at least annually for impairment, while core deposit intangibles were amortized over a period of 7 years. At the time of the merger, the Company sought opportunities to expand its market area to the south with the expectation that the Bakersfield area would have significant growth given its strategic location just north of Los Angeles. The Company has recorded no impairment on either the goodwill or core deposit intangible related to the Taft merger. 

On February 16, 2007, the Company completed its merger with Legacy Bank, N.A., located in Campbell, California, with the acquisition of 100 percent of Legacy&#8217;s outstanding common shares. At the time of the merger, Legacy Bank&#8217;s one branch was merged with and into United Security Bank, a subsidiary of the Company. The purchase of Legacy Bank provided the Company with an opportunity to expand its market area into Santa Clara County and to serve a growing small business niche and individual client base built by Legacy. The Company believes that as the economy continues to recover from the recent significant downturn, there will be increased opportunities to expand business within the greater Campbell area particularly in lending to small-to-medium sized businesses, The merger transaction was accounted for as a purchase transaction, and resulted in the purchase price being allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Legacy Bank based on the fair value of those assets and liabilities, with resultant goodwill of $8.8 million and core deposits intangibles of $1.9 million. Goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed at least annually for impairment, while core deposit intangibles are being amortized over a period of approximately 7 years. The Company recognized no impairment charges related to goodwill or core deposit intangibles related to the Legacy merger. 

At December 31, 2015 , the Bank operates three branches (including its main office), one construction lending office, and one financial services office in Fresno and one branch each, in Oakhurst, Caruthers, San Joaquin, Firebaugh, Coalinga, Bakersfield, Taft, and Campbell. In addition, the Company and Bank have administrative headquarters located at 2126 Inyo Street, Fresno, California, 93721. The Company operates as one operating segment. 

At December 31, 2015 and 2014 , the consolidated Company had total assets of approximately $725,644,000 , and $663,169,000 , respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , the Company reported net income of $6,810,000 , as compared to $6,216,000 &#32;for the year ended December 31, 2014 . At December 31, 2015 , the consolidated Company had approximately $505,663,000 &#32;in net loans, $621,805,000 &#32;in deposits, and $89,635,000 &#32;in shareholders' equity. 

The Company has increased loan growth over the last two years as the economy and real estate markets have improved. Total loans increased 16.35% between December 31, 2013 &#32;and December 31, 2014 , and increased an additional 13.17% &#32;between December 31, 2014 &#32;and December 31, 2015 . During the same periods, nonperforming assets increase d and related loan losses decreased. Nonperforming assets declined from $32,048,000 at December 31, 2013 , to $29,586,000 &#32;at December 31, 2014 , but increase d $2,508,000 &#32;to $32,094,000 &#32;at December 31, 2015 . Negative loan loss provisions totaled $1,098,000 for the year ended December 31, 2013. Negative provisions were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2014 , and December 31, 2015 , of $845,000 &#32;and $41,000 , respectively. Over the past few years, housing starts have increased and housing prices in the Company&#8217;s market area have improved. Unemployment and other economic factors continue to strengthen. As a result, Management&#8217;s focus over the past year, has been to concentrate its efforts on developing new business and growing the loan portfolio. Lending policies and procedures have been enhanced, and loan modifications, including rate and maturity concessions, and forbearance agreements, continue to be utilized in order to minimize loss exposure in the loan portfolio. 

&#160; 

While loan growth prior to 2007 was funded to some degree by brokered deposits and other wholesale funding sources, the current state of the economy and the financial condition of the Company have made it increasingly important to continue to develop core deposits and reduce the Company&#8217;s dependence on brokered and other wholesale funding sources, including lines of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank and the FHLB. The Company increased its efforts early in 2009 to develop core deposit growth with employee training throughout the entire organization and a deposit-gathering program that incented employees to bring in new deposits from our local market area and establish more extensive relationships with our customers. As a result, the Bank has reduced its dependence on wholesale funding sources, including brokered deposits, to a level more in-line with peers. 

&#160; 

The Company's percentage of brokered deposits are now in line with peers. Total brokered deposits decrease d from $11,480,000 &#32;at December 31, 2014 , to $8,546,000 &#32;at December 31, 2015 , representing a decrease of $2,934,000 . Despite additions to the loan portfolio and securities purchases, the Company has enhanced its liquidity positions with an increase in fed funds sold and other overnight investments of $82,229,000 &#32;at December 31, 2014 &#32;to $96,018,000 &#32;at December 31, 2015 . 

The following discussion of the Company's services should be read in conjunction with "MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS." 

Bank Services 

As a state-chartered commercial bank, United Security Bank offers a full range of commercial banking services primarily to the business and professional community and individuals located in Fresno, Madera, Kern, and Santa Clara Counties. 

The Bank offers a wide range of deposit instruments including personal and business checking accounts and savings accounts, interest-bearing negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW) accounts, money market accounts and time certificates of deposit. Most of the Bank's deposits are comprised of accounts from individuals and from small and medium-sized business-related sources. Time deposits have provided a significant portion of the Bank&#8217;s deposit base amounting to 11.12% &#32;and 13.82% &#32;of total deposits at December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively. A portion of those time deposits are brokered deposits which are considered wholesale funding sources generally from out of the Bank&#8217;s market area. Brokered deposits comprised 1.37% &#32;and 2.03% &#32;of total deposits at December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively. 

The Bank also engages in a full complement of lending activities, including real estate mortgage ( 48.9% &#32;of total loans at December 31, 2015 ), commercial and industrial ( 10.8% &#32;of total loans at December 31, 2015 ), real estate construction ( 25.3% &#32;of total loans at December 31, 2015 ), as well as agricultural ( 10.1% &#32;of total loans at December 31, 2015 ), and installment loans ( 4.9% &#32;of total loans at December 31, 2015 ), with particular emphasis on short and medium-term obligations. Approximately 77% of the Bank's loans are secured by real estate at December 31, 2015 . A loan may be secured (in whole or in part) by real estate even though the purpose of the loan is not to facilitate the purchase or development of real estate. At December 31, 2015 , the Bank had loans (net of unearned fees) outstanding of $515,376,000 , which represented approximately 82.9% &#32;of the Bank's total deposits and approximately 71.0% &#32;of its total assets. 

&#160; 

Real estate mortgage loans are secured by deeds of trust primarily on commercial property. Repayment of real estate mortgage loans is generally from the cash flow of the borrower. Commercial and industrial loans have a high degree of industry diversification. Loans may be originated in the Company&#8217;s market area, or participated with other financial institutions outside the Company&#8217;s market area. A substantial portion of the Company&#8217;s commercial and industrial loans are secured by accounts receivable, inventory, leases or other collateral. The remainder are unsecured. However, extensions of credit are predicated on the financial capacity of the borrower to repay. Repayment of commercial loans is generally from the cash flow of the borrower. Real estate construction loans consist of loans to residential contractors, which are secured by single-family residential properties. All real estate loans have established equity requirements. Repayment of real estate construction loans is generally from long-term mortgages with other lending institutions. Agricultural loans are generally secured by land, equipment, inventory and receivables. Repayment of agricultural loans is generally from the expected cash flow of the borrower. 

Although the Bank has a high concentration of commercial real estate loans, the Bank is not in the business of making residential mortgage loans to individuals. Residential mortgage loans totaled $68,811,000 &#32;or 13.35% &#32;of the portfolio at December 31, 2015 . The residential mortgage loan portfolio is comprised of purchased residential mortgage pools. The Bank does not originate, or have in its loans portfolio, any subprime, Alt-A, or option adjustable rate loans. The Bank does originate interest-only loans which are generally revolving lines of credit to commercial and agricultural businesses or for real estate development where the borrowers business may be seasonal or cash flows may be restricted until the completion of the project. In addition, the Bank has restructured certain loans to allow the borrower to continue to perform on the loan under a troubled debt restructuring plan. 

The Bank purchases loan participations from, and sells loan participations to, other financial institutions. The underwriting standards for loan participations or purchases are the same as non-participated loans, and are subject to the same limitations, collateral requirements, and borrower requirements. The Bank has reduced its level of loan participations over the past several years. Currently, the Bank holds no participation purchased loans. Loan participations sold comprised 5.6% &#32;and 1.4% &#32;of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively. During the past year, participation lending activity has increased and currently the Company is participating in more participation sales. 

In the normal course of business, the Bank makes various loan commitments and incurs certain contingent liabilities. At December 31, 2015 and 2014 , loan commitments of the Bank totaled $107,084,000 &#32;and $105,434,000 , respectively, and letters of credit totaled $3,295,000 &#32;and $3,800,000 , respectively. Of the $110,379,000 &#32;in total commitments outstanding at December 31, 2015 , $15,989,000, or 14.5%, were for loans with maturities of one year or less. Due to the nature of the business of the Bank's customers, there are no seasonal patterns or absolute predictability to the utilization of unused loan commitments; therefore, the Bank is unable to forecast the extent to which these commitments will be exercised within the 

current year. The Bank does not believe that any such utilization will constitute a material liquidity demand. The Company does however have collateralized and uncollateralized lines of credit which could be utilized if such loan commitments were to be exercised in excess of normal expectations. 

In addition to the loan and deposit services discussed above, the Bank also offers a wide range of specialized services designed to attract and service the needs of commercial customers and account holders. These services include online banking, mobile banking, safe deposit boxes, ATM services, payroll direct deposit, cashier's checks, traveler's checks, money orders, and foreign drafts. In addition, the Bank offers a variety of specialized financial services, including wealth management, employee benefit, insurance and loan products, as well as consulting services for a variety of clients. The Bank does not operate a trust department; however, it makes arrangements with its correspondent bank to offer trust services to its customers upon request. Most of the Bank's business originates within Fresno, Madera, Kern, and Santa Clara Counties. Neither the Bank&#8217;s business nor liquidity are seasonal, and there has been no material effect upon the Bank's capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position as a result of federal, state or local environmental regulation. 

Lending Policies 

The following is a summary of the Bank&#8217;s loan policies. 

&#9642; 

Loan Documentation &#8211; All loan documentation is prepared by a centralized loan servicing department or by legal counsel based on the terms contained in the approved Credit Authorizations. The documentation, upon completion, is reviewed by a third party (Bank employee) in the loan servicing department prior to forwarding to the relationship managers, who then review the documents to ensure that they have been correctly prepared in accordance with the credit approval before execution by the borrowers. 

&#9642; 

Purchased Participations &#8211; The Bank independently underwrites, using the Bank&#8217;s same guidelines for direct originations, and reviews the loan documentation of participation loans originated by other lenders for acceptability. 

&#9642; 

Verification of Information &#8211; The Bank, principally a commercial business lender, has not and does not make any &#8220;No Doc&#8221; or &#8220;Stated Income&#8221; loans. In the underwriting of a commercial loan request, the Bank performs an enterprise analysis of the financial information for trends, verifies major assets and liabilities, and obtains Dun and Bradstreet Credit reports on the entities and credit bureau reports on the principals of the entity. 

&#9642; 

The Company is not dependent on any individual customer, entity, or group of related entities for deposits nor on any significant percentage of loans to borrowers. 

&#9642; 

Unsecured - Whether unsecured or secured, guarantees are usually obtained from the principals or from 3 rd &#32;party guarantors if necessary for additional financial support. Unsecured loans totaled $35,626,000 and $46,982,000 at December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively. 

&#9642; 

Historic policy on renewals - The renewal or extension of existing performing lines of credit or loans has not been changed; the credits are re-underwritten for the renewal period. The restructure or renewal of substandard loans is certified to the Board of Directors that the renewal is necessary to improve and protect the Bank&#8217;s ultimate interest in the collection of the credit or maximize its potential for collection, that the renewal reflects prudent underwriting based on reasonable repayment terms and is adequately secured, that the Bank has performed a comprehensive credit analysis indicating the borrower has the willingness and ability to repay the debt as per the terms of the restructure plan and that the Bank&#8217;s Loan Committee, designated by the Board, believes that the renewal will be repaid in accordance with the terms. 

&#9642; 

Additional Loans to nonaccrual borrowers. &#8211; The Bank as a general rule does not make additional loans to borrowers that are past due in principal or interest more than 90-days. However, in selected and limited instances as part of the workout or restructure of non-performing assets, to effect repayment, additional secured advances may be made. 

&#9642; 

Lending Limits &#8211; The Bank approves revolving lines of credit or loans for each borrower with terms and limits. Consideration is given for the aggregate direct borrowing exposure of the borrower, as well as, their indirect liability, plus the indirect liability of any guarantor. Overall, the Bank has established normal &#8220;House&#8221; lending limits at 50% of the Legal Lending Limit. The Legal Lending Limit is calculated for unsecured loans at 15% of total regulatory capital, and for secured loans at 25% of total regulatory capital. The Board of Directors must approve any borrowing relationship that exceeds the House Lending Limit. 

&#160; 

Competition and Market Share 

The banking business in California generally, and in the market area served by the Company specifically, is highly competitive with respect to both loans and deposits. The Company competes for loans and deposits with other commercial banks, savings 

and loan associations, finance companies, money market funds, credit unions and other financial institutions, including a number that are substantially larger than the Company. Deregulation of the banking industry, increased competition from non-bank entities for the cash balances of individuals and businesses, and continuing developments in the computer and communications industries have had, and most likely will continue to have, a significant impact on the Company's competitive position. With the enactment of interstate banking legislation in California, bank holding companies headquartered outside of California will continue to enter the California market and provide competition for the Company. Additionally, with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, traditional competitive barriers between insurance companies, securities underwriters, and commercial banks have been eased, allowing a greater number of financial intermediaries to offer a wider assortment of financial services. Many of the major commercial banks operating in the Company's market areas offer certain services such as trust and international banking services, which the Company does not offer directly. In addition, banks with larger capitalization have larger lending limits and are thereby able to serve larger customers. 

The Company&#8217;s primary market area at December 31, 2015 &#32;was located in Fresno, Madera, and Kern Counties, in which approximately 30 FDIC-insured financial institutions compete for business. Santa Clara County was added during February 2007, with the Legacy Bank acquisition, in which approximately 50 FDIC-insured financial institutions compete for business. The following table sets forth information regarding deposit market share and ranking by county as of June 30, 2015, which is the most current information available.

Supervision and Regulation 

General 

The Company and the Bank are subject to significant regulation and restrictions by federal and state laws and regulatory agencies. This regulation is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the deposit insurance fund, and secondarily for the stability of the U.S. banking system. It is not intended for the benefit of shareholders of financial institutions. The following discussion of statutes and regulations is a summary and does not purport to be complete nor does it address all applicable statutes and regulations. This discussion is also qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text and to the implementation and enforcement of the statutes and regulations referred to in this discussion. 

The Company 

&#160; 

The Company is a bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the &#8220;BHC Act&#8221;), and is registered as such with the FRB. A bank holding company is required to file annual reports with the FRB regarding its business operations and those of its subsidiaries. The Company is also subject to examination by the FRB. 

The BHC Act requires, among other things, prior approval before acquiring, directly or indirectly, ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank, if after such acquisition it would directly or indirectly own or control more than 5% of the voting stock of that bank, unless it already owns a majority of the voting stock of that bank. The BHC Act also provides that the FRB shall not approve any acquisition that would result in or further the creation of a monopoly, or the effect of which may be substantially to lessen competition, unless the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed by the probable effect in meeting the convenience and needs of the community served. 

Furthermore, under the BHC Act, a bank holding company is, with limited exceptions, prohibited from (i) acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company which is not a bank or (ii) engaging in any activity other than managing or controlling banks. With the prior approval of the FRB, however, a bank holding company may own shares of a company engaged in activities which the FRB has determined to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be proper incident thereto. Amendments to the BHC Act expand the circumstances under which a bank holding company may acquire control of all or substantially all of the assets of a bank located outside the State of California. 

The Company is a legal entity, separate and distinct from the Bank. The Company has the ability to raise capital on its own behalf or borrow from external sources. The Company may also obtain additional funds from dividends paid by, and fees charged for services provided to, the Bank. Those dividends may come from funds legally available for those dividends, as specified and limited by the California Financial Code. If the Bank&#8217;s regulatory authorities determine that the Bank&#8217;s capital is not adequate or that the payment of the dividend would be unsafe or unsound, the regulatory authorities may order the Bank not to pay or reduce the amount of the dividend. 

Moreover, the BHC Act requires a bank holding company to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks. It is the FRB&#8217;s policy that a bank holding company should stand ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress and should maintain the financial flexibility and capital raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting a subsidiary bank. Under certain conditions, the FRB may conclude that certain actions of a bank holding company, such as payment of cash dividends to its shareholders, or the receipt of dividends from its subsidiary bank, would constitute unsafe and unsound banking practices because they violate the FRB&#8217;s &#8220;source of strength&#8221; doctrine. 

A bank holding company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from certain tie-in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit, sale or lease of property or furnishing of services. For example, with certain exceptions, a bank may not condition an extension of credit on a promise by its customer to obtain other services by it, its holding company or other subsidiaries, or on a promise by its customer not to obtain services from a competitor. In addition, federal law imposes certain restrictions between the Company and its subsidiaries, including the Bank. As an affiliate of the Bank, the Company is subject, with certain exceptions, to provisions of federal law imposing limitations on, and requiring collateral for, extensions of credit by the Bank to its affiliates. 

As a public company, United Security Bancshares is subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act amends the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, and is intended to protect investors by, among other things, improving the reliability of financial reporting, increasing management accountability, and increasing the independence of Directors and the Company&#8217;s external accountants. 

The Company is subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which include but are not limited to the filing of annual, quarterly and other current reports with the SEC. 

&#160; 

The Bank 

The Bank as a state-chartered bank and a member of the Federal Reserve, is subject to regulation, supervision and regular examination by the FRB, the California Department of Business Oversight (the &#8220;DBO&#8221;) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the &#8220;CFPB&#8221;). The Bank is subject to California laws, insofar as they are not preempted by federal banking law. Deposits of the Bank are insured by the FDIC up to the applicable limits in an amount up to $250,000 per customer and, as such, the Bank is subject the applicable provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and the regulations of the FDIC. As a consequence of the extensive regulation of commercial banking activities in California and the United States, the Bank&#8217;s business is particularly susceptible to changes in California and federal legislation and regulation, which may have the effect of increasing the cost of doing business, limiting permissible activities or increasing competition. 

&#160; 

Various other requirements and restrictions under the laws of the United States and the State of California affect the operations of the Bank. Federal and California statutes and regulations relate to many aspects of the Bank&#8217;s operations, including capital requirements and disclosure requirements to depositors and borrowers, requirements to maintain reserves against deposits, limitations on interest rates payable on deposits, loans, investments, and restrictions on borrowings and on payment of dividends. The DBO regulates the number and location of branch offices of a state-chartered bank, and may permit a bank to maintain branches only to the extent allowable under state law for state banks. California law presently permits a bank to locate a branch in any locality in the state. Additionally, California law exempts banks from California usury laws. 

Capital Standards &#160; 

The Company is subject to consolidated regulatory capital requirements administered by the FRB and the Bank is subject to similar capital requirements also administered by the FRB. The Dodd&#8209;Frank Act applied the same leverage and risk&#8209;based capital requirements that apply to insured depository institutions to bank holding companies, such as the Company. The guidelines of the FRB and the other federal banking agencies are intended to ensure that banking organizations have adequate capital given the risk levels of assets and off&#8209;balance sheet financial instruments. 

General Risk Based Capital Rules 

Prior to January 1, 2015, the FRB risk-based capital guidelines were based upon the 1988 Capital Accord (&#8220;Basel I&#8221;) of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the &#8220;Basel Committee&#8221;). The Basel Committee is a committee of central banks and bank supervisors/regulators from the major industrialized countries that develops broad policy guidelines that each country&#8217;s supervisors can use to determine the supervisory policies that apply. 

Under the general risk-based capital rules, applicable through December 31, 2014, banking organizations were required to maintain minimum ratios of Tier 1 capital and total capital to total risk&#8209;weighted assets (including certain off&#8209;balance sheet items, such as letters of credit). For purposes of calculating the ratios, a banking organization&#8217;s assets and some of its specified off&#8209;balance sheet commitments and obligations are assigned to various risk categories. A depository institution&#8217;s or holding company&#8217;s capital, in turn, is classified in one of two tiers relevant to us, depending on type: 

Core Capital (Tier 1). Tier 1 capital includes common equity, retained earnings, qualifying non&#8209;cumulative perpetual preferred stock, a limited amount of qualifying cumulative perpetual stock at the holding company level, minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, and qualifying trust preferred securities (subject to phase&#8209;out as described under &#8220;- Basel III Capital Rules &#8221; below) minus goodwill, most intangible assets and certain other assets. 

Supplementary Capital (Tier 2). Tier 2 capital includes, among other things, perpetual preferred stock and trust preferred securities not meeting the Tier 1 definition, qualifying mandatory convertible debt securities, qualifying subordinated debt, and allowances for possible credit losses, subject to limitations. 

As a bank holding company, the Company currently was required to maintain Tier 1 capital and total capital equal to at least 4.0% and 8.0%, respectively, of its total risk&#8209;weighted assets (including various off&#8209;balance sheet items, such as letters of credit). The Bank was required to maintain equivalent capital levels under the FDIC&#8217;s capital adequacy guidelines. In addition, as a depository institution, the Bank is subject to minimum capital ratios under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action discussed under &#8220;- Prompt Corrective Action .&#8221; 

The Company and the Bank are also required to comply with minimum leverage ratio requirements. The leverage ratio is the ratio of a banking organization&#8217;s Tier 1 capital to its total adjusted quarterly average assets (as defined for regulatory purposes). Bank holding companies and FRB&#8209;supervised banks, such as the Company and the Bank, are required to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%, unless a different minimum is specified by an appropriate regulatory authority. In addition, for a depository institution to be considered &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, its leverage ratio must be at least 5.0%. 

Regulatory capital requirements limit the amount of deferred tax assets that may be included when determining the amount of regulatory capital. Deferred tax asset amounts in excess of the calculated limit are deducted from regulatory capital. 

The Company issued subordinated debentures to trusts that were established by us which, in turn, issued trust preferred securities. The Company includes in Tier 1 capital an amount of trust preferred securities equal to no more than 25% of the sum of all core capital elements, which is generally defined as shareholders&#8217; equity less goodwill, net of any related deferred income tax liability. At December 31, 2015 , the amount of trust preferred securities included in Tier I capital was $7,836,000. 

Basel III Capital Rules 

In July 2013, the FRB and the other federal banking regulators approved final rules (the &#8220;New Capital Rules&#8221;) establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations. The New Capital Rules generally implement the Basel Committee&#8217;s December 2010 final capital framework referred to as &#8220;Basel III&#8221; for strengthening international capital standards. The New Capital Rules substantially revise the risk&#8209;based capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and their depository institution subsidiaries, including the Company and the Bank, as compared to the current U.S. general risk&#8209;based capital rules. The New Capital Rules revise the definitions and the components of regulatory capital, as well as address other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions&#8217; regulatory capital ratio calculations. The New Capital Rules also address asset risk weights and other matters affecting the denominator in banking institutions&#8217; regulatory capital ratio calculations and replace the existing general risk&#8209;weighting approach, which was derived from the Basel Committee&#8217;s 1988 &#8220;Basel I&#8221; capital accords, with a more risk&#8209;sensitive approach based, in part, on the &#8220;standardized approach&#8221; in the Basel Committee&#8217;s 2004 &#8220;Basel II&#8221; capital accords. The New Capital Rules also implement the requirements of Section 939A of the Dodd&#8209;Frank Act to remove references to credit ratings from the federal regulators&#8217; rules. The New Capital Rules were effective for the Company and the Bank as of January 1, 2015, subject to phase&#8209;in periods for certain of their components and other provisions. 

The New Capital Rules, among other things: (i) introduce a new capital measure called Common Equity Tier 1 (&#8220;CET1&#8221;) and related regulatory capital ratio of CET1 to risk&#8209;weighted assets; (ii) specify that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and &#8220;Additional Tier 1 capital&#8221; instruments meeting certain revised requirements; (iii) mandate that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital; and (iv) expand the scope of the deductions from and adjustments to capital as compared to existing regulations. Under the New Capital Rules, for most banking organizations the most common form of Additional Tier 1 capital is non&#8209;cumulative perpetual preferred stock and the most common form of Tier 2 capital is subordinated notes and a portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses, in each case, subject to the New Capital Rules&#8217; specific requirements. 

Pursuant to the New Capital Rules, the minimum capital ratios as of January 1, 2015 are as follows: 

&#9632; 4.5% CET1 to risk&#8209;weighted assets; 

&#9632; 6.0% Tier 1 capital (that is, CET1 plus &#32;Additional Tier 1 capital) to risk&#8209;weighted assets; 

&#9632; 8.0% Total capital (that is, Tier 1 capital plus &#32;Tier 2 capital) to risk&#8209;weighted assets; and 

&#9632; 4% Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets as reported on regulatory financial statements (known as the &#8220;leverage ratio&#8221;). 

The New Capital Rules also introduce a new &#8220;capital conservation buffer,&#8221; composed entirely of CET1, on top of these minimum risk&#8209;weighted asset ratios. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk&#8209;weighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 at a 0.625% level and increase by 0.625% on each subsequent January 1st, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019. When fully phased&#8209;in, the Company and the Bank will be required to maintain such additional capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of CET1, effectively resulting in minimum ratios of: (i) CET1 to risk&#8209;weighted assets of at least 7%; (ii) Tier 1 capital to risk&#8209;weighted assets of at least 8.5%; and (iii) Total capital to risk&#8209;weighted assets of at least 10.5%. 

The New Capital Rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks and significant investments in non&#8209;consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such items, in the aggregate, exceed 15% of CET1. 

In addition, under the current general risk&#8209;based capital rules, the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss (&#8220;AOCI&#8221;) items included in shareholders&#8217; equity (for example, unrealized gains and losses of securities held in the available-for-sale portfolio) under U.S. GAAP are reversed for the purposes of determining regulatory capital ratios. Pursuant to the New Capital Rules, the effects of certain AOCI items are not excluded; however, non&#8209;advanced approaches banking organizations, including the Company and the Bank, were able to make a one&#8209;time permanent election to continue to exclude these items in order to avoid significant variations in the level of capital depending upon the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the fair value of our securities portfolio. 

Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 commenced on January 1, 2015 and will be phased&#8209;in over a 4&#8209;year period (beginning at 40% on January 1, 2015 and an additional 20% per year thereafter). 

The New Capital Rules prescribe a new standardized approach for risk weightings that expand the risk&#8209;weighting categories from the previous four Basel I&#8209;derived categories (0%, 20%, 50% and 100%) to a larger and more risk&#8209;sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the assets, generally ranging from 0% for U.S. government and agency securities, to 600% for certain equity exposures, resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset classes. 

We are continuing to evaluate the impact of the New Capital Rules on our capital ratios and related calculations and believe that, as of December 31, 2015 , the Company and the Bank were "well-capitalized" under the New Capital Rules. The regulatory capital guidelines as well as the actual capitalization for the Bank and the Company as of December 31, 2015 &#32;are as follows:

Liquidity Requirements &#32; 

Historically, regulation and monitoring of bank and bank holding company liquidity has been addressed as a supervisory matter, both in the U.S. and internationally, without required formulaic measures. The Basel III framework requires banks and bank holding companies to measure their liquidity against specific liquidity tests that, although similar in some respects to liquidity measures historically applied by banks and regulators for management and supervisory purposes, going forward will be required by regulation. One test, referred to as the liquidity coverage ratio (&#8220;LCR&#8221;), is designed to ensure that the banking entity maintains an adequate level of unencumbered high&#8209;quality liquid assets equal to the entity&#8217;s expected net cash outflow for a 30&#8209;day time horizon (or, if greater, then 25% of its expected total cash outflow) under an acute liquidity stress scenario. The other test, referred to as the net stable funding ratio (&#8220;NSFR&#8221;), is designed to promote more medium&#8209; and long&#8209;term funding of the assets and activities of banking entities over a one&#8209;year time horizon. These requirements will incentivize banking entities to increase their holdings of U.S. Treasury securities and other sovereign debt as a component of assets and increase the use of long&#8209;term debt as a funding source. 

In September 2014, the federal banking agencies approved final rules implementing the LCR for advanced approaches banking organizations (i.e., banking organizations with $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets or $10 billion or more in total on-balance sheet foreign exposure) and a modified version of the LCR for bank holding companies with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets that are not advanced approach banking organizations, neither of which apply to the Company or the Bank. The federal banking agencies have not yet proposed rules to implement the NSFR. 

Prompt Corrective Action 

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (&#8220;FDICIA&#8221;) requires each federal banking agency to take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of insured depository institutions, including but not limited to those that fall below one or more prescribed minimum capital ratios. Pursuant to FDICIA, the FRB promulgated regulations defining the following five categories in which an insured depository institution will be placed, based on the level of its capital ratios: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. A bank&#8217;s category is determined solely for the purpose of applying prompt corrective action regulations, and the capital category may not constitute an accurate representation of the bank&#8217;s overall financial condition or prospects for other purposes. 

Under the prompt corrective action provisions of FDICIA (&#8220;PCA&#8221;), an insured depository institution generally will be classified as undercapitalized if its total risk&#8209;based capital is less than 8% or its Tier 1 risk&#8209;based capital or leverage ratio is less than 4%. The New Capital Rules revised the PCA regulations by: (i) introducing a CET1 ratio requirement at each PCA category (other than critically undercapitalized), with the required CET1 ratio being 6.5% for well capitalized status; (ii) increasing the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirement for each category, with the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio for well capitalized status being 8% (as compared to the current 6%); and (iii) eliminating the current provision that provides that a bank with a composite supervisory rating of 1 may have a 3% leverage ratio and still be adequately capitalized (under the New Capital Rules a 5% leverage ratio is required for an institution to be well capitalized and a 4% leverage ratio is required to be adequately capitalized). The New Capital Rules do not change the total risk&#8209;based capital requirement for any PCA category. An institution that, based upon its capital levels, is classified as &#8220;well capitalized&#8221;, &#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221; or &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221; may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or an unsafe or unsound practice warrants such treatment. At each successive lower capital category, an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions and prohibitions, including restrictions on growth, restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, prohibitions on payment of dividends and restrictions on the acceptance of brokered deposits. Furthermore, if a bank is classified in one of the undercapitalized categories, it is required to submit a capital restoration plan to its federal bank regulator, and the holding company must guarantee the performance of that plan. The obligation of a controlling bank holding company to fund a capital restoration plan is limited to the lower of 5% of an undercapitalized subsidiary&#8217;s assets or the amount required to meet regulatory capital requirements. 

In addition to measures taken under the prompt corrective action provisions, commercial banking organizations, such as the Bank, may be subject to potential enforcement actions by the federal or state banking agencies for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses or for violations of any law, rule, regulation or any condition imposed in writing by the agency or any written agreement with the agency. Enforcement actions may include the imposition of a conservator or receiver, the issuance of a cease&#8209;and&#8209;desist order that can be judicially enforced, the termination of insurance for deposits (in the case of a depository institution), the imposition of civil money penalties, the issuance of directives to increase capital, the issuance of formal and informal agreements, the issuance of removal and prohibition orders against institution&#8209;affiliated parties. The enforcement of such actions through injunctions or restraining orders may be based upon a judicial determination that the agency would be harmed if such equitable relief was not granted. 

&#160; 

Premiums for Deposit Insurance. &#160; The deposit insurance fund of the FDIC insures our customers&#8217; deposits up to prescribed limits for each depositor. 

In October 2010, the FDIC under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;) adopted a new restoration plan to ensure that the deposit insurance fund (the &#8220;DIF&#8221;) reserve ratio reaches 1.35% by September 30, 2020. At least semi-annually, the FDIC will update its loss and income projections for the DIF and, if needed, increase or decrease assessment rates. On February 7, 2011, the FDIC adopted a final rule modifying the risk-based assessment system from a domestic deposit base to a scorecard based assessment system, effective April 1, 2011. Effective as of April 1, 2011, the Bank was categorized as a small institution as the Bank has less than $10 billion in assets. The initial base assessment rates range from five to 35 basis points. After potential adjustments related to unsecured debt and brokered deposit balances, the final total assessment rates range from 2.5 to 45 basis points. Initial base assessment rates for small institutions ranged from five to 35 basis points. The Bank&#8217;s assessment rate for 2011 fell at the high end of this range. Any material increase in assessments or the assessment rate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, depending on the amount of the increase. Furthermore, the FDIC is authorized to raise insurance premiums under certain circumstances. 

&#160; 

The Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 (the &#8220;Reform Act&#8221;) increased the deposit insurance limit for certain retirement plan deposit accounts from $100,000 to $250,000 and the Dodd-Frank Act permanently raised the current standard maximum federal deposit insurance amount from $100,000 to $250,000 per qualified account. 

&#160; 

The FDIC is authorized to terminate a depository institution&#8217;s deposit insurance upon a finding by the FDIC that the institution&#8217;s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule, regulation, order or condition enacted or imposed by the institution&#8217;s regulatory agency. The termination of deposit insurance would result in the forced closure of the Bank would have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Federal Home Loan Bank System. &#32;The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (the &#8220;FHLB-SF&#8221;). Among other benefits, each Federal Home Loan Bank (&#8220;FHLB&#8221;) serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region. Each FHLB is financed primarily from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB system. Each FHLB makes available loans or advances to its members in compliance with the policies and procedures established by the Board of Directors of the individual FHLB. The FHLB-SF utilizes a single class of stock with a par value of $100 per share, which may be issued, exchanged, redeemed and repurchased only at par value. As an FHLB member, the Bank is required to own FHLB &#8211;SF capital stock in an amount equal to the greater of: 

&#9632; a membership stock requirement with an initial cap of $25 million (100% of &#8220;membership asset value&#8221; as defined), or 

&#9632; an activity based stock requirement (based on percentage of outstanding advances). 

The FHLB &#8211; SF capital stock is redeemable on five years written notice, subject to certain conditions. At December 31, 2015 &#32;the Bank owned 22,214 shares of the FHLB-SF capital stock. 

Federal Reserve. &#32;The FRB requires all depository institutions to maintain non-interest bearing reserves at specified levels against their transaction accounts and non-personal time deposits. At December 31, 2015 , the Bank was in compliance with these requirements. 

Regulatory Agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco 

On March 23, 2010, the Company and the Bank entered into a formal written agreement (the &#8220;Agreement&#8221;) with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (the &#8220;Federal Reserve&#8221;) as a result of a regulatory examination that was conducted by the Federal Reserve and the California Department of Financial Institutions (now the Department of Business Oversight, or &#8220;DBO&#8221;) in June 2009. That examination found significant increases in nonperforming assets, both classified loans and OREO, during 2008 and 2009, and heightened concerns about the Bank&#8217;s use of brokered and other wholesale funding sources to fund loan growth, which created increased risk to equity capital and potential volatility in earnings. 

&#160; 

Under the terms of the Agreement, the Company and the Bank agreed, among other things: to maintain a sound process for determining, documenting, and recording an adequate allowance for loan and lease losses; to improve the management of the Bank's liquidity position and funds management policies; to maintain sufficient capital at the Company and Bank level; and to improve the Bank&#8217;s earnings and overall condition. The Company and Bank also agreed not to increase or guarantee any debt, purchase or redeem any shares of stock, declare or pay any cash dividends, or pay interest on the Company's junior subordinated debt or trust preferred securities, without prior written approval from the Federal Reserve. The Company generates no revenue of its own and, as such, relies on dividends from the Bank to pay its operating expenses and interest payments on the Company&#8217;s junior subordinated debt. 

Effective November 19, 2014, the Federal Reserve terminated the Agreement with the Bank and the Company and replaced it with an informal supervisory agreement that requires, among other things, obtaining written approval from the Federal Reserve prior to the payment of dividends from the Bank to the Company or the payment of dividends by the Company or interest on the Company&#8217;s junior subordinated debt. The inability of the Bank to pay cash dividends to the Company may hinder the Company&#8217;s ability to meet its ongoing operating obligations. 

Regulatory Order from the California Department of Business Oversight 

On May 20, 2010, the DBO issued a formal written order (the &#8220;Order&#8221;) pursuant to a consent agreement with the Bank as a result of the same June 2009 joint regulatory examination. The terms of the Order were essentially similar to the Federal Reserve&#8217;s Agreement, except for a few additional requirements. 

On September 24, 2013, the Bank entered into an informal Memorandum of Understanding (the &#8220;MOU&#8221;) with the DBO and on October 15, 2013, the Order was terminated. The Order and the MOU require the Bank to maintain a ratio of tangible shareholder&#8217;s equity to total tangible assets equal to or greater than 9.0% and also requires the DBO&#8217;s approval for the Bank to pay a dividend to the Company. 

Accordingly, reflecting the Company&#8217;s and the Bank&#8217;s improved financial condition and performance, as of November 19, 2014, the Bank and the Company have been relieved of all formal regulatory agreements. Some of the governance and procedures established by the Agreement and the Order remain in place, including submission of certain plans and reports to the Federal Reserve and DBO, the Bank&#8217;s obligation to maintain a 9.0% tangible shareholder&#8217;s equity ratio, and the requirement to seek approvals from the Federal Reserve and the DBO for either the Bank or the Company to pay dividends and for the Company to pay interest on its outstanding junior subordinated debt. While no assurances can be given as to future regulatory approvals, over the last two years the DBO and the Federal Reserve have been approving the Bank's quarterly payment of dividends to the Company to cover the Company's operating expenses, tax obligations and interest payments on the junior subordinated debt and the Company's payment of quarterly interest on the junior subordinated debt. 

Effect of Governmental Policies and Recent Legislation 

Impact of Monetary Policies &#32; 

Banking has traditionally been a business that depends on rate differentials. In general, the difference between the interest earned on loans extended to the Company&#8217;s customers and securities held in the Company's portfolio and the interest paid by the Company on its deposits and other borrowings comprise the major portion of the Company's earnings. The amounts of interest earned and paid are impacted by the volumes of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the interest rates, which rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the control of the Company. Accordingly, the earnings and growth of the Company are subject to the influence of domestic and foreign economic conditions, including, but not limited to, inflation, recession and unemployment. 

&#160; 

The earnings and growth of the Company are also affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government and its agencies, particularly the FRB. The FRB implements national monetary policies (with objectives such as to curb inflation and combat recession) by its open market operations in United States Government securities, by adjusting the required level of reserves for financial institutions subject to reserve requirements, and by varying the discount rates applicable to 

borrowing by banks. The actions of the FRB in these areas influence the growth of bank loans, investments and deposits and also affect interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits. The FRB&#8217;s policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The nature and timing of any future changes in monetary policies are not predictable; however, the FRB has indicated its intention of slowing raising interest rates from their current historic lows. 

In addition, adverse economic conditions could make a higher provision for loan losses a prudent course and could cause higher loan charge-offs, thus adversely affecting the Company&#8217;s net income. 

Extensions of Credit to Insiders 

The Federal Reserve Act and the FRB&#8217;s Regulation O place limitations and conditions on loans or extensions of credit to: 

&#9632; a bank&#8217;s or bank holding company&#8217;s executive officers, directors and principal shareholders ( i.e. , in most cases, those persons who own, control or have power to vote more than 10% of any class of voting securities), 

&#9632; any company controlled by any such executive officer, director or shareholder, or 

&#9632; any political or campaign committee controlled by such executive officer, director or principal shareholder. 

&#160; 

Loans and leases extended to any of the above persons must comply with loan-to-one-borrower limits, require prior full board approval when aggregate extensions of credit to the person exceed specified amounts, must be made on substantially the same terms (including interest rates and collateral) as, and follow credit-underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non-insiders, and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. In addition, Regulation O provides that the aggregate limit on extensions of credit to all insiders of a bank as a group cannot exceed the bank&#8217;s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. Regulation O also prohibits a bank from paying an overdraft on an account of an executive officer or director, except pursuant to a written pre-authorized interest-bearing extension of credit plan that specifies a method of repayment or a written pre-authorized transfer of funds from another account of the officer or director at the bank. 

&#160; 

Transactions with Affiliates &#160; 

Sections 23A and 232B of the Federal Reserve Act and the FRB&#8217;s Regulation W impose quantitative and qualitative limitations on the ability of a bank to make loans to or enter into certain types of transactions with its holding company and other subsidiaries of the holding company (&#8220;affiliates&#8221;). Under Sections 23A and 23B and Regulation W, loans by the Bank to affiliates, investments by the Bank in affiliates' stock, and taking affiliates' stock as collateral for loans to any borrower are limited to 10% of the Bank's capital, in the case of any one affiliate, and are limited to 20% of the Bank's capital, in the case of all affiliates. In addition, transactions between the Bank and other affiliates must be on terms and conditions that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices; in particular, a bank and its subsidiaries generally may not purchase from an affiliate a low-quality asset, as defined in the Federal Reserve Act. These restrictions also prevent a bank holding company and its other affiliates from borrowing from a banking subsidiary of the bank holding company unless the loans are secured by marketable collateral of designated amounts. 

&#160; 

Consumer Protection Laws and Regulations &#160; 

The banking regulatory agencies are focusing greater attention on compliance with consumer protection laws and their implementing regulations. Examination and enforcement have become more intense in nature, and insured institutions have been advised to monitor carefully compliance with such laws and regulations. The Company is subject to many federal and state consumer protection and privacy statutes and regulations, some of which are discussed below. 

The Community Reinvestment Act (the &#8220;CRA&#8221;) is intended to encourage insured depository institutions to help meet the credit needs of their communities. The CRA specifically directs the federal regulatory agencies, in examining insured depository institutions, to assess a bank&#8217;s record of helping meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with safe and sound banking practices. The CRA further requires the agencies to take a financial institution&#8217;s record of meeting its community credit needs into account when evaluating applications for, among other things, domestic branches, mergers or acquisitions, or holding company formations . The agencies use the CRA assessment factors in order to provide a rating to the financial institution. The ratings range from a high of &#8220;outstanding&#8221; to a low of &#8220;substantial noncompliance.&#8221; In its last examination for CRA compliance, as of October 2012, the Bank was rated &#8220;satisfactory.&#8221; 

The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (the &#8220;ECOA&#8221;) generally prohibits discrimination in any credit transaction, whether for consumer or business purposes, on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age (except in limited circumstances), receipt of income from public assistance programs, or good faith exercise of any rights under the Consumer Credit Protection Act. 

The Truth in Lending Act (the &#8220;TILA&#8221;) is designed to ensure that credit terms are disclosed in a meaningful way so that consumers may compare credit terms more readily and knowledgeably. As a result of the TILA, all creditors must use the same credit terminology to express rates and payments, including the annual percentage rate, the finance charge, the amount financed, the total of payments and the payment schedule, among other things. As a result of Dodd Frank, Regulation Z promulgated under TILA includes new limits on loan originator compensation for all closed-end mortgages. These changes include, prohibiting certain payments to a mortgage broker or loan officer based on the transaction&#8217;s terms or conditions, prohibiting dual compensation, and prohibiting a mortgage broker or loan officer from &#8216;&#8216;steering&#8217;&#8217; consumers to transactions not in their interest, to increase mortgage broker or loan officer compensation. 

&#160; 

The Fair Housing Act (the &#8220;FH Act&#8221;) regulates many practices, including making it unlawful for any lender to discriminate in its housing-related lending activities against any person because of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, handicap or familial status. A number of lending practices have been found by the courts to be, or may be considered, illegal under the FH Act, including some that are not specifically mentioned in the FH Act itself. 

&#160; 

The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (the &#8220;HMDA&#8221;), in response to public concern over credit shortages in certain urban neighborhoods, requires public disclosure of information that shows whether financial institutions are serving the housing credit needs of the neighborhoods and communities in which they are located. The HMDA also includes a "fair lending" aspect that requires the collection and disclosure of data about applicant and borrower characteristics as a way of identifying possible discriminatory lending patterns and enforcing anti-discrimination statutes. 

&#160; 

The Right to Financial Privacy Act (the &#8220;RFPA&#8221;) imposes a new requirement for financial institutions to provide new privacy protections to consumers. Financial institutions must provide disclosures to consumers of its privacy policy, and state the rights of consumers to direct their financial institution not to share their nonpublic personal information with third parties. 

&#160; 

Finally, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (the &#8220;RESPA&#8221;) requires lenders to provide noncommercial borrowers with disclosures regarding the nature and cost of real estate settlements. Also, RESPA prohibits certain abusive practices, such as kickbacks, and places limitations on the amount of escrow accounts. 

&#160; 

Penalties for noncompliance or violations under the above laws may include fines, reimbursement and other penalties. Due to heightened regulatory concern related to compliance with CRA, ECOA, TILA, FH Act, HMDA, RFPA and RESPA generally, the Company has incurred additional compliance costs and has expended additional funds for investments in its local communities. 

&#160; 

Recent Legislation and Other Changes 

From time to time, legislation is enacted which has the effect of increasing the cost of doing business, limiting or expanding permissible activities or affecting the competitive balance between banks and other financial institutions. Proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the operations and taxation of banks and other financial institutions are frequently made in Congress, in the California legislature and before various bank regulatory agencies. The likelihood of any major change and the impact such change may have on the Company is impossible to predict. Certain of the potentially significant changes which have been enacted in the last several years recently and other which are currently under consideration by Congress or various regulatory agencies or professional agencies are discussed below. 

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 

The Dodd-Frank Act has significantly changed the bank regulatory structure and has impacted the lending, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act created a new interagency council, the Financial System Oversight Council that is charged with identifying and monitoring the systemic risk to the U.S. economy posed by systemically significant, large financial companies, including bank holding companies and non-bank financial companies. The Office of Thrift Supervision was eliminated and its powers distributed among the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC. The legislation also established a floor for capital of insured depository institutions that cannot be lower than the standards then in effect, and directed the federal banking regulators 

to implement new leverage and capital requirements that take into account off-balance sheet activities and other risks, including risks relating to securitized products and derivatives. 

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Act additionally created a new independent federal regulator to administer federal consumer protection laws. Among the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are the following: 

Deposit Insurance. &#32;&#32; The Dodd-Frank Act permanently increased the maximum deposit insurance amount for banks, savings institutions and credit unions to $250,000 per depositor, retroactive to January 1, 2009. The Dodd-Frank Act also broadened the base for FDIC insurance assessments. Assessments are based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the FDIC to increase the reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund from 1.15% to 1.35% of insured deposits by 2020 and eliminated the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to insured depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds. The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the federal statutory prohibition against the payment of interest on business checking accounts. 

Interstate Branching. &#32;&#32; The Dodd-Frank Act authorized national and state banks to establish branches in other states to the same extent as a bank chartered by that state would be permitted to branch. Previously, banks could only establish branches in other states if the host state expressly permitted out-of-state banks to establish branches in that state. Accordingly, banks will be able to enter new markets more freely, potentially increasing competition. 

Limits on Derivatives. &#32;&#32; The Dodd-Frank Act prohibited state-chartered banks from engaging in derivatives transactions unless the loans to one borrower limits of the state in which the bank is chartered take into consideration credit exposure to derivatives transactions. For this purpose, derivative transactions include any contract, agreement, swap, warrant, note or option that is based in whole or in part on the value of, any interest in, or any quantitative measure or the occurrence of any event relating to, one or more commodities securities, currencies, interest or other rates, indices or other assets. 

Final Volcker Rule 

In December 2013, the federal bank regulatory agencies adopted final rules that implement a part of the Dodd-Frank Act commonly referred to as the &#8220;Volcker Rule.&#8221; Under these rules and subject to certain exceptions, banking entities are restricted from engaging in activities that are considered proprietary trading and from sponsoring or investing in certain entities, including hedge or private equity funds that are considered &#8220;covered funds.&#8221; These rules became effective April 1, 2014, although certain provisions are subject to delayed effectiveness under rules promulgated by the FRB. The Company and the Bank held no investment positions at December 31, 2015 which were subject to the final rule. Therefore, while these new rules may require us to conduct certain internal analysis and reporting, we believe that they will not require any material changes in our operations or business. 

Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders. &#32;&#32; The Dodd-Frank Act expanded the definition of &#8220;affiliate&#8221; for purposes of the quantitative and qualitative limitations of Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act to include mutual funds advised by a depository institution or its affiliates. The Dodd-Frank Act applied Section 23A and Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act (governing transactions with insiders) to derivative transactions, repurchase agreements and securities lending and borrowing transactions that create credit exposure to an affiliate or an insider. Any such transactions with affiliates must be fully secured. The Dodd-Frank Act also prohibits an insured depository institution from purchasing an asset from or selling an asset to an insider unless the transaction is on market terms and, if representing more than 10% of capital, is approved in advance by disinterested directors. 

Debit Card Interchange Fees. &#32;&#32; The Dodd-Frank Act requires that the amount of any interchange fee charged by a debit card issuer with respect to a debit card transaction must be reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer. The FRB has established standards for reasonable and proportional fees which take into account the costs of preventing fraud. The restrictions on interchange fees, however, do not apply to banks that, together with their affiliates, have assets of less than $10 billion, such as the Bank. 

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. &#32;&#32; The Dodd-Frank Act created a new, independent federal agency called the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (&#8220;CFPB&#8221;), which was granted broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws, including the ECOA, the TILA, the RESPA, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Act, the consumer financial privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and certain other statutes. The CFPB has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to depository institutions with $10 billion or more in assets. Smaller institutions will be subject to rules promulgated by the CFPB but will continue to be examined and supervised by the other federal banking regulators for consumer compliance purposes. The CFPB has authority to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive practices in connection with the offering of consumer financial products. The Dodd-Frank Act 

authorized the CFPB to establish certain minimum standards for the origination of residential mortgages, including a determination of the borrower&#8217;s ability to repay. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act allows borrowers to raise certain defenses to foreclosure if they receive any loan other than a &#8220;qualified mortgage,&#8221; as defined by the CFPB. The Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and standards that are more stringent than those adopted at the federal level and, in certain circumstances, permits state attorneys general to enforce compliance with both the state and federal laws and regulations. 

The Electronic Funds Transfer Act 

The Electronic Funds Transfer Act (the &#8220;EFTA&#8221;) provides a basic framework for establishing the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of consumers who use electronic funds transfer (&#8220;EFT&#8221;) systems. The EFTA is implemented by the FRB's Regulation E, which governs transfers initiated through ATMs, point-of-sale terminals, payroll cards, automated clearinghouse (&#8220;ACH&#8221;) transactions, telephone bill-payment plans, or remote banking services. Regulation E was amended in January 2010 to require consumers to opt in (affirmatively consent) to participation in the Bank&#8217;s overdraft service program for ATM and one-time debit card transactions before overdraft fees may be assessed on the consumer&#8217;s account. Notice of the opt-in right must be provided to all existing and new customers who are consumers, and the customer&#8217;s affirmative consent must be obtained, before charges may be assessed on the consumer&#8217;s account for paying such overdrafts. 

Regulation E provides bank customers with an ongoing right to revoke consent to participation in an overdraft service program for ATM and one-time debit card transactions, as opposed to being automatically enrolled in such a program. Regulation E also prohibits banks from conditioning the payment of overdrafts for checks, ACH transactions, or other types of transactions that overdraw the consumer&#8217;s account on the consumer&#8217;s opting into an overdraft service for ATM and one-time debit card transactions. For customers who do not affirmatively consent to overdraft service for ATM and one-time debit card transactions, a bank must provide those customers with the same account terms, conditions, and features that it provides to consumers who do affirmatively consent, except for the overdraft service for ATM and one-time debit card transactions. 

Incentive Compensation 

On June 21, 2010, the federal banking agencies issued final guidance on incentive compensation which applies to all banks. Except for the largest banking organizations, enforcement of this guidance is handled through the agencies&#8217; regular risk-focused examination process. The employees covered by the final guidance are senior executives and others who are responsible for oversight of the organization&#8217;s firm-wide activities or material business lines; individual employees, including non-executive employees, whose activities may expose the organization to material amounts of risk; and groups of employees who are subject to the same or similar incentive compensation arrangements and who, in the aggregate, may expose the organization to material amounts of risk, even if no individual employee is likely to expose the organization to material risk. The guidance provides for three principles for safe and sound incentive compensation arrangements: 

&#9632; Balanced Risk-Taking: Incentive compensation arrangements should balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risks; 

&#9632; Compatibility with Effective Controls and Risk-Management: A banking organization&#8217;s risk-management processes and internal controls should reinforce and support the development and maintenance of balanced incentive compensation arrangements; and 

&#9632; Strong Corporate Governance: Banking organizations should have strong and effective corporate governance to help ensure sound compensation practices, including active and effective oversight by the board of directors. 

Helping Families Save Their Homes Act &#160; 

In May 2009 the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act of 2009 was enacted to help consumers avoid mortgage foreclosures on their homes through certain loss mitigation actions including special forbearance, loan modification, pre-foreclosure sale, deed in lieu of foreclosure, support for borrower housing counseling, subordinate lien resolution, and borrower relocation. This law permits the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (&#8220;HUD&#8221;), for mortgages either in default or facing imminent default, to: (1) authorize the modification of such mortgages; and (2) establish a program for payment of a partial claim to a mortgagee who agrees to apply the claim amount to payment of a mortgage on a 1- to 4-family residence. In implementing the law, the Secretary of HUD is authorized to (1) provide compensation to the mortgagee for lost income on monthly mortgage payments due to interest rate reduction; (2) reimburse the mortgagee from a guaranty fund in connection with activities that the mortgagee is required to undertake concerning repayment by the mortgagor of the amount owed to HUD; (3) make payments to the mortgagee on behalf of the borrower, under terms defined by HUD; and (4) make mortgage modification with terms 

extended up to 40 years from the modification date. The new law also authorizes the Secretary of HUD to: (1) reassign the mortgage to the mortgagee; (2) act as a Government National Mortgage Association (&#8220;GNMA&#8221; or &#8220;Ginnie Mae&#8221;) issuer, or contract with an entity for such purpose, in order to pool the mortgage into a Ginnie Mae security; or (3) resell the mortgage in accordance with any program established for purchase by the federal government of insured mortgages. The law also amended the Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008, with respect to emergency assistance for the redevelopment of abandoned and foreclosed homes (neighborhood stabilization), to authorize each state that has received certain minimum allocations and has fulfilled certain requirements, to distribute any remaining amounts to areas with homeowners at risk of foreclosure or in foreclosure without regard to the percentage of home foreclosures in such areas. 

Credit Card Act of 2009 

Also in May 2009, the Credit Card Act of 2009 was enacted to help consumers and ban certain practices of credit card issuers. This law allows interest rate hikes on existing balances only under limited conditions, such as when a promotional rate ends, there is a variable rate or if the cardholder makes a late payment. Interest rates on new transactions can increase only after the first year. Significant changes in terms on accounts cannot occur without 45 days' advance notice of the change. The law bans raising interest rates on customers based on their payment records with other unrelated credit issuers (such as utility companies and other creditors) for existing credit card balances, though card issuers would still be allowed to use universal default on future credit card balances if they give at least 45 days' advance notice of the change. The law allows consumers to opt out of certain significant changes in terms on their accounts. Opting out means cardholders agree to close their accounts and pay off the balance under the old terms. They have at least five years to pay the balance. Credit card issuers will be banned from issuing credit cards to anyone under 21, unless they have adult co-signers on the accounts or can show proof they have enough income to repay the card debt. 

The law requires card issuers to give card account holders "a reasonable amount of time" to make payments on monthly bills. That means payments would be due at least 21 days after they are mailed or delivered. Credit card issuers would no longer be able to set early morning or other arbitrary deadlines for payments. When consumers have accounts that carry different interest rates for different types of purchases payments in excess of the minimum amount due must go to balances with higher interest rates first. Consumers must "opt in" to over-limit fees. Those who opt out would have their transactions rejected if they exceed their credit limits, thus avoiding over-limit fees. Fees charged for going over the limit must be reasonable. Finance charges on outstanding credit card balances would be computed based on purchases made in the current cycle rather than going back to the previous billing cycle to calculate interest charges. Fees on credit cards cannot exceed 25 percent of the available credit limit in the first year of the card.

Other Aspects of Banking Law 

The Bank is also be subject to federal statutory and regulatory provisions covering, among other things, security procedures, management interlocks, funds availability and truth-in-savings. There are also a variety of federal statutes that regulate acquisitions of control and the formation of bank holding companies, and the activities beyond owning banks that are permissible. 

Conclusion 

Future legislation is also likely to impact the Company&#8217;s business; however, it is impossible to predict what legislation might be enacted or what regulations might be adopted on the state or federal level or the effects thereof. 

The foregoing summary of the laws, regulations and rules governing the Bank and the Company is not a complete summary of all applicable laws, regulations and rules.
