 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Overview 

Organization 

We were incorporated under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware on February 18, 2005. On June 22, 2005, we completed our initial public offering and commenced operations. We operate as an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company and have elected to be treated as a business development company (&#147;BDC&#148;) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the &#147;1940 Act&#148;). For federal income tax purposes, we have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company (&#147;RIC&#148;) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;Code&#148;). To continue to qualify as a RIC for federal income tax purposes and obtain favorable RIC tax treatment, we must meet certain requirements, including certain minimum distribution requirements. Since our initial public offering in 2005 and through March 31, 2016, we have made 129 consecutive monthly distributions to common stockholders. 

Our shares of common stock, 7.125% Series A Cumulative Term Preferred Stock (&#147;Series A Term Preferred Stock&#148;), 6.75% Series B Cumulative Term Preferred Stock (&#147;Series B Term Preferred Stock&#148;) and 6.50% Series C Cumulative Term Preferred Stock (&#147;Series C Term Preferred Stock&#148;) are traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (&#147;NASDAQ&#148;) under the trading symbols &#147;GAIN,&#148; &#147;GAINP,&#148; &#147;GAINO,&#148; and &#147;GAINN,&#148; respectively. 

&#160;

Investment Adviser and Administrator 

We are externally managed by our affiliated investment adviser, Gladstone Management Corporation (the &#147;Adviser&#148;), under an investment advisory and management agreement (the &#147;Advisory Agreement&#148;) and another of our affiliates, Gladstone Administration, LLC, (the &#147;Administrator&#148;) provides administrative services to us pursuant to a contractual agreement (the &#147;Administration Agreement&#148;). Each of the Adviser and Administrator are privately-held companies that are indirectly owned and controlled by David Gladstone, our chairman and chief executive officer. Mr. Gladstone and Terry Brubaker, our vice chairman and chief operating officer, also serve on the board of directors of the Adviser, the board of managers of the Administrator, and serve as executive officers of the Adviser and the Administrator. The Administrator employs, among others, our chief financial officer and treasurer, chief valuation officer, chief compliance officer, general counsel and secretary (who also serves as the president of the Administrator) and their respective staffs. The Adviser and Administrator have extensive experience in our lines of business and also provide investment advisory and administrative services, respectively, to our affiliates, including, but not limited to: Gladstone Commercial Corporation (&#147;Gladstone Commercial&#148;), a publicly-traded real estate investment trust; Gladstone Capital Corporation (&#147;Gladstone Capital&#148;), a publicly-traded BDC and RIC; and Gladstone Land Corporation (&#147;Gladstone Land,&#148; with &#147;Gladstone Commercial,&#148; and &#147;Gladstone Capital,&#148; collectively the &#147;Affiliated Public Funds&#148;), a publicly-traded real estate investment trust. In the future, the Adviser and Administrator may provide investment advisory and administrative services, respectively, to other funds and companies, both public and private. 

The Adviser was organized as a corporation under the laws of the State of Delaware on July 2, 2002, and is a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. The Administrator was organized as a limited liability company under the laws of the State of Delaware on March 18, 2005. The Adviser and Administrator are headquartered in McLean, Virginia, a suburb of Washington, D.C. The Adviser also has offices in several other states. 

Investment Objectives and Strategy 

We were established for the purpose of investing in debt and equity securities of established private businesses operating in the United States (&#147;U.S.&#148;). Our investment objectives are to: (1) achieve and grow current income by investing in debt securities of established businesses that we believe will provide stable earnings and cash flow to pay expenses, make principal and interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness and make distributions to stockholders that grow over time; and (2) provide our stockholders with long-term capital appreciation in the value of our assets by investing in equity securities, generally in combination with the aforementioned debt securities, of established businesses that we believe can grow over time to permit us to sell our equity investments for capital gains. To achieve our objectives, our investment strategy is to invest in several categories of debt and equity securities, with each investment generally ranging from $5 million to $30 million, although investment size may vary, depending upon our total assets or available capital at the time of investment. We intend that our investment portfolio over time will consist of approximately 75% in debt securities and 25% in equity securities, at cost. As of March 31, 2016, our investment portfolio was made up of 71.3% in debt securities and 28.7% in equity securities, at cost. 

In July 2012, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;) granted us an exemptive order (the &#147;Co-Investment Order&#148;) that expanded our ability to co-invest with certain of our affiliates, including Gladstone Capital, under certain circumstances and any future business development company or closed-end management investment company that is advised (or sub-advised if it controls the fund) by our external investment adviser, or any combination of the foregoing, subject to the conditions in the SEC&#146;s order. 

In general, our investments in debt securities have a term of no more than seven years, accrue interest at variable rates (based on the one-month London Interbank Offered Rate (&#147;LIBOR&#148;)) and, to a lesser extent, at fixed rates. We seek debt instruments that pay interest monthly or, at a minimum, quarterly, and which may include a yield enhancement such as a success fee or deferred interest provision and are primarily interest only, with all principal and any accrued but unpaid interest due at maturity. Generally, success fees accrue at a set rate and are contractually due upon a change of control of the business. Some debt securities have deferred interest whereby some portion of the interest payment is added to the principal balance so that the interest is paid, together with the principal, at maturity. This form of deferred interest is often called &#147;paid-in-kind&#148; (&#147;PIK&#148;) interest. 

Typically, our investments in equity securities take the form of common stock, preferred stock, limited liability company interests, or warrants or options to purchase the foregoing. Often, these equity investments occur in connection with our original investment, buyouts and recapitalizations of a business, or refinancing existing debt. Since our initial public offering in 2005 and through March 31, 2016, we have made investments in 43 companies, excluding investments in syndicated loans. 

We expect that our investment portfolio will primarily include the following three categories of investments in private companies in the U.S.: 

&#160;

&#149; &#160; First Lien Secured Debt Securities: We seek to invest a portion of our assets in first lien secured debt securities also known as senior loans, senior term loans, lines of credit and senior notes. Using its assets as collateral, the borrower typically uses first lien secured debt to cover a substantial portion of the funding needs of the business. These debt securities usually take the form of first priority liens on all, or substantially all, of the assets of the business. &#160;

&#149; &#160; Second Lien Secured Debt Securities: We seek to invest a portion of our assets in second lien secured debt securities, which may also be referred to as subordinated loans, subordinated notes and mezzanine loans. These second lien secured debt securities rank junior to the borrower&#146;s first lien secured debt securities and may be secured by second priority liens on all or a portion of the assets of the business. Additionally, we may receive other yield enhancements, such as warrants to buy common and preferred stock or limited liability interests, in connection with these second lien secured debt securities. &#160;

&#149; &#160; Preferred and Common Equity/Equivalents: We seek to invest a portion of our assets in equity securities, which consist of preferred and common equity, limited liability company interests, warrants or options to acquire such securities, and are generally in combination with our debt investment in a business. Additionally, we may receive equity investments derived from restructurings on some of our existing debt investments. In many cases, we will own a significant portion of the equity of the businesses in which we invest. Additionally, pursuant to the 1940 Act, we must maintain at least 70% of our total assets in qualifying assets, which generally include each of the investment types listed above. Therefore, the 1940 Act permits us to invest up to 30% of our assets in other non-qualifying assets. See &#147;&#151; Regulation as a BDC &#151; Qualifying Assets &#148; for a discussion of the types of qualifying assets in which we are permitted to invest pursuant to Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act. 

Because the majority of the loans in our portfolio consist of term debt in private companies that typically cannot or will not expend the resources to have their debt securities rated by a credit rating agency, we expect that most, if not all, of the debt securities we acquire will be unrated. Investors should assume that these loans would be rated below what is today considered &#147;investment grade&#148; quality. Investments rated below investment grade are often referred to as high yield securities or junk bonds and may be considered higher risk, as compared to investment-grade debt instruments. 

Investment Policies 

We seek to achieve a high level of current income and capital gains through investments in debt securities and preferred and common stock that we generally acquire in connection with buyout and other recapitalizations. The following investment policies, along with these investment objectives, may not be changed without the approval of our Board of Directors: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; We will at all times conduct our business so as to retain our status as a BDC. In order to retain that status, we must be operated for the purpose of investing in certain categories of qualifying assets. In addition, we may not acquire any assets (other than non-investment assets necessary and appropriate to our operations as a BDC or qualifying assets) if, after giving effect to such acquisition, the value of our &#147;qualifying assets&#148; is less than 70% of the value of our total assets. We anticipate that the securities we seek to acquire will generally be qualifying assets. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; We will at all times endeavor to conduct our business so as to retain our status as a RIC under the Code. To do so, we must meet income source, asset diversification and annual distribution requirements. We may issue senior securities, such as debt or preferred stock, to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act for the purpose of making investments, to fund share repurchases, or for temporary emergency or other purposes. With the exception of our policy to conduct our business as a BDC, these policies are not fundamental and may be changed without stockholder approval. 

&#160;

Investment Concentrations 

As of March 31, 2016, our investment portfolio consisted of investments in 36 portfolio companies located in 19 states across 17 different industries with an aggregate fair value of $487.7 million.

Investment Process 

Overview of Investment and Approval Process 

To originate investments, the Adviser&#146;s investment professionals use an extensive referral network comprised primarily of private equity sponsors, venture capitalists, leveraged buyout funds, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, commercial bankers and business brokers. The Adviser&#146;s investment professionals review information received from these and other sources in search of potential financing opportunities. If a potential opportunity matches our investment objectives, the investment professionals will seek an initial screening of the opportunity with our president, David Dullum, to authorize the submission of an indication of interest (&#147;IOI&#148;) to the prospective portfolio company. If the prospective portfolio company passes this initial screening and the IOI is accepted by the prospective company, the investment professionals will seek approval to issue a letter of intent (&#147;LOI&#148;) from the Adviser&#146;s investment committee, which is composed of Messrs. Gladstone, Brubaker, and Dullum, to the prospective company. If this LOI is issued, then the Adviser and Gladstone Securities (the &#147;Due Diligence Team&#148;) will conduct a due diligence investigation and create a detailed profile summarizing the prospective portfolio company&#146;s historical financial statements, industry, competitive position and management team and analyzing its conformity to our general investment criteria. The investment professionals then present this profile to the Adviser&#146;s investment committee, which must approve each investment. Further, each investment is available for review by the members of our board of directors (our &#147;Board of Directors&#148;), a majority of whom are not &#147;interested persons&#148; as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act, and our Board of Directors reviews and approves any investments we may make pursuant to the Co-Investment Order. 

Prospective Portfolio Company Characteristics 

We have identified certain characteristics that we believe are important in identifying and investing in prospective portfolio companies. The criteria listed below provide general guidelines for our investment decisions, although not all of these criteria may be met by each portfolio company. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Experienced Management. We typically require that the businesses in which we invest have experienced management teams or a hiring plan in place to install an experienced management team. We also require the businesses to have in place proper incentives to induce management to succeed and act in concert with our interests as investors, including having significant equity or other interests in the financial performance of their companies. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Value-and-Income Orientation and Positive Cash Flow. Our investment philosophy places a premium on fundamental analysis from an investor&#146;s perspective and has a distinct value-and-income orientation. In seeking value, we focus on established companies in which we can invest at relatively low multiples of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (&#147;EBITDA&#148;), and that have positive operating cash flow at the time of investment. In seeking income, we typically invest in companies that generate relatively stable to growing sales, cash flows, and EBITDA to fixed charges coverage, which provides some assurance that the borrowers will be able to service their debt. We do not expect to invest in start-up companies or companies with what we believe to be speculative business plans. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Strong Competitive Position in an Industry. We seek to invest in businesses that have developed strong market positions and significant relative market share within their respective markets and that we believe are well-positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities. We seek businesses that demonstrate significant competitive advantages versus their competitors, which we believe will help to protect their market positions and profitability. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Liquidation Value of Assets. The projected liquidation value of the assets, if any, is an important factor in our investment analysis in collateralizing our debt securities. Extensive Due Diligence 

The Due Diligence Team conducts what we believe are extensive due diligence investigations of our prospective portfolio companies and investment opportunities. The due diligence investigation may begin with a review of publicly available information followed by in depth business analysis, including, but not limited to, some or all of the following: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; a review of the prospective portfolio company&#146;s historical and projected financial information, including a quality of earnings analysis; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; visits to the prospective portfolio company&#146;s business site(s) and evaluation of potential environmental issues; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; interviews with the prospective portfolio company&#146;s management, employees, customers and vendors; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; review of loan documents and material contracts; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; background checks and a management capabilities assessment on the prospective portfolio company&#146;s management team; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; research, including market analyses, on the prospective portfolio company&#146;s products, services or particular industry and its competitive position therein. Additional due diligence of a potential investment may be conducted on our behalf by attorneys and independent accountants, as well as other outside advisers, prior to the closing of the investment, as appropriate. 

Investment Structure 

Once the Adviser has determined that an investment meets our standards and investment criteria, the Adviser works with the management of that company and other capital providers to structure the transaction in a way that we believe will provide us with the greatest opportunity to maximize our return on the investment, while providing appropriate incentives to management of the company. As discussed above, the capital classes through which we typically structure a deal include first lien secured debt, second lien secured debt, and preferred and common equity or equivalents. Through its risk management process, the Adviser seeks to limit the downside risk of our investments by: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; making investments with an expected total return (including interest, yield enhancements and potential equity appreciation) that it believes compensates us for the credit risk of the investment; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; seeking collateral or superior positions in the portfolio company&#146;s capital structure where possible; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; incorporating put and call protection rights into the investment structure where possible; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; negotiating covenants in connection with our investments that afford our portfolio companies as much flexibility as possible in managing their businesses, consistent with preserving our capital; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; holding board seats or securing board observation rights at the portfolio company. We expect to hold most of our debt investments until maturity or repayment. From time to time, we may sell our investments (including our equity investments) earlier if a liquidity event takes place, such as a recapitalization of a portfolio company, an initial public offering, or a sale to a third party, including strategic buyers, private equity funds, or existing investors in the portfolio company, and which may be privately negotiated transactions. 

Competitive Advantages 

A large number of entities compete with us and make the types of investments that we seek to make in small and medium-sized privately-owned businesses. Such competitors include private equity funds, leveraged buyout funds, other BDCs, venture capital funds, investment banks and other equity and non-equity based investment funds, and other financing sources, including traditional financial services companies such as commercial banks. Many of our competitors are substantially larger than we are and have considerably greater funding sources or are able to access capital more cost effectively. In addition, certain of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments, and establish a larger portfolio of investments. Furthermore, many of these competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a BDC. However, we believe that we have the following competitive advantages over many other providers of financing to small and medium-sized businesses. 

Management Expertise 

Our Adviser has an investment committee for each of the Company and the Affiliated Public Funds. Mr. Gladstone and Mr. Brubaker serve as members of the Adviser&#146;s investment committees for each of the Company and each of the Affiliated Public Funds. Mr. Gladstone and Mr. Dullum have extensive experience in investing in middle market companies and with operating in the BDC marketplace in general. Mr. Brubaker has substantial experience in acquisitions and operations of companies. These three individuals comprising our executive management dedicate a significant portion of their time to managing our investment portfolio. They have extensive experience providing capital to small and medium-sized companies and have worked together at the Gladstone family of companies for more than ten years. In addition, we have access to the resources and expertise of the Adviser&#146;s investment professionals and support staff who possess a broad range of transactional, financial, managerial, and investment skills. 

&#160;

Increased Access to Investment Opportunities Developed Through Extensive Research Capability and Network of Contacts 

The Adviser seeks to identify potential investments through active origination and due diligence and through its dialogue with numerous management teams, members of the financial community and potential corporate partners with whom the Adviser&#146;s investment professionals have long-term relationships. We believe that the Adviser&#146;s investment professionals have developed a broad network of contacts within the investment, commercial banking, private equity and investment management communities, and that their reputation, experience, and focus on investing in small and medium-sized companies enables us to source and identify well-positioned prospective portfolio companies, which provide attractive investment opportunities. Additionally, the Adviser expects to generate information from its professionals&#146; network of accountants, consultants, lawyers and management teams of portfolio companies and other companies to support the Adviser&#146;s investment activities. 

Disciplined, Value and Income-Oriented Investment Philosophy with a Focus on Preservation of Capital 

In making its investment decisions, the Adviser focuses on the risk and reward profile of each prospective portfolio company, seeking to minimize the risk of capital loss without foregoing the potential for capital appreciation. We expect the Adviser to use the same value and income-oriented investment philosophy that its professionals use in the management of the other Gladstone Companies and to commit resources to manage downside exposure. The Adviser&#146;s approach seeks to reduce our risk in investments by using some or all of the following approaches: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; focusing on companies with attractive and sustainable market positions and cash flow; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; investing in businesses with experienced and established management teams; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; engaging in extensive due diligence from the perspective of a long-term investor; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; investing at low price-to-cash flow multiples; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; adopting flexible transaction structures by drawing on the experience of the investment professionals of the Adviser and its affiliates. Longer Investment Horizon 

Unlike private equity and venture capital funds that are typically organized as finite-life partnerships, we are not subject to standard periodic capital return requirements. The partnership agreements of most private equity and venture capital funds typically provide that these funds may only invest investors&#146; capital once and must return all capital and realized gains to investors within a finite time period, often seven to ten years. These provisions often force private equity and venture capital funds to seek returns on their investments by causing their portfolio companies to pursue mergers, public equity offerings, or other liquidity events more quickly than might otherwise be optimal or desirable, potentially resulting in a lower overall return to investors and/or an adverse impact on their portfolio companies. In contrast, we are a corporation of perpetual duration and are exchange-traded. We believe that our flexibility to make investments with a long-term view and without the capital return requirements of traditional private investment vehicles provides us with the opportunity to achieve greater long-term returns on invested capital. 

Flexible Transaction Structuring 

We believe our management team&#146;s broad expertise and its ability to draw upon many years of combined experience enables the Adviser to identify, assess, and structure investments successfully across all levels of a company&#146;s capital structure and manage potential risk and return at all stages of the economic cycle. We are not subject to many of the regulatory limitations that govern traditional lending institutions, such as banks. As a result, we are flexible in selecting and structuring investments, adjusting investment criteria and transaction structures and, in some cases, the types of securities in which we invest, thereby affording us a competitive advantage of providing both, equity and debt financing, which may limit uncertainty related to the close of the transaction. We believe that this approach enables the Adviser to develop a financing structure which best fits the investment and growth profile of the underlying business and yields attractive investment opportunities that will continue to generate current income and capital gain potential throughout the economic cycle, including during turbulent periods in the capital markets. 

&#160;

Ongoing Management of Investments and Portfolio Company Relationships 

The Adviser&#146;s investment professionals actively oversee each investment by continuously evaluating the portfolio company&#146;s performance and typically working collaboratively with the portfolio company&#146;s management to identify and incorporate best resources and practices that help us achieve our projected investment performance. 

Monitoring 

The Adviser&#146;s investment professionals monitor the financial performance, trends, and changing risks of each portfolio company on an ongoing basis to determine if each company is performing within expectations and to guide the portfolio company&#146;s management in taking the appropriate courses of action. The Adviser employs various methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance of our investments in portfolio companies, which can include the following: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; monthly analysis of financial and operating performance; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; frequent assessment of the portfolio company&#146;s performance against its business plan and our investment expectations; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; attendance at and/or participation in the portfolio company&#146;s board of directors or management meetings; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; continuous assessment of portfolio company management, governance and strategic direction; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; continuous assessment of the portfolio company&#146;s industry and competitive environment; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; frequent review and assessment of the portfolio company&#146;s operating outlook and financial projections. Relationship Management 

The Adviser&#146;s investment professionals interact with various parties involved with a portfolio company, or investment, by actively engaging with internal and external constituents, including: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; management; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; boards of directors; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; financial sponsors; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; capital partners; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; auditors; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; advisers and consultants. Managerial Assistance and Services 

As a BDC, we make available significant managerial assistance, as defined in the 1940 Act, to our portfolio companies and provide other services (other than such managerial assistance) to such portfolio companies. Neither we, nor the Adviser, currently receive fees in connection with the managerial assistance we make available. At times, the Adviser may also provide other services to our portfolio companies under certain agreements and may receive fees for services other than managerial assistance. Such services may include, but are not limited to: (i) assistance obtaining, sourcing or structuring credit facilities, long term loans or additional equity from unaffiliated third parties; (ii) negotiating important contractual financial relationships; (iii) consulting services regarding restructuring of the portfolio company and financial modeling as it relates to raising additional debt and equity capital from unaffiliated third parties; and (iv) primary role in interviewing, vetting and negotiating employment contracts with candidates in connection with adding and retaining key portfolio company management team members. The Adviser voluntarily, unconditionally, and irrevocably credits 100% of these fees against the base management fee that we would otherwise be required to pay to the Adviser as discussed below in &#147;&#151; Transactions with Related Parties &#151; Investment Advisory and Management Agreement &#151; Base Management Fee;&#148; however, pursuant to the terms of the Advisory Agreement, a small percentage of certain of such fees is retained by the Adviser in the form of reimbursement, at cost, for tasks completed by personnel of the Adviser, primarily for the valuation of portfolio companies. 

&#160;

In February 2011, Gladstone Securities started providing other services (such as investment banking and due diligence services) to certain of our portfolio companies, see &#147;&#151; Transactions with Related Parties &#151; Other Transactions &#148; below. 

Valuation Process 

The following is a general description of our investment valuation policy (the &#147;Policy&#148;) (which has been approved by our Board of Directors) that the professionals of the Adviser and Administrator, with oversight and direction from our chief valuation officer, an employee of the Administrator that reports directly to our Board of Directors, (collectively, the &#147;Valuation Team&#148;) use each quarter to determine the fair value of our investment portfolio. In accordance with the 1940 Act, our Board of Directors has the ultimate responsibility for reviewing and approving, in good faith, the fair value of our investments based on the Policy. The Adviser values our investments in accordance with the requirements of the 1940 Act and accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (&#147;GAAP&#148;). There is no single standard for determining fair value (especially for privately-held businesses), as fair value depends upon the specific facts and circumstances of each individual investment. Each quarter, our Board of Directors reviews the Policy to determine if changes thereto are advisable and assesses whether the Valuation Team has applied the Policy consistently. With respect to the valuation of our investment portfolio, the Valuation Team performs the following steps each quarter: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Each investment is initially assessed by the Valuation Team using the Policy, which may include: &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; obtaining fair value quotes or utilizing valuation inputs from third party valuation firms; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; using techniques, such as total enterprise value, yield analysis, market quotes and other factors, including but not limited to: the nature and realizable value of the collateral, including external parties&#146; guaranties; any relevant offers or letters of intent to acquire the portfolio company; and the markets in which the portfolio company operates. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Preliminary valuation conclusions are then discussed amongst the Valuation Team and with our management and documented for review by our Board of Directors. Written valuation recommendations and supporting material are sent to the Board of Directors in advance of the quarterly meetings. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Next, the Valuation Committee of the Board of Directors (comprised entirely of independent directors) meets to review this documentation and discusses the information provided by our Valuation Team, and determines whether the Valuation Team has followed the Policy, determines whether the Valuation Team&#146;s recommended fair value is reasonable in light of the Policy and reviews other facts and circumstances. Then, the Valuation Committee and chief valuation officer present the Valuation Committee&#146;s findings to the entire Board of Directors, so that the full Board of Directors may review and approve, with a vote, to accept or reject the fair value recommendations in accordance with the Policy. Fair value measurements of our investments may involve subjective judgment and estimates. Due to the uncertainty inherent in valuing these securities, the Valuation Team&#146;s determinations of fair value may fluctuate from period to period and may differ materially from the values that could be obtained if a ready market for these securities existed. Our NAV could be materially affected if the Valuation Team&#146;s determinations regarding the fair value of our investments are materially different from the values that we ultimately realize upon our disposal of such securities. Our valuation policies, procedures and processes are more fully described under &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#151; Critical Accounting Policies &#151; Investment Valuation.&#148; 

Transactions with Related Parties 

Investment Advisory and Management Agreement 

Pursuant to our Advisory Agreement, we pay the Adviser certain fees as compensation for its services, consisting of a base management fee and an incentive fee, each as described below. On July 14, 2015, our Board of Directors, including a majority of the directors who are not parties to the Advisory Agreement or interested persons of such party, approved the annual renewal of the Advisory Agreement through August 31, 2016. Our Board of Directors considered the following factors as the basis for its decision to renew the Advisory Agreement: (1) the nature, extent and quality of services provided by the Adviser to our stockholders; (2) the investment performance of the Company and the Adviser, (3) the costs of the services to be provided and profits to be realized by the Adviser and its affiliates from the relationship with the Company, (4) the extent to which economies of scale will be realized as the Company and the Company&#146;s affiliates that are managed by the same Adviser (the Affiliated Public Funds) grow and whether the fee level under the Advisory Agreement reflects the economies of scale for the Company&#146;s investors, (5) the fee structure of the advisory and administrative agreements of comparable funds, and (6) indirect profits to the Adviser created through the Company and (7) in light of the foregoing considerations, the overall fairness of the advisory fee paid under the Advisory Agreement. 

&#160;

Base Management Fee 

The base management fee is payable quarterly to the Adviser pursuant to our Advisory Agreement and is assessed at an annual rate of 2.0%, computed on the basis of the value of our average gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed quarters (inclusive of the current quarter), which are total assets, including investments made with proceeds of borrowings, less any uninvested cash or cash equivalents resulting from borrowings, and adjusted appropriately for any share issuances or repurchases during the period. 

Additionally, as stated above, pursuant to the requirements of the 1940 Act, the Adviser makes available significant managerial assistance to our portfolio companies. The Adviser may also provide other services to our portfolio companies under certain agreements and may receive fees for services other than managerial assistance. The Adviser voluntarily, unconditionally, and irrevocably credits 100% of these fees against the base management fee that we would otherwise be required to pay to the Adviser; however, pursuant to the terms of the Advisory Agreement, a small percentage of certain of such fees is retained by the Adviser in the form of reimbursement, at cost, for tasks completed by personnel of the Adviser, primarily for the valuation of portfolio companies. Loan servicing fees that are payable to the Adviser pursuant to our Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, as amended (our &#147;Credit Facility&#148;), are also 100% credited against the base management fee as discussed below &#147;&#151; Loan Servicing Fee Pursuant to Credit Facility &#148;). 

Incentive Fee 

The incentive fee payable to the Adviser under our Advisory Agreement consists of two parts: an income-based incentive fee and a capital gains-based incentive fee. 

The income-based incentive fee rewards the Adviser if our quarterly net investment income (before giving effect to any incentive fee) exceeds 1.75% of our net assets, adjusted appropriately for any share issuances or repurchases during the period (the &#147;Hurdle Rate&#148;). The income-based incentive fee with respect to our pre-incentive fee net investment income is payable quarterly to the Adviser and is computed as follows: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; no incentive fee in any calendar quarter in which our pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the Hurdle Rate (7.0% annualized); &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; 100.0% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the Hurdle Rate but is less than 2.1875% of our net assets, adjusted appropriately for any share issuances or repurchases during the period, in any calendar quarter (8.75% annualized); and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; 20.0% of the amount of our pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds 2.1875% of our net assets, adjusted appropriately for any share issuances or repurchases during the period, in any calendar quarter (8.75% annualized). Quarterly Incentive Fee Based on Net Investment Income 

Pre-incentive fee net investment income 

(expressed as a percentage of the value of net assets) 

&#160;

&#160;

Percentage of pre-incentive fee net investment income 

allocated to income-related portion of incentive fee 

The second part of the incentive fee is a capital gains-based incentive fee that is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each fiscal year (or upon termination of the Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date), and equals 20.0% of our realized capital gains, less any realized capital losses and unrealized depreciation, calculated as of the end of the preceding calendar year. The capital gains-based incentive fee payable to the Adviser is calculated based on (i) cumulative aggregate realized capital gains since our inception, less (ii) cumulative aggregate realized capital losses since our inception, less (iii) the entire portfolio&#146;s aggregate unrealized capital depreciation, if any, as of the date of the calculation. If this number is positive at the applicable calculation date, then the 

&#160;

capital gains-based incentive fee for such year equals 20.0% of such amount, less the aggregate amount of any capital gains-based incentive fees paid in respect of our portfolio in all prior years. For calculation purposes, cumulative aggregate realized capital gains, if any, equals the sum of the excess between the net sales price of each investment, when sold, and the original cost of such investment since our inception. Cumulative aggregate realized capital losses equals the sum of the deficit between the net sales price of each investment, when sold, and the original cost of such investment since our inception. The entire portfolio&#146;s aggregate unrealized capital depreciation, if any, equals the sum of deficit between the fair value of each investment security as of the applicable calculation date and the original cost of such investment security. We have not incurred capital gains-based incentive fees from inception through March 31, 2016, as cumulative net unrealized capital depreciation has exceeded cumulative realized capital gains net of cumulative realized capital losses. 

Additionally, in accordance with GAAP, a capital gains-based incentive fee accrual is calculated using the aggregate cumulative realized capital gains and losses and aggregate cumulative unrealized capital depreciation included in the calculation of the capital gains-based incentive fee plus the aggregate cumulative unrealized capital appreciation. If such amount is positive at the end of a reporting period, then GAAP requires us to record a capital gains-based incentive fee equal to 20.0% of such amount, less the aggregate amount of actual capital gains-based incentive fees paid in all prior years. If such amount is negative, then there is no accrual for such period. GAAP requires that the capital gains-based incentive fee accrual consider the cumulative aggregate unrealized capital appreciation in the calculation, as a capital gains-based incentive fee would be payable if such unrealized capital appreciation were realized. There can be no assurance that any such unrealized capital appreciation will be realized in the future. There has been no GAAP accrual recorded for a capital gains-based incentive fee since our inception through March 31, 2016. 

Our Board of Directors may accept voluntary, unconditional, and irrevocable credits from the Adviser to reduce the income-based incentive fee to the extent net investment income generated in the current or prior year does not cover 100% of the distributions to common stockholders for a year. For the years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, there were no such incentive fee credits from the Adviser. 

Loan Servicing Fee Pursuant to Credit Facility 

The Adviser also services the loans held by our wholly-owned subsidiary, Gladstone Business Investment, LLC (&#147;Business Investment&#148;) (the borrower under our Credit Facility), in return for which the Adviser receives a 2.0% annual fee based on the monthly aggregate outstanding balance of loans pledged under our Credit Facility. Since Business Investment is a consolidated subsidiary of ours, coupled with the fact that the total base management fee paid to the Adviser pursuant to the Advisory Agreement cannot exceed 2.0% of total assets (as reduced by cash and cash equivalents pledged to creditors) during any given calendar year, we treat payment of the loan servicing as a pre-payment of the base management fee under the Advisory Agreement. Accordingly, these loan servicing fees are 100% voluntarily, unconditionally, and irrevocably credited back to us by the Adviser. 

Administration Agreement 

We pay the Administrator pursuant to the Administration Agreement for our allocable portion of the Administrator&#146;s expenses incurred while performing services to us, which are primarily rent and salaries and benefits expenses of the Administrator&#146;s employees, including, but not limited to, our chief financial officer and treasurer, chief valuation officer, chief compliance officer and general counsel and secretary (who also serves as the Administrator&#146;s president) and their respective staffs. Prior to July 1, 2014, our allocable portion of the expenses was generally derived by multiplying that portion of the Administrator&#146;s expenses allocable to all funds managed by the Adviser and serviced by the Administrator by the percentage of our total assets at the beginning of each quarter in comparison to the total assets at the beginning of each quarter of all funds managed by the Adviser and serviced by the Administrator. 

Effective July 1, 2014, our allocable portion of the Administrator&#146;s expenses are generally derived by multiplying the Administrator&#146;s total expenses by the approximate percentage of time during the current quarter the Administrator&#146;s employees performed services for us in relation to their time spent performing services for all companies serviced by the Administrator. These administrative fees are accrued at the end of the quarter when the services are performed and recorded in our accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and generally paid the following quarter. On July 14, 2015, our Board of Directors approved the annual renewal of the Administration Agreement through August 31, 2016. 

Other Transactions 

Mr. Gladstone also serves on the board of managers of our affiliate, Gladstone Securities, LLC (&#147;Gladstone Securities&#148;), a privately-held broker-dealer registered with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (&#147;FINRA&#148;) and insured by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation. Gladstone Securities is 100% indirectly owned and controlled by Mr. Gladstone and has provided other services, such as investment banking and due diligence services, to certain of our portfolio companies, for which Gladstone Securities 

&#160;

receives a fee. Any such fees paid by portfolio companies to Gladstone Securities do not impact the fees we pay to the Adviser or the voluntary, unconditional, and irrevocable credits against the base management fee. For additional information refer to Note 4 &#151; Related Party Transactions of the notes to our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements . 

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations 

RIC Status 

To qualify for treatment as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, we must generally distribute to our stockholders, for each taxable year, at least 90% of our ordinary income plus the excess of our net short-term capital gains over net long-term capital losses (&#147;Investment Company Taxable Income&#148;). We refer to this as the &#147;annual distribution requirement.&#148; We must also meet several additional requirements, including: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Business Development Company status. At all times during the taxable year, we must maintain our status as a BDC. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Income source requirements. At least 90% of our gross income for each taxable year must be from dividends, interest, payments with respect to securities loans, gains from sales or other dispositions of securities or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in securities, and net income derived from an interest in a qualified, publicly-traded partnership. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Asset diversification requirements. As of the close of each quarter of our taxable year: (1) at least 50% of the value of our assets must consist of cash, cash items, U.S. government securities, the securities of other regulated investment companies and other securities to the extent that (a) we do not hold more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of an issuer of such other securities and (b) such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5% of our total assets (the &#147;50% threshold&#148;), and (2) no more than 25% of the value of our total assets may be invested in the securities of one issuer (other than U.S. government securities or the securities of other regulated investment companies), or of two or more issuers that are controlled by us and are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses or in the securities of one or more qualified, publicly-traded partnerships. Failure to Qualify as a RIC 

If we are unable to qualify for treatment as a RIC, we would be subject to tax on all of our taxable income at regular corporate rates. We would not be able to deduct distributions to stockholders, nor would we be required to make such distributions. Distributions would be taxable to our stockholders as dividend income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. Subject to certain limitations under the Code, corporate distributees would be eligible for the dividends received deduction. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholder&#146;s adjusted tax basis, and then as a gain realized from the sale or exchange of property. If we fail to meet the RIC requirements for more than two consecutive years and then seek to requalify as a RIC, we generally would be subject to corporate-level federal income tax on any unrealized appreciation with respect to our assets to the extent that any such unrealized appreciation is recognized during the five-year period commencing on the first date on which we requalify as a RIC. 

Qualification as a RIC 

If we qualify as a RIC and distribute to stockholders each year in a timely manner at least 90% of our Investment Company Taxable Income, we will not be subject to federal income tax on the portion of our taxable income and gains we distribute to stockholders. We would, however, be subject to a 4% nondeductible federal excise tax if we do not distribute, actually or on a deemed basis, an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our ordinary income for the calendar year, (2) 98.2% of our capital gains in excess of capital losses for the one-year period ending on October 31 of the calendar year and (3) any ordinary income and capital gains in excess of capital losses for preceding years that were not distributed during such years. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we incurred $0.3 million, $0.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively, in excise taxes. As of March 31, 2016, our capital loss carryforward totaled $13.6 million. 

We will be subject to regular corporate income tax, currently at rates up to 35%, on any income that is not distributed or deemed to be distributed, including both ordinary income and capital gains. We may retain some or all of our long-term capital gains, but we generally intend to treat the retained amount as a deemed distribution. In that case, among other consequences, we will pay federal tax on the retained amount, each stockholder will be required to include its share of the deemed distribution in income as if it had been actually distributed to the stockholder and the stockholder will be entitled to claim a credit or refund equal to its allocable share of the tax we pay on the retained long-term capital gain. The amount of the deemed distribution, net of such tax, will be added to the stockholder&#146;s tax basis for its stock. Since we expect to pay federal tax on any retained long-term capital gains at our regular corporate capital gain tax rate, and since that rate is in excess of the maximum rate currently payable by individuals on long-term capital gains, the amount of tax that individual stockholders will be treated as having paid will exceed the tax they owe on the capital gain dividend 

&#160;

and such excess may be claimed as a credit or refund against the stockholder&#146;s other tax obligations. A stockholder that is not subject to U.S. federal income tax or tax on long-term capital gains would be required to file a U.S. federal income tax return on the appropriate form in order to claim a refund for the taxes we paid. In order to utilize the deemed distribution approach, we must provide written notice to the stockholders after the close of the relevant tax year. We will also be subject to alternative minimum tax, but any tax preference items would be apportioned between us and our stockholders in the same proportion that distributions, other than capital gain dividends, paid to each stockholder bear to our taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction. As of March 31, 2016, we have never made a deemed distribution. 

Taxation of Our U.S. Stockholders 

Distributions 

For any period during which we qualify as a RIC for federal income tax purposes, distributions to our stockholders attributable to our Investment Company Taxable Income generally will be taxable as ordinary income to stockholders to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits. We first allocate our earnings and profits to distributions to our preferred stockholders and then to distributions to our common stockholders based on priority in our capital structure. Any distributions in excess of our earnings and profits will first be treated as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholder&#146;s adjusted basis in his or her shares of stock and thereafter as gain from the sale of shares of our stock. Distributions of our long-term capital gains, reported by us as such, will be taxable to stockholders as long-term capital gains regardless of the stockholder&#146;s holding period of the stock and whether the distributions are paid in cash or invested in additional stock. Corporate stockholders are generally eligible for the 70% dividends received deduction with respect to dividends received from us, other than capital gains dividends, but only to the extent such amount is attributable to dividends received by us from taxable domestic corporations. 

Any distribution declared by us in October, November or December of any calendar year, payable to stockholders of record on a specified date in such a month and actually paid during January of the following year, will be treated as if it were paid by us and received by the stockholders on December 31 of the previous year. In addition, we may elect (in accordance with Section 855(a) of the Code) to relate a distribution back to the prior taxable year if we (1) declare such distribution prior to the later of the due date for filing our return for that taxable year or the 15 th day of the ninth month following the close of the taxable year, (2) make the election in that return, and (3) distribute the amount in the 12-month period following the close of the taxable year but not later than the first regular distribution payment of the same type following the declaration. Any such election will not alter the general rule that a stockholder will be treated as receiving a distribution in the taxable year in which the distribution is made, subject to the October, November, December rule described above. As of March 31, 2016, our Section 855(a) distributions were $6.9 million. 

If a common stockholder participates in our &#147;opt in&#148; dividend reinvestment plan, any distributions reinvested under the plan will be taxable to the common stockholder to the same extent, and with the same character, as if the common stockholder had received the distribution in cash. The common stockholder will have an adjusted basis in the additional common shares purchased through the plan equal to the amount of the reinvested distribution. The additional common shares will have a new holding period commencing on the day following the day on which the shares are credited to the common stockholder&#146;s account. The plan agent purchases shares in the open market in connection with the obligations under the plan. We do not have a dividend reinvestment plan for our preferred stockholders. 

Sale of Our Shares 

A U.S. stockholder generally will recognize taxable gain or loss if the U.S. stockholder sells or otherwise disposes of the shares of our common or preferred stock. Any gain arising from such sale or disposition generally will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. stockholder has held the shares for more than one year. Otherwise, it will be classified as short-term capital gain or loss. However, any capital loss arising from the sale or disposition of shares of our stock held for six months or less will be treated as long-term capital loss to the extent of the amount of capital gain dividends received, or undistributed capital gain deemed received, with respect to such shares. Under the tax laws in effect as of the date of this filing, individual U.S. stockholders are subject to a maximum federal income tax rate of 20% on their net capital gain (i.e. the excess of realized net long-term capital gain over realized net short-term capital loss for a taxable year) including any long-term capital gain derived from an investment in our shares. Such rate is lower than the maximum rate on ordinary income currently payable by individuals. Corporate U.S. stockholders currently are subject to federal income tax on net capital gain at the same rates applied to their ordinary income (currently up to a maximum of 35%). Capital losses are subject to limitations on use for both corporate and non-corporate stockholders. Certain U.S. stockholders who are individuals, estates or trusts generally are subject to a 3.8% Medicare tax on, among other things, dividends on, and capital gain from the sale or other disposition of, shares of our stock. 

&#160;

Backup Withholding and Other Required Withholding 

We may be required to withhold federal income tax, or backup withholding, currently at a rate of 28%, from all taxable distributions to any non-corporate U.S. stockholder (1) who fails to furnish us with a correct taxpayer identification number or a certificate that such stockholder is exempt from backup withholding, or (2) with respect to whom the Internal Revenue Service (&#147;IRS&#148;) notifies us that such stockholder has failed to properly report certain interest and dividend income to the IRS and to respond to notices to that effect. An individual&#146;s taxpayer identification number is generally his or her social security number. Any amount withheld under backup withholding is allowed as a credit against the U.S. stockholder&#146;s federal income tax liability, provided that proper information is provided to the IRS. 

The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (&#147;FATCA&#148;) imposes a federal withholding tax on certain types of payments made to &#147;foreign financial institutions&#148; and certain other non-U.S. entities unless certain due diligence, reporting, withholding, and certification obligation requirements are satisfied. Under delayed effective dates provided for in the Treasury Regulations and other IRS guidance, such required withholding will not begin until January 1, 2019 with respect to gross proceeds from a sale or other disposition of our stock. 

Regulation as a BDC 

We are a closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under Section 54 of the 1940 Act. As such, we are subject to regulation under the 1940 Act. The 1940 Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between BDCs and their affiliates, principal underwriters and affiliates of those affiliates or underwriters and requires that a majority of the directors be persons other than &#147;interested persons,&#148; as defined in the 1940 Act. In addition, the 1940 Act provides that we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or to withdraw our election as, a BDC unless approved by a majority of our outstanding &#147;voting securities,&#148; as defined in the 1940 Act. 

We intend to conduct our business so as to retain our status as a BDC. A BDC may use capital provided by public stockholders and from other sources to make long-term private investments in businesses. A BDC provides stockholders the ability to retain the liquidity of a publicly-traded stock while sharing in the possible benefits, if any, of investing in primarily privately owned companies. In general, a BDC must have been organized and have its principal place of business in the U.S. and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in qualifying assets, as described in Sections 55(a)(1) &#151; through (a)(3) of the 1940 Act. 

Qualifying Assets 

Under the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as qualifying assets, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets, other than certain interests in furniture, equipment, real estate, or leasehold improvements (&#147;Operating Assets&#148;) represent at least 70% of total assets, exclusive of Operating Assets. The types of qualifying assets in which we may invest under the 1940 Act include, but are not limited to, the following: 

&#160;

&#160; (1) Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer is an eligible portfolio company. An eligible portfolio company is generally defined in the 1940 Act as any issuer which: &#160;

&#160; (a) is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, any State or States in the U.S.; &#160;

&#160; (b) is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company wholly owned by the BDC or otherwise excluded from the definition of investment company); and &#160;

&#160; (c) satisfies one of the following: &#160;

&#160; (i) it does not have any class of securities with respect to which a broker or dealer may extend margin credit; &#160;

&#160; (ii) it is controlled by the BDC and for which an affiliate of the BDC serves as a director; &#160;

&#160; (iii) it has total assets of not more than $4 million and capital and surplus of not less than $2 million; &#160;

&#160; (iv) it does not have any class of securities listed on a national securities exchange; or &#160;

&#160; (v) it has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange, with an aggregate market value of outstanding voting and non-voting equity of less than $250 million. &#160;

&#160; (2) Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described in (1) above, or pursuant to the exercise of options, warrants or rights relating to such securities. &#160;

&#160; (3) Cash, cash items, government securities or high quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment. As of March 31, 2016, 99.1% of our assets were qualifying assets. 

&#160;

Asset Coverage 

Pursuant to Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act, we are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of senior securities representing indebtedness. However, pursuant to Section 18(c) of the 1940 Act, we are permitted to issue only one class of senior securities that is stock. In either case, we may only issue such senior securities if such class of senior securities, after such issuance, has an asset coverage, as defined in Section 18(h) of the 1940 Act, of at least 200%. 

In addition, our ability to pay dividends or distributions (other than dividends payable in our stock) to holders of any class of our capital stock would be restricted if our senior securities representing indebtedness fail to have an asset coverage of at least 200% (measured at the time of declaration of such distribution and accounting for such distribution). The 1940 Act does not apply this limitation to privately arranged debt that is not intended to be publicly distributed, unless this limitation is specifically negotiated by the lender. In addition, our ability to pay dividends or distributions (other than dividends payable in our common stock) to our common stockholders would be restricted if our senior securities that are stock fail to have an asset coverage of at least 200% (measured at the time of declaration of such distribution and accounting for such distribution). If the value of our assets declines, we might be unable to satisfy these asset coverage requirements. To satisfy the 200% asset coverage requirement in the event that we are seeking to pay a distribution, we might either have to (i) liquidate a portion of our loan portfolio to repay a portion of our indebtedness or (ii) issue common stock. This may occur at a time when a sale of a portfolio asset may be disadvantageous, or when we have limited access to capital markets on agreeable terms. In addition, any amounts that we use to service our indebtedness or for offering costs will not be available for distributions to our stockholders. If we are unable to regain asset coverage through these methods, we may be forced to suspend the payment of such dividends or distributions. 

Significant Managerial Assistance 

A BDC generally must make available significant managerial assistance to issuers of certain of its portfolio securities that the BDC counts as a qualifying asset for the 70% test described above. Making available significant managerial assistance means, among other things, any arrangement whereby the BDC, through its directors, officers or employees, offers to provide, and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company. Significant managerial assistance also includes the exercise of a controlling influence over the management and policies of the portfolio company. However, with respect to certain, but not all such securities, where the BDC purchases such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together, one of the other persons in the group may make available such managerial assistance, or the BDC may exercise such control jointly. 

Code of Ethics 

We and all of the Gladstone family of companies, have adopted a code of ethics and business conduct applicable to all of the officers, directors and personnel of such companies that complies with the guidelines set forth in Item 406 of Regulation S-K of the Securities Act of 1933 (the &#147;Securities Act&#148;) and Rule 17j-1 of the 1940 Act. As required by the 1940 Act, this code establishes procedures for personal investments, restricts certain transactions by such personnel and requires the reporting of certain transactions and holdings by such personnel. This code of ethics and business conduct is publicly available on our website under &#147;Corporate Governance&#148; at www.GladstoneInvestment.com. We intend to provide any required disclosure of any amendments to or waivers of the provisions of this code by posting information regarding any such amendment or waiver to our website or in a Current Report on Form 8-K. 

Compliance Policies and Procedures 

We and the Adviser have adopted and implemented written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of the federal securities laws, and our Board of Directors is required to review these compliance policies and procedures annually to assess their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation. We have designated a chief compliance officer, John Dellafiora, Jr., who also serves as chief compliance officer for all of our Gladstone affiliates. 

Staffing 

We do not currently have any employees and do not expect to have any employees in the foreseeable future. Currently, services necessary for our business are provided by individuals who are employees of the Adviser and the Administrator pursuant to the terms of the Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement, respectively. No employee of the Adviser or the Administrator will dedicate all of his or her time to us. However, we expect that 25 to 30 full time employees of the Adviser and the Administrator will spend substantial time on our matters during the remainder of calendar year 2016 and all of calendar year 2017. To the extent we acquire more investments, we anticipate that the number of employees of the Adviser and the Administrator who devote time to our matters will increase. 

&#160;

As of May 9, 2016, the Adviser and Administrator collectively had 66 full-time employees. A breakdown of these employees is summarized by functional area in the table below:
