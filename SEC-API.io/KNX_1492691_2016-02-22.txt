Company Overview 

Swift is a multi-faceted transportation services company, operating one of the largest fleets of truckload equipment in North America from over 40 &#32;terminals near key freight centers and traffic lanes. We principally operate in short- to medium-haul traffic lanes around our terminals and dedicated customer locations. During 2015 , our consolidated average operational truck count was 17,915 , which covered 2.2 billion &#32;miles for shippers throughout North America, contributing to consolidated operating revenue of $4.2 billion &#32;and consolidated operating income of $370.1 million . As of December 31, 2015 , our fleet was comprised of 15,211 &#32;company tractors and 4,653 &#32;owner-operator tractors, as well as 65,233 &#32;trailers and 9,150 &#32;intermodal containers. Our customers have the opportunity to "one-stop-shop" for their truckload transportation needs with our extensive suite of service offerings, which include line-haul services, dedicated customer contracts, temperature-controlled units, intermodal freight solutions, cross-border United States/Mexico and United States/Canada freight, flatbed hauling, freight brokerage and logistics, and others. 

Company Background 

Jerry Moyes, along with his father and brother, founded Swift Transportation Co., Inc. ("Swift Transportation") in 1966 with only one truck. In 1990, Swift Transportation went public on the NASDAQ stock market. 

&#8226; 

The 2007 Transactions &#32; &#8212; &#32; In April 2007, Mr. Moyes and his wife contributed their ownership of all of the issued and outstanding shares of IEL to Swift Corporation in exchange for additional Swift Corporation shares. In May 2007, the Moyes Affiliates, contributed their shares of Swift Transportation common stock to Swift Corporation in exchange for additional Swift Corporation shares. Swift Corporation then completed its acquisition of Swift Transportation through a merger on May 10, 2007, thereby acquiring the remaining outstanding shares of Swift Transportation common stock. Upon completion of the 2007 Transactions, Swift Transportation became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Swift Corporation. At the close of market on May 10, 2007, the common stock of Swift Transportation ceased trading on NASDAQ. 

&#8226; 

The IPO &#8212; &#32; On May 20, 2010, Swift Corporation formed Swift Transportation Company, a Delaware corporation. Swift Transportation Company did not engage in any business or other activities except in connection with its formation and the IPO and held no assets or subsidiaries prior to such offering. Immediately prior to the consummation of the IPO, Swift Corporation merged with and into Swift Transportation Company, with Swift Transportation Company surviving as a Delaware corporation. In the merger, all of the outstanding common stock of Swift Corporation was converted into shares of Swift Transportation Company Class B common stock on a one-for-one basis, and all outstanding stock options of Swift Corporation were converted into options to purchase shares of Class A common stock of Swift Transportation Company. All outstanding Class B shares are held by Mr. Moyes and the Moyes Affiliates. Swift Transportation Company went public on the NYSE in December 2010, at an initial trading price of $11.00 per share. 

&#8226; 

Central Acquisition &#8212; &#32; On August 6, 2013, Swift acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Central in a cash transaction. Jerry Moyes, our CEO and controlling stockholder, was the principal owner of Central. Given Mr. Moyes&#8217; interests in the temperature-controlled truckload industry, our Board established a special committee comprised solely of independent and disinterested directors in May of 2011 to evaluate Swift&#8217;s expansion of its temperature-controlled operations. The special committee evaluated alternative business opportunities, including organic growth and various acquisition targets, and negotiated the transaction contemplated by the stock purchase agreement, with the assistance of its independent financial advisors. Upon the unanimous recommendation of the special committee, the Central Acquisition was approved by the Board (with Mr. Moyes not participating in the vote). 

Central is a premium service truckload carrier specializing in temperature-controlled freight transportation and was a large provider of temperature-controlled truckload services in the United States. With the addition of Central to its dedicated temperature-controlled business, Swift is one of the largest temperature-controlled truckload providers in the United States. Our accounting treatment of the Central Acquisition and other details are discussed in Note 1 &#32;in Part II, Item 8, &#32;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Industry and Competition 

Truckload carriers represent the largest part of the transportation supply chain for most retail and manufactured goods in North America and typically transport a full trailer (or container) of freight for a single customer from origin to destination without intermediate sorting and handling. Generally, the truckload industry is compensated based on miles, whereas the LTL industry is compensated based on package size and/or weight. Overall, the United States trucking industry is large, fragmented, and highly competitive. We compete with thousands &#32;of truckload carriers, most of whom operate much smaller fleets than we do. To a lesser extent, our intermodal services, as well as our freight brokerage and logistics business, compete with railroads, LTL carriers, logistics providers, and other transportation companies. 

Our industry has encountered the following major economic cycles since 2000:

&#160; 

&#160; 

2010 &#8212; present 

moderate recovery. The industry freight data began to show positive trends for both volume and pricing. The slow, steady growth is a result of moderate increases in gross domestic product, coupled with a tighter supply of available tractors. Trends in supply of available tractors were lower due to several years of below average truck builds, an increase in truckload fleet bankruptcies in 2009 and 2010, increasing equipment prices due to stringent EPA requirements, less available credit, and less driver availability. 

The principal means of competition in our industry are customer service, capacity, and price. In times of strong freight demand, customer service and capacity become increasingly important, and in times of weak freight demand, pricing becomes increasingly important. Most truckload contracts (other than dedicated contracts) do not guarantee truck availability or load levels. Pricing is influenced by supply and demand. 

The trucking industry faces the following primary challenges, which we believe we are well-positioned to address, as discussed under "Our Competitive Strengths" and "Company Strategy," below: 

&#8226; 

uncertainty in the extent and duration of the current economic recovery; 

&#8226; 

potential reduction in driver pool from recent regulatory initiatives such as hours-of-service limitations for drivers, ELDs, and the FMCSA's CSA; 

&#8226; 

potential decreases in utilization from new or changing regulatory constraints on drivers that may further decrease the utilization of an already shrinking driver pool; 

&#8226; 

significant increases and rapid fluctuations in fuel prices; 

&#8226; 

increased prices for new revenue equipment, design changes of new engines, and volatility in the used equipment sales market; and 

&#8226; 

changing supply chain and consumer spending patterns.

SWIFT TRANSPORTATION COMPANY 

Our Competitive Strengths 

We aspire to achieve the themes of our mission and vision and believe our competitive strengths and strategies will enable us to attain our desired level of service to customers and results for our shareholders. We believe the following competitive strengths provide a solid platform for pursuing our goals and strategies: 

North American Truckload Leader with Broad Terminal Network and a &#160; Modern Fleet 

Our fleet size offers wide geographic coverage, while maintaining the efficiencies associated with significant traffic density within our operating regions. Our terminals are strategically located near key population centers, driver recruiting areas, and cross-border hubs, often in close proximity to our customers. This broad network offers benefits such as in-house maintenance, more frequent equipment inspections, localized driver recruiting, rapid customer response, and personalized marketing efforts. Our size allows us to achieve substantial economies of scale in purchasing items such as tractors, trailers, containers, fuel, and tires where pricing is volume-sensitive. We believe our scale also offers additional benefits in brand awareness and access to capital. 

Our company tractor fleet has an average age of 2.0 years for our approximately 11,200 core operating sleeper units. By maintaining a newer fleet than most of our industry competitors, we believe that we have the following advantages: 

&#8226; Newer tractors typically have fewer repairs and lower operating costs. 

&#8226; Newer tractors are available for dispatch more often. 

&#8226; Drivers are typically more attracted to newer tractors, which helps with driver recruiting and retention. 

&#8226; Many competitors that allowed their fleets to age excessively will likely face a deferred capital expenditure spike, accompanied by difficulty in replacing their tractors because new tractor prices have increased, the value received for the old tractors will be low, and financing sources have diminished. 

&#160; 

High Quality Customer Service and Extensive Suite of Services 

Our intense focus on customer satisfaction has helped us establish a strong platform for cross-selling our other services to our strong and diversified customer base. We believe customers continue to search for ways to better streamline their transportation management functions. We respond to this need by providing our customers with solutions that include a wide variety of shipping services, including general and specialized truckload, cross-border services, regional distribution, high-service dedicated operations, intermodal service, and surge capacity through fleet flexibility and brokerage and logistics operations. This breadth of service helps diversify our customer base and provides us with a competitive advantage, especially for customers with multiple needs and cross-border United States/Mexico and United States/Canada shipments. 

&#160; 

Strong Owner-operator Business 

We supplement our company tractor fleet with owner-operators, who own and operate their own tractors and are responsible for ownership and operating expenses. We believe that owner-operators provide significant advantages that primarily arise from the entrepreneurial motivation of business ownership. The owner-operators we contract with tend to be more experienced, have fewer accidents per million miles, and on average, produce higher weekly revenue per tractor than our company drivers. 

&#160; 

Leader in Driver Development 

Historically, driver recruiting and retention have been significant challenges for truckload carriers. To address these challenges, we employ nationwide recruiting efforts through our terminal network, operate eight driver academies, partner with third-party driver training facilities, provide drivers with modern tractors, and promote numerous driver satisfaction initiatives. 

&#160; 

Regional Operating Model 

Our short- and medium-haul regional operating model contributes to higher revenue per mile and takes advantage of shipping trends toward regional distribution. We also experience less competition in our short- and medium-haul regional business from railroads. In addition, our regional terminal network allows our drivers to be home more often, which assists with driver retention. 

&#160; 

Experienced Management, Aligned with Corporate Success 

Our management team has a proven track record of growth and cost control. Management focuses on disciplined execution and financial performance by measuring our progress through a combination of financial metrics. We align management&#8217;s priorities with our stockholders&#8217; through equity incentive awards and an annual performance-based bonus plan. 

&#32;&#32;&#32; Glossary of Terms 

SWIFT TRANSPORTATION COMPANY 

Company Strategy 

Our key financial goals include improving our asset utilization, controlling costs, growing Adjusted EPS (defined in "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" under Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations), improving return on net assets, and generating cash flow to reinvest in our business, repay debt and return capital to our stockholders. We align our company focus to attain these goals by implementing the following strategies, which we believe also serve to minimize the impact of challenges currently faced in the trucking industry. 

Profitable Revenue Growth 

To increase freight volumes and yield, we intend to further penetrate our existing customer base, cross-sell our services, pursue new customer opportunities by leveraging our outstanding customer service and extensive suite of truckload services, and effectively price fuel surcharges. &#160; In our pursuit to be best in class, we survey our customers and identify areas where we can accelerate the capture of new freight opportunities, improve our customers&#8217; experience, and profit from enhancing the value our customers receive. We are continuously refining our freight management tools to allocate our equipment to more profitable loads and complementary lanes. In addition to growth in our core over-the-road dry van truckload business, we are targeting expansion in the following areas: 

Dedicated Services and Private Fleet Outsourcing 

Dedicated contracts are often used by our customers with high-service and high-priority freight, sometimes to replace private fleets previously operated by them. The size and scale of our fleet and terminal network allows us to provide the equipment availability and high service levels required for dedicated contracts. We believe these opportunities will increase in times of scarce capacity in the truckload industry. 

Temperature-controlled 

With the acquisition of Central, we are now able to compete in the over-the-road temperature-controlled business to complement our dedicated temperature-controlled and our over-the-road dry van service offerings. Growth in the temperature-controlled market has kept pace with the dry van market over the past ten years, and many of our current customers have a need for this service. We believe the scale provided by the Central Acquisition and our ability to penetrate our existing customer base will provide us future opportunities in this growing market. 

Cross-border United States/Mexico and United States/Canada Freight 

The combination of our United States, cross-border, customs brokerage, and Mexican operations enables us to provide efficient door-to-door service between the United States and Mexico, as well as Canada. We believe our sophisticated load security measures, as well as our DHS status as a C-TPAT carrier, allow us to offer more efficient service than most competitors and afford us substantial advantages with major cross-border United States/Mexico and United States/Canada shippers. 

Freight Brokerage and Logistics 

We believe we have a substantial opportunity to continue to increase our non-asset-based freight brokerage and logistics services. We believe many customers increasingly seek transportation companies that offer both asset-based and non-asset-based services to ensure additional certainty that safe, secure and timely truckload service will be available on demand. We intend to continue growing our transportation management and freight brokerage capability to build market share, earn marginal revenue on more loads, and preserve our assets for the most attractive lanes and loads. 

Intermodal 

We have favorable intermodal agreements with most major North American rail carriers, which have helped increase our volumes through more competitive pricing. Our intermodal presence, which expanded to service Mexico in 2013, complements our regional operating model and allows us to better serve customers in longer haul lanes and reduce our investment in fixed assets. Our intermodal fleet has more than doubled its size since its inception in 2005. In the latter half of 2014, we added over 400 containers. With these additions, our capacity totals 9,150 containers as of December 31, 2015. 

Increase Asset Productivity and Return on Capital 

Because of our size and operating leverage, even small improvements in our asset productivity and yield can have a significant impact on our operating results. We believe we have substantial opportunity to improve the productivity and yield of our existing assets as follows: 

Disciplined Tractor Fleet Growth 

We will continue to focus on maintaining discipline regarding the timing and extent of company tractor fleet growth, based on availability of high-quality freight. 

Process Improvement and System Integration 

Successful implementation of process improvements and effective systems integration will achieve more efficient utilization of our tractors, trailers, and drivers' available hours of service. For example, our entire tractor fleet is retrofitted with ELDs, which we believe can help us more efficiently utilize our drivers' available hours-of-service. 

Tractor Utilization &#160; 

We use equipment pools, relays, team drivers and similar measures to improve company tractor utilization. 

Owner-operator Trucking Capacity 

On average, owner-operators produce higher weekly revenue per tractor than company drivers. As such, we continue to work on increasing the percentage of our trucking capacity provided by owner-operators. 

Elimination of Unproductive Assets &#160; 

Our return on capital improves as we successfully eliminate unproductive assets. 

&#32;&#32;&#32; Glossary of Terms 

SWIFT TRANSPORTATION COMPANY 

Continue to Focus on Efficiency and Cost Control 

To ensure that we respond appropriately to economic change, we closely manage our costs and capital resources and continually monitor the economic environment, as well as its potential impact on our customers and end-markets. We presently have ongoing efforts in the following areas that we expect will yield benefits in future periods: 

Tractor Capacity &#160; 

In order to balance freight flows and reduce deadhead miles, we manage the flow of our tractor capacity through our network. 

Driver Satisfaction 

Improving driver satisfaction typically reduces turnover costs and improves performance. We believe our driver development programs, including our driver academies and nationwide recruiting, will become increasingly advantageous to us in countering attrition effects stemming from noncompliance with internal policies and procedures, as well as recent regulatory initiatives (discussed below). In addition, we believe that the negative impact of such regulations will be partially mitigated by our average length of haul, regional terminal network, and less mileage-intensive operations, such as intermodal, dedicated, brokerage, and cross-border operations. 

Waste Reduction 

Reducing waste in shop methods and procedures and in other administrative processes remains important to us. 

Pursue Selected Acquisitions 

From time to time, we take advantage of opportunities to add complementary operations to our company by pursuing acquisitions. Acquisitions can provide us an opportunity to expand our fleet with customer revenue and drivers already in place. In our history, we have completed 13 acquisitions, including Central in 2013, most of which were immediately integrated into our existing business. Given our size in relation to most competitors, we expect most future acquisitions to be integrated quickly. 

We believe that by achieving profitable revenue growth, improving asset utilization, continuing to control costs, and streamlining our processes, we will be able to grow our Adjusted EPS and our return on net assets, while generating free cash flow to reinvest in our business, repay debt, reduce our leverage ratio and return capital to our stockholders. These goals are in part dependent on continued improvement in industry-wide truckload volumes and pricing. Although we expect the economic environment and capacity constraints in our industry to support achievement of our goals, we have limited ability to affect industry volumes and pricing and cannot provide assurance that this environment will sustain. Nevertheless, we believe our competitive strengths and the current supply and demand environment in the truckload industry are aligned to support the achievement of our goals through the strategies outlined above. 

Information by Segment and Geography 

&#8226; 

Segments &#8212; &#32;Our four reportable segments are Truckload, Dedicated, Swift Refrigerated (formerly Central Refrigerated) and Intermodal. Segment information is provided in Notes &#32; 2 &#32;and 25 &#32;to the consolidated financial statements, including accounting and reporting policy, segment definitions, and financial information. Supplementary segment information is available in Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." 

&#8226; 

Geography &#8212; &#32; The required disclosures relating to revenue and long-lived assets by geography are included in Note 25 &#32;to the consolidated financial statements. Income tax information by geography is included in Note 20 &#32;to the consolidated financial statements. 

Customers and Marketing 

&#8226; 

Customers &#8212; &#32; Our customers are typically large corporations in the retail (including discount and online retail), food and beverage, consumer products, paper products, transportation and logistics, housing and building, automotive, and manufacturing industries. Many of our customers have extensive operations, geographically distributed locations, and diverse shipping needs. Customer satisfaction is an important priority for us, which is demonstrated by the numerous "carrier of the year" or similar awards received from our customers over the past several years. Such achievements have helped us maintain a large and stable customer base featuring Fortune 500 and other leading companies from a number of different industries. Consistent with industry practice, our typical customer contracts (other than dedicated contracts) do not guarantee shipment volumes by our customers or truck availability by us. This affords us and our customers some flexibility to negotiate rates in response to changes in freight demand and industry-wide truck capacity. We believe our fleet capacity, terminal network, customer service and breadth of services offer a competitive advantage to major shippers, particularly in times of rising freight volumes when shippers must quickly access capacity across multiple facilities and regions.

(1) Excludes 4,653 &#32;owner-operator tractors. 

&#32;&#32;&#32; Glossary of Terms 

SWIFT TRANSPORTATION COMPANY 

We typically purchase or lease tractors and trailers manufactured to our specifications. We follow a comprehensive maintenance program designed to reduce downtime and enhance the resale value of our equipment. We have major maintenance facilities in the following locations: 

&#8226; 

Phoenix, Arizona 

&#8226; 

Memphis, Tennessee 

&#8226; 

Greer, South Carolina 

&#8226; 

West Valley City, Utah 

&#8226; 

Columbus, Ohio 

&#8226; 

Laredo, Texas 

In addition to these maintenance facilities, we perform routine servicing and maintenance of our revenue equipment at most of our regional terminal facilities, in an effort to avoid costly on-road repairs and deadhead miles. The contracts governing our equipment purchases typically contain specifications of equipment, projected delivery dates, warranty terms, and trade or return conditions, and are cancelable upon 60 &#32;to 90 &#32;days' notice without penalty. 

In 2015, we accelerated our tractor trade-in cycle from an average of 48 to 72 months to an average of 36 &#32;to 48 &#32;months, depending on equipment type and usage. We believe that our newer equipment has enhanced features, which tend to lower the overall life cycle costs by reducing safety-related expenses, lowering repair and maintenance expenses, improving fuel economy and improving driver satisfaction. In 2016 and beyond, we will continue to monitor the appropriateness of this shorter tractor trade-in cycle against the lower capital expenditure and financing costs of a longer tractor trade-in cycle, based on current and future business needs. 

Technology 

We equip virtually all of our trucks with certain OmniTRACS tm &#32;technologies that enhance communication between the regional terminals and corporate headquarters, as well as the added benefits of ELDs, text-to-voice messaging, and turn-by-turn directions designed specifically for our industry. This allows us to alter driver routes rapidly, in case of urgent customer requests, adverse weather conditions, road closures or other potential delays. It also enables our drivers to timely communicate route status or the need for emergency repairs. These technologies have afforded us additional productivity, improved safety, and increased customer and driver satisfaction. 

We reduce costs through programs that manage equipment maintenance, select fuel purchasing locations in our nationwide network of terminals and approved truck stops, and inform us of inefficient or undesirable driving behaviors that are monitored and reported through electronic engine sensors and cameras. We believe our technologies and systems are superior to those employed by most of our smaller competitors. 

Our trailers and containers are equipped with tracking devices that monitor locations of empty and loaded equipment via satellite. Notification is sent to us if a unit is moved outside of the electronic geofence encasing on each piece of equipment. This enables us to identify unused or hijacked units, enhance our ability to charge for units detained by customers, and reduce theft. 

Employees 

The strength of our company is our people, working together with common goals. There were approximately 20,800 &#32;full-time employees in our total headcount of approximately 21,000 &#32;employees as of December 31, 2015 , which was comprised of: 

Company drivers (including driver trainees) 

15,850 

Technicians and other equipment maintenance personnel 

1,200 

Support personnel (such as corporate managers, sales, and administrative personnel) 

3,950 

Total 

21,000 

As of December 31, 2015 , our 819 &#32;Trans-Mex drivers in Mexico were our only employees represented by a union. 

&#8226; 

Company Drivers &#8212; &#32; All of our drivers must meet specific guidelines relating primarily to safety records, driving experience, and personal evaluations, including a physical examination and mandatory drug and alcohol testing. Upon hire, drivers are trained in our policies, operations, safety techniques, and fuel-efficient operation of the equipment. All new drivers must pass a safety test and have a current CDL. In addition, we have ongoing driver efficiency and safety programs to ensure that our drivers comply with our safety procedures. 

We have established eight driver academies across the United States. Our academies are strategically located in areas where external driver-training organizations were lacking. In other areas of the United States, we have contracted with driver-training schools, which are managed by third parties. There are certain minimum qualifications for candidates to be accepted into the 

&#32;&#32;&#32; Glossary of Terms 

SWIFT TRANSPORTATION COMPANY 

academy, including passing the DOT physical examination and drug/alcohol screening. Students are required to complete three weeks of instructor-led study/training and then spend a minimum of 200 behind-the-wheel hours, driving with an experienced trainer. 

In order to attract and retain qualified drivers and promote safe operations, we purchase high quality tractors equipped with optional comfort and safety features. We base our drivers at terminals and monitor each driver&#8217;s location in order to schedule routing for our drivers so they can return home regularly. The majority of company drivers are compensated based on industry standard dispatched miles, loading/unloading, and number of stops or deliveries, plus bonuses. The driver&#8217;s base pay per mile increases with the driver&#8217;s length of experience. Our driver ranking system measures safety, compliance, customer service, and number of miles driven. Higher rankings provide drivers with additional benefits and/or privileges, such as special recognition, the ability to self-select freight, and the opportunity for increased pay. 

Upon enrollment eligibility, drivers employed by us may participate in company-sponsored health, life and dental insurance plans and participate in our 401(k) and employee stock purchase plans. 

&#8226; 

Terminal Staff &#8212; Our larger terminals are staffed with terminal leaders, fleet leaders, driver leaders, planners, safety coordinators and customer service representatives. Our terminal leaders work with driver leaders, customer service representatives, and other operations personnel to coordinate the needs of both our customers and our drivers. Terminal leaders are also responsible for soliciting new customers and serving existing customers in their areas. Each fleet leader supervises approximately five driver leaders at our larger terminals. Each driver leader is responsible for the general operation of approximately 40 trucks and their drivers, focusing on driver retention, productivity per truck, routing, fuel consumption and efficiency, safety, and scheduled maintenance. Customer service representatives are assigned specific customers to ensure specialized, high-quality service and frequent customer contact. 

Owner-Operators 

In addition to Swift-employed company drivers, we enter into contractor agreements with third parties who own and operate tractors (or hire their own drivers to operate the tractors) that service our customers. We pay these owner-operators for their services, based on a contracted rate per mile. By operating safely and productively, owner-operators can improve their own profitability and ours. Owner-operators are responsible for most costs incurred for owning and operating their tractors. For convenience, we offer owner-operators maintenance services at our in-house shops and fuel at our terminals at competitive and attractive prices. As of December 31, 2015 , owner-operators comprised approximately 23% &#32;of our total fleet, as measured by tractor count. 

We offer tractor financing to independent owner-operators through our financing subsidiaries. Our financing subsidiaries generally lease premium equipment from the original equipment manufacturers and sublease the equipment to owner-operators. The owner-operators are qualified for financing, based on their driving and safety records. In the event of default, our financing subsidiaries have the option to repossess the tractor and sublease it to a replacement owner-operator. 

Safety and Insurance 

We take pride in our safety-oriented culture and maintain an active safety and loss-prevention program, which is led by regional safety management personnel at each of our terminals. We also equip our tractors with many safety features, such as roll-over stability devices and critical-event recorders, to help prevent, or reduce the severity of, accidents. We self-insure for a significant portion of our claims exposure and related expenses. We currently carry six main types of insurance, which generally have the following self-insured retention amounts, maximum benefits per claim, and other limitations:

SWIFT TRANSPORTATION COMPANY 

We insure certain casualty risks through our wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiaries, Mohave and Red Rock. Mohave and Red Rock provide reinsurance associated with a share of our automobile liability risk. In addition to insuring a proportionate share of our corporate casualty risk, Mohave provides reinsurance coverage to third-party insurance companies associated with our affiliated companies&#8217; owner-operators. 

While under dispatch and our operating authority, the owner-operators we contract with are covered by our liability coverage and self-insurance retention limits. However, each is responsible for physical damage to his or her own equipment, occupational accident coverage and liability exposure while the truck is used for non-company purposes. Additionally, fleet operators are responsible for any applicable workers&#8217; compensation requirements for their employees. 

We regulate the speed of our company tractors to a maximum of 62 miles per hour and for safety reasons have contractually agreed with owner-operators to limit their speed to 68 miles per hour. These adopted speed limits are below the limits established by statute in many states. We believe our adopted speed limits for company drivers reduce the frequency and severity of accidents, enhance fuel efficiency, and reduce maintenance expense, when compared to operating without our imposed speed limits. Substantially all of our company tractors are equipped with electronically-controlled engines that are set to limit the speed of the vehicle. 

Fuel 

We actively manage our fuel purchasing network in an effort to maintain adequate fuel supplies and reduce our fuel costs. Additionally, we utilize a fuel surcharge program to pass a majority of increases in fuel costs to our customers. In 2015 , we purchased 17% &#32;of our fuel in bulk at 57 &#32;Swift and dedicated customer locations across the United States and Mexico. We purchased substantially all of the remainder through a network of retail truck stops with which we have negotiated volume purchasing discounts. The volumes we purchase at terminals and through the fuel network vary based on procurement costs and other factors. We seek to reduce our fuel costs by routing our drivers to truck stops when fuel prices at such stops are cheaper than the bulk rate paid for fuel at our terminals. We store fuel in underground storage tanks at two of our bulk fueling terminals and in above-ground storage tanks at our other bulk fueling terminals. We believe that we are sufficiently in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations relating to the storage and dispensing of fuel. 

Seasonality 

In the truckload industry, results of operations generally show a seasonal pattern. As customers ramp up for the year-end holiday season, the late third and fourth quarters have historically been our strongest volume quarters. As customers reduce shipments after the winter holiday season, the first quarter has historically been a lower volume quarter for us than the other three quarters. In recent years, the macro consumer buying patterns combined with shippers&#8217; supply chain management, which historically contributed to the fourth quarter "peak" season, continued to evolve. As a result, our fourth quarter 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;volumes were more evenly disbursed throughout the quarter rather than peaking early in the quarter. In the eastern and mid-western United States, and to a lesser extent in the western United States, during the winter season our equipment utilization typically declines and operating expenses generally increase, with fuel efficiency declining because of engine idling and severe weather sometimes creating higher accident frequency, increased claims, and more equipment repairs. Revenue may also be affected by holidays as a result of curtailed operations or vacation shutdowns, because our revenue is directly related to available working days of shippers. From time to time, we also suffer short-term impacts from severe weather and similar events, such as tornadoes, hurricanes, blizzards, ice storms, floods, fires, earthquakes, and explosions that could harm our results of operations or make our results of operations more volatile. 

Environmental Regulation 

General &#8212; We have bulk fuel storage and fuel islands at many of our terminals, as well as vehicle maintenance, repair, and washing operations at some of our facilities, which exposes us to certain environmental risks. Soil and groundwater contamination have occurred at some of our facilities in prior years, for which we have been responsible for remediating the environmental contamination. Also, less than one percent of our total shipments contain hazardous materials, which are generally rated as low- to medium-risk. In the past, we have been responsible for the costs of clean-up of cargo and diesel fuel spills caused by traffic accidents or other events. 

We have instituted programs to monitor and mitigate environmental risks and maintain compliance with applicable environmental laws dealing with the hauling, handling and disposal of hazardous materials, fuel spillage or seepage, emissions from our vehicles and facilities, engine-idling, discharge and retention of storm water, and other environmental matters. As part of our safety and risk management program, we periodically perform internal environmental reviews. We are a Charter Partner in the EPA&#8217;s SmartWay Transport Partnership, a voluntary program promoting energy efficiency and air quality. We believe that our operations are sufficiently in compliance with current laws and regulations and do not know of any existing environmental condition that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business or operating results. 

&#32;&#32;&#32; Glossary of Terms 

SWIFT TRANSPORTATION COMPANY 

If we are held responsible for the cleanup of any environmental incidents caused by our operations or business, or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to liabilities, including substantial fines or penalties or civil and criminal liability. We have paid penalties for spills and violations in the past. 

Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Fuel Efficiency Standards &#8212; &#32;In 2008 the State of California's Air Resources Board ("ARB") approved the Heavy-Duty Vehicle GHG Emission Reduction Regulation in efforts to reduce GHG emissions from certain long-haul tractor-trailers that operate in California by requiring them to utilize technologies that improve fuel efficiency (regardless of where the vehicle is registered). The regulation required owners of long-haul tractors and 53-foot trailers to replace or retrofit their vehicles with aerodynamic technologies and low rolling resistance tires. The regulation also contained certain emissions and registration standards for refrigerated trailer operators. 

Thereafter, the United States EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ("NHTSA") began taking coordinated steps in support of a new generation of clean vehicles and engines through reduced GHG emissions and improved fuel efficiency at a national level. 

&#8226; 

Phase 1: &#32;In September 2011, the United States EPA finalized federal regulations for controlling GHG emissions, beginning with model-year 2014 medium- and heavy-duty engines and vehicles and increasing in stringency through model-year 2018. The federal regulations relate to efficient engines, use of auxiliary power units, mass reduction, low rolling resistance tires, improved aerodynamics, improved transmissions and reduced accessory loads. 

In December 2013, California's ARB approved regulations to align its GHG emission standards and test procedures, as well as its tractor-trailer GHG regulation, with the federal Phase 1 GHG regulation. 

&#8226; 

Phase 2: In June 2015, the EPA and NHTSA, working in concert with California's ARB, formally announced a proposed national program establishing Phase 2 of the GHG emissions and fuel efficiency standards for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles for model-year 2018 and beyond. Phase 2 builds upon Phase 1, and would apply to certain trailer types beginning with model-year 2018 for EPA standards (voluntary for NHTSA standards through model-year 2020). Tractors and certain trailer types would be subject to the Phase 2 standards beginning with model-year 2021, increasing in stringency through model-year 2024, and phasing in completely by model-year 2027. 

Current and proposed GHG regulations could impact us by increasing the cost of new tractors, impairing productivity, and increasing our operating expenses. 

Climate-change Proposals &#8212; &#32; Federal and state lawmakers are considering a variety of climate-change proposals related to carbon emissions and GHG emissions. The proposals could potentially limit carbon emissions for certain states and municipalities, which continue to restrict the location and amount of time that diesel-powered tractors (like ours) may idle. 

Industry Regulation 

Our operations are regulated and licensed by various federal, state and local government agencies in North America, including the DOT, the FMCSA, and the DHS, among others. Our company, as well as our drivers and contracted owner-operators, must comply with enacted governmental regulations regarding safety, equipment, environmental protection, and operating methods. Examples include regulation of equipment weight, equipment dimensions, fuel emissions, driver hours-of-service, driver eligibility requirements, on-board reporting of operations, and ergonomics. &#32;&#32;The following discussion presents recently enacted federal, state and local regulations that have an impact on our operations. 

&#8226; 

Hours-of-service &#8212; &#32; In December 2011, the FMCSA released its final rule on hours-of-service, which was effective on July 1, 2013. The key provisions included: 

&#9702; 

retaining the current 11-hour daily driving time limit; 

&#9702; 

reducing the maximum number of hours a truck driver can work within a week from 82 hours to 70 hours; and 

&#9702; 

limiting the number of consecutive driving hours a truck driver can work to eight hours before requiring the driver to take a 30 minute break. 

Since 2004 the hours-of-service rules allowed drivers to restart their duty-cycle clocks every 34 hours to begin a new work week. From July 2013 through December 2014, the FMCSA required that drivers include 1:00 a.m. to 5:00 a.m. on consecutive days for applying the restart, which was also capped at once per week, or 168 hours. On December 13, 2014, Congress passed the fiscal year 2015 Omnibus Appropriations bill, which temporarily suspended enforcement of the 1:00 to 5:00 am provision and the 168-hour rule until September 30, 2015. The restart provision was again suspended on December 18, 2015, when Congress passed the fiscal year 2016 Omnibus Appropriations bill. All other provisions of the hours-of-service rules that went into effect on July 1, 2013 remained unchanged. A study on the effectiveness of the suspended restart provisions was recently completed. The FMCSA could move to reinstate these provisions or request that Congress remove the suspension.

BASICs &#8212; &#32;In December 2010, the FMCSA introduced a new enforcement and compliance model that ranks both fleets and individual drivers on seven categories of safety-related data, eventually replacing the current SafeStat model. The seven categories of safety-related data, known as BASICs, currently include Unsafe Driving, Fatigued Driving (hours-of-service), Driver Fitness, Controlled Substances/Alcohol, Vehicle Maintenance, Hazardous Materials Compliance, and Crash Indicator. 

Certain BASICs information was initially published and made available to carriers, as well as the general public. However, in December 2015, as part of the Fixing America's Surface Transportation ("FAST") Act, Congress mandated that the FMCSA remove all CSA scores from public view until a more comprehensive study regarding the effectiveness of BASICs improving truck safety can be completed. Swift scored within the acceptable level in the safety-related categories, based on our CSA rankings. 

Implementation and effective dates are unclear, as there is currently no proposed rulemaking with respect to BASICs, leaving SafeStat the authoritative safety measurement system in effect. We currently have a satisfactory SafeStat DOT rating, which is the best available rating under the current safety rating scale. 

&#8226; 

Safety Fitness Determination &#32; &#8212; &#32; In January 2016, the FMCSA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking ("NPRM") in the Federal Register, regarding carrier safety fitness determination. The NPRM proposes new methodologies that would determine when a motor carrier is not fit to operate a CMV. Key proposed changes included in the NPRM are as follows: 

&#9702; 

There would be only one safety rating of "unfit," as compared to the current rules, which have three safety ratings (satisfactory, conditional, and unsatisfactory). 

&#9702; 

Carriers could be determined "unfit" by failing two or more BASICs, investigation results, or a combination of the two. 

&#9702; 

Stricter standards would be used for BASICs with a higher correlation to crash risk (Unsafe Driving and Hours-of-Service Compliance). 

&#9702; 

All investigation results would be used, not just results from comprehensive on-site reviews. 

&#9702; 

Violations of a revised list of "critical" and "acute" safety regulations would result in failing a BASIC. 

&#9702; 

Carriers would be assessed monthly. 

The FMCSA estimates that the proposed rule would increase the number of carriers determined to be "unfit" by more than two and a half times. 

&#8226; 

Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Bill &#8212; &#32;On July 6, 2012, Congress passed the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21 st &#32;Century bill into law. Included in the highway bill was a provision that mandates ELDs in commercial motor vehicles to record hours-of-service. During 2012, the FMCSA published a Supplemental NPRM, announcing its plan to proceed with the ELDs and hours-of-service supporting documents rulemaking. In December 2015, the ELD rule became final, as published in the Federal Register. Although the final ELD rule may have a large impact on the industry as a whole, we do not expect a significant impact on Swift, as we previously installed ELDs in our operational trucks in conjunction with our efforts to improve efficiency and communications with drivers and owner-operators. 

&#8226; 

Prohibiting Coercion of Commercial Motor Vehicle Drivers &#8212; &#32; In November 2015, the Prohibiting Coercion of Commercial Motor Vehicle Drivers rule became final, as published in the Federal Register and adopted by the FMCSA. The rule explicitly prohibits motor carriers from coercing drivers to violate certain FMCSA regulations, including driver hours-of-service limits, CDL regulations, drug and alcohol testing rules, and hazardous materials regulations, among others. Under the new rule, drivers can report incidents of coercion to the FMCSA, who is authorized to issue penalties against the motor carrier. 

Other Regulation 

&#8226; 

The TSA &#8212; &#32; In the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, federal, state and municipal authorities implemented and continue to implement various security measures on large trucks, including checkpoints and travel restrictions. The TSA adopted regulations that require drivers applying for or renewing a license for carrying hazardous materials to obtain a TSA determination that they are not a security threat. 

&#8226; 

WOTC &#8212; &#32; In December 2014, United States President, Barack Obama, signed the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 ("TIPA"). Among other things, TIPA extended 50% bonus depreciation and the Work Opportunity Tax Credit ("WOTC"). In December 2015, President Obama signed the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes ("PATH") Act of 2015. Among other things, PATH further extended 50% bonus depreciation and WOTC. The financial impact of these regulations is discussed in Note 20 &#32;in Part II, Item 8.
