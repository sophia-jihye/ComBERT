 Item 1. Business . 

(a) General Development of Business 

During October 2013, the Board of Directors of Liberty Interactive Corporation and its subsidiaries (&#8220;Liberty&#8221;) authorized a plan to distribute to the stockholders of Liberty&#8217;s Liberty Ventures common stock shares of a newly-formed company, Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings, Inc. (&#8220;TripCo&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) (the &#8220;Trip Spin-Off&#8221;). TripCo holds the subsidiaries TripAdvisor, Inc. (&#8220;TripAdvisor&#8221;) and BuySeasons, Inc., which includes the retail businesses of BuyCostumes.com and Celebrate Express (&#8220;BuySeasons&#8221;), both of which operate as stand-alone operating entities. Both TripAdvisor and BuySeasons have more revenue in the third quarter, based on a higher travel research period and the Halloween period, respectively, as compared to the other quarters of the year. The Trip Spin-Off was completed on August 27, 2014 and effected as a pro-rata dividend of shares of TripCo to the stockholders of Series A and Series B Liberty Ventures common stock of Liberty. 

Spin-Off of TripCo from Liberty Interactive Corporation 

Following the Trip Spin-Off, Liberty and TripCo operate as separate, publicly traded companies, and neither has any stock ownership, beneficial or otherwise, in the other. In connection with the Trip Spin-Off, TripCo entered into certain agreements, including the reorganization agreement, the services agreement, the facilities sharing agreement and the tax sharing agreement, with Liberty and/or Liberty Media Corporation (&#8220;Liberty Media&#8221;) (or certain of their subsidiaries) in order to govern certain of the ongoing relationships between the companies after the Trip Spin-Off and to provide for an orderly transition. 

The reorganization agreement provides for, among other things, the principal corporate transactions (including the internal restructuring) required to effect the Trip Spin-Off, certain conditions to the Trip Spin-Off and provisions governing the relationship between TripCo and Liberty with respect to and resulting from the Trip Spin-Off. 

Pursuant to the services agreement, Liberty Media provides TripCo with general and administrative services including legal, tax, accounting, treasury and investor relations support. TripCo will reimburse Liberty Media for direct, out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Liberty Media in providing these services and TripCo will pay a services fee to Liberty Media under the services agreement that will be subject to adjustment semi-annually, as necessary. 

Under the facilities sharing agreement, TripCo will share office space with Liberty, Liberty Media and Liberty Broadband Corporation (&#8220;LBC&#8221;) and related amenities at Liberty Media&#8217;s corporate headquarters in Englewood, Colorado. 

The tax sharing agreement provides for the allocation and indemnification of tax liabilities and benefits between Liberty and TripCo and other agreements related to tax matters. Pursuant to the tax sharing agreement, TripCo has agreed to indemnify Liberty, subject to certain limited exceptions, for losses and taxes resulting from the Trip Spin-Off to the extent such losses or taxes result primarily from, individually or in the aggregate, the breach of certain restrictive covenants made by TripCo (applicable to actions or failures to act by TripCo and its subsidiaries following the completion of the Trip Spin-Off). 

In October 2014, the Internal Revenue Service (&#8220;IRS&#8221;) completed its examination of the Trip Spin-Off and notified Liberty that it agreed with the nontaxable characterization of the transaction. Liberty executed a Closing Agreement with the IRS documenting this conclusion in 2015.

I- 3 

&#160;

TripAdvisor branded sites are comprehensive online resource s for user-generated content on destinations, lodging, restaurants and attractions. To help its users plan and book their trips, TripAdvisor&#8217;s websites feature 320 million reviews and opinions on accommodations, restaurants and attractions, including more than 50 million candid photos, and helpful content ranging from hotel room tips to travel guides. TripAdvisor provides real-time pricing and availability search functionality that compares hundreds of partner websites and enables users to book hotels, activities , attractions and make restaurant reservations through its site s . The tools and information TripAdvisor provides are available in 28 different languages on web-based and mobile applications on mobile devices and desktops. In order to achieve its goals, TripAdvisor leverages its key assets: a robust travel community, rich user-generated content, continuous technological innovation and global reach. 

TripAdvisor derives the majority of its revenue from the sale of advertising, primarily through click-based advertising and, to a lesser extent, display-based advertising. The remainder of its revenue is generated through a combination of subscription and transaction-based offerings, and other revenue including content licensing. In the year ended December 31, 2015, TripAdvisor earned &#160; $956 million of revenue from click-based advertising, $159 million in revenue from display-based advertising and $377 million in revenue from subscription-based offerings, transaction revenue and other revenue. 

TripAdvisor has click-based advertising relationships with the vast majority of the leading online travel agencies globally as well as a variety of other travel suppliers pursuant to which these companies purchase traveler leads from it, generally on a cost-per-click (&#8220; CPC &#8221;) basis. These click-based advertising relationships are strategically important to it and most can be terminated by the advertiser at will or on short notice. 

TripAdvisor&#8217;s systems infrastructure, web and database servers for TripAdvisor branded websites are housed at two geographically separate facilities and have multiple communication links as well as continuous monitoring and engineering support. Each facility is fully self-sufficient and operational with its own hardware, networking, software, and content, and is structured in an active/passive, fully redundant configuration. Substantially all of its software components, data, and content are replicated in multiple datacenters and development centers, as well as being backed up at offsite locations. TripAdvisor&#8217;s systems are monitored and protected though multiple layers of security. Several of its individual subsidiaries and businesses, including Viator , have their own data infrastructure and technology teams. 

Business Model 

TripAdvisor&#8217;s platforms connect users wishing to plan and book the best travel experiences with providers of travel accommodations and travel services around the world. TripAdvisor derives the majority of its revenue from the sale of advertising, primarily through click-based advertising and, to a lesser extent, display-based advertising. The remainder of TripAdvisor&#8217;s revenue is generated through a combination of subscription and transaction-based offerings as well as content licensing. 

&#183; 

Click-Based Advertising Revenue. TripAdvisor&#8217;s largest source of revenue is click-based advertising, which includes links to its partners&#8217; booking sites and contextually-relevant branded and unbranded text links. Its click-based advertising partners are predominantly online travel agencies, or OTAs, and direct suppliers in the hotel, airline and cruise product categories. Click-based advertising is generally priced on a cost-per-click, or CPC, basis, with payments from advertisers based on the number of users who click on each type of link. CPC prices are determined in a bidding process that allows TripAdvisor&#8217;s partners to use its proprietary system to submit CPC bids to have their rates and availability listed on TripAdvisor&#8217;s site. When a partner submits a CPC bid they agree to pay the amount of that bid each time a user subsequently clicks on the URL link to the partner&#8217;s website. Bids are submitted periodically &#8211; sometimes as often as daily or weekly &#8211; on a property-by-property basis and the size of the bid relative to other bids received determines the partner&#8217;s placement in all metasearch placements on TripAdvisor&#8217;s site with one or more offers shown, including hotel comparison search results and the property detail page. The system is automated and the size of the partner&#8217;s bid is the only factor impacting the partner&#8217;s placement on that page, except that individual partners may be sorted lower in the event that they have not provided price information or if they cease to have availability for the property. Click-based advertising revenue also includes revenue from TripAdvisor&#8217;s instant booking feature, which enab les the merchant of record, generally an OTA or hotel partner , to pay a 

I- 4 

&#160;

commission rate for a user that completes a reservation on TripAdvisor. Instant booking revenue is current ly recognized under two different models: the transaction mode l and the consumption model. Under the transaction model , commission revenue is recorded at the time a traveler books a hotel reservation on TripAdvisor&#8217;s site with one of its transaction partners. TripAdvisor&#8217;s transaction pa rtners are liable for commissi on payment to TripAdvisor upon booking and the partner assumes the cancel lation risk. When a traveler makes a hotel reservation on TripAdvisor&#8217;s site with one of its consumption partners, revenue is not recorded until the travelers&#8217; stay. TripAdvisor&#8217;s consumption partners are liable for commission payment upon the complet ion of stay by the traveler. Online travel agencies, hotel partner placement and comparative hotel prices available to the traveler in the booking process under both models are determined in a bidding process in TripAdvisor&#8217;s proprietary system , based on a number of variables including commission rates , depending on the specific hotel selected. &#160; For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, TripAdvisor earned $956 million, $870 million, and $696 million, respectively, of revenue from click-based advertising. 

&#183; 

Display-Based Advertising Revenue. Advertising partners can promote their brands in a contextually-relevant manner through a variety of display-based advertising placements on TripAdvisor&#8217;s websites. While its display-based advertising clients are predominately direct suppliers in the hotel, airline and cruise categories as well as OTA s, TripAdvisor also accepts display advertising from destination marketing organizations, casinos, resorts and attractions, as well as advertisers from non-travel categories. Display-based advertising is sold predominately on a cost per thousand impressions, or CPM, basis. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, TripAdvisor earned $159 million, $140 million and $119 million, respectively, in revenue from display-based advertising. 

&#183; 

Subscription-Based, Transaction -Based and Other Revenue. Business Listings is a subscription-based advertising product offered to hotels, B&#38;Bs and other specialty lodging properties. This advertising product is sold for a flat fee and allows subscribers to list, for a contracted period of time, a website URL, email address and phone number on TripAdvisor-branded websites, as well as to post special offers for travelers. In addition, TripAdvisor earns revenue from making hotel room nights available for booking on its transaction -based sites, including Jetsetter and Tingo , for which TripAdvisor is the merchant of record; making ren tal listings available through its vacation rentals business; selling destination activities primarily through Viator; and providing access to online restaurant reservations primarily through Lafourchette , or thefork.com ; as well as other revenue including content licensing with third-party sites. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, TripAdvisor earned $377 million, $236 million and $130 million, respectively, in revenue from subscription-based, transaction -based and other revenue. 

Commercial Relationships 

Trip Advisor has a number of commercial relationships that are important to the success of its business . Although t hese relationships are memorialized in some form of agreement, many of these agreements are for a limited term or are terminable at will or on short notice. 

TripAdvisor has click-based advertising relationships with the vast majority of the leading online travel agencies as well as a variety of other travel suppliers, pursuant to which such companies purchase traveler leads from TripAdvisor, generally on a CPC basis. For the year ended December 31, 2015, TripAdvisor&#8217;s two most significant advertising partners , Expedia and Priceline, and their subsidiaries, each accounted for more than 10% of its total revenue and combined accounted for 46% of total revenue. 

TripAdvisor&#8217;s instant booking feature enables hotel shoppers to book directly with a third-party partner, without leaving TripAdvisor&#8217;s website. To facilitate this, TripAdvisor has partnered with seven of the top ten major hotel chains, including Accor, Best Western International , Carlson Rezidor , Choice Hotels, Hyatt H otels , Marriott International &#160; and Wyndham Worldwide . TripAdvisor also partnered with Priceline, whereby some of Priceline's online travel brands will participate in TripAdvisor&#8217;s instant booking platform, beginning with its Booking.com brand. As a result, u s ers are able to book more than 450,000 hotels, powered by its partners, without leaving the TripAdvisor site or mobile experience . 

I- 5 

&#160;

TripAdvisor has a content licensing program utilized by over 1,300 partners around the world, including hotel chains, online travel agents, tourist boards, airlines and media sites. TripAdvisor also distributes its content through self-service HTML widgets, which are used on the websites of hotels, restaurants, attractions and destination marketing organizations. These products, which are available at no cost in the TripAdvisor Management Center, allow businesses and destinations to promote themselves by displaying their TripAdvisor ratings, reviews and awards. TripAdvisor widgets are presently found on more than 200,000 unique domains around the globe. Both free and licensed TripAdvisor content reaches over 900 million people per month. Partners benefit from its user-generated content, such as reviews, ratings, and photos. In addition, TripAdvisor powers review collection for a growing number of partners, such as Accor Hotels, Wyndham Hotel Group, Best Western and Easytobook.com, enabling them to proactively collect reviews from their own customers post-stay in their own branded environment. TripAdvisor has also developed partnerships with mobile carriers and device manufacturers. 

Intellectual Property 

TripAdvisor&#8217;s intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, copyrights, domain names, trade dress, proprietary technology and trade secrets, is an important component of its business. TripAdvisor relies on its intellectual property rights in its content, proprietary technology, software code, ratings indexes, databases of reviews and forum content, images, videos, graphics and brands. TripAdvisor has acquired some of its intellectual property rights through licenses and content agreements with third parties. These licenses and agreements may place restrictions on its use of the intellectual property. 

TripAdvisor protects its intellectual property by relying on its terms of use, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, as well as on international, national, state and common law rights. In addition, TripAdvisor enters into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with other third parties. TripAdvisor protects its brands by pursuing the trademark registration of its core brands, such as TripAdvisor and the Owl Logo, maintaining its trademark portfolio, securing contractual trademark rights protection when appropriate, and relying on common law trademark rights when appropriate. TripAdvisor also registers copyrights and domain names as deemed appropriate. Additionally, TripAdvisor protects its trademarks, domain names and copyrights with the use of intellectual property licenses and an enforcement program. 

Seasonality 

The global travel market is large and traveler expenditures tend to follow a seasonal pattern. As such, expenditures by travel advertisers to market to potential travelers, and, therefore, TripAdvisor&#8217;s financial performance, tends to be seasonal as well. As a result, the third quarter tends to be TripAdvisor&#8217;s seasonal high, as it is a key period for travel research and trip-taking and its seasonal low generally occurs in the first and/or fourth quarter. Significant shifts in TripAdvisor&#8217;s business mix or adverse economic conditions could influence the typical trend of its seasonality in the future. 

Terms of Investment in TripAdvisor 

We own an approximate 21% equity interest and 56% voting interest in TripAdvisor. TripAdvisor&#8217;s amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the holders of TripAdvisor common stock, acting as a single class, are entitled to elect a number of directors equal to 25% of the total number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, which is currently three directors. As discussed previously we currently consolidate TripAdvisor as we control a majority of the voting interest in TripAdvisor. We are subject to a Governance Agreement with TripAdvisor which provides us with certain director nomination, registration and other rights and imposes certain restrictions on our shares of Class B common stock. 

BuySeasons 

BuySeasons is a wholly owned subsidiary of TripCo that owns and operates BuyCostumes.com and the Celebrate Express family of websites. Liberty acquired BuySeasons in 2006, which in turn acquired Celebrate Express in 2008. BuySeasons, an internet celebrations leader, provides a unique party offering by giving individuals the resources necessary to plan, execute and attend a wide variety of celebrations and costuming events. These resources include party supplies 

I- 6 

&#160;

primarily through the retail websites which offer proprietary products through exclusive license agreements and costumes for a wide variety of occasions (the primary occasion is Halloween). BuySeasons purchases its products from various suppliers, both domestic and international. BuySeasons depends on five suppliers for approximately one half of its costumes, accessories, and party supplies. The loss of any of these suppliers could adversely impact stand alone financial results of BuySeasons. 

BuySeasons&#8217; business is highly seasonal with approximately half of its revenue earned from the sale of costumes in September and October leading up to Halloween. Since the acquisition of Celebrate Express, BuySeasons has seen the seasonality decrease slightly due to higher sales of birthday party supplies which is a less seasonal business. BuySeasons outsources about 90% of its customer service function, with the remaining portion being maintained at its corporate headquarters. Customer service representatives are available up to 12 hours a day, and up to seven days a week during its busy season to respond to customer questions. The customer service center and warehouse staffing is scalable and BuySeasons employs seasonal labor to react to higher volume during the peak Halloween season. Subsequent to December 31, 2015, BuySeasons has made the decision to pivot its business to a dropship business model. 

Regulatory Matters 

Internet Services 

Our online commerce businesses are subject, both directly and indirectly, to various laws and governmental regulations. Certain of these businesses engaged in the provision of goods and services over the Internet must comply with federal and state laws and regulations applicable to online communications and commerce. For example, the Children&#8217;s Online Privacy Protection Act (&#8220; COPPA&#8221;) prohibits web sites from collecting personally identifiable information online from children under age 13 without parental consent and imposes a number of operational requirements. In 2012, the Federal Trade Commission (&#8220; FTC&#8221;) adopted revised COPPA regulations amending certain definitions and modifying certain operational requirements regarding notice and parental consent, among other matters. Certain email activities are subject to the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003, commonly known as the CAN-SPAM Act. The CAN-SPAM Act regulates the sending of unsolicited commercial email by requiring the email sender, among other things, to comply with specific disclosure requirements and to provide an &#8220;opt-out&#8221; mechanism for recipients. Both of these laws include statutory penalties for non-compliance. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act limits, but does not eliminate, liability for listing or linking to third party websites that may include content that infringes on copyrights or other rights so long as our Internet businesses comply with the statutory requirements. Various states also have adopted laws regulating certain aspects of Internet communications. Congress has extended the moratorium on state and local taxes on Internet access and commerce until October 1, 2016. Legislative proposals that would further extend the moratorium on state and local taxes on Internet access and commerce are pending in Congress. 

Our online commerce businesses also are subject to laws governing the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personally-identifiable information about their users. In particular, the collection and use of personal information by companies has received increased regulatory scrutiny on a global basis. The enactment, interpretation and application of user data protection laws are in a state of flux, and the interpretation and application of such laws may vary from country to country. For example, on December 15, 2015, the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union (&#8220;Council&#8221;) reached agreement on new data laws that give customers additional rights and impose additional restrictions and penalties on companies for illegal collection and misuse of personal information. The European Parliament and the Council are expected to adopt the new laws in early 2016, with the laws expected to become effective on a future date following adoption. Further, on October 6, 2015, the Court of Justice of the European Union invalidated the &#8220;Safe Harbor Framework,&#8221; which had allowed companies to collect and process personal data in European Union nations for use in the U.S. European Union and U.S. authorities announced on February 2, 2016 that they had reached agreement on a new data transfer framework. The European Union and the U.S. must implement the new framework, which may be subject to legal challenge. Finally, a European Union directive restricting the Internet tracking tools known as &#8220;cookies&#8221; has taken effect. &#160; 

In the U.S., the FTC has proposed a privacy policy framework, and legislation that would require organizations that suffer a breach of security related to personal information to notify owners of such information is pending in Congress. Many states have adopted laws requiring notification to users when there is a security breach affecting personal data, such 

I- 7 

&#160;

as California&#8217;s Information Practices Act. Complying with these different national and state privacy requirements may cause the Internet companies in which we have interests to incur substantial costs. In addition, such companies generally have and post on their websites privacy policies and practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of user data. A failure to comply with such posted privacy policies or with the regulatory requirements of federal, state, or foreign privacy laws could result in proceedings or actions by governmental agencies or others (such as class action litigation) which could adversely affect our online commerce businesses. Technical violations of certain privacy laws can result in significant penalties, including statutory penalties. In 2012, the FCC amended its regulations under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act &#8220; TCPA&#8221; , which could subject our Internet businesses to increased liability for certain telephonic communications with customers, including but not limited to text messages to mobile phones. Under the TCPA, plaintiffs may seek actual monetary loss or statutory damages of $500 per violation, whichever is greater, and courts may treble such damage awards for willful or knowing violations. Data collection, privacy and security are growing public concerns. If consumers were to decrease their use of our Internet businesses&#8217; websites to purchase products and services, such businesses could be harmed. Congress and individual states may consider additional online privacy legislation. 

Goods sold over the Internet also must comply with traditional regulatory requirements, such as the FTC requirements regarding truthful and accurate claims. Other Internet-related laws and regulations enacted in the future may cover issues such as defamatory speech, copyright infringement, pricing and characteristics and quality of products and services. The future adoption of such laws or regulations may slow the growth of commercial online services and the Internet, which could in turn cause a decline in the demand for the services and products of our online commerce businesses and increase their costs of doing business or otherwise have an adverse effect on their businesses, operating results and financial conditions. Moreover, the applicability to commercial online services and the Internet of existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, libel, personal privacy and taxation is uncertain and could expose these companies to substantial liability. 

In 2010, the FCC adopted rules in its open Internet proceeding that largely were vacated by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (&#8220;D.C. Circuit&#8221;) in 2014. On February 26, 2015, the FCC adopted new open Internet rules that reclassify wireline and wireless broadband services as Title II common carrier services and regulate broadband services offered by Internet service providers (ISPs) under Title II, Title III and Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. The regulations prohibit ISPs from: (1) blocking access to, or impairing or degrading, legal content, applications, services or non-harmful devices; and (2) favoring selected Internet traffic in exchange for consideration. The rules also allow the FCC to hear complaints and take enforcement action if it determines that the interconnection agreements of ISPs are not just and reasonable, or if ISPs fail to meet a new general obligation not to unreasonably interfere with or unreasonably disadvantage consumers or edge providers. The rules also require greater transparency by ISPs, including requiring disclosure of promotional rates, fees and surcharges, and data caps. The FCC forbears, or refrains from, imposing certain Title II regulation on ISPs, such as rate regulation, tariffs, and last-mile unbundling, and do not assess Universal Service Fund fees on broadband at this time. Multiple parties have challenged the open Internet rules in the D.C. Circuit, and the D.C. Circuit is expected to rule on the challenge in 2016. 

Proposed Changes in Regulation 

The regulation of Internet services, online sales and other forms of product marketing is subject to the political process and has been in constant flux over the past decade. Further material changes in the law and regulatory requirements must be anticipated and there can be no assurance that our business will not be adversely affected by future legislation, new regulation or deregulation. 

Competition 

TripAdvisor 

TripAdvisor competes in rapidly evolving and intensely competitive markets. TripAdvisor faces com petition for content, users, advertisers , online travel search and price comparison services (or hotel metasearch) and online reservations . TripAdvisor also faces competition from large companies that also offer comprehensive on-line resources for destinations, lodging, attractions and restaurants. TripAdvisor&#8217;s primary competitors &#160; include large online portals, social networking sites and search engines, such as Google (including Google + Local) , Facebook (including Graph Search), 

I- 8 

&#160;

Yahoo! (including Yahoo! Travel) and Baidu. TripAdvisor faces competition from online travel agencies (such as Expedia and Priceline and their respective subsidiaries), as well as wholesalers, tour operators and traditional offline travel agencies. TripAdvisor also competes with a wide range of other companies, including Airbnb, Inc., Alibaba, Ctrip.com International, Ltd., HolidayCheck AG, HomeAway, Inc. (a subsidiary of Expedia as of December 15, 2015), Yelp, Inc. and OpenTable, Inc. ( a subsidiary of Priceline ) . 

TripAdvisor faces competition in the travel review space from online travel agencies, such as Expedia and Priceline and their respective subsidiaries, which solicit reviews from travelers who book travel on their websites. With respect to its restaurant , attractions and vacation rental business es , TripAdvisor faces competition from OpenTable ( a subsidi ary of Priceline), and Yelp &#8217;s SeatMe and Amazon&#8217;s Table8 &#160; with respect to online restaurant reservation services, from GetYourGuide and Expedia (through its Destination Services) with respect to online attraction reservation services and from HomeAway (a subsidiary of Expedia) and Airbnb with respect to online accommodation search and research services. Moreover, networks with significant installed user bases such as Google (for example, via Google + Local and Google Hotel Finder) and Microsoft (through Bing Travel) have begun to compete more directly with TripAdvisor by attracting and accumulating user-generated travel reviews and opinions or may pursue the acquisition of travel-related content directly from consumers, and other networks and channels could choose to do the same. In the competition to attract users, TripAdvisor relies on its ability to acquire traffic through offline brand recognition and brand-direct efforts such as television, email and online search, whether unpaid or paid. TripAdvisor also competes f or online travel search and price comparison services (or hotel metasearch), with other such companies, including Expedia (through its ownership of Trivago), Priceline (through its ownership of Kayak) and HotelsCombined. Finally, TripAdvisor also competes for travel-related advertising budgets with large, established search engines with significantly greater resources than it has, such as Google, Bing, and Yahoo!, as well as online media companies and ad networks, and offline advertising sources, such as television and print media. 

Certain of the companies TripAdvisor does business with are also its competitors. The consolidation of its competitors and partners, including Expedia (through its ownership of Trivago , Orbitz , &#160; Travelocity and HomeAway) and Priceline (through its ownership of Kayak and OpenTable), coupled with evolving business models throughout the industry, results in a highly dynamic competitive environment . As the market evolves for online travel content and the technol ogy supporting it, including platforms such as smartphone and tablet computing devices, we and TripAdvisor anticipate that the existing competitive landscape will change and new competitors may emerge. 

BuySeasons 

The party and costume segments have a large number of in dependent retailers, both brick -and-mortar and online. Our subsidiary BuySeasons has a number of large and small primary competitors. Party City is the most significant competitor selling in both the party and costume categories. BuySeasons believes it has a competitive advantage due to the combination of a large assortment of on-line products, services related to party planning, product personalization, value pricing and a high level of customer service. 

In addition, BuySeasons competes with traditional brick -and-mortar and online retailers ranging from large department stores to specialty shops, electronic retailers, direct marketing retailers, such as mail order and catalog companies, and discount retailers. Due to the nature of these businesses there is not a single or small group of competitors that own a significant portion of the overall market share. However, some of these competitors, such as Amazon, have a significantly greater Web-presence than our e-commerce businesses. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the markets in which BuySeasons competes are selection, price, availability of inventory, convenience, brand recognition, accessibility, customer service, reliability, website performance, and ease of use.
