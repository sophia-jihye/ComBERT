The Company 

&#160;

Patriot Scientific Corporation (the &#8220;Company&#8221;, &#8220;PTSC&#8221;, &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221;, or &#8220;our&#8221;) is an intellectual-property licensing company with several patents (described below) covering the design of microprocessor chips. Chips with our patented technology are used throughout the world in products ranging from computers and cameras to printers, automobiles and industrial devices. Through our joint venture, Phoenix Digital Solutions, LLC (&#8220;PDS&#8221;), we pursue the commercialization of our patented microprocessor technologies through broad and open licensing and by litigating against those who may be infringing on our patents.

&#160;

Our business address is 2038 Corte Del Nogal, Suite 141, Carlsbad, California 92011; our main telephone number is (760) 795-8517. Our internet website page is located at http://www.ptsc.com. All of our reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;), are available free of charge on our internet website. The information on, or that can be accessed through, our website is not part of this Annual Report.

&#160;

PTSC is a corporation organized under Delaware law on March 24, 1992, and is the successor by merger to Patriot Financial Corporation, a Colorado corporation, incorporated on June 10, 1987. In June 2005, we entered into a joint venture agreement with Technology Properties Limited, Inc. (&#8220;TPL&#8221;) to form PDS. In September 2008, we acquired Patriot Data Solutions Group, Inc. formerly known as Crossflo Systems, Inc. (&#8220;PDSG&#8221;) which engaged in data-sharing services and products primarily in the public safety/government sector. During April 2012, we sold substantially all of the assets of PDSG.

&#160;

PDSG was a segment of our business prior to the quarter ended February 29, 2012 and it is now classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements.

Our Technology 

&#160;

The global semiconductor (or silicon &#8220;chip&#8221;) market has many segments and categories. The best-known - and most profitable - of these is the microprocessor segment. Microprocessor chips are the &#8220;brains&#8221; of most electronic and electrical devices throughout the world. Although microprocessors are often closely associated with personal computers (&#8220;PCs&#8221;), PCs account for only a small fraction of the microprocessor chips made and sold every year. The vast majority of microprocessors are used in everyday items like automobiles, digital cameras, cell phones, video game players, data networks, industrial flow-control valves, sensors, medical devices, weapons, home appliances, robots, security systems, televisions, and much more. These &#8220;embedded microprocessors&#8221; (so called because they&#8217;re embedded into another product) are far more ubiquitous than the chips inside personal computers. This is the market that our technology serves.

Phoenix Digital Solutions, LLC 

&#160;

On June 7, 2005, we entered into a Master Agreement (the &#8220;Master Agreement&#8221;) with TPL, and Charles H. Moore, an individual (&#8220;Moore&#8221;). We, TPL and Moore were parties to certain lawsuits filed by us alleging infringement (the &#8220;Infringement Litigation&#8221;) of seven U.S. patents issued dating back to 1989 on our microprocessor technology (the &#8220;Microprocessor Patents&#8221;) and a lawsuit also filed by us alleging claims for declaratory judgment for determination and correction of inventorship of the Microprocessor Patents (the &#8220;Inventorship Litigation&#8221;). The transactions described in the Master Agreement and related agreements (the &#8220;Transactions&#8221;) included the settlement or dismissal of the Inventorship Litigation.

&#160;

Pursuant to the Master Agreement we caused certain of our respective interests in the Microprocessor Patents to be licensed to PDS, a joint venture limited liability company owned 50% by us and 50% by TPL, and PDS engaged TPL to commercialize the Microprocessor Patents pursuant to a Commercialization Agreement among PDS, TPL and us (the &#8220;Commercialization Agreement&#8221;). Under the Commercialization Agreement, PDS granted to TPL the exclusive right to grant licenses and sub-licenses of the Microprocessor Patents and to pursue claims against violators of the Microprocessor Patents, in each case, on behalf of PDS, us, TPL and Moore, and TPL agreed to use reasonable best efforts to commercialize the Microprocessor Patents in accordance with a mutually agreed business plan. Pursuant to the Commercialization Agreement, PDS agreed to a reimbursement policy with regard to TPL&#8217;s expenses incurred in connection with the commercialization of the Microprocessor Patents. All proceeds generated by TPL in connection with the commercialization of the Microprocessor Patents were paid directly to PDS. From the inception of the Commercialization Agreement to May 31, 2016, gross license revenues to PDS totaled $309,814,535.

&#160;

&#160;

Pursuant to the Master Agreement, we and TPL entered into the Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement of PDS (&#8220;LLC Agreement&#8221;). We and TPL each own 50% of the membership interests of PDS, and each member has the right to appoint one member of the three member management committee. The TPL and PDS appointees are required to select a mutually acceptable third member of the management committee. There had not been a third management committee member since May 2010; however, as a result of our initiating arbitration seeking the appointment of a third member, on December 16, 2014, an independent manager to the PDS management committee was selected by the arbitrator. Pursuant to the LLC Agreement, we and TPL must each contribute to the working capital of PDS and at the discretion of PDS&#8217;s management committee we may be obligated to make future contributions in equal amounts in order to maintain a working capital fund. The LLC Agreement provides that PDS shall indemnify its members, managers, officers and employees, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, for any liabilities incurred as a result of their involvement with PDS, if the person seeking indemnification acted in good faith and in a manner reasonably believed to be in the best interest of PDS.

&#160; 

On July 11, 2012, we entered into a Licensing Program Services Agreement (the &#8220;Program Agreement&#8221;) with PDS, TPL, and Alliacense Limited, LLC (&#8220;Alliacense&#8221;, an affiliate of TPL) creating an amendment to the Commercialization Agreement, and an Agreement (the &#8220;TPL Agreement&#8221;) with TPL. Pursuant to the Program Agreement, PDS engaged Alliacense to negotiate Moore Microprocessor Patent (&#8220;MMP&#8221;) portfolio licenses and to pursue claims against violators of the MMP portfolio on behalf of PDS, TPL, and the Company. The Program Agreement extended through the useful life of the MMP portfolio patents. Pursuant to the TPL Agreement, we and TPL agreed to certain allocations of obligations in connection with the engagement of Alliacense. On July 24, 2014, the Program Agreement was amended with PDS and Alliacense entering into the Amended Alliacense Services and Novation Agreement (the &#8220;Novation Agreement&#8221;). Pursuant to the Novation Agreement certain performance goals and incentives were established for Alliacense. The Novation Agreement also provided for the addition of a second licensing company, which was engaged on October 10, 2014, to complement the MMP licensing commercialization. However, Alliacense fulfilled only a portion of its obligations under the Novation Agreement associated with the deployment of the second licensing company and on May 11, 2015 Alliacense was terminated by PDS. On July 17, 2012, we entered into an Agreement with PDS, TPL, and Alliacense whereby we agreed to certain additional allocations of obligations relating to the Program Agreement.

The July 2012 and 2014 agreements facilitated an aggressive litigation strategy which currently includes actions in U.S. District Court against multiple companies alleged to be infringers of the MMP portfolio. We believe that the significant investment in legal effort and costs incurred to date at PDS is necessary for the protection of our interests in the MMP portfolio and its future success.

On August 10, 2016, PDS entered into an agreement with Alliacense and MMP Licensing, LLC to settle matters relating to Alliacense&#8217;s non-performance under terms of the Novation Agreement. The August 10, 2016 agreement requires Alliacense to provide PDS&#8217;s second licensing company with certain materials and to cooperate with reasonable discovery requests relating to infringement litigation currently pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. MMP Licensing, LLC will provide commercialization services to PDS for the MMP portfolio with respect to certain companies. The August 10, 2016 agreement will expire on October 4, 2022.

On March 20, 2013, TPL filed a petition under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. A Joint Plan of Reorganization (the &#8220;Joint Plan&#8221;) between TPL and the creditor&#8217;s committee was confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court on February 11, 2015 with the entered confirmation order becoming final on April 2, 2015. We have been appointed to the creditors&#8217; committee and have been closely monitoring the progress in this matter as it relates to our interest in PDS.

&#160;

In the event we are required to provide funding to PDS that is not reciprocated by TPL, our ownership percentage in PDS will increase and we will have a controlling financial interest in PDS, in which case, we will consolidate PDS in our consolidated financial statements.

Licenses, Patents, Trade Secrets and Other Proprietary Rights 

&#160;

We rely on a combination of patents, copyright and trademark laws, trade secrets, software security measures, license agreements and nondisclosure agreements to protect our proprietary technologies. Our policy is to seek the issuance of patents that we consider important to our business to protect inventions and technology that support our microprocessor technology.

&#160;

As of the date of this filing, we have three European and two Japanese patents all expiring on October 4, 2016. We also have seven U.S. patents, six European, and one Japanese patent all of which expired between August 2009 and September 15, 2015. These patents, while expired, may have certain retrospective statutory benefits that will fully diminish six years after the patent expiration dates. The patent useful life for purposes of negotiating licenses is finite and these patents are subject to legal challenges, which in combination with the limited life, could adversely impact the stream of revenues. A successful challenge to the ownership of the technology or the proprietary nature of the intellectual property would materially damage business prospects. Any issued patent may be challenged and invalidated.

&#160;

There can be no assurance that our patents will provide meaningful commercial advantages to us. Although we intend to protect our rights vigorously, there can be no assurance that these measures will be successful.

&#160;

We generally require all of our employees and consultants, including our management, to sign a non-disclosure and invention assignment agreement upon employment with us.

&#160;

Products and Services 

&#160; 

Our investment in the MMP portfolio represents virtually all of our business interests at this time.

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160;

At May 31, 2016, we have two employees. All employees are full time. We also engage consultants and part-time persons, as needed.

&#160;

Our future success depends in significant part upon the continued services of our key personnel. The competition for highly qualified personnel is intense, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain key employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. None of our employees are covered by key man life insurance policies.

&#160;
