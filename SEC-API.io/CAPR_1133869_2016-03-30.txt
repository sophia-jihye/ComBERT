 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160;

Capricor Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of first-in-class therapeutics. We were originally incorporated in Delaware in August 2005 under the name Nile Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and we changed our name to Nile Therapeutics, Inc., or Nile Therapeutics, in January 2007.

&#160;

On November 20, 2013, pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated as of July 7, 2013, as amended by that certain First Amendment to Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated as of September 27, 2013 (as amended, the Merger Agreement), by and among Nile Therapeutics, Inc., or Nile, Nile&#8217;s wholly-owned subsidiary, Bovet Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation, or Merger Sub, and Capricor, Inc., or Capricor, a Delaware corporation, Merger Sub merged with and into Capricor and Capricor became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nile (referred to herein as the Merger). Immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger and in connection therewith, Nile filed certain amendments to its certificate of incorporation which, among other things, (i) effected a 1-for-50 reverse split of its common stock (the Reverse Stock Split), (ii) changed its corporate name from &#8220;Nile Therapeutics, Inc.&#8221; to &#8220;Capricor Therapeutics, Inc.,&#8221; and (iii) effected a reduction in the total number of authorized shares of common stock from 100,000,000 to 50,000,000, and a reduction in the total number of authorized shares of preferred stock from 10,000,000 to 5,000,000.

&#160;

Capricor, our wholly-owned subsidiary, was founded in 2005 as a Delaware corporation based on the innovative work of its founder, Eduardo Marb&#225;n, M.D., Ph.D., and his collaborators. First located in Baltimore, Maryland, adjacent to The Johns Hopkins University, or JHU, where Dr. Marb&#225;n was chief of cardiology, Capricor moved to Los Angeles, California in 2007 when Dr. Marb&#225;n became Director of the Heart Institute at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, or CSMC. Capricor&#8217;s laboratories are located in space that Capricor leases from CSMC.

&#160;

Our Strategy 

&#160; 

Our strategy is to discover, develop and commercialize regenerative medicine and large molecule products for the treatment of disease, with a primary focus on the treatment of cardiovascular diseases including orphan indications. We currently have four ongoing clinical trials aiming to treat cardiovascular diseases in various progressions of the disease state.

&#160;

CAP-1002, a cardiosphere-derived cell product, is currently being tested in the ALLSTAR Phase II clinical study on patients who have suffered a myocardial infarction (heart attack), while the DYNAMIC clinical study is testing CAP-1002 in patients who are in the advanced stages of heart failure. CAP-1002 is also being tested in the HOPE-Duchenne Phase I/II clinical study for use in connection with Duchenne muscular dystrophy-related cardiomyopathy.

&#160;

Cenderitide, a dual receptor natriuretic peptide agonist developed at the Mayo Clinic, is currently being tested in a Phase II clinical study which is evaluating the safety and dose response of Cenderitide administered to patients with chronic heart failure.

&#160;

Exosomes, which are are nano-sized, membrane-enclosed vesicles, or &#8220;bubbles,&#8221; filled with select molecules, are being tested in pre-clinical studies to explore new therapies and indications. These programs represent our core technology and products.

&#160;

Background on Heart Disease, Heart Failure and Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy 

&#160; 

Heart Disease 

&#160;

Heart disease is a general term for many specific diseases or conditions relating to the heart. In the United States, heart disease costs over $207 billion in direct and indirect costs annually, according to the American Heart Association. Furthermore, heart disease is the number one cause of death in the world and in the United States. Treatment options for most types of heart disease typically include a life-long medication regimen. Other options include implanted devices such as coronary stents, pacemakers, and cardio-defibrillators, and for some patients, heart transplantation may be the only other option. The effectiveness of these interventions is limited. With an estimated 85 million Americans having some form of heart disease, according to the American Heart Association, the need for new, effective therapy is significant.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The most common form of heart disease is coronary heart disease, which is characterized by a buildup of plaque inside the coronary arteries which supply blood to the heart. Plaque is made up of fat, cholesterol, calcium, and other substances found in the blood. The plaque can eventually burst, tear or rupture, creating a &#8220;snag&#8221; where a blood clot forms and blocks blood flow in the artery, depriving part of the heart of oxygen and nutrients. This leads to a myocardial infarction (MI), the medical term for a heart attack. If the flow of blood is not restored within a few minutes heart muscle cells may die, causing permanent damage.

&#160;

As the heart muscle begins to heal, a scar is formed that can impact normal heart function. Patients who suffer an MI often continue to experience degeneration or weakening of their heart muscle which can lead to heart failure and ultimately may shorten their lives.

&#160;

According to the American Heart Association, coronary heart disease afflicts over 15 million people in the U.S. and causes almost 50% of heart disease deaths in the United States. In 2010, coronary heart disease was responsible for 1.3 million hospital stays. In 2011 heart attacks and coronary heart disease were two of the ten most expensive hospitalizations. Coronary heart disease is the primary cause of heart attack or MI, which strikes approximately 750,000 Americans each year, often leading to repeated hospitalizations, a decrease in quality of life, and premature death. In fact, more than seven million people in the U.S. have had a heart attack.

&#160;

Capricor is evaluating CAP-1002 in the ALLSTAR Phase II clinical trial to determine its efficacy in reversing damage caused by heart attack.

&#160;

Heart Failure &#38; Dilated Cardiomyopathy 

&#160;

Heart failure, or HF, is a condition that exists when the heart cannot pump blood to the body as quickly as needed. The disease progresses over a long period of time and can make everyday activities more difficult. Blood returning to the heart faster than the heart can eject it, congests the system behind it. Decreased blood flow to organs, such as the kidneys, causes the body to retain more fluid, which further complicates the problem. As a result, HF can often cause damage to the kidneys and other organs, which in turn can worsen the condition of the heart. Dilated cardiomyopathy is another common cause of heart failure and is primarily characterized by the enlargement and weakening of the heart&#8217;s left ventricle, its main pumping chamber. The left ventricle becomes enlarged, or dilated, and cannot pump blood to the body with as much force as a healthy heart. Conditions such as coronary heart disease and heart attack, as well as viral infections, can cause dilated cardiomyopathy. While many people with dilated cardiomyopathy have minor or no symptoms, other people develop symptoms that may progress and worsen as heart function worsens.

&#160;

HF is the fastest-growing clinical cardiac disease in the United States according to the American Heart Association, affecting over five million Americans. The number of U.S. adults with heart failure is expected to increase to approximately eight million people by 2030.

&#160;

Capricor is evaluating CAP-1002 in the DYNAMIC clinical study to assess the safety and feasibility of delivering CAP-1002 to advanced heart failure patients. We initiated enrollment of the DYNAMIC trial in December 2014 and completed enrollment in April 2015. Initial top-line results showed that multi-vessel intracoronary infusion of CAP-1002 in subjects with dilated cardiomyopathy was shown to be safe with no major adverse cardiac events reported at one month or at six months post-infusion. Though this trial was intended as an early safety study, the six-month data demonstrated encouraging and congruent preliminary efficacy signals in multiple parameters, including subjective well-being, exercise capacity, ejection fraction and ventricular volumes.

&#160;

Additionally, HF is the most frequent cause of hospital admissions in the U.S. for patients older than 65 years, generating annual inpatient costs of more than $20 billion, according to the American Heart Association. Furthermore, HF is responsible for over 1 million hospitalizations annually in the U.S. alone. Among those patients who have been admitted, approximately 24% are re-hospitalized in one month and approximately 50% are re-hospitalized in six months.

&#160;

Acute Decompensated Heart Failure, or ADHF, is an acute exacerbation of HF requiring unplanned office visits, emergency room visits or hospitalization. Treatment options sometimes include diuretics to relieve the symptoms of ADHF by helping to remove excess fluid from the body which then helps to increase cardiac output. Despite aggressive therapies, one in three patients dies of the disease within a year of diagnosis, reflecting a substantial need for novel treatments.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Within 90 days following hospital admission for ADHF, which we refer to as the &#8220;post-acute&#8221; period, approximately 40% of patients with ADHF return to the hospital or die. To prevent re-hospitalization, post-acute patients need sustained heart and kidney function support to prevent a recurrence of their acute symptoms. While this post-acute indication is a novel indication in the HF space, we believe that post-acute patients represent one of the greatest areas of unmet need in the HF market. Cenderitide&#8217;s treatment goal and target indication is the prevention of re-hospitalization in heart failure patients during the post-acute hospitalization period.

&#160; 

Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy 

&#160; 

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a rare form of muscular dystrophy which results in muscle degeneration and premature death. DMD affects approximately 1 in 3,600 male infants, and nearly 20,000 boys are living with the disease in the U.S. DMD results from a lack of a functional dystrophin protein as caused by a gene mutation. The lack of dystrophin, an important structural component of muscle cells, causes them to have increased susceptibility to damage and to progressively die. Patients with DMD experience progressive muscle weakness starting at an early age, loss of ambulation in the first decade of life, and eventual respiratory and cardiac failure. Their lifespan is abbreviated and averages less than three decades.

&#160;

In the hearts of DMD patients, muscle is progressively replaced by scar tissue, often leading to eventual heart failure. This almost inevitable cardiomyopathy has become the leading cause of death in patients with DMD. However, patients with DMD may live longer following improvements in the treatment of their respiratory function. No therapies are currently approved to treat DMD cardiomyopathy. Capricor is evaluating CAP-1002 in the HOPE-Duchenne Phase I/II clinical trial to assess the safety and efficacy of delivering CAP-1002 to patients with DMD-related cardiomyopathy.

&#160;

CDC (Cardiosphere-Derived Cell) Technology 

&#160; 

The initial discovery by Dr. Marb&#225;n and his colleagues was that a novel progenitor cell type called a CDC, or cardiosphere-derived cell, can be isolated from heart tissue after passing through a cardiosphere phase and expanded into doses that can be delivered directly to the patient. These cells come from the heart and are potentially well-suited to treat the heart. Capricor believes that CDCs have anti-fibrotic, anti-apoptotic and pro-angiogenic functions that may reduce damage caused by myocardial ischemia and encourage blood vessel development in those areas of injury. This combination of properties may be able to treat other disease processes that cause the development of scar tissue. Capricor is evaluating the possibility of applying these cells or similar cells into other therapeutic areas. Capricor has exclusively licensed intellectual property for CDCs and Capricor&#8217;s other product candidate, cardiospheres, or CSps, from three academic institutions and is also pursuing its own intellectual property rights relating to these product candidates.

&#160;

Capricor&#8217;s proprietary methods are focused on producing therapeutic doses of cardiac-derived stem cells to boost the regenerative capacity of the heart and, with that, to perhaps improve cardiac function. A significant number of patients who suffer a heart attack eventually go on to develop heart failure. Heart attacks are one of the most common causes of heart failure. In patients with heart failure, the main pumping function of the heart is often diminished and results in symptoms and signs of poor cardiac function including shortness of breath, pulmonary congestion, diminished ability to perform activities of daily life (ADL) and, in some cases, death.

&#160;

When a patient suffers a heart attack, also called a myocardial infarction (MI), blood cannot reach the area due to an artery being blocked, preventing blood from reaching the distal tissue. The tissue that is downstream of the blockage quickly dies, leaving a scar. The larger the size of this scar, the greater the chance that a patient will have additional complications. CDCs have been shown in pre-clinical and clinical studies to reduce scar size following a myocardial infarction. Further, it has been demonstrated that new tissue is generated in response to cell delivery. Capricor researchers believe that the reduced scar and new tissue may improve heart function so that it will work more efficiently. Should Capricor&#8217;s CDCs prove to be effective at reducing the damage done to the heart by a heart attack, it is possible that fewer people may develop heart failure and suffer its devastating consequences.

&#160;

The first trial using CDCs was CADUCEUS, sponsored by CSMC in collaboration with JHU. CADUCEUS was a twenty-five patient randomized open-label study using 25 million autologous CDCs (i.e. CDCs derived from the patient&#8217;s own heart tissue) injected down the coronary artery thirty to ninety days after an MI. Seventeen patients received CDCs and eight received standard of care for post heart attack patients. Sixteen of the seventeen patients treated with CDCs showed a reduction in infarct (scar) size and generation of new heart tissue. To the best of Capricor&#8217;s knowledge, CADUCEUS is the first trial in the field of cardiac stem cell therapy that showed a significant reduction in scar size and a significant increase in new heart muscle as determined by blinded MRI analysis.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The precise mechanism of action of CDCs is not definitively understood. Capricor believes that CDCs work by harnessing and augmenting the natural healing powers that exist within the heart and that the cells act by recruiting the endogenous pool of stem cells to come to the site of injury and assist in repairing the damage that has been done. These natural healing effects may be enough for daily wear and tear on the heart but may not be strong enough for catastrophic injury such as a heart attack. Capricor believes that the CDCs track to the area of injury and release growth factors and cytokines (molecules that stimulate specific cell responses) that signal the heart to repair itself. The CADUCEUS trial provides preliminary validation of the potential regenerative properties of CDCs.

&#160;

Capricor&#8217;s core technology is based on cardiospheres, or CSps, which are multi-cell clusters of cardiac-derived cells that have been demonstrated to process regenerative properties in pre-clinical studies. The size of CSps is sufficiently large that injecting them directly into the infarct-related artery is not feasible due to potential for impairment of blood flow. Capricor&#8217;s lead product candidate, the CDCs, are the single cell monolayer product of the CSps. CDCs are small enough that within acceptable dose limits, they can be injected down a coronary artery without damaging the heart muscle. Capricor has done studies to establish the range of doses that are safe to deliver to the heart. Although Capricor has experimented with direct intra-myocardial injection of CSps, it is not actively developing them for clinical use. CSps appear to be no more effective than CDCs for the presently considered indications. It is possible that at some time in the future, the Company may evaluate the use of CSps for other indications.

&#160;

Both CSps and CDCs are derived from either a deceased human donor (allogeneic source) or from heart tissue taken directly from recipient patients themselves (autologous source). The manufacturing method for both allogeneic and autologous CSps or CDCs is similar though the starting material comes from different sources. Capricor has data to demonstrate that CSps and CDCs can be readily grown from heart tissue of humans.

&#160;

Natriuretic Peptide Technology 

&#160;

Cenderitide is a novel chimeric natriuretic peptide being considered for the treatment of heart failure patients. Specifically, Cenderitide is a dual receptor agonist acting on both the A and B receptors. Cenderitide was rationally designed by scientists at the Mayo Clinic&#8217;s cardio-renal research labs. Current therapies for acutely decompensated heart failure, or ADHF, including nesiritide, have been associated with favorable pharmacologic effects, but have also been associated with hypotension, which limits their utility outside the hospital setting. Cenderitide was designed to preserve the favorable effects of existing natriuretic peptide therapies while reducing or attenuating the hypotensive response and enhancing or preserving renal function. We believe that there may be a role for the use of Cenderitide in the outpatient treatment of heart failure. 

&#160;

In October 2011, we completed dosing of a 58 patient, open-label, placebo controlled Phase I clinical trial that was designed to identify the doses required to achieve pre-determined plasma levels of Cenderitide when delivered through a subcutaneous infusion pump. The target Cenderitide plasma levels were based on our previous Phase II clinical trials, in which Cenderitide was delivered through continuous IV infusion. The Phase II study enrolled patients in three parts. In Part A of the trial, 12 patients received two subcutaneous bolus injections of Cenderitide. In Part B of the trial, 34 patients received a 24-hour continuous subcutaneous infusion of either of two fixed doses of Cenderitide or placebo. In Part C of the trial, 12 patients received a 24-hour continuous subcutaneous infusion of either a weight-based dose of Cenderitide, or placebo. All infusions were delivered through the subcutaneous pump technology of Medtronic, Inc. pursuant to the parties&#8217; February 2011 collaboration agreement. In accordance with the terms of that agreement, Medtronic agreed to reimburse us for certain expenses of this Phase I study and provided the subcutaneous pumps used in the study.

&#160;

The top line results from the Phase I trial are as follows:

&#160;

&#183; The primary end-point was met &#8211; Cenderitide achieved target pharmacokinetic, or PK, levels when delivered through Medtronic&#8217;s subcutaneous pump technology; &#183; 24 hour subcutaneous delivery of Cenderitide through Medtronic&#8217;s pump technology was well-tolerated, with no injection site irritation; &#183; Subcutaneously delivered Cenderitide has an acceptable bioavailability profile; &#183; Cenderitide&#8217;s PK profile achieved steady-state when delivered through subcutaneous infusion; and &#183; Weight-based dosing reduced PK variability, as compared to a fixed dosing regimen. &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Since the merger between Capricor, Inc. and Nile, we have decided to advance our Cenderitide development program in patients with HF. In October 2014, we entered into a Transfer Agreement with Medtronic pursuant to which we acquired certain intellectual property rights to patents and patent applications that were previously co-owned by Medtronic and Capricor. In addition, we acquired the rights to other patents and patent applications that were previously owned solely by Medtronic. In October 2014, we also entered into an Agreement for Investigator-Initiated Research Support with Insulet Corporation. Pursuant to the agreement with Insulet, Insulet supported Capricor&#8217;s research by engaging in certain product development, project management and design control activities, in addition to supplying the OmniPod &#174; product being used for our current studies of Cenderitide. In 2015, we completed a Phase II study in 14 patients with stable, chronic heart failure. Patients received up to eight consecutive days of Cenderitide through subcutaneous infusion using Insulet&#8217;s drug delivery system based on the OmniPod technology. This trial assessed the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetic profiles and pharmacodynamic response to increasing dose levels of open-label Cenderitide administered in a stepwise fashion. The drug was tolerated and there were no significant adverse events. Capricor has initiated an additional study to further assess the safety and efficacy of this product candidate, which will include higher dose levels of Cenderitide in patients with stable heart failure with moderate renal impairment. This study will assess the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetic profiles and pharmacodynamic response to increasing dose levels of Cenderitide. Following these studies, Capricor will determine whether to conduct additional clinical studies to further assess the safety and efficacy of this product candidate. Cenderitide in the post-acute period has been granted Fast Track designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the &#8220;FDA&#8221;).

&#160;

Exosomes Technology 

&#160;

The CDC exosomes technology is based upon pre-clinical research by Dr. Eduardo Marb&#225;n and his colleagues at CSMC. Released by nearly every cell type in the body and a vital mediator of cellular activity, exosomes are nano-sized, membrane-enclosed vesicles, or &#8220;bubbles,&#8221; that are filled with select molecules. These molecules include RNAs, proteins and microRNAs which, when released, send messages to neighboring cells to regulate cellular functions. They are present in bodily fluids, are accessible and can be readily isolated from cells.

&#160;

Exosomes act as the transport vehicle out of the cell for segments of genetic material and proteins that act as messengers between cells, ultimately providing regulatory function for many cell processes, including inflammation, angiogenesis, programmed cell death (apoptosis), and scarring. Research has shown that exosomes derived from cultured cells can be used as therapeutic agents aimed to direct or, in some cases, re-direct cellular activities. Their size, ease in crossing cell membranes and their ability to communicate in the native cellular language of the cell makes them a class of exciting and potentially novel therapeutic agents.

&#160;

As recently published research indicates, exosomes extracted from Capricor&#8217;s CDCs, prompted myocardial regeneration in pre-clinical models of ischemic heart disease. Further, exosomes were shown to induce various structural and functional changes within the heart. We believe that these findings demonstrate for the first time that exosomes derived from CDCs may possess regenerative capabilities and may serve as proof of concept for the potential of these CDC-derived agents. We are hopeful that the unique properties of CDC-derived exosomes may allow us to develop novel cell-free therapeutics and expand our product portfolio. Though it is early in the development cycle, Capricor plans to explore the development of the exosomes technology as a next generation regenerative medicine portfolio in a variety of cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular areas.

&#160; 

Our Product Candidates 

&#160;

We currently have six drug candidates in various stages of development:

&#160;

&#183; CAP-1002: Capricor&#8217;s lead product candidate consists of allogeneic cardiosphere-derived cells, or CDCs. CAP-1002 is currently being tested in Capricor&#8217;s ALLSTAR Phase II clinical trial which will determine if the cells can lead to reduction in scar size in patients who have had a heart attack. It is a dual cohort clinical trial that has two independently recruiting strata: the first are patients who have recently experienced a myocardial infarction, or MI (30-90 days post MI); the second are patients who have suffered an MI within one year (90 days to one-year post MI) to see if the cells can reduce the size of older, more established scar. In addition to measuring scar size, ALLSTAR will also look at a variety of clinical and quality of life endpoints. Phase I of the ALLSTAR trial was a 14 patient trial conducted to determine if allogeneic CDCs are safe for patients. Phase I of the trial was funded in large part by a grant received from the National Institutes of Health, or NIH. The primary endpoints focused on acute effects of cell delivery and potential immune consequences of allogeneic cell delivery. Patient enrollment was completed for the Phase I portion of the trial in October 2013. Preliminary 12 month MRI data collected on the patients in the Phase I open-label dose-escalation study revealed that those patients who would be included in the Phase II clinical study by virtue of dose and tissue type compatibility exhibited a 5.2% improvement in ejection fraction, a global measure of the heart's pumping ability. Additionally, there was a relative reduction in scar size of 20.7%. Measurements of viable mass and regional function also showed quantifiable improvements. &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

In December 2013, Capricor received notification from the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, or the NHLBI, Gene and Cell Therapy Data Safety Monitoring Board that the 14-patient Phase I portion had met its safety endpoints and that Capricor was cleared to begin the Phase II portion of the trial. Capricor began enrollment of the Phase II portion of the ALLSTAR study in the first quarter of 2014. Phase II is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial which is powered to detect a reduction in infarct (scar) size as measured by MRI in both groups of patients, those with recent and chronic MI, at the one year follow-up. The Phase II portion of the trial was initially designed to enroll up to 300 patients.

&#160;

We recently completed statistical modelling of the design of ALLSTAR. This modelling incorporated the expanded dataset that has become available from our other clinical trials of CAP-1002. Based on these results, we have elected to decrease the enrollment goal of ALLSTAR to approximately 120 patients, a sample size that is expected to maintain sufficient statistical power to detect a reduction in infarct, or scar, size as measured by MRI at twelve months. We have amended our clinical protocol to reflect these changes, which such amendment has been approved by the Data Safety Monitoring Board and submitted to the FDA. Phase II of the ALLSTAR study is being funded in large part through the support of the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine, or CIRM.

&#160;

In December 2013, Capricor entered into a Collaboration Agreement and Exclusive License Option with Janssen Biotech, Inc., or Janssen. Under the agreement, Janssen has an exclusive option to enter into an exclusive license agreement with Capricor, pursuant to which, if exercised, Janssen would receive a worldwide, exclusive license to exploit CAP-1002 as well as certain allogeneic cardiospheres and cardiosphere-derived cells in the field of cardiology, except as may otherwise be agreed with respect to certain indications. Janssen has the right to exercise the option at any time until 60 days after the delivery by Capricor of the six-month follow-up results from Phase II of Capricor&#8217;s ALLSTAR clinical trial for CAP-1002.

&#160;

Capricor was awarded a grant for approximately $2.9 million from the NIH to support further development of the CAP-1002 product. In June 2014, we received approval from the NIH to use the funds from the grant for the first part of the DYNAMIC (dilated cardiomyopathy intervention with allogeneic myocardially-regenerative cells) trial, which is being sponsored by Capricor. The first part of the DYNAMIC trial used CAP-1002 to treat patients with advanced heart failure utilizing triple-vessel intracoronary infusion. We initiated enrollment of the DYNAMIC trial in December 2014 and completed enrollment in April 2015. Initial top-line results were presented at the American Heart Association&#8217;s Annual Scientific Sessions in November 2015. Multi-vessel intracoronary infusion of CAP-1002 in subjects with dilated cardiomyopathy was shown to be safe in this study with no major adverse cardiac events reported at one month or at six months post-infusion. Though this trial was intended as an early safety study, the six-month data demonstrated encouraging and congruent preliminary efficacy signals in multiple parameters, including subjective well-being, exercise capacity, ejection fraction and ventricular volumes.

&#160;

Additionally, we are currently enrolling the Phase I/II HOPE-Duchenne clinical trial, which is designed to enroll approximately 24 patients in a randomized, multi-center study evaluating the safety and preliminary efficacy of CAP-1002 in patients with cardiomyopathy related to Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Patients enrolled in the study who are randomized to receive CAP-1002 will be infused in all three coronary arteries, which will allow for CAP-1002 to be delivered to wide areas of the myocardium. Subject to finalization of definitive documents, this study will be funded in part through a grant award from CIRM in the amount of approximately $3.4 million. Both the milestones and the rate of disbursement of the award proceeds will be set forth in the definitive documents, which have not been determined as of the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In April 2015, the FDA granted orphan drug designation to CAP-1002 for the treatment of DMD.

&#160;

&#183; Cenderitide (CD-NP) : Cenderitide belongs to a class of drugs called natriuretic peptides. Preclinical and clinical data have shown that the natriuretic peptide class can act on multiple disease processes that play a role in negative outcomes associated with heart failure. Cenderitide&#8217;s treatment goal and target indication is to provide a novel and effective therapeutic option for the outpatient treatment of heart failure, thereby addressing a critical unmet need. Cenderitide is being developed as an outpatient therapy to be delivered continuously using a validated subcutaneous infusion pump for up to 90 days (the &#8220;post-acute&#8221; period) following an acute heart failure hospital admission, as well as for other potential indications. Cenderitide was designed by scientists at the Mayo Clinic to be the only dual natriuretic peptide receptor agonist. In October 2014, we entered into an Agreement for Investigator-Initiated Research Support with Insulet Corporation, or Insulet, pursuant to, which Insulet supported Capricor&#8217;s research by engaging in certain product development, project management and design control activities, in addition to supplying the OmniPod product being used for our current studies. In 2015, we completed a Phase II study in 14 patients with stable, chronic heart failure. Patients received up to eight consecutive days of Cenderitide through subcutaneous infusion using Insulet&#8217;s drug delivery system based on the OmniPod technology. This trial assessed the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetic profiles and pharmacodynamic response to increasing dose levels of open-label Cenderitide administered in a stepwise fashion. The drug was tolerated and there were no significant adverse events. Capricor has initiated an additional study to further assess the safety and efficacy of this product candidate, which will include higher dose levels of Cenderitide in patients with stable heart failure with moderate renal impairment. This study will assess the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetic profiles and pharmacodynamic response to increasing dose levels of Cenderitide. Following these studies, Capricor will determine whether to conduct additional clinical studies to further assess the safety and efficacy of this product candidate. Cenderitide in the post-acute period has been granted Fast-Track designation by the FDA. &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; Exosomes : Exosomes are nano-sized, membrane-enclosed vesicles, or &#8220;bubbles&#8221;, that are filled with select molecules, including proteins, RNAs and microRNAs, which, when released, send messages to neighboring cells to regulate cellular functions. Exosomes act as transport vehicles out of cells for microRNA, other fragments of genetic material and proteins that act as messengers between cells, ultimately providing regulatory function for many cell processes, including inflammation, angiogenesis, programmed cell death (apoptosis) and scarring. Pre-clinical research has shown that exogenous exosomes can be used as therapeutic agents aimed to direct or, in some cases, re-direct cellular activity. Their size, ease of crossing cell membranes, and ability to communicate in native cellular language makes them a class of exciting and novel therapeutic agents. We are currently in pre-clinical testing to explore the possible future therapeutic benefits that exosomes may possess and the indications in which they potentially may be investigated. &#160;

&#183; CAP-1001: CAP-1001 consists of autologous CDCs. This product was used in the Phase I CADUCEUS clinical trial, which was sponsored and conducted by CSMC in collaboration with JHU. In that study, 25 patients were enrolled, 17 of which received autologous CDCs. 16 of the 17 treated patients showed a mean reduction of approximately 45% in scar mass and an increase in viable heart muscle one-year post heart attack. The eight patients in the control group had no significant change in infarct (scar) size. At present, there is no plan for another clinical trial for CAP-1001. The data from CADUCEUS, using autologous CDCs, suggests that CDCs are effective in reducing scar within several months of a heart attack. The ALLSTAR trial is designed to validate the results of CADUCEUS using an allogeneic product while also looking for potential efficacy in patients between 90 days and one year post MI with a more chronic scar, a patient population that CADUCEUS was not designed to study. &#160;

&#183; CU-NP : CU-NP is a pre-clinical rationally-designed natriuretic peptide that consists of amino acid chains identical to those produced by the human body, specifically the ring structure of C-type natriuretic peptide, or CNP, and the N- and C-termini of Urodilatin, or URO. We are currently evaluating whether we will proceed with clinical development of this product. &#160;

&#183; CSps: CSps are multicellular clusters called cardiospheres, a 3D micro-tissue from which CDCs are derived, and have shown significant healing effects in pre-clinical models of heart failure. While Capricor considers the CSps an important asset, at present there is no plan to develop CSps as therapeutic agents. &#160;

The following table summarizes our product development programs:

Intellectual Property and Proprietary Know-How 

&#160; 

Our goal is to obtain, maintain and enforce patent rights for our products, formulations, processes, methods of use and other proprietary technologies, preserve our trade secrets, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties, both in the United States and abroad. Our policy is to actively seek to obtain, where appropriate, the broadest intellectual property protection possible for our current product candidates and any future product candidates, proprietary information and proprietary technology through a combination of contractual arrangements and patents, both in the United States and abroad. Even patent protection, however, may not always afford us with complete protection against competitors who seek to circumvent our patents. If we fail to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or secure rights to patents of others, the value of our intellectual property rights would diminish. To this end, we require all of our employees, consultants, advisors and other contractors to enter into confidentiality agreements that prohibit the disclosure and use of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business.

&#160;

The development of complex biotechnology products such as ours typically includes the early discovery of a technology platform &#8211; often in an academic institution &#8211; followed by increasingly focused development around a product opportunity, including identification and definition of a specific product candidate and development of scalable manufacturing processes, formulation, delivery and dosage regimens. As a result, biotechnology products are often protected by several families of patent filings that are made at different times of the development cycle and cover different aspects of the product. Earlier filed broad patent applications directed to the discovery of the platform technology thus usually expire ahead of patents covering later developments such as scalable manufacturing processes and dosing regimens. Patent expirations on products may therefore span several years and vary from country to country based on the scope of available coverage. There are also limited opportunities to obtain extensions of patent coverage in certain countries. Our issued patents will expire on dates ranging from approximately 2019-2031.

&#160;

Capricor&#8217;s Technology - CAP-1002, CAP-1001, CSps and Exosomes 

&#160; 

Capricor has entered into exclusive license agreements for intellectual property rights related to cardiac-derived cells with Universit&#224; Degli Studi Di Roma at la Sapienza (the &#8220;University of Rome&#8221;), The Johns Hopkins University (&#8220;JHU&#8221;) and CSMC. In addition, Capricor has filed patent applications related to enhancements or validation of the technology developed by its own scientists.

&#160;

University of Rome License Agreement 

&#160; 

Capricor and the University of Rome entered into a License Agreement, dated June 21, 2006 (the &#8220;Rome License Agreement&#8221;) which provides for the grant of an exclusive, world-wide, royalty-bearing license by the University of Rome to Capricor (with the right to sublicense) to develop and commercialize licensed products under the licensed patent rights in all fields. With respect to any new or future patent applications assigned to the University of Rome utilizing cardiac stem cells in cardiac care, Capricor has a first right of negotiation for a certain period of time to obtain a license thereto.

&#160;

Pursuant to the Rome License Agreement, Capricor paid the University of Rome a license issue fee, is currently paying minimum annual royalties in the amount of 20,000 Euros per year, and is obligated to pay a lower-end of a mid-range double-digit percentage on all royalties received as a result of sublicenses granted, which are net of any royalties paid to third parties under a license agreement from such third party to Capricor. The minimum annual royalties are creditable against future royalty payments.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The Rome License Agreement will, unless extended or sooner terminated, remain in effect until the later of the last claim of any patent or until any patent application comprising licensed patent rights has expired or been abandoned. Under the terms of the Rome License Agreement, either party may terminate the agreement should the other party become insolvent or file a petition in bankruptcy. Either party will have up to 90 days to cure its material breach.

&#160; 

The Johns Hopkins University License Agreement 

&#160;

Capricor and JHU entered into an Exclusive License Agreement, effective June 22, 2006 (the &#8220;JHU License Agreement&#8221;), which provides for the grant of an exclusive, world-wide, royalty-bearing license by JHU to Capricor (with the right to sublicense) to develop and commercialize licensed products and licensed services under the licensed patent rights in all fields and a nonexclusive right to the know-how. In May 2009, the JHU License Agreement was amended to add additional patent rights to the JHU License Agreement in consideration of a payment to JHU and reimbursement of patent costs. Capricor and JHU executed a Second Amendment to the JHU License Agreement, effective as of December 20, 2013, pursuant to which, among other things, certain definitions were added or amended, the timing of certain obligations was revised and other obligations of the parties were clarified.

&#160;

Pursuant to the JHU License Agreement, JHU was paid an initial license fee and, thereafter, Capricor is required to pay minimum annual royalties on the anniversary dates of the JHU License Agreement. The minimum annual royalties range from $5,000 on the first and second anniversary dates to $20,000 on the tenth anniversary date and thereafter. The minimum annual royalties are creditable against a low single-digit running royalty on net sales of products and net service revenues, which Capricor is also required to pay under the JHU License Agreement, which running royalty may be subject to further reduction in the event that Capricor is required to pay royalties on any patent rights to third parties in order to make or sell a licensed product. In addition, Capricor is required to pay a low double-digit percentage of the consideration received by it from sublicenses granted, and is required to pay JHU certain defined development milestone payments upon the successful completion of certain phases of its clinical studies and upon receiving approval from the FDA. The development milestones range from $100,000 upon successful completion of a full Phase I clinical study to $1,000,000 upon full FDA market approval and are fully creditable against payments owed by Capricor to JHU on account of sublicense consideration attributable to milestone payments received from a sublicensee. The maximum aggregate amount of milestone payments payable under the JHU License Agreement, as amended, is $1,850,000.

&#160;

The JHU License Agreement will, unless sooner terminated, continue in effect in each applicable country until the date of expiration of the last to expire patent within the patent rights, or, if no patents are issued, then for twenty years from the effective date. Under the terms of the JHU License Agreement, either party may terminate the agreement should the other party become insolvent or file a petition in bankruptcy, or fail to cure a material breach within 30 days after notice. In addition, Capricor may terminate for any reason upon 60 days&#8217; written notice.

&#160; 

Cedars-Sinai Medical Center License Agreements 

&#160; 

License Agreement for CDCs 

&#160; 

On January 4, 2010, Capricor entered into an Exclusive License Agreement with CSMC (the &#8220;CSMC License Agreement&#8221;), for certain intellectual property rights. In 2013, the CSMC License Agreement was amended twice resulting in, among other things, a reduction in the percentage of sublicense fees which would have been payable to CSMC. Effective December 30, 2013, Capricor entered into an Amended and Restated Exclusive License Agreement with CSMC (the &#8220;Amended CSMC License Agreement&#8221;), pursuant to which, among other things, certain definitions were added or amended, the timing of certain obligations was revised and other obligations of the parties were clarified.

&#160;

The Amended CSMC License Agreement provides for the grant of an exclusive, world-wide, royalty-bearing license by CSMC to Capricor (with the right to sublicense) to conduct research using the patent rights and know-how and develop and commercialize products in the field using the patent rights and know-how. In addition, Capricor has the exclusive right to negotiate for an exclusive license to any future rights arising from related work conducted by or under the direction of Dr. Eduardo Marb&#225;n on behalf of CSMC. In the event the parties fail to agree upon the terms of an exclusive license, Capricor will have a non-exclusive license to such future rights, subject to royalty obligations.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Pursuant to the CSMC License Agreement, CSMC was paid a license fee and Capricor was obligated to reimburse CSMC for certain fees and costs incurred in connection with the prosecution of certain patent rights. Additionally, Capricor is required to meet certain spending and development milestones. The annual spending requirements range from $350,000 to $800,000 each year between 2010 and 2017 (with the exception of 2014, for which there was no annual spending requirement). Pursuant to the Amended CSMC License Agreement, Capricor remains obligated to pay low single-digit royalties on sales of royalty-bearing products as well as a low double-digit percentage of the consideration received from any sublicenses or other grant of rights. The above-mentioned royalties are subject to reduction in the event Capricor becomes obligated to obtain a license from a third party for patent rights in connection with the royalty-bearing product. In 2010, Capricor discontinued its research under some of the patents.

&#160;

The Amended CSMC License Agreement will, unless sooner terminated, continue in effect on a country by country basis until the last to expire of the patents covering the patent rights or future patent rights. Under the terms of the Amended CSMC License Agreement, unless waived by CSMC, the agreement shall automatically terminate: (i) if Capricor ceases, dissolves or winds up its business operations; (ii) in the event of the insolvency or bankruptcy of Capricor or if Capricor makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors; (iii) if performance by either party jeopardizes the licensure, accreditation or tax exempt status of CSMC or the agreement is deemed illegal by a governmental body; (iv) within 30 days for non-payment of royalties; (v) within 90 days if Capricor fails to undertake commercially reasonable efforts to exploit the patent rights or future patent rights; (vi) if a material breach has not been cured within 90 days; or (vii) if Capricor challenges any of the CSMC patent rights. Capricor may terminate the agreement if CSMC fails to cure any material breach within 90 days after notice.

&#160;

On March 20, 2015, Capricor and CSMC entered into a First Amendment to the Amended CSMC License Agreement, pursuant to which the parties agreed to delete certain patent applications from the list of Scheduled Patents which Capricor determined not to be material to the portfolio.

&#160;

License Agreement for Exosomes 

&#160;

On May 5, 2014, Capricor entered into an Exclusive License Agreement with CSMC (the &#8220;Exosomes License Agreement&#8221;), for certain intellectual property rights related to exosomes technology. The Exosomes License Agreement provides for the grant of an exclusive, world-wide, royalty-bearing license by CSMC to Capricor (with the right to sublicense) in order to conduct research using the patent rights and know-how and to develop and commercialize products in the field using the patent rights and know-how. In addition, Capricor has the exclusive right to negotiate for an exclusive license to any future rights arising from related work conducted by or under the direction of Dr. Eduardo Marb&#225;n on behalf of CSMC. In the event the parties fail to agree upon the terms of an exclusive license, Capricor shall have a non-exclusive license to such future rights, subject to royalty obligations.

&#160;

Pursuant to the Exosomes License Agreement, CSMC was paid a license fee and Capricor reimbursed CSMC for certain fees and costs incurred in connection with the prosecution of certain patent rights. Additionally, Capricor is required to meet certain non-monetary development milestones and is obligated to pay low single-digit royalties on sales of royalty-bearing products as well as a single-digit percentage of the consideration received from any sublicenses or other grant of rights. The above-mentioned royalties are subject to reduction in the event Capricor becomes obligated to obtain a license from a third party for patent rights in connection with the royalty bearing product.

&#160;

The Exosomes License Agreement will, unless sooner terminated, continue in effect on a country by country basis until the last to expire of the patents covering the patent rights or future patent rights. Under the terms of the Exosomes License Agreement, unless waived by CSMC, the agreement shall automatically terminate: (i) if Capricor ceases, dissolves or winds up its business operations; (ii) in the event of the insolvency or bankruptcy of Capricor or if Capricor makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors; (iii) if performance by either party jeopardizes the licensure, accreditation or tax exempt status of CSMC or the agreement is deemed illegal by a governmental body; (iv) within 30 days for non-payment of royalties; (v) within 90 days if Capricor fails to undertake commercially reasonable efforts to exploit the patent rights or future patent rights; (vi) if a material breach has not been cured within 90 days; or (vii) if Capricor challenges any of the CSMC patent rights. Capricor may terminate the agreement if CSMC fails to cure any material breach within 90 days after notice.

&#160;

On February 27, 2015, Capricor and CSMC entered into a First Amendment to Exclusive License Agreement, thereby amending the Exosomes License Agreement (the &#8220;Exosomes License Amendment&#8221;). Under the Exosomes License Amendment, (i) the description of patent rights in Schedule A has been replaced by a Revised Schedule A that includes four additional patent applications; (ii) Capricor was required to pay CSMC an upfront fee of $20,000; (iii) Capricor is required to reimburse CSMC approximately $34,000 for attorneys&#8217; fees and filing fees that were incurred in connection with the additional patent rights; and (iv) Capricor is required to pay CSMC certain defined product development milestone payments upon reaching certain phases of its clinical studies and upon receiving approval for a product from the FDA. The product development milestones range from $15,000 upon the dosing of the first patient in a Phase I clinical trial of a product to $75,000 upon receipt of FDA approval for a product. The maximum aggregate amount of milestone payments payable under the Exosomes License Agreement, as amended, is $190,000. On June 10, 2015, Capricor and CSMC entered into a Second Amendment to Exclusive License Agreement, thereby amending the Exosomes License Agreement further to add an additional patent application to the Schedule of Patent Rights.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

CSMC holds more than 10% of the outstanding capital stock of Capricor Therapeutics. Capricor is a party to a Facilities Lease Agreement with CSMC dated June 1, 2014. Capricor also manufactures CAP-1002 and Exosomes products in a manufacturing facility provided by CSMC. Additionally, Dr. Eduardo Marb&#225;n, who holds more than 10% of the outstanding capital stock of Capricor Therapeutics, is the Director of the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute, the Co-Founder of Capricor and Chairman of Capricor&#8217;s Scientific Advisory Board.

&#160;

Collaboration Agreement with Janssen Biotech, Inc. 

&#160;

On December 27, 2013, Capricor entered into a Collaboration Agreement and Exclusive License Option (the &#8220;Janssen Agreement&#8221;) with Janssen, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Johnson &#38; Johnson. Under the terms of the Janssen Agreement, Capricor and Janssen agreed to collaborate on the development of Capricor&#8217;s cell therapy program for cardiovascular applications, including its lead product candidate, CAP-1002. Capricor and Janssen further agreed to collaborate on the development of cell manufacturing in preparation for future clinical trials. Under the Janssen Agreement, Capricor was paid $12.5 million, and Capricor will contribute to the development of a chemistry, manufacturing and controls (&#8220;CMC&#8221;) package. In addition, Janssen has the exclusive right to enter into an exclusive license agreement pursuant to which Janssen would receive a worldwide, exclusive license to exploit CAP-1002 as well as certain allogeneic cardiospheres and cardiosphere-derived cells in the field of cardiology. Janssen has the right to exercise the option at any time until 60 days after the delivery by Capricor of the six-month follow-up results from Phase II of Capricor&#8217;s ALLSTAR clinical trial for CAP-1002. If Janssen exercises its option rights, Capricor would receive an upfront license fee and additional milestone payments, which may total up to $325.0 million. In addition, a royalty ranging from a low double-digit percentage to a lower-end of a mid-range double-digit percentage would be paid on sales of licensed products.

&#160;

Company Technology &#8211; Cenderitide and CU-NP 

&#160;

The Company has entered into an exclusive license agreement for intellectual property rights related to natriuretic peptides with the Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (&#8220;Mayo&#8221;), a Clinical Trial Funding Agreement with Medtronic, Inc. (&#8220;Medtronic&#8221;), and a Transfer Agreement with Medtronic, all of which also include certain intellectual property licensing provisions.

&#160;

Mayo License Agreement 

&#160;

The Company and Mayo previously entered into a Technology License Agreement with respect to Cenderitide on January 20, 2006, which was filed as Exhibit 10.6 to the Company&#8217;s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, on September 21, 2007, and which was amended on June 2, 2008 (as so amended, the &#8220;CD-NP Agreement&#8221;). On June 13, 2008, the Company and Mayo entered into a Technology License Agreement with respect to CU-NP (the &#8220;CU-NP Agreement&#8221;), which was filed as Exhibit 10.1 to the Company&#8217;s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on August 14, 2008. On November 14, 2013, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated License Agreement with Mayo (the &#8220;Amended Mayo Agreement&#8221;). The Amended Mayo Agreement amends and restates in its entirety each of the CD-NP Agreement and the CU-NP Agreement, and creates a single amended and restated license agreement between the Company and Mayo with respect to CD-NP and CU-NP.

&#160;

The Amended Mayo Agreement provides for the grant of an exclusive, world-wide, royalty-bearing license by Mayo to the Company (with the right to sublicense) under the Mayo patents, patent applications and improvements, and a nonexclusive right under the know-how, for the development and commercialization of CD-NP and CU-NP in all therapeutic indications. With respect to any future patents and any improvements related to Cenderitide and CU-NP owned by or assigned to Mayo, the Company has the exclusive right of first negotiation for the exclusive or non-exclusive rights (at the Company&#8217;s option) thereto. Such exclusive right of negotiation shall be effective as of June 1, 2016, or such earlier date when the Company has satisfied certain payment obligations to Mayo.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Under each of the previous CD-NP Agreement and CU-NP Agreement, the Company paid Mayo up-front cash payments and the Company agreed to make certain performance-based cash payments to Mayo upon successful completion of certain milestones. Additionally, the Company issued certain amounts of common stock of the Company to Mayo under each agreement. The Amended Mayo Agreement restructured the economic arrangements of the CD-NP Agreement and the CU-NP Agreement by, among other things, eliminating certain milestone payments and decreasing the royalty percentages payable upon the commercial sale of the products to low single-digit royalties on sales of CD-NP and CU-NP products. The Company is also obligated to pay to Mayo a low single-digit percentage on any upfront consideration or milestone payment received in connection with a sublicense. The Company is further obligated to pay to Mayo a low single-digit percentage on any consideration received in connection with an assignment of rights under the Amended Mayo Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the Amended Mayo Agreement, the Company agreed to pay to Mayo an annual license maintenance fee and to issue to Mayo an additional 18,000 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock as additional consideration for the grant of certain rights. Mayo also agreed to waive or defer the payment of certain fees owed to Mayo. All breaches and defaults by the Company under the terms of the CD-NP Agreement and CU-NP Agreement were waived by Mayo in the Amended Mayo Agreement.

&#160;

The Amended Mayo Agreement will, unless sooner terminated, expire on the later of (a) the expiration of the last to expire valid claim contained in the Mayo patents, or (b) the 20th anniversary of the Amended Mayo Agreement. Under the terms of the Amended Mayo Agreement, Mayo may terminate the agreement earlier (i) for the Company&#8217;s material breach of the agreement that remains uncured for 90 days&#8217; after written notice to the Company, (ii) for the Company&#8217;s insolvency or bankruptcy, (iii) if the Company challenges the validity or enforceability of any of the patent rights in any manner, or (iv) if the Company has not initiated either the next clinical trial of Cenderitide within two years of the effective date of the Amended Mayo Agreement or a clinical trial of CU-NP within two and one-half years of the effective date. Such condition was satisfied when the Company initiated its clinical trial of Cenderitide in January 2015. The Company may terminate the Amended Mayo Agreement without cause upon 90 days&#8217; written notice.

&#160;

Medtronic Clinical Trial Funding Agreement 

&#160;

In February 2011, the Company entered into a Clinical Trial Funding Agreement with Medtronic. Pursuant to the agreement, Medtronic provided funding and equipment necessary for the Company to conduct a Phase I clinical trial to assess the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of Cenderitide when delivered to heart failure patients through continuous subcutaneous infusion using Medtronic&#8217;s pump technology.

&#160;

The agreement provided that intellectual property conceived in or otherwise resulting from the performance of the Phase I clinical trial will be jointly owned by the Company and Medtronic (the &#8220;Joint Intellectual Property&#8221;), and that the Company is to pay royalties to Medtronic based on the net sales of a product covered by the Joint Intellectual Property. The agreement further provided that, if the parties fail to enter into a definitive commercial license agreement with respect to Cenderitide, each party will have a right of first negotiation to license exclusive rights to any Joint Intellectual Property.

&#160;

Pursuant to its terms, the agreement expired in February 2012, following the completion of the Phase I clinical trial and the delivery of data and reports related to such study. Although the Medtronic agreement expired, there are certain provisions that survive the expiration of the agreement, including the obligation to pay royalties on products that might be covered by the Joint Intellectual Property. The Company and Medtronic have subsequently entered into a Transfer Agreement, described below. 

&#160;

Medtronic Transfer Agreement 

&#160;

On October 8, 2014, the Company entered into a Transfer Agreement (the &#8220;Transfer Agreement&#8221;) with Medtronic to acquire patent rights relating to the formulation and pump delivery of natriuretic peptides. Pursuant to the Transfer Agreement, Medtronic has assigned to the Company all of its right, title and interest in all natriuretic peptide patents and patent applications previously owned by Medtronic or co-owned by Medtronic and the Company (&#8220;Natriuretic Peptide Patents&#8221;). Under the Transfer Agreement, the Company received all rights to the Natriuretic Peptide Patents, including the right to grant licenses and to make assignments without approval from Medtronic.

&#160;

The Transfer Agreement became effective on October 8, 2014 and will expire simultaneously at the expiration of the last to expire of the valid claims. Both parties have the right to terminate the Transfer Agreement upon 30 days written notice to the other party in the event of a default which has not been cured within such 30-day period. In addition, Medtronic had the right to terminate the Transfer Agreement and to have the rights to the Natriuretic Peptide Patents reassigned to it by the Company if either the Company, an affiliate, or a non-party licensee failed to commence a clinical trial of a CD-NP product within 18 months from the effective date. Such condition was satisfied when the Company initiated its clinical trial of Cenderitide in January 2015.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

In the event of a termination of the Transfer Agreement, (i) the Natriuretic Peptide Patents which were not owned or co-owned by the Company prior to the effective date of the Transfer Agreement shall be assigned back to Medtronic; (ii) the Company&#8217;s rights in the Natriuretic Peptide Patents that were co-owned by Capricor pursuant to the Clinical Trial Funding Agreement will remain with the Company, subject to the surviving terms and provisions thereof; and (iii) the Company shall assign back to Medtronic those rights that were co-owned by Medtronic pursuant to the Clinical Trial Funding Agreement.

&#160;

Pursuant to the Transfer Agreement, Medtronic was paid an upfront payment of $100,000, and the Company is obligated to pay Medtronic a mid-single-digit royalty on net sales of products, a low double-digit percentage of any consideration received from any sublicenses or other grant of rights, and a mid-double-digit percentage of any monetary awards or settlements received by the Company as a result of enforcement of the Natriuretic Peptide Patents against a non-party entity, less the costs and attorney&#8217;s fees incurred to enforce the Natriuretic Peptide Patents. In addition, there are additional payments that may become due from the Company upon the achievement of certain defined milestones, which payments, in the aggregate, total up to $7.0 million.

&#160; 

Manufacturing 

&#160; 

Capricor presently maintains its laboratory and research facilities in leased premises located at CSMC (the &#8220;CSMC Lease&#8221;). Additionally, Capricor presently manufactures its cells in a facility which is owned by and located within CSMC and in which we believe we follow current good manufacturing practices. It is Capricor&#8217;s intention is to manufacture cells at this facility for its currently enrolling ALLSTAR and HOPE-Duchenne clinical studies. If the CSMC Lease is terminated or if CSMC revokes its permission to allow Capricor to utilize the manufacturing facility, Capricor would have to secure alternative facilities in which to operate its research and development activities and/or manufacture its products, which would involve a significant monetary investment and would negatively impact the progress of our clinical trials and regulatory approvals. In addition, we would have to establish a collaboration agreement with a third party or build out our own manufacturing facility for any Phase III trial. We are actively in discussions with third parties regarding a potential technology transfer of our cell manufacturing processes in anticipation of potential advanced clinical studies and commercialization.

&#160; 

CAP-1001: 

&#160;

The manufacturing process begins with a biopsy of cardiac tissue from the patient taken during a simple outpatient procedure. This tissue is taken to the lab where the cells are isolated, expanded, and processed through a series of proprietary unit operations. After release testing and quality review of the manufacturing data, this drug product is then administered into the same patient. The time frame for autologous manufacturing is 6-8 weeks post-biopsy until the product can be administered to the patient.

&#160; 

CAP-1002: 

&#160;

The process for manufacturing CAP-1002 differs very little from the CAP-1001 process, except that it can be executed at a significantly larger scale. This is because the starting material is from an entire heart taken from a donor, and collected from an organ procurement organization (OPO), rather than a small biopsy taken from the patient. After expanding, processing, release testing and quality review, the CAP-1002 product becomes available for administration to patients. CAP-1002 is cryo-preserved, enabling us to produce large lots that can be frozen and then administered to patients as needed. We believe that the allogeneic nature of CAP-1002 enables us to potentially create a commercially scalable stem cell product.

&#160;

Cenderitide and CU-NP: 

&#160; 

We do not currently manufacture Cenderitide or CU-NP in-house, nor do we have the capacity to do so. Accordingly, we have established relationships with third-party manufacturers and other service providers to perform these services for us. We have historically relied on individual proposals and purchase orders to meet our needs and have typically relied on terms and conditions proposed by the third party or us to govern our rights and obligations under each order (including provisions with respect to intellectual property, if any). We do not have any material long-term agreements or commitments that are currently in place.

&#160;

Exosomes: 

&#160;

The process for manufacturing exosomes starts with the proprietary process of creating a cell bank from donor heart tissue through the expansion of CDCs. Afterwards exosomes are isolated from the expanded CDCs. After CDC-derived exosomes are prepared, formulated, filled, tested, and validated, the exosomes product becomes available for therapeutic use. We believe that the allogeneic, acellular nature of exosomes enables us to potentially create a commercially scalable stem cell-derived product.

Research and Development 

&#160; 

Capricor&#8217;s research and development program has been funded in large part through Federal grants totaling approximately $7.0 million. In addition, Capricor has been granted a loan award in the approximate amount of $19.8 million from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine, or CIRM, to fund Phase II of the ALLSTAR trial. Because the Company is decreasing the number of patients to be enrolled in the ALLSTAR clinical trial, it is undetermined at the time of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K how much of the remaining CIRM loan award will ultimately be disbursed under the CIRM Loan Agreement. Our research and development efforts to date have led to the development of four product candidates which have reached various stages of pre-clinical and clinical development: autologous CDCs, allogeneic CDCs, Cenderitide and exosomes. Ongoing research focuses on in-depth product characterization, expanded use of current products, development of next generation products and identification of new technologies and indications. Capricor aims to create a pipeline of regenerative medicine products potentially capable of improving the healing capacity of injured tissue. Capricor&#8217;s research continues to explore the growth factors and cytokines that have been shown to reduce both infarct (scar) size and promote regeneration of heart muscle or other tissues injured by ischemia. Our research is also exploring the use of natriuretic peptides for the treatment of patients with post-acute heart failure as well as potential indications for the use of exosomes. Capricor spent approximately $13.8 million and $7.8 million on research and development activities for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Subject to finalization of definitive documents, the HOPE-Duchenne clinical trial will be funded in part through a grant award from CIRM in the amount of approximately $3.4 million. Both the milestones and the rate of disbursement of the award proceeds will be set forth in the definitive documents, which have not been determined as of the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160; 

We are engaged in fields that are characterized by extensive worldwide research and competition by pharmaceutical companies, medical device companies, specialized biotechnology companies, hospitals, physicians and academic institutions, both in the United States and abroad. The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive, with a number of established, large pharmaceutical companies, as well as many smaller companies. Many of the organizations competing with us have substantially greater financial resources, larger research and development staffs and facilities, longer drug development history in obtaining regulatory approvals, and greater manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do. There are many pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, public and private universities, government agencies, and research organizations actively engaged in research and development of products which may target the same indications as our product candidates. We expect any future products and product candidates we develop to compete on the basis of, among other things, product efficacy and safety, time to market, price, extent of adverse side effects, and convenience of treatment procedures. The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are subject to rapid and significant technological change. The drugs that we are attempting to develop will have to compete with existing therapies. Our future success will depend in part on our ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to evolving cell therapies as well as our other novel technologies. There can be no assurance that existing or future therapies developed by others will not render our potential products obsolete or noncompetitive. In addition, companies pursuing different but related fields represent substantial competition. These organizations also compete with us to attract qualified personnel and parties for acquisitions, joint ventures, or other collaborations.

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160;

The research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution and marketing, among other things, of our product candidates are extensively regulated by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and its implementing regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements may subject us to administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve a pending new drug application, or NDA, or a pending biologics license application, or BLA, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions and/or criminal prosecution.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Drug Approval Process 

&#160;

A drug or drug candidate may not be marketed or sold in the United States until it has received FDA approval. The process to receiving such approval is long, expensive and risky, and includes the following steps:

&#160;

&#183; pre-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies; &#183; submission to the FDA of an IND for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; &#183; adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each indication; &#183; submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA; &#183; satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs; and &#183; FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA. &#160;

Regulation by United States and foreign governmental authorities is a significant factor affecting our ability to commercialize any of our products, as well as the timing of such commercialization and our ongoing research and development activities. The commercialization of drug products requires regulatory approval by governmental agencies prior to commercialization. Various laws and regulations govern or influence the research and development, non-clinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, processing, packing, validation, safety, labeling, storage, record keeping, registration, listing, distribution, advertising, sale, marketing and post-marketing commitments of our products. The lengthy process of seeking these approvals, and the subsequent compliance with applicable laws and regulations, require expending substantial resources.

&#160;

Pharmaceutical products such as ours may not be commercially marketed without prior approval from the FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in other countries. In the United States, the process for obtaining FDA approval typically includes pre-clinical studies, the filing of an investigational new drug, or IND, application, human clinical trials and filing and approval of either an NDA, for chemical pharmaceutical products, or a BLA for biological pharmaceutical products. The results of pre-clinical testing, which include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product and its formulations, details concerning the drug manufacturing process and its controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol and other information must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND that must be reviewed and become effective before clinical testing can begin. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, for approval covering each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. Once a sponsor submits an IND, the sponsor must wait 30 calendar days before initiating any clinical trials. If the FDA has comments or questions within this 30-day period, the issue(s) must be resolved to the satisfaction of the FDA before clinical trials can begin. In addition, the FDA, an IRB or Capricor may impose a clinical hold on ongoing clinical trials due to safety concerns. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, clinical trials can only proceed under terms authorized by the FDA. Our non-clinical and clinical studies must conform to the FDA&#8217;s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, and Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, requirements, respectively, which are designed to ensure the quality and integrity of submitted data and protect the rights and well-being of study patients. Information for certain clinical trials also must be publicly disclosed within certain time limits on the clinical trial registry and results databank maintained by the NIH.

&#160;

Typically, clinical testing involves a three-phase process; however, the phases may overlap or be combined:

&#160;

&#183; Phase I clinical trials typically are conducted in a small number of volunteers or patients to assess the early tolerability and safety profile, and the pattern of drug absorption, distribution and metabolism; &#160;

&#183; Phase II clinical trials typically are conducted in a limited patient population with a specific disease in order to assess appropriate dosages and dose regimens, expand evidence of the safety profile and evaluate preliminary efficacy; and &#160;

&#183; Phase III clinical trials typically are larger scale, multicenter, well-controlled trials conducted on patients with a specific disease to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the registration of the drug. &#160;

The results of the pre-clinical and clinical testing, chemistry, manufacturing and control information, proposed labeling and other information are then submitted to the FDA in the form of either an NDA or BLA for review and potential approval to begin commercial sales. In responding to an NDA or BLA, the FDA may grant marketing approval, request additional information in a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, or deny the approval if it determines that the NDA or BLA does not provide an adequate basis for approval. A CRL generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of an NDA or BLA and may require additional testing. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter, which authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications, and sometimes with specified post-marketing commitments and/or distribution and use restrictions imposed under a REMS program. Any approval required from the FDA might not be obtained on a timely basis, if at all.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Among the conditions for an NDA or BLA approval is the requirement that the manufacturing operations conform on an ongoing basis with current cGMP. In complying with cGMP, we must expend time, money and effort in the areas of training, production and quality control within our own organization and at our contract manufacturing facilities. A successful inspection of the manufacturing facility by the FDA is usually a prerequisite for final approval of a pharmaceutical product. Following approval of the NDA or BLA, we and our manufacturers will remain subject to periodic inspections by the FDA to assess compliance with cGMP requirements and the conditions of approval. We will also face similar inspections coordinated by foreign regulatory authorities.

&#160;

Post -Approval Requirements 

&#160;

Often times, even after a drug has been approved by the FDA for sale, the FDA may require that certain post-approval requirements be satisfied, including the conduct of additional clinical studies. If such post-approval requirements are not satisfied, the FDA may withdraw its approval of the drug. In addition, holders of an approved NDA or BLA are required to report certain adverse reactions to the FDA, comply with certain requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for their products, and continue to have quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, after approval. The FDA periodically inspects the sponsor&#8217;s records related to safety reporting and/or manufacturing facilities; this latter effort includes assessment of compliance with cGMP. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.

&#160;

Capricor presently manufactures its cells in a facility which is owned by and located within CSMC and in which we believe we follow good manufacturing practices. Capricor&#8217;s intention is to manufacture cells at this facility for its currently enrolling trials. If CSMC were to revoke its permission to allow Capricor to utilize the facility, Capricor would have to secure alternative facilities in which to operate its research and development activities and/or manufacture its products which would involve a significant monetary investment and would negatively impact the progress of Capricor&#8217;s clinical trials and regulatory approvals. In addition, we will have to establish a collaboration agreement with a third party or build out our own manufacturing facility for any Phase III trial.

&#160; 

As we proceed with the development of Cenderitide or possibly, CU-NP, we intend to use third-party manufacturers to produce our products in clinical and commercial quantities, and future FDA inspections may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved NDA or BLA, including withdrawal of the product from the market.

Description of Property 

&#160; 

We do not own any real property. Our principal offices are located at 8840 Wilshire Blvd., 2nd Floor, Beverly Hills, California 90211. Under the terms of a two-year lease (the &#8220;Bubble Lease&#8221;) which originally was set to expire on June 30, 2015, the base rent for the first 12-month period was $16,620 per month, and the base rent for the second 12-month period will be $17,285. On March 3, 2015, Capricor executed a Second Amendment to Lease with The Bubble Real Estate Company, LLC, pursuant to which additional space was added to the Bubble Lease and we exercised our option to extend the term of the Bubble Lease through June 30, 2016. Under the terms of the Second Amendment to the Bubble Lease, commencing February 2, 2015, the base rent increased to $17,957 for one month. Commencing on March 2, 2015, the base rent increased to $21,420 per month for the following four month period and commencing July 1, 2015, the base rent increased to $22,111 per month. At the time of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are exploring different lease options, including renewing our current lease or moving to a different office location.

&#160;

Capricor currently leases two research laboratories from CSMC under the terms of a three-year lease which expires on June 1, 2017. The rent expense for the first six-month period was approximately $15,461 per month. Commencing with the seventh month of the lease term, the rent expense increased to approximately $19,350 per month. The amount of rent expense is subject to annual adjustments according to increases in the Consumer Price Index.

&#160;

With permission from CSMC, Capricor presently manufactures its cells and exosomes in a facility which is owned by and located within CSMC and in which we believe we follow good manufacturing practices. Our laboratories and manufacturing facility are located at 8700 Beverly Blvd., Los Angeles, California 90048. As our operations expand, we expect our space requirements and related expenses to increase.
