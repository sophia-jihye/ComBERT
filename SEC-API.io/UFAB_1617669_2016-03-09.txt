Automotive Industry Analysis and Industry Trends 

The automotive parts industry provides components, systems, subsystems and modules to OEMs for the manufacture of new vehicles, and had approximately $245 billion of North American annual revenue in 2014 according to an April 2015 Bank of America Merrill Lynch report on the automotive supplier market. Within the automotive parts industry, North America is the Company&#8217;s core market. We manufacture multi-material foam, rubber, and plastic components utilized in noise, vibration and harshness management, acoustical management, water and air sealing, decorative and other functional applications. 

Demand for automotive parts in the OEM market is generally a function of the number of new vehicles produced, which is primarily driven by macro-economic factors such as credit availability, interest rates, fuel prices, consumer confidence, employment and other trends. Although OEM demand is tied to actual vehicle production, participants in the automotive parts industry also have the opportunity to grow through increasing product content per vehicle by further penetrating business with existing customers and in existing markets, gaining new customers and increasing their presence in global markets. We believe that as a company with a North American presence and advanced technology, engineering, manufacturing and customer support capabilities, we are well-positioned to take advantage of these opportunities. 

Overall, we expect long-term growth of vehicle sales and production in the OEM market. The automobile industry in the last seven years has seen increased customer sales and production schedules with production volumes in the last three years higher than OEM production volumes prior to the industry disruptions experienced after the financial market crisis of 2008. We anticipate that the North American automotive production will continue to recover from the low point experienced in 2009. According to IHS Automotive, North American vehicle production increased during 2015 to 17.5 million units, an expansion of approximately 3.4% compared to 2014. Bolstered by a wave of new vehicle introductions and favorable demographic trends, IHS projects continued growth in North American unit production volumes to 18.2 million units in 2016, an approximate 4.0% increase from 2015, and 19.0 million units in 2019, as depicted in the following chart. IHS Automotive currently predicts that production volumes will remain flat in 2020 and 2021 compared to 2019.

In addition to the overall industry growth, we believe there are a variety of trends that are influencing the future of the global automotive market. We believe we positively are positioned to benefit from an increasing number of trends driven by market forces such as: 

&#8226; 

Fuel efficiency/vehicle light-weighting : Expanding government mandates on fuel efficiency and emission reductions, will continue to force the automotive industry to focus on improving the fuel economy of vehicles. In addition, the evolution of materials utilized in vehicles is moving away from conventional steel as the primary material, which comprised approximately 65% of vehicles content in 2010, and is expected to decrease to 10 &#8211; 20% by 2025, according to industry sources. Conventional steel is expected to be increasingly replaced by lighter weight materials with increasing use of plastics and foam materials per vehicle. 

&#8226; 

Interior comfort : Comfort of interiors consistently rank in the top three factors that consumers consider when purchasing a new vehicle, and is a key area where vehicle manufactures can differentiate their vehicles. The comfort of the interior is an area of increased focus for the OEM manufacturers with each new generation of vehicles. This is expected to continue to increase the use of foam in seats and acoustical insulation in more and more vehicles. 

&#8226; 

Telematics and Infotainment : The increasing use of telematics and infotainment requires increasingly quieter vehicles for the telematics systems to recognize voice commands and passengers to enjoy the infotainment options. Over the next four years, approximately 80% of all new vehicles are expected to include voice recognition systems, increasing the need for quiet interiors. The result will be increased use of acoustic insulation materials, more precise air seals and other noise, vibration and harshness products in all vehicles. 

&#8226; 

Rapid pace of new vehicle launches : In order to meet consumers&#8217; increasing demand for new products, the automotive market will see a significant number of new program launches from vehicle manufacturers over the next few years. Each new vehicle launch creates new product opportunities for us because of the OEMs need for noise, vibration and harshness solutions as they discover unplanned noise issues at the launch of production for a new vehicle program. 

&#8226; 

Localization of production : Due to freight costs, currency fluctuations, logistic issues and protection of supply many foreign vehicle manufacturers have increased their production volumes in North America and are increasing local sourcing of vehicle components. We believe that Unique&#8217;s production facilities are situated in geographic proximity to the majority of North American vehicle assembly locations provides a competitive advantage. 

We believe these market trends create opportunities for us to achieve above market growth rates as a result of increased content per vehicle, higher production volumes, geographic shifts in vehicle production, and evolving customer sourcing strategies. Our challenge is to continue developing leading edge solutions focused on addressing these trends, and applying those solutions via products with sustainable margins that enable our customers to produce distinctive market-leading products. 

As an example of our innovative technical capabilities, we utilized our thermoforming process to develop and produce a line of lightweight flexible air duct systems for a leading OEM, providing an 80% weight reduction and enhanced functionality. This air duct system has developed into Unique&#8217;s patent pending TwinShape line of proprietary ducts. Unique has secured development and prototyping contracts with four additional OEMs for potential inclusion of this product in vehicle programs starting with model years 2017 and 2018 vehicles. 

We generate a significant number of new sales opportunities from customer challenges, such as buzz, squeak, rattle (BSR) or noise, vibration and harshness issues (NVH), discovered during the launch of production for a new vehicle program. In many of these situations, we develop and begin supplying a solution within days, a level of responsiveness that avoids competitive requests for quotations and produces premium value for our customers. Given the projected rapid pace of new vehicle launches over the next three years, we expect to benefit from an increasing number of opportunities sourced late in the launch cycle. 

Appliance, HVAC, and Water Heater Industries 

We are a leading provider of fabricated, non-metallic components to a diverse group of OEMs and tiered suppliers in the appliance, HVAC, and water heater industries. These sales represented approximately 16.0% of net sales for the year ended January 3, 2016. These components are primarily manufactured from foam, adhesives, fiberglass, rubber and board-back material. We have extensive materials, engineering and fabrication expertise and deliver custom-designed, innovative solutions for our customers. Our component solutions primarily consist of products used in gasketing, heat deflection, packaging, insulation, water seals, noise reduction and vibration control. Demand for these end-market products is largely driven by the health of the housing sector. We believe that each respective industry will receive the positive benefits of a recovering economy and especially the benefits of a recovering residential real estate market. The National Association of Home Builders forecasts that there will be approximately 1.3 million new housing starts in 2016, approximately 13% more than 1.1 million new housing starts during 2015. We believe that the appliance, HVAC, and water heater industries are currently primed for favorable growth. 

The United States appliance industry is forecast to show modest growth through 2017, as new and existing home sales, as well as home improvement spending, both of which have a direct impact on appliance industry sales, continue to show upward momentum. According to the latest Appliance Magazine&#8217;s Annual US Appliance Industry Forecast, forecasted unit shipments for this industry in the United States are expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 3.5% through 2017 to reach approximately 46.4 million units per year, which would put the industry close to its peak sales years of 2004 &#8211; 2006. We believe these benefits will increase the demand for our products from clients such as GE and Whirlpool. 

The HVAC and water heater industries are also poised to benefit from the gains in the housing and home improvement markets. According to the same Appliance Magazine Industry Forecast, shipments of heating and cooling units in the United States are expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 2.4% through 2017, while shipments of residential and commercial water heaters are expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 2.6% through 2017. We believe this trend will increase the demand for our products from clients such as AO Smith, Rheem and Trane. 

Our Objectives 

Our goals are to provide exceptional quality, reliable on-time delivery, competitive cost, and technical innovation with rapid engineering support. The objective is for Unique to be the easiest source for our customers to do business with, while being a great place to work for our team members.

We also strive to achieve growth at above industry levels through strong competitive capabilities in engineering, manufacturing, and program management that contribute to leading positions in cost and quality. In addition, the Company will selectively continue to pursue opportunistic acquisitions that provide additional products and processes, as well as entrance into new growth markets. 

We work together with our customers in various stages of production, including initial concept and development, routine engineering problem resolution during their product launches and ongoing value engineering. In addition, we work together with our customers on component sourcing, quality assurance, manufacturing and delivery in order to develop long-standing business relationships. We believe we are well-positioned to meet customer needs and have a strong, established reputation with customers for providing high-quality products at competitive prices, as well as for timely delivery and customer service. Given that both the automotive OEM business and the appliance/water heater OEM business involve long-term business awarded on a platform-by-platform basis, our intent is to leverage our strong technical expertise and customer relationships to obtain new platform awards. 

Our Strengths 

Our mission is to deliver innovative and timely customer solutions for noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) management, water and air sealing and other functional and decorative applications. We employ our extensive knowledge of raw materials and adhesives, our engineering and creative resources and rapid response to deliver rapid technical innovation, exceptional quality, reliable on-time delivery and competitive costs. We believe the key to our core competitive strengths are as follows: 

Strong technical expertise. We have tremendous depth of expertise and knowledge of materials, adhesives, manufacturing processes and the product applications of our customers. Our understanding of our customers&#8217; design and performance needs, and how our products interface with their applications allows us to engineer effective product solutions. We believe that our engineering talent, test facilities and rapid prototyping capabilities distinguish us from our competitors and enable us to rapidly innovate and develop products that resolve customers&#8217; problems, often within 24 to 48 hours. By understanding our customers&#8217; products and processes, when we are confronted with a customer engineering challenge, we can conceptualize a design concept that allows us to capitalize on the optimum combination of materials to solve a given problem. We have the ability to create our own prototype tools in-house so that we can go directly from concept to hardware and quickly present tangible product solutions for our customers to evaluate. Our ability to rapidly address customer challenges and provide prototype parts that include the use of new materials, products or processes is one of our key competitive strengths. 

Operational Excellence. We are dedicated to maintaining a culture of continuous improvement. We utilize lean manufacturing techniques and statistical methods to drive productivity and quality improvement. We use quality, delivery and speed-to-market as competitive advantages. Lean manufacturing not only improves overall costs and quality, it also improves product velocity through the manufacturing process. This leads to better response time and greater flexibility in scheduling. Our reputation for high quality, innovative products is attributable to a constant emphasis on engineering, including materials engineering, product and process engineering, and sales engineering, coupled with our dedication to lean manufacturing to ensure effective execution. 

Depth of customer relationships. We have developed long-term relationships with a customer base that we target deliberately, each of which has substantial requirements for NVH management, water and air sealing, functional and decorative components. Due to our technical sophistication, raw material and adhesive innovation and rapid responsiveness, we have a reputation with our key customers as the supplier of choice for our core products within the North American automotive and appliance markets. Our sales engineers have developed deep relationships with the technical teams of our key customers. The customers&#8217; engineers leverage our materials knowledge and utilize us as a resource to help them solve problems and/or pursue product enhancements. This enables us to become involved early in the design/development stage of new vehicles or appliances, leading to opportunities to introduce new products. In certain situations, we are able to influence the customer design specifications from which new business is awarded. 

Key relationships with suppliers. We have long relationships with over 150 raw material and adhesive suppliers. We track new developments in materials, and pursue exclusive relationships with those suppliers that develop innovative raw materials and adhesives. Our key suppliers see us as a way to introduce their new products and technology to the marketplace and obtain the necessary customer approvals. This, in turn, can lead to Unique being first to market with certain products or materials. For example, this has led to us having exclusive access for our types of products to the only source of recycled polyol for polyurethane in the industry. While products incorporating these materials accounted for less than 1% of net sales for the year ended January 3, 2016, we believe these recycled materials are opening up opportunities for new product variations that other competitors cannot offer. We constantly collaborate with our suppliers to develop new materials and adhesive combinations that exhibit a cost, quality and/or performance enhancement for our customers. 

Proximity to key customers. Our manufacturing facilities are strategically located to serve the North American automotive and appliance industries. Our primary manufacturing centers are in the Midwestern and Southeastern regions of the United States and Mexico. We believe that our manufacturing facilities are within approximately 500 miles of over 80.0% of North American vehicle production, and even closer to major appliance manufacturing locations. This is advantageous, because our products are light in weight, and transportation costs can be a significant portion of the delivered cost of products. 

Our Strategy 

Our business strategy is to be a valued partner in our customers&#8217; product development and production processes by producing exceptional quality and providing reliable on-time delivery, competitive costs, and technical innovation with rapid engineering support. We utilize our extensive knowledge of raw materials and adhesives combined with our engineering development and rapid responsiveness to deliver innovative and timely customer solutions for NVH management, water and air sealing, decorative and other functional applications. 

We attempt to align our internal human resources and technical capabilities to take advantage of industry mega trends, such as light weighting, telematics, and reduced energy consumption, which we believe will produce profitable revenue growth opportunities from our existing operations. In addition, our growth plan includes initiatives to develop certain new products and new markets which provide incremental growth opportunities. We believe that significant opportunities exist to continue to grow our business and increase profitability by focusing on the following: 

Further Penetrate Existing Markets with Existing Products and Processes. We believe we are positioned to gain share and grow in existing markets with our current products and processes, capitalizing on the industry&#8217;s increasing demand for NVH management content coupled with our capabilities, including exclusive proprietary materials sold to existing customers and targeted new customers. As vehicles change materials to reduce weight, vehicles are utilizing more rubber and plastic components like those designed and supplied by Unique. In addition, the increasing use of telematics is driving a need for quieter interiors in vehicles at all levels. This is causing an increase in the amount of acoustical insulation and solutions per vehicle. Separately, the rate of increase in vehicle production is projected to be significantly higher in the Southern United States and Mexico than elsewhere in North America over the next five years. We hope to capitalize on our ability to service customers in different geographical locations through our manufacturing facilities in the Midwestern and Southeastern regions of the United States and Mexico. 

Develop New Products and Processes for Existing Markets. We have developed and earned the reputation as a problem solver to our current customers. As a result, we are in the position to develop complementary products and processes that can be sold to the same purchasing and engineering groups that already do business with us. By adding products and processes to our portfolio that broaden our scope with existing engineers and purchasing groups, we can offer one stop shopping, that allows them to reduce their supply base and complexity, while increasing sales opportunities for Unique. We work closely with raw material and adhesive suppliers to develop innovative solutions that offer cost and performance improvement. We constantly focus on finding new applications for molded products utilizing thermoforming, compression and fusion molding. These activities frequently lead to the development of new or novel products not yet in common use. When this occurs, we actively explore the patentability of the product. Protection of our intellectual property is a conscious part of our strategy of using technology and innovation as a competitive advantage. An example of this is our patent pending for light weight TwinShape duct technology. 

Create New Markets with Existing Products and Processes. While the specific products may vary, we have identified numerous opportunities to sell products fabricated using die cut and molding technology into new markets such as medical and not currently served industrial markets. We have demonstrated the ability to develop cost effective products utilizing various materials. Our recent acquisitions have provided the Company with credible access to a variety of new markets for our products. Because of our strategic acquisitions, we are currently developing new products for the appliance, water heater and HVAC industries utilizing our various molding technologies. We are also exploring increased opportunities for medical products. Raw material and adhesive suppliers rely on us to provide marketplace insight into new or emerging customer challenges. We have the capability to combine new materials with new processes to create cost effective products in new markets 

Pursue Acquisitions. We expect to selectively pursue acquisitions that add new products and/or processes or geographic and market expansion to further expand our portfolio of customer solutions. Since December 2013, management has completed three accretive add-on acquisitions that added new markets and additional manufacturing processes to our capabilities. Management has a long history of identifying and successfully integrating new platforms. We will continue to use our relationship with Taglich Private Equity, LLC., which sponsored our formation, to identify evaluate and execute acquisition opportunities.
