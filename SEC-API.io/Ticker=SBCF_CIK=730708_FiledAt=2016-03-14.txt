 Item 1. Business &#160; 

General 

&#160;

We are a bank holding company, incorporated in Florida in 1983, and registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the &#8220;BHC Act&#8221;). Our principal subsidiary is Seacoast National Bank, a national banking association (&#8220;Seacoast National&#8221;). Seacoast National commenced its operations in 1933, and operated as &#8220;First National Bank &#38; Trust Company of the Treasure Coast&#8221; prior to 2006 when we changed its name to Seacoast National Bank.

&#160;

As a bank holding company, we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our subsidiaries, including Seacoast National. We coordinate the financial resources of the consolidated enterprise and maintain financial, operational and administrative systems that allow centralized evaluation of subsidiary operations and coordination of selected policies and activities. Our operating revenues and net income are derived primarily from Seacoast National through dividends and fees for services performed.

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, we had total consolidated assets of approximately $3.535 billion, total deposits of approximately $2.844 billion, total consolidated liabilities, including deposits, of approximately $3.181 billion and consolidated shareholders&#8217; equity of approximately $353.5 million. Our operations are discussed in more detail under &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#8221;

&#160;

We and our subsidiaries offer a full array of deposit accounts and retail banking services, engage in consumer and commercial lending and provide a wide variety of trust and asset management services, as well as securities and annuity products to our customers. Seacoast National had 43 traditional banking offices in 14 counties in Florida at year-end 2015. We have 18 branches in the &#8220;Treasure Coast of Florida,&#8221; including the counties of Martin, St. Lucie and Indian River on Florida&#8217;s southeastern coast. During 2013, we expanded our footprint by strategically opening five new commercial lending offices in the larger metropolitan markets we serve, more specifically, three in Orlando, one in Boca Raton, and one in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. More recently, in October 2014, we acquired 12 branches in Central Florida through our acquisition of The BANKshares, Inc., a Florida corporation (&#8220;BANKshares&#8221;), and its subsidiary bank, BankFIRST, and in July 2015, we acquired 3 branches in Palm Beach County (closing one branch in close proximity to an existing Seacoast branch) through our acquisition of Grand Bankshares, Inc., a Florida corporation (&#8220;Grand Bankshares&#8221;), and its subsidiary bank, Grand Bank (&#8220;Grand&#8221;).

&#160;

Most of our banking offices have one or more automated teller machines (&#8220;ATMs&#8221;) providing customers with 24-hour access to their deposit accounts. We are a member of the &#8220;NYCE Payments Network,&#8221; an electronic funds transfer organization represented in all fifty states in the United States, which permits banking customers access to their accounts at 2.5 million participating ATMs and retail locations throughout the United States. During 2014, Seacoast National partnered with Publix, a major grocery chain in the state of Florida, to offer free access at over 1,000 Publix ATMs within the state of Florida. Our debit cards are accepted wherever VISA is accepted.

&#160;

Seacoast National&#8217;s &#8220;MoneyPhone&#8221; system allows customers to access information on their loan or deposit account balances, transfer funds between linked accounts, make loan payments, and verify deposits or checks that may have cleared, all over the telephone. This service is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

&#160;

6&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

In addition, customers may access banking information via Seacoast National&#8217;s Customer Service Center (&#8220;CSC&#8221;) 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Our CSC staff is available to open accounts, take applications for certain types of loans, resolve account issues, and offer information on other bank products and services to existing and potential customers.

&#160;

We also offer Internet and Mobile banking to business and retail customers. These services allow customers to access transactional information on their deposit accounts, review loan and deposit balances, transfer funds between linked accounts and deposit checks to and loan payments from a deposit account, all over the Internet or their Mobile device, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Seacoast National has significantly expanded its technology platform and the products offered to its customers by introducing digital deposit capture on smart phones, launching new consumer and business tablet and mobile platforms, rebranding its website, and enhancing its automatic teller machine capabilities.

&#160;

Seacoast National also provides brokerage and annuity services. Seacoast National personnel involved with the sale of these services are dual employees with Invest Financial Corporation, the company through which Seacoast National presently conducts its brokerage and annuity services.

&#160;

Seacoast National has seven, wholly-owned subsidiaries:

&#160;

&#183; FNB Insurance Services, Inc. (&#8220;FNB Insurance&#8221;), an inactive subsidiary, which was formed to provide insurance agency services; &#160;

&#183; South Branch Building, Inc., which is a general partner in a partnership that constructed a branch facility of Seacoast National; &#160;

&#183; TCoast Holdings, LLC, BR West, LLC, and TC Property Ventures, LLC, each of which was formed to own and operate certain properties acquired through foreclosure. TC Stuart, LLC, similar in operation, was dissolved in the state of Florida on April 26, 2013; &#160;

&#183; Commercial Business Finance, Inc. (&#8220;CBF&#8221;), a receivables factoring company, acquired in the BANKshares acquisition, that provides working capital financing for small to medium sized businesses; and &#160;

&#183; BankFIRST Realty, Inc., acquired in the BANKshares acquisition, which owns and operates certain properties acquired through foreclosure. We anticipate dissolution of this entity during 2016, when remaining foreclosed properties are expected to be sold. &#160;

The operations of each of these direct and indirect subsidiaries represented less than 10% of our consolidated assets and contributed less than 10% to our consolidated revenues in 2015.

&#160;

We directly own all the common equity in six statutory trusts relating to our trust preferred securities:

&#160;

&#183; SBCF Capital Trust I, formed on March 31, 2005 for the purpose of issuing $20 million in trust preferred securities; &#160;

&#183; SBCF Statutory Trust II, formed on December 16, 2005 for the purpose of issuing $20 million in trust preferred securities; &#160;

&#183; SBCF Statutory Trust III, formed on June 29, 2007 for the purpose of issuing $12 million in trust preferred securities; &#160;

7&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; BankFIRST (FL) Statutory Trust I, formed on December 19, 2002 for the purpose of issuing $5.2 million in trust preferred securities; &#160;

&#183; BankFIRST (FL) Statutory Trust II, formed on March 5, 2004 for the purpose of issuing $4.1 million in trust preferred securities; &#160;

&#183; The BANKshares Capital Trust I, formed on December 15, 2005, for the purpose of issuing $5.2 million in trust preferred securities; and &#160;

&#183; Grand Bankshares Capital Trust I, formed on October 29, 2004, also for the purpose of issuing $7.2 million in trust preferred securities. &#160;

We have operated an office of Seacoast Marine Finance Division, a division of Seacoast National, in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida since February 2000. Offices in California that have been in operation since November 2002 were closed at the end of 2014, but Seacoast National continues to have representation in California, Washington and Arizona. Seacoast Marine Finance Division is staffed with experienced marine lending professionals with a marketing emphasis on marine loans of $200,000 and greater, with the majority of loan production sold to correspondent banks on a non-recourse basis.

&#160;

During May 2015, Seacoast acquired a second receivables factoring location in Boynton Beach, Florida, and operates this office as Seacoast Business Funding, a division of Seacoast National. We believe cost synergies will be obtained by merging the back room operations of this division with that of CBF&#8217;s in early 2016, under one division manager.

&#160;

Our principal offices are located at 815 Colorado Avenue, Stuart, Florida 34994, and the telephone number at that address is (772) 287-4000. We and our subsidiary Seacoast National maintain Internet websites at www.seacoastbanking.com , www.seacoastbank.com , and www.seacoastnational.com , respectively. We are not incorporating the information on our or Seacoast National&#8217;s website into this report, and none of these websites nor the information appearing on these websites is included or incorporated in, or is a part of, this report.

&#160;

We make available, free of charge on our corporate website, our Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with or furnish it to the SEC.

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, we and our subsidiaries employed 665 full-time equivalent employees. We consider our employee relations to be good, and we have no collective bargaining agreements with any employees.

&#160; 

Expansion of Business 

&#160;

Over the years, we have expanded our products and services to meet the changing needs of the various segments of our market, and we presently expect to continue this strategy. We have expanded geographically through the addition of de novo branches. We also, from time to time, have acquired banks, bank branches and deposits, and have opened new branches and commercial lending offices.

&#160;

8&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

In October 2014, we acquired BankFIRST, a commercial bank headquartered in Winter Park, Florida, with twelve offices in five counties in Central Florida. BankFIRST was merged with Seacoast National in October 2014.

&#160;

In July 2015, we acquired Grand, a commercial bank headquartered in West Palm Beach, Florida, with three offices in Palm Beach County. Grand was merged into Seacoast National in July 2015.

&#160;

In October 2015, Seacoast National entered into a Branch Sale Agreement with BMO Harris Bank N.A. (&#8220;BMO&#8221;) pursuant to which Seacoast National has agreed to purchase fourteen branches of BMO located in the Orlando MSA, which will add approximately $355 million of deposits, and approximately $70 million in loans. This transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2016, subject to regulatory approval or other customary conditions.

&#160;

In November 2015, we and Seacoast National entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Floridian Financial Group, Inc., a Florida corporation (&#8220; Floridian &#8221;), and Floridian&#8217;s wholly-owned subsidiary, Floridian Bank, a Florida chartered commercial bank. This acquisition will add approximately $426 million in assets, $361 million in deposits, and $289 million in gross loans. This transaction closed March 11, 2016.

&#160;

Florida law permits statewide branching, and Seacoast National has expanded, and anticipates future expansion, by opening additional bank offices and facilities, as well as by acquisition of other financial institutions and branches. Since 2002, we have opened and acquired 34 new offices in 14 counties of Florida. With technology improvements and changes to our customers&#8217; banking preferences, we have also rationalized our branch footprint by closing and consolidating certain branches. Since 2007, we have closed 19 offices in seven counties of Florida, with three offices consolidated during 2015, five offices consolidated in December 2014, and two offices consolidated in January 2013. During 2013, we opened five new commercial lending offices in our larger metropolitan locations in Florida, with three opened in Orlando, one in Ft. Lauderdale and one in Boca Raton. The Seacoast Marine Finance Division operates a loan production office in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, and has representation in California, Washington and Arizona. For more information on our branches and offices see &#8220;Item 2. Properties&#8221;. As part of our overall strategic growth plan, we intend to regularly evaluate possible mergers, acquisitions and other expansion opportunities. We believe that with the current economic environment, there may be additional opportunities for us to acquire and consolidate other financial institutions in the State of Florida.

&#160; 

Seasonality; Cycles 

&#160;

We believe our commercial banking operations are somewhat seasonal in nature. Investment management fees and deposits often peak in the first and second quarters, and often are lowest in the third quarter. Transactional fees from merchants, and ATM and debit card use also typically peak in the first and second quarters. Public deposits tend to increase with tax collections in the first and fourth quarters and decline as a result of spending thereafter.

&#160;

Commercial and residential real estate activity, demand, prices and sales volumes are less seasonal and vary based upon various factors, including economic conditions, interest rates and credit availability.

&#160; 

9&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160;

We and our subsidiaries operate in the highly competitive markets of Martin, St. Lucie, Indian River, Brevard, Palm Beach and Broward Counties, in southeastern Florida and in the Orlando metropolitan statistical area in Orange, Seminole and Lake County, as well as Volusia County. We also operate in five competitive counties in central Florida near Lake Okeechobee. Seacoast National not only competes with other banks of comparable or larger size in its markets, but also competes with various other nonbank financial institutions, including savings and loan associations, credit unions, mortgage companies, personal and commercial financial companies, peer to peer lending businesses, investment brokerage and financial advisory firms and mutual fund companies. We compete for deposits, commercial, fiduciary and investment services and various types of loans and other financial services. Seacoast National also competes for interest-bearing funds with a number of other financial intermediaries and investment alternatives, including mutual funds, brokerage and insurance firms, governmental and corporate bonds, and other securities. Continued consolidation, and rapid technological changes, within the financial services industry will most likely change the nature and intensity of competition that we face, but can also create opportunities for us to demonstrate and exploit what we believe are our competitive advantages.

&#160;

Our competitors include not only financial institutions based in the State of Florida, but also a number of large out-of-state and foreign banks, bank holding companies and other financial institutions that have an established market presence in the State of Florida, or that offer products by mail, telephone or over the Internet. Many of our competitors are engaged in local, regional, national and international operations and have greater assets, personnel and other resources. Some of these competitors are subject to less regulation and/or more favorable tax treatment than us. Many of these institutions have greater resources, broader geographic markets and higher lending limits than us and may offer services that we do not offer. In addition, these institutions may be able to better afford and make broader use of media advertising, support services, and electronic and other technology than us. To offset these potential competitive disadvantages, we depend on our reputation as an independent, &#8220;super&#8221; community bank headquartered locally, our personal service, our greater community involvement and our ability to make credit and other business decisions quickly and locally.

&#160; 

Supervision and Regulation 

&#160;

Bank holding companies and banks are extensively regulated under federal and state law. This discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provisions described below and is not intended to be an exhaustive description of the statutes or regulations applicable to us and Seacoast National&#8217;s business. As a bank holding company under federal law, we are subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (&#8220;Federal Reserve&#8221;). As a national bank, our primary bank subsidiary, Seacoast National, is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (&#8220;OCC&#8221;). In addition, as discussed in more detail below, Seacoast National and any other of our subsidiaries that offer consumer financial products could be subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (&#8220;CFPB&#8221;). Supervision, regulation, and examination of us, Seacoast National and our respective subsidiaries by the bank regulatory agencies are intended primarily for the protection of consumers, bank depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund (&#8220;DIF&#8221;) of the FDIC, rather than holders of our capital stock. Any change in laws, regulations, or supervisory actions, whether by the OCC, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, the CFPB, or Congress, could have a material adverse impact on us and Seacoast National.

&#160;

We are required to comply with various corporate governance and financial reporting requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rules and regulations adopted by the SEC, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, and Nasdaq. In particular, we are required to include management and independent registered public accounting firm reports on internal controls as part of our Annual Report on Form 10-K in order to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We have evaluated our controls, including compliance with the SEC rules on internal controls, and have and expect to continue to spend significant amounts of time and money on compliance with these rules. Our failure to comply with these internal control rules may materially adversely affect our reputation, ability to obtain the necessary certifications to financial statements, and the values of our securities. The assessments of our financial reporting controls as of December 31, 2015 are included in this report under &#8220;Section 9A. Controls and Procedures.&#8221;

&#160; 

Recent Regulatory Developments 

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 

&#160; 

On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act has and will continue to have a broad impact on the financial services industry, imposing significant regulatory and compliance changes, the imposition of increased capital, leverage and liquidity requirements, and numerous other provisions designed to improve supervision and oversight of, and strengthen safety and soundness within, the financial services sector. Provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that have affected or are likely to affect our operations or the operations of Seacoast National include:

&#160;

&#183; Creation of the CFPB with centralized authority, including examination and enforcement authority, for consumer protection in the banking industry. &#160;

&#183; New limitations on federal preemption. &#160;

&#183; New prohibitions and restrictions on the ability of a banking entity to engage in proprietary trading for its own account and have certain interests in, or relationships with, certain unregistered hedge funds, private equity funds and commodity pools (together, &#8220;covered funds&#8221;). &#160;

&#183; Application of new regulatory capital requirements, including changes to leverage and risk-based capital standards and changes to the components of permissible tiered capital. &#160;

&#183; Requirement that holding companies and their subsidiary banks be well capitalized and well managed in order to engage in activities permitted for financial holding companies. &#160;

&#183; Changes to the assessment base for deposit insurance premiums. &#160;

&#183; Permanently raising the FDIC&#8217;s standard maximum insurance amount to $250,000. &#160;

&#183; Repealed the prohibition of the payment of interest on demand deposits. &#160;

&#183; Restrictions on compensation, including a prohibition on incentive-based compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking by covered financial institutions that are deemed to be excessive, or that may lead to material losses. &#160;

&#183; Requirement that sponsors of asset-backed securities retain a percentage of the credit risk underlying the securities. &#160;

&#183; Requirement that banking regulators remove references to and requirements of reliance upon credit ratings from their regulations and replace them with appropriate alternatives for evaluating creditworthiness. &#160;

11&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The following items and information provided in subsequent sections provide a further description of certain relevant provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and their potential impact on our operations and activities, both currently and prospectively.

&#160;

Creation of New Governmental Authorities. The Dodd-Frank Act created various new governmental authorities such as the Oversight Council and the CFPB, an independent regulatory authority housed within the Federal Reserve. The CFPB has broad authority to regulate the offering and provision of consumer financial products.. The CFPB&#8217;s authority to supervise and examine depository institutions with $10 billion or less in assets for compliance with federal consumer laws remains largely with those institutions&#8217; primary regulators. However, the CFPB may participate in examinations of these smaller institutions on a &#8220;sampling basis&#8221; and may refer potential enforcement actions against such institutions to their primary regulators. The CFPB also may participate in examinations of Seacoast National, which currently has assets of less than $10 billion, and could supervise and examine our other direct or indirect subsidiaries that offer consumer financial products or services. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and regulations that are stricter than those regulations promulgated by the CFPB, and state attorneys general are permitted to enforce consumer protection rules adopted by the CFPB against certain institutions.

&#160;

Limitation on Federal Preemption. The Dodd-Frank Act significantly reduced the ability of national banks to rely upon federal preemption of state consumer financial laws. Although the OCC will have the ability to make preemption determinations where certain conditions are met, the broad rollback of federal preemption has the potential to create a patchwork of federal and state compliance obligations. This could, in turn, result in significant new regulatory requirements applicable to us, with attendant potential significant changes in our operations and increases in our compliance costs. It could also result in uncertainty concerning compliance, with attendant regulatory and litigation risks.

&#160;

Corporate Governance. The Dodd-Frank Act addresses many investor protection, corporate governance, and executive compensation matters that will affect most U.S. publicly traded companies. The Dodd-Frank Act (1) grants shareholders of U.S. publicly traded companies an advisory vote on executive compensation; (2) enhances independence requirements for Compensation Committee members; and (3) requires companies listed on national securities exchanges to adopt incentive-based compensation clawback policies for executive officers.

&#160;

The Dodd-Frank Act requires the banking agencies and the SEC to establish joint rules or guidelines for financial institutions with more than $1 billion in assets, such as us and Seacoast National, that prohibit incentive compensation arrangements that the agencies determine encourage inappropriate risks by the institution. The banking agencies issued proposed rules in 2011 and previously issued guidance on sound incentive compensation policies, but have not yet finalized any rules. We and Seacoast National have undertaken efforts to ensure that our incentive compensation plans do not encourage inappropriate risks, consistent with three key principles&#8212;that incentive compensation arrangements should appropriately balance risk and financial rewards, be compatible with effective controls and risk management, and be supported by strong corporate governance.

&#160;

Shareholder Say-On-Pay Votes. The Dodd-Frank Act requires public companies to take shareholders' votes on proposals addressing compensation (known as say-on-pay), the frequency of a say-on-pay vote, and the golden parachutes available to executives in connection with change-in-control transactions. Public companies must give shareholders the opportunity to vote on the compensation at least every three years and the opportunity to vote on frequency at least every six years, indicating whether the say-on-pay vote should be held annually, biennially, or triennially. The first say-on-pay vote occurred at our 2011 annual shareholders meeting. The say-on-pay, the say-on-parachute and the say-on-frequency votes are explicitly nonbinding and cannot override a decision of our board of directors.

&#160;

12&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Volcker Rule. In December 2013, the Federal Reserve and other regulators jointly issued final rules implementing requirements of a new Section 13 to the Bank Holding Company Act, commonly referred to as the &#8220;Volcker Rule.&#8221; The Volcker Rule generally prohibits us and our subsidiaries from (i) engaging in proprietary trading for our own account, and (ii) acquiring or retaining an ownership interest in or sponsoring a &#8220;covered fund,&#8221; all subject to certain exceptions. The Volcker Rule also specifies certain limited activities in which we and our subsidiaries may continue to engage, and required us to implement a compliance program. The regulators provided for a Volcker Rule conformance date of July 21, 2015. The Federal Reserve extended the conformance deadline to July 21, 2016 for certain legacy &#8220;covered funds&#8221; activities and investments in place before December 31, 2013, and the Federal Reserve expressed its intention to grant the last available statutory extension for such covered funds activities until July 21, 2017. 

&#160;

While many of the requirements called for in the Dodd-Frank Act have been implemented, others will continue to be implemented over time. Given the extent of the changes brought about by the Dodd-Frank Act and the significant discretion afforded to federal regulators to implement those changes, we cannot fully predict the extent of the impact such requirements will have on our operations. The changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may impact the profitability of our business activities, require changes to certain of our business practices, impose upon us more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage requirements or otherwise adversely affect our business. These changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes necessary to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with the new requirements may negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. While we cannot predict what effect any presently contemplated or future changes in the laws or regulations or their interpretations would have on us, these changes could be materially adverse to our investors.

&#160;

Basel III 

&#160;

We were required to comply with higher minimum capital requirements as of January 1, 2015. These new rules (&#8220;Revised Capital Rules&#8221;) implement the Dodd-Frank Act and a separate international regulatory regime known as &#8220;Basel III&#8221; (which is discussed below). Prior to January 1, 2015, we and Seacoast National were subject to risk-based capital guidelines issued by the Federal Reserve and the OCC for bank holding companies and national banks, respectively. The risk-based capital guidelines that applied to us and Seacoast National through December 31, 2014, were based upon the 1988 capital accord of the international Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, a committee of central banks and bank supervisors, as implemented by the U.S. federal banking agencies on an interagency basis.

&#160;

The following is a brief description of the relevant provisions of the Revised Capital Rules and their potential impact on our capital levels. Among other things, the Revised Capital Rules (i) introduce a new capital measure called &#8220;Common Equity Tier 1&#8221; (&#8220;CET1&#8221;), (ii) specify that Tier 1 Capital consist of CET1 and &#8220;Additional Tier 1 Capital&#8221; instruments meeting certain requirements, (iii) define CET1 narrowly by requiring that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and note to the other components of capital and (iv) expand the scope of the deductions/adjustments from capital as compared to existing regulation that apply to us and other banking organizations.

&#160;

New Minimum Capital Requirements. The Revised Capital Rules required the following initial minimum capital ratios as of January 1, 2015:

&#160;

&#183; 4.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets. &#183; 6.0% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets. &#183; 8.0% Total capital to risk-weighted assets. &#160;

13&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 4.0% Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets as reported on consolidated financial statements (known as the &#34;leverage ratio&#34;). &#160;

Capital Conservation Buffer. The Revised Capital Rules also introduce a new &#8220;capital conservation buffer,&#8221; composed entirely of CET1, on top of the minimum risk-weighted asset ratios, which is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking organizations with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of this difference.

&#160;

When fully phased in on January 1, 2019, the Revised Capital Rules will require us and Seacoast National to maintain (i) a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of 7% (4.5% attributable to CET1 plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer); (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.5% (6.0% attributable to Tier 1 capital plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer), (iii) a minimum ratio of Total capital (that is, Tier 1 plus Tier 2) to risk-weighted assets of at least 10.5% (8.0% attributable to Total capital plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer) and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 4%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average assets (as compared to a current minimum leverage ratio of 3% for banking organizations that either have the highest supervisory rating or have implemented the appropriate federal regulatory authority's risk-adjusted measure for market risk).

&#160;

Regulatory Deductions. The Revised Capital Rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1, including the requirement that mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1. Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 began on January 1, 2015 and will be phased-in over a three-year period (beginning at 40% on January 1, 2015 and an additional 20% per year thereafter until fully phased-in at January 1, 2018).

&#160;

Under the Revised Capital Rules, the effects of certain accumulated other comprehensive items (except gains and losses on cash flow hedges where the hedged item is not recognized on a banking organization&#8217;s balance sheet at fair value) are not excluded; however, certain banking organizations, including us and Seacoast National, may make a one-time permanent election to continue to exclude these items. The Revised Capital Rules also preclude counting certain hybrid securities, such as trust preferred securities, as Tier 1 capital of bank or thrift holding companies. However, for bank or thrift holding companies that had assets of less than $15 billion as of December 31, 2009 like us, trust preferred securities issued prior to May 19, 2010 can be treated as Tier 1 capital to the extent that they do not exceed 25% of Tier 1 capital after applying all capital deductions and adjustments.

&#160;

Management believes, at December 31, 2015, that we and Seacoast National meet all capital adequacy requirements under the Revised Capital Rules on a fully phased-in basis if such requirements were currently effective.

&#160;

Bank Holding Company Regulation 

&#160;

As a bank holding company, we are subject to supervision and regulation by the Federal Reserve under the BHC Act. Bank holding companies generally are limited to the business of banking, managing or controlling banks, and other activities that the Federal Reserve determines to be closely related to banking, or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. We are required to file with the Federal Reserve periodic reports and such other information as the Federal Reserve may request. Ongoing supervision is provided through regular examinations by the Federal Reserve and other means that allow the regulators to gauge management&#8217;s ability to identify, assess and control risk in all areas of operations in a safe and sound manner and to ensure compliance with laws and regulations. The Federal Reserve may also examine our non-bank subsidiaries.

&#160; 

14&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Expansion and Activity Limitations . Under the BHC Act, a bank holding company is generally permitted to engage in, or acquire direct or indirect control of more than 5 percent of the voting shares of, any company engaged in the following activities:

&#160;

&#183; banking or managing or controlling banks. &#160;

&#183; furnishing services to or performing services for our subsidiaries; and &#160; 

&#183; any activity that the Federal Reserve determines to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to the business of banking, including: 

&#160;

&#8226; factoring accounts receivable; &#160;

&#8226; making, acquiring, brokering or servicing loans and usual related activities; &#160;

&#8226; leasing personal or real property; &#160;

&#8226; operating a non-bank depository institution, such as a savings association; &#160;

&#8226; performing trust company functions; &#160;

&#8226; providing financial and investment advisory activities; &#160;

&#8226; conducting discount securities brokerage activities; &#160;

&#8226; underwriting and dealing in government obligations and money market instruments; &#160;

&#8226; providing specified management consulting and counseling activities; &#160;

&#8226; performing selected data processing services and support services; &#160;

&#8226; acting as agent or broker in selling credit life insurance and other types of insurance in connection with credit transactions; &#160;

&#8226; performing selected insurance underwriting activities; &#160;

&#8226; providing certain community development activities (such as making investments in projects designed primarily to promote community welfare); and, &#160;

&#8226; issuing and selling money orders and similar consumer-type payment instruments &#160;

With certain exceptions, the BHC Act prohibits a bank holding company from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of voting shares of any company which is not a bank or bank holding company, and from engaging directly or indirectly in any activity other than banking or managing or controlling banks or performing services for its authorized subsidiaries. A bank holding company, may, however, engage in or acquire an interest in a company that engages in activities which the Federal Reserve has determined by regulation or order to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto.

&#160;

15&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (the &#8220;GLB&#8221;) substantially revised the statutory restrictions separating banking activities from certain other financial activities. Under the GLB, bank holding companies that are &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; and &#8220;well-managed&#8221;, as defined in Federal Reserve Regulation Y, which have and maintain &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; ratings under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, as amended (the &#8220;CRA&#8221;), and meet certain other conditions, can elect to become &#8220;financial holding companies&#8221;. Financial holding companies and their subsidiaries are permitted to acquire or engage in activities such as insurance underwriting, securities underwriting, travel agency activities, a broad range of insurance agency activities, merchant banking, and other activities that the Federal Reserve determines to be financial in nature or complementary thereto. While we have not become a financial holding company, we may elect to do so in the future in order to exercise the broader activity powers provided by the GLB. Banks may also engage in similar &#8220;financial activities&#8221; through subsidiaries.

&#160;

The BHC Act permits acquisitions of banks by bank holding companies, such that we and any other bank holding company, whether located in Florida or elsewhere, may acquire a bank located in any other state, subject to certain deposit-percentage, age of bank charter requirements, and other restrictions. Federal law also permits national and state-chartered banks to branch interstate through acquisitions of banks in other states, subject to certain requirements.

&#160; 

Support of Subsidiary Banks by Holding Companies . Federal Reserve policy requires a bank holding company to act as a source of financial and managerial strength and to preserve and protect its bank subsidiaries in situations where additional investments in a troubled bank may not otherwise be warranted. Notably, the Dodd-Frank Act has codified the Federal Reserve&#8217;s &#8220;source of strength&#8221; doctrine. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act&#8217;s new provisions authorize the Federal Reserve to require a company that directly or indirectly controls a bank to submit reports that are designed both to assess the ability of such company to comply with its &#8220;source of strength&#8221; obligations and to enforce the company&#8217;s compliance with these obligations.

&#160; 

FDICIA and Prompt Corrective Action 

&#160;

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (&#8220;FDICIA&#8221;), among other things, requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to take &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; regarding depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. FDICIA establishes five regulatory capital tiers: &#8220;well capitalized&#8221;, &#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221;, &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221;, &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221;, and &#8220;critically undercapitalized&#8221;. A depository institution&#8217;s capital tier will depend upon how its capital levels compare to various relevant capital measures and certain other factors, as established by regulation. The FDICIA imposes progressively more restrictive restraints on operations, management and capital distributions, depending on the category in which an institution is classified.

&#160;

All of the federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted regulations establishing relevant capital measures and relevant capital levels for federally insured depository institutions. Notably, the Revised Capital Rule updated the prompt corrective action framework to correspond to the rule&#8217;s new minimum capital thresholds, which took effect on January 1, 2015. Under this new framework, (i) a well-capitalized insured depository institution is one having a total risk-based capital ratio of 10 percent or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8 percent or greater, a CET1 capital ratio of 6.5 percent or greater, a leverage capital ratio of 5 percent or greater and that is not subject to any order or written directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure; (ii) an adequately-capitalized depository institution is one having a total risk based capital ratio of 8 percent or more, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6 percent or more, a CET1 capital ratio of 4.5 percent or more, and a leverage ratio of 4 percent or more; (iii) an undercapitalized depository institution is one having a total capital ratio of less than 8 percent, a Tier 1 capital ratio of less than 6 percent, a CET1 capital ratio of less than 4.5 percent, or a leverage ratio of less than 4 percent; and (iv) a significantly undercapitalized institution is one having a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6 percent, a Tier 1 capital ratio of less than 4 percent, a CET1 ratio of less than 3 percent or a leverage capital ratio of less than 3 percent. The Revised Capital Rules retain the 2 percent threshold for critically undercapitalized institutions, but make certain changes to the framework for calculating an institution&#8217;s ratio of tangible equity to total assets.

&#160;

16&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, the consolidated capital ratios of Seacoast and Seacoast National were as follows:

&#160;

&#160; &#160; Seacoast &#160; &#160; Seacoast &#160; &#160; Minimum to be &#160; &#160; &#160; (Consolidated) &#160; &#160; National &#160; &#160; Well-Capitalized* &#160; Common equity Tier 1 ratio (CET1) &#160; &#160; 13.25 % &#160; &#160; 13.31 % &#160; &#160; 6.5 % Tier 1 capital ratio &#160; &#160; 15.21 % &#160; &#160; 13.31 % &#160; &#160; 8.0 % Total risk-based capital ratio &#160; &#160; 16.01 % &#160; &#160; 14.11 % &#160; &#160; 10.0 % Leverage ratio &#160; &#160; 10.70 % &#160; &#160; 9.36 % &#160; &#160; 5.0 % &#160;

* For subsidiary bank only 

&#160;

FDICIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized. Undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration plan for approval within 90 days of becoming undercapitalized. For a capital restoration plan to be acceptable, the depository institution&#8217;s parent holding company must guarantee that the institution will comply with such capital restoration plan. The aggregate liability of the parent holding company is limited to the lesser of 5% of the depository institution&#8217;s total assets at the time it became undercapitalized and the amount necessary to bring the institution into compliance with applicable capital standards. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized. If the controlling holding company fails to fulfill its obligations under FDICIA and files (or has filed against it) a petition under the federal Bankruptcy Code, the claim for such liability would be entitled to a priority in such bankruptcy proceeding over third party creditors of the bank holding company. In addition, an undercapitalized institution is subject to increased monitoring and asset growth restrictions and is required to obtain prior regulatory approval for acquisitions, new lines of business, and branching. Such an institution also is barred from soliciting, taking or rolling over brokered deposits.

&#160;

Significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets, and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. Critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator within 90 days of becoming significantly undercapitalized, except under limited circumstances. Because our company and Seacoast National exceed applicable capital requirements, the respective managements of our company and Seacoast National do not believe that the provisions of FDICIA have had any material effect on our company and Seacoast National or our respective operations.

&#160;

FDICIA also contains a variety of other provisions that may affect the operations of our company and Seacoast National, including reporting requirements, regulatory standards for real estate lending, &#8220;truth in savings&#8221; provisions, the requirement that a depository institution give 90 days&#8217; prior notice to customers and regulatory authorities before closing any branch, and a prohibition on the acceptance or renewal of brokered deposits by depository institutions that are not well capitalized, or are adequately capitalized and have not received a waiver from the FDIC. Seacoast National was well capitalized at December 31, 2015, and brokered deposits are not restricted.

&#160; 

17&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Payment of Dividends 

&#160;

We are a legal entity separate and distinct from Seacoast National and our other subsidiaries. Our primary source of cash, other than securities offerings, is dividends from Seacoast National. The prior approval of the OCC is required if the total of all dividends declared by a national bank (such as Seacoast National) in any calendar year will exceed the sum of such bank&#8217;s net profits for that year and its retained net profits for the preceding two calendar years, less any required transfers to surplus. Federal law also prohibits any national bank from paying dividends that would be greater than such bank&#8217;s undivided profits after deducting statutory bad debts in excess of such bank&#8217;s allowance for possible loan losses.

&#160;

In addition, we and Seacoast National are subject to various general regulatory policies and requirements relating to the payment of dividends, including requirements to maintain adequate capital above regulatory minimums. The appropriate federal bank regulatory authority may prohibit the payment of dividends where it has determined that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit payment thereof. The OCC and the Federal Reserve have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a national or state member bank&#8217;s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsound and unsafe banking practice. The OCC and the Federal Reserve have each indicated that depository institutions and their holding companies should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings.

&#160;

Under a Federal Reserve policy adopted in 2009, the board of directors of a bank holding company must consider different factors to ensure that its dividend level is prudent relative to maintaining a strong financial position, and is not based on overly optimistic earnings scenarios, such as potential events that could affect its ability to pay, while still maintaining a strong financial position. As a general matter, the Federal Reserve has indicated that the board of directors of a bank holding company should consult with the Federal Reserve and eliminate, defer or significantly reduce the bank holding company&#8217;s dividends if:

&#160;

&#183; its net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends; &#160;

&#183; its prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with its capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or &#160;

&#183; it will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios. Seacoast National recorded net income in 2013, 2014 and 2015, but no dividends were paid to us during any of these years. Prior approval by the OCC is required if the total of all dividends declared by a national bank in any calendar year exceeds the bank&#8217;s profits, for that year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two calendar years. Under this restriction, based on our recent profitability, Seacoast National is eligible to distribute dividends up to $81.4 million to us, without prior OCC approval, as of December 31, 2015. Seacoast National has not given any consideration to dividends to the extent permitted by regulation.

&#160;

No dividends on our common stock were declared or paid in 2013, 2014 or 2015.

&#160; 

18&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Enforcement Policies and Actions 

&#160;

The Federal Reserve and the OCC monitor compliance with laws and regulations. Violations of laws and regulations, or other unsafe and unsound practices, may result in these agencies imposing fines or penalties, cease and desist orders, or taking other enforcement actions. Under certain circumstances, these agencies may enforce these remedies directly against officers, directors, employees and other parties participating in the affairs of a bank or bank holding company.

&#160; 

Bank and Bank Subsidiary Regulation 

&#160;

Seacoast National is a national bank subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the OCC, which monitors all areas of operations, including reserves, loans, mortgages, the issuance of securities, payment of dividends, establishing branches, capital adequacy, and compliance with laws. Seacoast National is a member of the FDIC and, as such, its deposits are insured by the FDIC to the maximum extent provided by law. See &#8220;FDIC Insurance Assessments&#8221;.

&#160;

Under Florida law, Seacoast National may establish and operate branches throughout the State of Florida, subject to the maintenance of adequate capital and the receipt of OCC approval.

&#160;

The OCC has adopted the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council&#8217;s (&#8220;FFIEC&#8221;) rating system and assigns each financial institution a confidential composite rating based on an evaluation and rating of six essential components of an institution&#8217;s financial condition and operations, including Capital Adequacy, Asset Quality, Management, Earnings, Liquidity and Sensitivity to Market Risk, as well as the quality of risk management practices.

&#160;

FNB Insurance, a Seacoast National subsidiary, is authorized by the State of Florida to market insurance products as an agent. FNB Insurance is a separate and distinct entity from Seacoast National and is subject to supervision and regulation by state insurance authorities. It is a financial subsidiary, but is inactive.

&#160; 

Standards for Safety and Soundness 

&#160;

The Federal Deposit Insurance Act requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to prescribe, by regulation or guideline, operational and managerial standards for all insured depository institutions relating to: (1) internal controls; (2) information systems and audit systems; (3) loan documentation; (4) credit underwriting; (5) interest rate risk exposure; and (6) asset quality. 

&#160;

The agencies also must prescribe standards for asset quality, earnings, and stock valuation, as well as standards for compensation, fees and benefits. The federal banking agencies have adopted regulations and Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness to implement these required standards. These guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards used to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. Under the regulations, if a regulator determines that a bank fails to meet any standards prescribed by the guidelines, the regulator may require the bank to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance, consistent with deadlines for the submission and review of such safety and soundness compliance plans.

&#160; 

FDIC Insurance Assessments 

&#160;

Seacoast National&#8217;s deposits are insured by the FDIC&#8217;s DIF, and Seacoast National is subject to FDIC assessments for its deposit insurance, as well as assessments by the FDIC to pay interest on Financing Corporation (&#8220;FICO&#8221;) bonds.

&#160;

19&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Effective April 1, 2011, the FDIC began calculating assessments based on an institution&#8217;s average consolidated total assets less its average tangible equity in accordance with changes mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act. The FDIC also established a new assessment rate schedule, as well as alternative rate schedules that become effective when the DIF reserve ratio reaches certain levels. In determining the deposit insurance assessments to be paid by insured depository institutions, the FDIC generally assigns institutions to one of four risk categories based on supervisory ratings and capital ratios.

&#160;

The Dodd-Frank Act also increased the minimum designated reserve ratio of the DIF from 1.15% to 1.35% of the estimated amount of total insured deposits, and eliminated the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds. Under proposed rules set forth by the FDIC in October 2015, banks with at least $10 billion in assets would pay a surcharge to enable the reserve ratio to reach 1.35 percent.

&#160;

Upon inception of the new schedule in 2011, Seacoast National&#8217;s overall rate for assessment calculations was 14 basis points. As of September 19, 2013, with the release from its formal agreement with the OCC, Seacoast National&#8217;s rate was reduced to 8.15 basis points. As of September 30, 2014 and 2015, Seacoast National&#8217;s rate was further reduced to 6.79 basis points and 6.54 basis points, respectively. For Seacoast National, the new methodology has had a favorable effect. Seacoast National&#8217;s deposit insurance premiums totaled $2.6 million for 2013, $1.6 million for 2014, and $2.1 million for 2015. The increase in 2015 resulted from total assets increasing due to the full-year impact of the BankFIRST acquisition and Grand acquisition in the third quarter of 2015.

&#160;

In addition, the FDIC collects FICO deposit assessments, which are calculated off of the assessment base described above. FICO assessments are set quarterly, and our FICO assessment averages 0.59 basis points for all four quarters during 2015. Our FICO assessment rate for the first quarter of 2016 is 0.58 basis points.

&#160; 

Change in Control 

&#160; 

Subject to certain exceptions, the BHC Act and the Change in Bank Control Act, together with regulations promulgated thereunder, require Federal Reserve approval prior to any person or company acquiring &#8220;control&#8221; of a bank or bank holding company. Control is conclusively presumed to exist if an individual or company acquires 25 percent or more of any class of voting securities, and rebuttably presumed to exist if a person acquires 10 percent or more, but less than 25 percent, of any class of voting securities and either the company has registered securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act or no other person owns a greater percentage of that class of voting securities immediately after the transaction. In certain cases, a company may also be presumed to have control under the BHC Act if it acquires 5 percent or more of any class of voting securities.

&#160; 

Other Regulations 

&#160; 

Anti-Money Laundering . The International Money Laundering Abatement and Anti-Terrorism Funding Act of 2001 specifies &#8220;know your customer&#8221; requirements that obligate financial institutions to take actions to verify the identity of the account holders in connection with opening an account at any U.S. financial institution. Banking regulators will consider compliance with the Act&#8217;s money laundering provisions in acting upon acquisition and merger proposals. Sanctions for violations of the Act can be imposed in an amount equal to twice the sum involved in the violating transaction, up to $1 million.

&#160;

20&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Under the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (&#8220;USA PATRIOT&#8221;) Act of 2001, financial institutions are subject to prohibitions against specified financial transactions and account relationships as well as enhanced due diligence and &#8220;know your customer&#8221; standards in their dealings with foreign financial institutions and foreign customers.

&#160;

The USA PATRIOT Act requires financial institutions to establish anti-money laundering programs with minimum standards that include:

&#160;

&#183; the development of internal policies, procedures, and controls; &#183; the designation of a compliance officer; &#183; an ongoing employee training program; and &#183; an independent audit function to test the programs. &#160; 

Bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these anti-money laundering obligations and recently have been active in imposing &#8220;cease and desist&#8221; and other regulatory orders and money penalty sanctions against institutions found to be in violation of these requirements. In addition, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network has proposed new regulations that would require financial institutions to obtain beneficial ownership information for certain accounts, however, it has yet to establish final regulations on this topic.

&#160; 

Economic Sanctions . The Office of Foreign Assets Control (&#8220;OFAC&#8221;) is responsible for helping to ensure that U.S. entities do not engage in transactions with certain prohibited parties, as defined by various Executive Orders and acts of Congress. OFAC publishes, and routinely updates, lists of names of persons and organizations suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts, including the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List. If we find a name on any transaction, account or wire transfer that is on an OFAC list, we must undertake certain specified activities, which could include blocking or freezing the account or transaction requested, and we must notify the appropriate authorities.

&#160; 

Transactions with Related Parties . We are a legal entity separate and distinct from Seacoast National and our other subsidiaries. Various legal limitations restrict our banking subsidiaries from lending or otherwise supplying funds to us or our non-bank subsidiaries. We and our banking subsidiaries are subject to Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act and the corresponding provisions of Federal Reserve Regulation W thereunder. Section 23A defines &#8220;covered transactions&#8221; to include, among other types of transactions, extensions of credit, and limits a bank&#8217;s covered transactions with any of its &#8220;affiliates&#8221; to 10% of such bank&#8217;s capital and surplus. All covered and exempt transactions between a bank and its affiliates must be on terms and conditions consistent with safe and sound banking practices, and banks and their operating subsidiaries are prohibited from purchasing low-quality assets from the bank&#8217;s affiliates. Finally, Section 23A requires that all of a bank&#8217;s extensions of credit to its affiliates be appropriately secured by acceptable collateral, generally United States government or agency securities.

&#160;

We and our bank subsidiaries also are subject to Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and the corresponding provisions of Federal Reserve Regulation W thereunder, which generally require covered transactions and certain other transactions between a bank and its affiliates to be on terms, including credit standards, that are substantially the same or at least as favorable to, the bank as those prevailing at the time for similar transactions with unaffiliated companies.

&#160;

21&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The Dodd-Frank Act generally enhances the restrictions on banks&#8217; transactions with affiliates under Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, including an expansion of the definition of &#8220;covered transactions&#8221; and an increase in the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered credit transactions must be satisfied. Specifically, Section 608 of the Dodd-Frank Act broadens the definition of &#8220;covered transactions&#8221; to include derivative transactions and the borrowing or lending of securities if the transaction will cause a bank to have credit exposure to an affiliate. The revised definition also includes the acceptance of debt obligations of an affiliate as collateral for a loan or extension of credit to a third party. Furthermore, reverse repurchase transactions will be viewed as extensions of credit (instead of asset purchases) and thus become subject to collateral requirements. These expanded definitions took effect on July 21, 2012. The ability of the Federal Reserve to grant exemptions from these restrictions is also narrowed by the Dodd-Frank Act, including with respect to the requirement for the OCC, FDIC and Federal Reserve to coordinate with one another.

&#160;

Concentrations in Lending . During 2006, the federal bank regulatory agencies released guidance on &#8220;Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending&#8221; (the &#8220;Guidance&#8221;) and advised financial institutions of the risks posed by commercial real estate (&#8220;CRE&#8221;) lending concentrations.

&#160;

The Guidance requires that appropriate processes be in place to identify, monitor and control risks associated with real estate lending concentrations. Higher allowances for loan losses and capital levels may also be required. The Guidance is triggered when CRE loan concentrations exceed either:

&#160;

&#183; Total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land of 100 percent or more of a bank&#8217;s total risk based capital; or &#183; Total reported loans secured by multifamily and nonfarm nonresidential properties and loans for construction, land development, and other land of 300 percent or more of a bank&#8217;s total risk based capital. &#160;

The Guidance also applies when a bank has a sharp increase in CRE loans or has significant concentrations of CRE secured by a particular property type.

&#160;

We have always had significant exposures to loans secured by commercial real estate due to the nature of our markets and the loan needs of both retail and commercial customers. We believe our long term experience in CRE lending, underwriting policies, internal controls, and other policies currently in place, as well as our loan and credit monitoring and administration procedures, are generally appropriate to managing our concentrations as required under the Guidance. At December 31, 2015, we had outstanding $63.6 million in commercial construction and residential land development loans and $45.1 million in residential construction loans to individuals, which represents approximately 31 percent of Seacoast National&#8217;s total risk based capital at December 31, 2015, well below the Guidance&#8217;s threshold. At December 31, 2015, the total CRE exposure for Seacoast National represents approximately 196 percent of total risk based capital, below the Guidance&#8217;s threshold.

&#160; 

Community Reinvestment Act. We and our banking subsidiaries are subject to the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act (&#8220;CRA&#8221;) and related federal bank regulatory agencies&#8217; regulations. Under the CRA, all banks and thrifts have a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with their safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs for their entire communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. The CRA requires a depository institution&#8217;s primary federal regulator, in connection with its examination of the institution, to assess the institution&#8217;s record of assessing and meeting the credit needs of the communities served by that institution, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. The bank regulatory agency&#8217;s assessment of the institution&#8217;s record is made available to the public. Further, such assessment is required of any institution which has applied to: (i) charter a national bank; (ii) obtain deposit insurance coverage for a newly-chartered institution; (iii) establish a new branch office that accepts deposits; (iv) relocate an office; (v) merge or consolidate with, or acquire the assets or assume the liabilities of, a federally regulated financial institution, or (vi) expand other activities, including engaging in financial services activities authorized by the GLB. A less than satisfactory CRA rating will slow, if not preclude, expansion of banking activities and prevent a company from becoming or remaining a financial holding company.

&#160;

22&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Following the enactment of the GLB, CRA agreements with private parties must be disclosed and annual CRA reports must be made to a bank&#8217;s primary federal regulator. A bank holding company will not be permitted to become or remain a financial holding company and no new activities authorized under GLB may be commenced by a holding company or by a bank financial subsidiary if any of its bank subsidiaries received less than a &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; CRA rating in its latest CRA examination. Federal CRA regulations require, among other things, that evidence of discrimination against applicants on a prohibited basis, and illegal or abusive lending practices be considered in the CRA evaluation.

&#160; 

Privacy and Data Security. The GLB generally prohibits disclosure of consumer information to non-affiliated third parties unless the consumer has been given the opportunity to object and has not objected to such disclosure. Financial institutions are further required to disclose their privacy policies to consumers annually. Financial institutions, however, will be required to comply with state law if it is more protective of consumer privacy than the GLB. The GLB also directed federal regulators, including the FDIC and the OCC, to prescribe standards for the security of consumer information. Seacoast National is subject to such standards, as well as standards for notifying customers in the event of a security breach. Under federal law, Seacoast National must disclose its privacy policy to consumers, permit customers to opt out of having nonpublic customer information disclosed to third parties in certain circumstances, and allow customers to opt out of receiving marketing solicitations based on information about the customer received from another subsidiary. States may adopt more extensive privacy protections. We are similarly required to have an information security program to safeguard the confidentiality and security of customer information and to ensure proper disposal. Customers must be notified when unauthorized disclosure involves sensitive customer information that may be misused.

&#160; 

Consumer Regulation. Activities of Seacoast National are subject to a variety of statutes and regulations designed to protect consumers. These laws and regulations include, among numerous other things, provisions that:

&#160;

&#183; limit the interest and other charges collected or contracted for by Seacoast National, including new rules respecting the terms of credit cards and of debit card overdrafts; &#160;

The CFPB adopted a rule that implements the ability-to-repay and qualified mortgage provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act (the &#8220;ATR/QM rule&#8221;), which took effect on January 10, 2014, and has impacted our residential mortgage lending practices, and the residential mortgage market generally. The ATR/QM rule requires lenders to consider, among other things, income, employment status, assets, payment amounts, and credit history before approving a mortgage, and provides a compliance &#8220;safe harbor&#8221; for lenders that issue certain &#8220;qualified mortgages.&#8221; The ATR/QM rule defines a &#8220;qualified mortgage&#8221; to have certain specified characteristics, and generally prohibit loans with negative amortization, interest-only payments, balloon payments, or terms exceeding 30 years from being qualified mortgages. The rule also establishes general underwriting criteria for qualified mortgages, including that monthly payments be calculated based on the highest payment that will apply in the first five years of the loan and that the borrower have a total debt-to-income ratio that is less than or equal to 43 percent. While &#8220;qualified mortgages&#8221; will generally be afforded safe harbor status, a rebuttable presumption of compliance with the ability-to-repay requirements will attach to &#8220;qualified mortgages&#8221; that are &#8220;higher priced mortgages&#8221; (which are generally subprime loans). In addition, under rules that became effective December 24, 2015, the securitizer of asset-backed securities must retain not less than 5 percent of the credit risk of the assets collateralizing the asset-backed securities, unless subject to an exemption for asset-backed securities that are collateralized exclusively by residential mortgages that qualify as &#8220;qualified residential mortgages.&#8221; These definitions are expected to significantly shape the parameters for the majority of consumer mortgage lending in the U.S.

&#160;

Reflecting the CFPB's focus on the residential mortgage lending market, the CFPB has also issued rules to implement requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act pertaining to mortgage loan origination (including with respect to loan originator compensation and loan originator qualifications) and has finalized integrated mortgage disclosure rules that replace and combine certain requirements under the Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act. In addition, the CFPB has issued rules that require servicers to comply with new standards and practices with regard to: error correction; information disclosure; force-placement of insurance; information management policies and procedures; requiring information about mortgage loss mitigation options be provided to delinquent borrowers; providing delinquent borrowers access to servicer personnel with continuity of contact about the borrower&#8217;s mortgage loan account; and evaluating borrowers&#8217; applications for available loss mitigation options. These rules also address initial rate adjustment notices for adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), periodic statements for residential mortgage loans, and prompt crediting of mortgage payments and response to requests for payoff amounts. The CFPB has indicated that it expects to issue additional mortgage-related rules in the future.

&#160;

It is anticipated that the CFPB will engage in numerous other rulemakings in the near term that may impact our business, as the CFPB has indicated that, in addition to specific statutory mandates, it is working on a wide range of initiatives to address issues in markets for consumer financial products and services. The CFPB has also undertaken an effort to &#8220;streamline&#8221; consumer regulations and has established a database to collect, track and make public consumer complaints, including complaints against individual financial institutions.

&#160;

The CFPB also has broad authority to prohibit unfair, deceptive and abusive acts and practices (&#8220;UDAAP&#8221;) and to investigate and penalize financial institutions that violate this prohibition. While the statutory language of the Dodd-Frank Act sets forth the standards for acts and practices that violate this prohibition, certain aspects of these standards are untested, which has created some uncertainty regarding how the CFPB will exercise this authority. The CFPB has, however, begun to bring enforcement actions against certain financial institutions for UDAAP violations and issued some guidance on the topic, which provides insight into the agency&#8217;s expectations regarding these standards. Among other things, CFPB guidance and its UDAAP-related enforcement actions have emphasized that management of third-party service providers is essential to effective UDAAP compliance and that the CFPB is particularly focused on marketing and sales practices.

We cannot fully predict the effect that being regulated by a new, additional regulatory authority focused on consumer financial protection, or any new implementing regulations or revisions to existing regulations that may result from the establishment of this new authority, will have on our businesses.

&#160;

The deposit operations of Seacoast National are also subject to laws and regulations that:

&#160;

&#183; require Seacoast National to adequately disclose the interest rates and other terms of consumer deposit accounts; &#160;

&#183; impose a duty on Seacoast National to maintain the confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribe procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records; &#160;

&#183; require escheatment of unclaimed funds to the appropriate state agencies after the passage of certain statutory time frames; and, &#160;

&#183; govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts with Seacoast National and the rights and liabilities of customers who use automated teller machines, or ATMs, and other electronic banking services. As described above, beginning in July 2010, new rules took effect that limited Seacoast National&#8217;s ability to charge fees for the payment of overdrafts for every day debit and ATM card transactions. &#160;

As noted above, Seacoast National will likely face a significant increase in its consumer compliance regulatory burden as a result of the combination of the CFPB and the significant roll back of federal preemption of state laws in the area.

&#160;

Non-Discrimination Policies. Seacoast National is also subject to, among other things, the provisions of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (the &#8220;ECOA&#8221;) and the Fair Housing Act (the &#8220;FHA&#8221;), both of which prohibit discrimination based on race or color, religion, national origin, sex, and familial status in any aspect of a consumer or commercial credit or residential real estate transaction. The Department of Justice (the &#8220;DOJ&#8221;), and the federal bank regulatory agencies have issued an Interagency Policy Statement on Discrimination in Lending that provides guidance to financial institutions in determining whether discrimination exists, how the agencies will respond to lending discrimination, and what steps lenders might take to prevent discriminatory lending practices. The DOJ has increased its efforts to prosecute what it regards as violations of the ECOA and FHA.

&#160; 

Enforcement Authority . Seacoast National and its &#8220;institution-affiliated parties,&#8221; including management, employees, agents, independent contractors and consultants, such as attorneys and accountants and others who participate in the conduct of the institution&#8217;s affairs, are subject to potential civil and criminal penalties for violations of law, regulations or written orders of a government agency. Violations can include failure to timely file required reports, filing false or misleading information or submitting inaccurate reports. Civil penalties may be as high as $1,000,000 a day for such violations, and criminal penalties for some financial institution crimes may include imprisonment for 20 years. Regulators have flexibility to commence enforcement actions against institutions and institution-affiliated parties, and the FDIC has the authority to terminate deposit insurance. When issued by a banking agency, cease-and-desist orders may, among other things, require affirmative action to correct any harm resulting from a violation or practice, including restitution, reimbursement, indemnifications or guarantees against loss. A financial institution may also be ordered to restrict its growth, dispose of certain assets, rescind agreements or contracts, or take other actions determined to be appropriate by the ordering agency. The federal banking agencies also may remove a director or officer from an insured depository institution (or bar them from the industry) if a violation is willful or reckless.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Other Regulatory Matters . We and our subsidiaries are subject to oversight by the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. (&#8220;FINRA&#8221;), the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (&#8220;PCAOB&#8221;), Nasdaq and various state securities regulators. We and our subsidiaries have from time to time received requests for information from regulatory authorities in various states, including state attorneys general, securities regulators and other regulatory authorities, concerning our business practices. Such requests are considered incidental to the normal conduct of business.
