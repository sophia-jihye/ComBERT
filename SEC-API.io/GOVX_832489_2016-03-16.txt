Overview 

&#160; 

GeoVax Labs, Inc. (&#8220;GeoVax&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing human vaccines against infectious diseases using our MVA-VLP vaccine platform. Our platform supports in vivo expression of non-infectious virus-like particles (VLPs) from the cells of the person receiving the vaccine. VLPs work by displaying the virus&#8217; surface glycoproteins which in turn train the person&#8217;s immune system to recognize and destroy the actual virus and virus-infected cells to block infection. The production of VLPs in the person being vaccinated mimics a natural infection, stimulating both the humoral and cellular arms of the immune system to recognize, prevent and control the target infection should it appear. 

&#160; 

Our current development programs are focused on vaccines against Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Zika virus, and hemorrhagic fever viruses (Ebola, Marburg, Lassa Fever), as well as for use in cancer immunotherapy. We believe our technology and vaccine development expertise are well-suited for a variety of human infectious diseases and we intend to pursue expansion of our product pipeline. 

&#160; 

Our most advanced HIV vaccine program is focused on the clade B subtype of HIV prevalent in the Americas and Western Europe. Our preventive clade B HIV vaccine has successfully completed Phase 2a human clinical testing and we expect to enter a follow-on clinical trial in mid-2016 with support from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). We are considered the leading vaccine candidate for protection against the clade B subtype; accordingly, planning has begun for a phase 2b efficacy trial. Our vaccine has shown outstanding safety and excellent and highly reproducible immunogenicity ( Journal of Infectious Diseases volume 203, pg 610 and volume 210 pg 99 ). We have also extended our HIV vaccine effort to the most common virus subtype affecting sub-Saharan Africa (clade C) and are conducting preclinical studies pursuant to a grant from the NIH. Our HIV vaccine technology was developed in collaboration with researchers at Emory University, the NIH, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The technology developed by the collaboration is exclusively licensed to us from Emory University. We also have nonexclusive licenses to certain patents owned by the NIH. 

&#160; 

Our hemorrhagic fever vaccine program was initiated during 2014 with the objective of developing a tetravalent vaccine designed to protect against all major hemorrhagic fever viruses (Ebola, Marburg, Lassa) endemic in African countries. Studies of our first Ebola vaccine candidate have demonstrated 100 percent protection in rodent models. We plan to conduct additional challenge studies in non-human primates in collaboration with the NIH during 2016, with the goal of beginning human clinical trials during 2017. In February 2016 we entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement for material transfer with the United States Army Research Institute of Infectious Disease (USAMRIID). This agreement provides us with access to Ebola, Marburg and Lassa fever monoclonal antibodies for in vitro vaccine characterization, with USAMRIID performing in vitro and in vivo assessment of our vaccine candidates. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

In December 2015, we entered into a Collaborative Research Agreement with the University of Pittsburgh to evaluate our MVA-VLP vaccine platform for use in cancer immunotherapy, including the selection and testing of vaccine candidates. We are currently constructing our vaccine candidates and intend to conduct proof-of-concept animal studies during 2016. Cancer immunotherapy (or immuno-oncology), is a technique whereby the patient&#8217;s immune system is trained to fight solid tumors and is considered to be a very promising area of biotechnology. 

&#160; 

In February 2016, we began a program to develop a vaccine for the prevention of Zika virus infections using our MVA-VLP vaccine platform, and we entered into a Collaborative Research Agreement with the University of Georgia (UGA) to speed development of the vaccine. Pursuant to this collaboration, we will develop vaccine antigens that elicit broadly reactive immunity against Zika viruses and UGA will test those vaccines in preclinical models. We are also collaborating with the CDC for reagents and testing of vaccines. We intend to conduct the initial proof-of-concept animal studies during the first half of 2016. 

&#160; 

Our HIV vaccine development activities have been, and continue to be, financially supported by the U.S. government. This support has been both in the form of research grants awarded directly to us, as well as indirect support for the conduct of our human clinical trials. Government support is also being sought for our newer vaccine targets. This is discussed further under &#8220;Support from the United States Government&#8221; below. 

&#160; 

We are incorporated in Delaware, and our offices and laboratory facilities are located in S myrna, Georgia (metropolitan Atlanta). 

&#160; 

Our Technology 

&#160; 

Vaccines typically contain agents (antigens) that resemble disease-causing microorganisms. Traditional vaccines are often made from weakened or killed forms of the virus or from its surface proteins. Many newer vaccines use recombinant DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) technology to generate vaccine antigens in bacteria or cultured cells from specific portions of the DNA sequence of the target pathogen. The generated antigens are then purified and formulated for use in a vaccine. The most successful of these purified antigens have been non-infectious virus-like particles (VLPs) as exemplified by vaccines for hepatitis B (Merck&#8217;s Recombivax&#174; and GSK&#8217;s Engerix&#174;) and Papilloma viruses (GSK&#8217;s Cervarix&#174;, and Merck&#8217;s Gardasil&#174;). Our approach uses recombinant DNA or recombinant viruses to produce VLPs in the person being vaccinated. In human clinical trials of our HIV vaccines, we have demonstrated that our VLPs, expressed in the cells of the person being vaccinated, are safe, yet elicit both strong and durable humoral and cellular immune response. 

&#160; 

All of our vaccines are designed to produce self-assembling non-infectious VLPs in the cells of the person being vaccinated. VLPs train the body&#8217;s immune system to recognize and kill the authentic virus should a target infection appear. VLPs also train the immune system to recognize and kill infected cells to control infection and reduce the length and severity of disease. One of the biggest challenges with VLP-based vaccines is to design the vaccines in such a way that the VLPs will be recognized by the immune system in the same way as the authentic virus would be. When VLPs for enveloped viruses like HIV, Ebola, and Marburg are produced in vivo , they include not only the protein antigens, but also an envelope consisting of membranes from the vaccinated individual&#8217;s cells. In this way, they are highly similar to the virus generated in a person&#8217;s body during a natural infection. VLPs produced externally, by contrast, may have no envelope; or, envelopes from the cultured cells (typically hamster or insect cells) used to produce them. We believe our technology provides distinct advantages by producing VLPs that more closely resemble the authentic virus, which in turn, allows the body&#8217;s immune system to more readily recognize the authentic virus. By producing VLPs in the individual being vaccinated, we avoid the cost and technical issues associated with in vitro production of VLPs in cell culture. 

&#160; 

DNA and MVA as Vaccine Vectors. Our HIV vaccines incorporate two delivery components (or vectors): a priming recombinant plasmid DNA vaccine, and a boosting recombinant MVA (modified vaccinia Ankara) vaccine. Our hemorrhagic fever and Zika vaccines use only the MVA vector. Both our DNA and MVA vaccines express sufficient vaccine antigens to support the production of non-infectious VLPs. The VLPs cannot cause disease because they contain mutated or deleted enzymatic functions that are essential for virus replication. VLPs display trimeric membrane bound forms of the viral envelope glycoprotein (Env for HIV, or GP for Ebola/Marburg/Lassa and Zika). This is important because the natural form of the envelope glycoprotein elicits target antibodies with multiple specificities capable of recognizing incoming virus and blocking infections. Expression of multiple proteins by the vaccines is essential for the formation of VLPs. The multiple proteins also provide more targets for immune responses such as cytotoxic T-cells. Elicitation of multi-target humoral and cellular responses limits immune escape, just as multi-drug therapies limit drug escape.

&#160; Ebola VLPs 

&#160; HIV VLPs 

Figure 1. Electron micrographs showing the virus-like particles (VLPs) elicited by GeoVax vaccines from human cells. Note that the Ebola VLPs on the left self-assemble into the rod-like shape of the actual Ebola virus, while the HIV VLPs shown on the right take on the spherical shape of the actual HIV virus. While below the resolution of these micrographs, both types of VLPs display what we believe to be the native form of their respective viral envelope glycoproteins which we believe is key to generating an effective immune humoral response. 

&#160; 

We selected MVA for use as the live viral component of our vaccines because of its well-established safety record and because of the ability of this vector to carry sufficient viral proteins to produce virus-like particles. MVA was originally developed as a safer smallpox vaccine for use in immune compromised humans. It was developed by attenuating the standard smallpox vaccine by making over 500 passages of the virus in chicken embryos or chicken embryo fibroblasts, which resulted in a virus with limited ability to replicate in human cells, but did not compromise the ability of MVA to grow on avian cells, which are used for manufacturing the virus. The deletions also resulted in the loss of immune evasion genes which assist the spread of wild type smallpox infections, even in the presence of human immune responses. MVA was safely administered to over 120,000 people in the 1970s as a smallpox vaccine. 

&#160; 

Induction of T-cell and Antibody Immune Responses. In both preclinical and clinical trials, our HIV vaccines have been shown to induce both humoral (antibody) and cellular (T-cell) responses against HIV. The induction of both antibodies and T-cells is beneficial because these immune responses work through different mechanisms. Antibodies prevent infection by blocking viruses from infecting cells. In preclinical simian vaccine studies using repeated rectal challenges with moderate doses of virus, the avidity, or tightness, of antibody binding to the surface envelope glycoprotein of HIV correlates with the prevention of infection ( The Journal of Infectious Diseases, 204:164 (2011)). In high dose challenges that infect all animals at the first exposure, the avidity of the antibody for envelope glycoprotein correlates with reduced levels of virus replication ( Journal of Virology , 83:4102 (2009)). Similarly, antibody responses are believed to be critical for vaccine-elicited protection against Ebola and Marburg infection ( Expert Review of Vaccines , 10:63 (2011)). These results likely reflect the tightly binding antibody both blocking infection as well as tagging virus and infected cells for destruction, by white blood cells such as macrophages, neutrophils and natural killer cells. Our vaccines elicit CD8+ T-cells, a type of T-cell that can recognize and kill cells that become infected by virus (without antibody tagging). For HIV, CD8+ T-cells are important for the control of the virus that has established an infection. For Ebola and Marburg, antibodies can stop or slow the progress of infection, but T cells are important for clearing the infection by killing remaining infected cells. 

&#160; 

Background &#8211; What are Vaccines? 

&#160; 

A vaccine is a substance introduced into the human body that teaches the immune system to detect and destroy a pathogen (a virus or other pathogen that causes disease). All vaccines contain some harmless form or part of the pathogen they target or of a highly similar pathogen. They exert their effects through the adaptive immune response, an arm of the immune system that learns to recognize and control specific pathogens. 

&#160; 

There are several types of vaccines: 

&#9679; 

Whole-killed/Whole-inactivated vaccines : The active ingredient in these vaccines is an intact virus or bacterium that has been killed or otherwise stripped of its ability to infect humans. Examples include the cholera, influenza, hepatitis A, rabies, injectable polio, tick-borne encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis (both from Flaviviridae family that include Zika virus) vaccines. This approach has not been applied to the development of vaccines against HIV due to lack of success in animal experiments and the difficulty of developing an inactivation method capable of ensuring that the product will be entirely free of active virus. Similarly, inactivated Ebola vaccines have not shown great promise in animal models, and any production process starting with live Ebola, Marburg or Lassa fever virus would require such extreme containment measures that it would be difficult to operate at industrial scale. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Live attenuated vaccines : These vaccines use a form of the targeted pathogen that is highly unlikely to be harmful&#8212;one capable, say, of multiplying, but not causing disease. Examples include the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR), yellow fever (a flavivirus), Varicella, influenza, smallpox and the oral vaccine against polio, which has been widely deployed in global eradication efforts. Such vaccines can be very effective because they closely mimic the behavior of the targeted pathogen, giving the immune system a true picture of what it would be up against. Due to the risk that attenuated HIV, Ebola, or Marburg might revert to its disease-causing form, this approach has not been applied to the development of HIV, Ebola, or Marburg vaccines. 

&#9679; 

Subunit vaccines: Vaccines of this variety are composed of purified pieces of the pathogen (known as antigens) that generate a vigorous, protective immune response. Common subunit vaccines include the seasonal flu and hepatitis B vaccines. This approach was employed to devise the first AIDS vaccine candidate tested in humans, which failed to induce protection from HIV infection. To date, subunit vaccines have failed to protect nonhuman primates against Ebola infection ( Human Vaccines, 6:439 (2010)). 

&#9679; 

Purified VLP vaccines : Purified VLP vaccines consist only of virus-like particles, which are composed of certain viral proteins but do not contain the genetic material of the virus. Unlike subunit vaccines, VLPs typically provide viral antigens in their native form. Due to their structural similarity to actual viruses, VLPs are excellent immunogens capable of raising potent antibody and cellular immune responses. Purified VLPs need to be manufactured and purified in large quantities. They also are difficult to make for relatively fragile viruses with lipid membrane envelopes such as HIV, Ebola, Marburg or Zika vaccines. Examples of successful vaccines using purified VLPs include vaccines for hepatitis B (Merck&#8217;s Recombivax &#174; and GSK&#8217;s Engerix &#174; ) and Papilloma viruses (GSK&#8217;s Cervarix &#174; , and Merck&#8217;s Gardasil &#174; ). 

&#9679; 

Expressed VLP vaccines : These vaccines are designed to produce self-assembling non-infectious VLPs in the cells of the person being vaccinated. When VLPs for enveloped viruses like HIV, Ebola, and Marburg are produced in vivo , they include not only the protein antigens, but also an envelope consisting of membranes from the vaccinated individual&#8217;s cells displaying proteins that mediate entry into cells. In this way, they are highly similar to the virus generated in a person&#8217;s body during a natural infection. Purified VLPs produced externally, by contrast, have no envelope; or, envelopes from the cultured cells (typically hamster or insect cells) used to produce them. By producing VLPs in vivo , potential purification issues associated with in vitro production of VLPs are avoided. GeoVax employs this approach in our vaccine design. 

&#9679; 

DNA vaccines : These vaccine candidates are also designed to train the immune system to recognize a piece of the targeted bacterium or virus. The difference is that the active ingredients are not the purified antigens themselves but circles of DNA, called plasmids, which carry genes encoding those antigens. Human cells passively take up these plasmids and produce the antigens which, in turn, train the immune system to recognize the targeted pathogen. There currently is no FDA-approved DNA vaccine for humans. 

&#9679; 

Recombinant viral vaccines : These vaccines, like DNA vaccines, introduce genes for targeted antigens into the body. But the genes are inserted into a virus that actively carries the vaccine insert into human cells. The viruses chosen as vectors are safe to use because they do not ordinarily cause disease in humans and/or have been stripped of their ability to proliferate. Examples include two flavivirus vaccines, Japanese encephalitis (IMOJEV &#174; ) and dengue (DENGVAXIA &#174; ) vaccines constructed using the yellow fever 17D vaccine as a vector. 

&#160; 

Our HIV/AIDS Vaccine Program 

&#160; 

About HIV/AIDS. HIV is a retrovirus that carries its genetic code in the form of RNA. Retroviruses use RNA and the reverse transcriptase enzyme to create DNA from the RNA template. The HIV-1 virus enters human cells and copies its viral RNA to produce complementary DNA (cDNA) that is subsequently inserted into the chromosomes, which are the genetic material of a cell. HIV preferentially infects and replicates in T-cells, which are a type of white blood cell. Infection of T-cells alters them from immunity mediating cells to cells that produce and release HIV. This process results in the destruction of the immune defenses of infected individuals and ultimately, the development of AIDS. 

&#160; 

There are several AIDS-causing HIV virus subtypes, or clades, that are found in different regions of the world. These clades are identified as clade A, clade B and so on. The predominant clade found in Europe, North America, parts of South America, Japan and Australia is clade B, whereas the predominant clades in Africa are clades A and C. In India, the predominant clade is clade C. Each clade differs by at least 20% with respect to its genetic sequence from other clades. These differences may mean that vaccines or treatments developed against HIV of one clade may only be partially effective or ineffective against HIV of other clades. Thus, there is often a geographical focus to designing and developing HIV vaccines. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

HIV, even within clades, has a high rate of mutation that supports a significant level of genetic variation. In drug treatment programs, virus mutation can result in the development of drug resistance, referred to as virus drug escape, thereby rendering drug therapy ineffective. Hence, we believe that multi-drug therapy is very important. If several drugs are active against virus replication, the virus must undergo multiple simultaneous mutations to escape, which is less likely. The same is true for immune responses. HIV can escape single targeted immune responses. However, our scientists believe if an immune response is directed against multiple targets, which are referred to as epitopes, virus escape is much less frequent. Vaccination against more than one of the proteins found in HIV increases the number of targets for the immune response as well as the chance that HIV will not escape the vaccine-stimulated immune response, thus resulting in protection against infection or the development of clinical AIDS if infection occurs. 

&#160; 

HIV infects and gradually destroys T-cells and macrophages, which are white blood cells that play key roles in protecting humans against infectious disease caused by viruses, bacteria, fungi and other micro-organisms. Opportunistic infections by organisms, normally posing no problem for control by a healthy immune system, can ravage persons with immune systems damaged by HIV infections. Destruction of the immune system occurs over years. The average onset of the clinical disease recognized as AIDS occurs after three to ten years of HIV infection if the virus is not treated effectively with drugs, but the time to developing AIDS is highly variable. 

&#160; 

HIV/AIDS is considered by many in the scientific and medical community to be the most lethal infectious disease in the world. An estimated 37 million people are living with HIV worldwide, with approximately 2.5 million newly infected in 2012 alone. Approximately 39 million people infected with HIV have died since the 1981 start of the HIV pandemic. The United States currently has an estimated 1.2 million HIV-infected individuals, with approximately 50,000 new infections per year, a number that has remained virtually the same for 20 years. Alarmingly the fastest growing demographic for acquiring an HIV infection is the 13 &#8211; 24 year old group which is expanding at roughly 10% per year and will soon become the group with the highest total number of infections. 

&#160; 

At present, the standard approach to treating HIV infection is to inhibit viral replication through the use of combinations of drugs. Available drugs include reverse transcriptase inhibitors, protease inhibitors, integration inhibitors and inhibitors of cell entry. However, HIV is prone to genetic changes that can produce strains that are resistant to currently approved drugs. When HIV acquires resistance to one drug within a class, it can often become resistant to the entire class, meaning that it may be impossible to re-establish control of a genetically altered strain by substituting different drugs in the same class. Furthermore, these treatments continue to have significant limitations which include toxicity, patient non-adherence to the treatment regimens and cost. As a result, over time, viruses acquire drug-resistant mutations, and many patients develop intolerance to the medications or simply give up taking the medications due to cost, inconvenience or side effects. 

&#160; 

According to the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI), the cost and complexity of new treatment advances for AIDS puts them out of reach for most people in the countries where treatment is most needed. As noted above, in industrialized nations, where drugs are more readily available, side effects and increased rates of viral resistance have raised concerns about their long term use. Vaccines are seen by many as the most promising way to end the HIV/AIDS pandemic. It is expected that vaccines for HIV/AIDS, once developed, will be used universally and administered worldwide by organizations that provide health care services, including hospitals, medical clinics, the military, prisons and schools. 

&#160; 

Our Preventive HIV Vaccine Program 

&#160; 

Prevention of HIV infection remains a worldwide unmet medical need, even in the United States and other first world countries where effective antiretroviral therapies are available. There is no approved HIV vaccine. Current antiretroviral therapies do not eliminate HIV infection, requiring individuals to remain on antiretroviral drugs for their entire lives. Uptake and successful long term adherence to therapy is also limited. Only 25% of those infected with HIV in the US ultimately remain in HIV care with their viral load sufficiently suppressed to prevent spread of HIV. The annual incidence of new HIV infections has remained virtually unchanged for the past 20 years. Furthermore, the annual financial burden to the U.S. taxpayer for HIV education, prevention, and treatment costs borne through multiple federal agencies is more than $20 billion annually. 

&#160; 

Work on our HIV vaccines began during the 1990s at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, under the direction of Dr. Harriet L. Robinson, who is now our Chief Scientific Officer. The vaccine technology was developed in collaboration with researchers at the NIH and the CDC. 

&#160; 

Our most clinically advanced vaccine development program is a DNA/MVA vaccine regimen designed to protect against the clade B subtype of the HIV virus. Clade B is prevalent in the Americas and Western Europe. An estimated 3.3 million people are infected with clade B HIV virus worldwide, with 187,000 new infections in 2012. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

We have two HIV vaccine components under development: a recombinant DNA vaccine, and a recombinant MVA vaccine. Both the DNA and MVA vaccines contain sufficient HIV genes to support the production of non-infectious virus-like particles. These VLPs display the native trimeric membrane-bound form of the HIV envelope glycoprotein (Env) that mediates entry into cells and is the target for protective antibody. When used together, the recombinant DNA component primes immune responses, which are boosted by administration of the recombinant MVA component. This prime-boost strategy elicits high avidity antibodies (tightly binding antibodies) and cytotoxic T cells. The antibodies can block infections and initiate the killing of virus and infected cells by bound antibody signaling destruction by virion capture, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, phagocytosis and complement mediated lysis. 

&#160; 

Clinical trials of our preventive HIV vaccine have been conducted by the HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN). The HVTN is the largest worldwide clinical trials network dedicated to the development and testing of HIV/AIDS vaccines. Support for the HVTN comes from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the NIH. The HVTN&#8217;s HIV Vaccine Trial Units are located at leading research institutions in 27 cities on four continents. 

&#160; 

We have completed multiple Phase 1 trials and a Phase 2a trial (HVTN 205) of various dosing regimens and formulations of our vaccines. These vaccines have been evaluated in nearly 500 humans. All of the clinical trials of our preventive vaccines have been conducted by the HVTN, and fully funded by the NIH. 

&#160; 

We expect the NIH to fully fund the cost of another Phase 1 trial (HVTN 114) of our preventive HIV vaccine to begin in mid-2016, which will investigate the effect of adding a &#8220;protein boost&#8221; component to our vaccine. Protein boosts may augment antibody responses that can block virus infections (neutralizing antibody) and cause antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Proteins added to HIV vaccines have shown some success in other trials. The HVTN believes this &#8220;dual-action&#8221; approach will be a prudent and cost-effective path forward for supporting large clinical trials. Information from this trial would then inform the design of future, larger clinical trials. While efforts are underway to evaluate the protein boost concept, we also intend to seek funding to expedite our vaccine (without the added protein boost) directly into pivotal Phase 2b efficacy trials. 

&#160; 

The HVTN is continuing to consider future efficacy studies, and members are working to develop collaborative clinical development plans, as well as initiating regulatory planning. The plans for large-scale clinical trials may change as researchers continue to gather information from our earlier studies and are influenced by results from other vaccine trials. Trial start dates are dependent on many factors and are likely to change. 

&#160; 

Preventive HIV Vaccine Program &#8211; Clade C. We also are developing DNA/MVA vaccines designed for use to combat the subtypes of HIV that predominate in South Africa and India. In June 2015, the NIH awarded us a Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) grant entitled &#8220;Directed Lineage Immunizations for Eliciting Broadly Neutralizing Antibody&#8221; toward this effort. 

&#160; 

Preclinical Studies. We have conducted multiple preclinical efficacy trials of our preventive HIV vaccines by vaccinating non-human primates with simian immunodeficiency virus prototypes of our HIV vaccines and then testing them for resistance to either single high dose, or repeated low dose rectal challenges. The most recent of these studies has shown that the SIV prototype of our HIV vaccine that is advancing in clinical trials provided a 76% reduction in per exposure risk of infection over a series of 12 weekly rectal challenges. This is a very good level of protection to have achieved in the SIV macaque model much better than achieved in preclinical models by simian prototypes of the one partially successful HIV vaccine tested in the RV144 trial in Thailand. 

&#160; 

Completed Human Clinical Trials -- Preventive HIV Vaccine 

&#160; 

Phase 1 Human Clinical Trials. All of our preventive vaccination trials in humans have been conducted by the HVTN, a network that is funded and supported by the NIH. The HVTN is the largest worldwide clinical trials network focused on the development and testing of HIV/AIDS vaccines. The results of a two group, 30 participant, Phase 1 trial (designated HVTN 045) are published in AIDS RESEARCH AND HUMAN RETROVIRUSES 22:678 (2006) and of a four group 120 participant trial (HVTN 065) in The Journal of Infectious Diseases 203:610 (2011). The results of a 300 person Phase 2a trial are published in The Journal of Infectious Diseases 210: 99 (2014). These trials have tested both safety and dosing regimens. 

&#160; 

In our first Phase 1 clinical trial, HVTN 045, our DNA vaccine was tested without MVA boosting to document the safety of the DNA. Our second Phase 1 clinical trial, HVTN 065, was designed to test the combined use of DNA and MVA and consisted of a dose escalation as well as regimen studies. The low dose consisted of 0.3 mg of DNA and 1x10 7 tissue culture infectious doses (TCID50) of MVA. Once safety was demonstrated for the low dose in 10 participants, the full dose (3 mg of DNA and 1x10 8 TCID50 of MVA) was administered to 30 participants. A single dose of DNA at time 0 followed by MVA at weeks 8 and 24, a DMM regimen, and three doses of MVA administered at weeks 0, 8 and 24, an MMM regimen, were also tested in 30 participants each. Participants were followed for 12 months to assess vaccine safety and to measure vaccine-induced immune responses. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Data from the HVTN 065 trial again documented the safety of the vaccine products but also showed that the DDMM and MMM regimens induced different patterns of immune responses. The full dose DDMM regimen induced higher response rates of CD4+ T-cells (77%) and CD8+ T-cells (42%) compared to the MMM regimen (43% CD4+ and 17% CD8+ response rates). In contrast, the highest response rates and highest titers of antibodies to the HIV Env protein were induced in the group that received only the MVA using the MMM regimen. 

&#160; 

Phase 2 Human Clinical Trials. Based on the safety and the immunogenicity results in the HVTN 045 and HVTN 065 Phase 1 trials, the full dose DNA/MVA and MVA-only regimens were selected for testing by the HVTN in a Phase 2a trial (designated HVTN 205). HVTN 205 was designed to further evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of our vaccines in healthy, HIV-uninfected adults. In HVTN 205, 299 participants were randomly assigned to three study arms: 149 participants received two injections of our DNA vaccine followed by two injections of our MVA vaccine (DDMM arm), 75 participants received three MVA injections and one placebo injection (MMPM arm), and 75 participants received four injections of placebo. At 2 weeks after the final vaccination, antibody responses against the HIV Envelope protein (Env), the target for protective antibody, were detected in 93.2% of the DDMM arm (the vaccination regimen selected for further clinical study). At six months after final vaccination), anti-Env Ab response titers in the DDMM arm had declined by less than 3-fold. The antibody to Env had high affinity binding, a characteristic associated with prevention of infection in preclinical models. The study also showed low response rates for serum IgA, a desirable characteristic because serum IgA can compete for binding with serum IgG and block protective Fc-mediated protection. In the one partially successful HIV vaccine trial, levels of serum IgA were a direct correlate with risk. Encouragingly, response rates for serum IgG3, an isotype associated with Fc-mediated mechanisms of protection such as complement (C&#8217;)-mediated lysis and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity were excellent (91% response rate). These results reinforce our desire to move to the next level of clinical trial, a Phase 2b efficacy trial using individuals who are at risk of coming into contact with HIV. This type of trial would show whether the vaccine protects against HIV exposure.

HIV Immunotherapy Program 

&#160; 

Current antiretroviral therapies, though highly effective at suppressing HIV viral load, are unable to eliminate latent forms of HIV that are invisible to the immune system and inaccessible to antiretroviral drugs. In response to this problem, the NIH and other leaders in the HIV field have developed a new concept: the &#8220;shock and kill&#8221; strategy, in which patients remain on standard-of-care anti-retroviral drug therapy while a second drug (&#8220;shock agent&#8221;) is used to activate latent HIV and a third drug (&#8220;kill agent&#8221;) is used to recognize and eliminate cells with activated HIV infections. A shock and kill therapy could potentially contribute to a drug-free cure for HIV. 

&#160; 

Preclinical Studies &#8211; Therapeutic Vaccine. In 2007-2008, data were generated in three pilot studies conducted at Yerkes National Primate Research Center of Emory University in which non-human primates were infected, drug-treated, vaccinated and then drug-interrupted. Following treatment interruption, median levels of virus in blood, measured as viral RNA, were 10 to 1000-times lower than those measured prior to drug and vaccine treatment. The therapeutic reductions in virus levels were best for animals placed on drugs within 12 weeks of infection with lower levels of protection being achieved in animals that were placed on drugs at 3 months or later after infection. 

&#160; 

Phase 1 Clinical Trial (Treatment Interruption). In early 2014, we completed a Phase 1 clinical trial (GV-TH-01) investigating the therapeutic use of our GOVX-B11 HIV vaccine in HIV-infected patients. GV-TH-01 was an open label Phase 1 treatment interruption trial investigating the safety and immunogenicity of our DNA/MVA vaccine regimen in 9 HIV-infected patients who initiated drug treatment within 18 months of seroconversion and had stably controlled virus for at least 6 months. Patients were vaccinated with two DNA inoculations followed by two MVA inoculations at intervals of two months. Eight weeks following the last inoculation, patients suspended drug therapy for a 12-week period. Vaccinated patients&#8217; ability to control the time and temporal height of re-emergent virus in the absence of drugs was then observed. Drug treatment was re-instituted after 12 weeks, and trial participants were observed for an additional 6 months. The primary endpoint of this study was to evaluate the safety of our vaccine in HIV-positive patients with well-controlled infections who are being treated with oral HIV medications. An exploratory objective of the study was to evaluate the ability of the vaccinated patient to control re-emergent virus during the drug treatment interruption period. 

&#160; 

Analysis of GV-TH-01 data indicates that, during the vaccination phase of the trial, enhanced CD8+ T cells were elicited in 8 of 9 participants and enhanced CD4+ T cell in 5 of 9 participants. Eight participants underwent treatment interruption to test the ability of the vaccine-enhanced responses to control, or prevent, re-emergent virus. Virus re-emerged in all 8 individuals. Interestingly, in 6 of the 8, re-emergent virus appeared to have already escaped the hosts&#8217; T cell responses indicating that to be effective, vaccination would need to take place in individuals placed on antiretroviral therapy soon after infection (see preclinical study above, where vaccination was most effective in non-human primates placed on drugs at 12 weeks after infection). In 2 of the 8 participants, escape had not taken place before treatment interruption. In these two participants, the vaccination failed to snuff the infection at the site of re-emergence and escape mutants rapidly appeared. Thus, therapeutic vaccination will need to overcome the challenge of the rapid selection of CD8+ escape viruses in infected individuals (most of whom do not realize that they are infected) and a poor ability of CD8+ T cells to control virus (that has not already escaped the T cell response) at the site of viral re-emergence. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

While no reportable medical adverse events were documented during GV-TH-01, it remains clear that in order to achieve a cure for HIV multiple concomitant therapies will be necessary. An approach using the standard of care oral drug therapy, plus a vaccine and a &#8220;shock&#8221; agent used to expose the virus and make it susceptible to activated antibodies and T-cells is an example of an approach required to achieve such a cure. Observations from GV-TH-01 have led us to postulate that our DNA vaccines may be effective as shock agents to partially reactivate viral reservoirs. Therefore, future therapeutic studies of GeoVax&#8217;s vaccine will investigate the vaccine&#8217;s ability to act as a shock agent to reactivate latent virus. The timetable and specific clinical plans will depend upon the Company&#8217;s ability to secure external funding for the program. 

&#160; 

Our Hemorrhagic Fever Vaccine Program 

&#160; 

About Ebola, Marburg and Lassa fever viruses. Ebola (EBOV, formerly designated as Zaire ebolavirus), Sudan (SUDV), and Marburg viruses (MARV) are the current most virulent species of the Filoviridae family. They can cause up to a 90% fatality rate in humans, and are epizootic in Central and West Africa with multiple outbreaks since 1970. Lassa fever virus (LASV), a member of the Arenaviridae family, causes severe and often fatal hemorrhagic illnesses in an overlapping region with Ebola. In contrast to the unpredictable epidemics of filoviruses, LASV is endemic in West Africa with an annual incidence of &#62;300,000 infections, resulting in 5,000-10,000 deaths. Data from a recent sero-epidemiologic study suggest that the number of annual LASV cases may be much higher, reaching three million infections and 67,000 deaths, putting as many as 200 million persons at risk. Although the timing of the next filovirus outbreak cannot be predicted, it is certain that one will occur due to multiple factors such as: the zoonotic nature of the virus, weak health systems, high population mobility, cultural beliefs and burial practices, and endemic infectious diseases such as malaria and Lassa fever that mimic early Ebola symptoms in those at natural risk; and for those not at natural risk, the risk of intentional release by a bioterrorist. 

&#160; 

We believe an ideal vaccine against major filoviruses and LASV viruses must activate both humoral and cellular arms of the immune system. It must include the induction of antibodies to slow the initial rate of infection and a cellular immune response to help clear the infection. Moreover, it must address strain variations by providing broad coverage against potential epizootic filovirus strains, and it must be safe not only in healthy individuals (e.g. travelers or health care workers), but also in immunocompromised persons (e.g., HIV infected) and those with other underlying health concerns. 

&#160; 

Despite significant progress being made with some experimental vaccines in clinical trials (e.g. rVSV-ZEBOV), none have been fully tested for both safety and efficacy. The replication competent rVSV-ZEBOV showed safety concerns in Phase 1 trials and by virtue of being replication competent could pose threats to immunocompromised individuals, such as those infected with HIV. The less advanced adeno-vectored vaccine candidates may require relatively cumbersome heterologous prime/boost regimens, for example with MVA, to elicit durable protective immunity. The use of Ad5 vectors also has been associated with concerns over increased susceptibility to HIV infection in areas with high HIV incidence. Even with rVSV-ZEBOV showing promise in the 2013-2015 epidemic, the world would benefit by being prepared with a multivalent, as well as safer vaccine, to prevent or alleviate the effects of the next epidemic. 

&#160; 

Our Vaccines . To address the unmet need for a product that can respond to future filovirus epidemics and potentially end LASV infections in West Africa, we are developing an innovative Tetravalent Vaccine (TV) utilizing our proven MVA-VLP platform. We are addressing strain variations, and induction of broad humoral and cellular response through development of 4 monovalent vaccines, which can be blended to provide broad coverage. The MVA vector is highly safe, having been developed for use in immunocompromised individuals. It has had excellent safety in clinical trials in immunocompromised (~1000) as well as normal (&#62;5000) people and is currently licensed by Bavarian Nordic for use as a smallpox vaccine. 

&#160; 

Our TV vaccine generates VLPs by expressing both GP and matrix proteins (VP40 for filoviruses, Z for LASV) in single vectors for each of its target viruses. It is designed to elicit protective antibodies against GP as well as protective T cells against GP plus the more conserved VP40, or Z, matrix proteins. It is expected to not only protect at risk individuals against EBOV, SUDV, MARV, and LASV; but also potentially reduce or modify the severity of other re-emerging filovirus pathogens such as Bundibugyo, Ivory Coast, and Reston viruses, based on antigenic cross reactivity and the elicitation of T cells to the more conserved matrix proteins. Thus, the GeoVax MVA-VLP-TV approach offers a unique combination of advantages to achieve breadth and safety of a pan-filo/LASV vaccine. In addition to protecting people in Africa, it is intended to prevent the spread of disease to the US, as with the last outbreak, and for preparedness against terrorist release of any of these four bio-threat pathogens (EBOV, SUDV, MARV, and LASV). The initial markets for the TV vaccine are both NGOs such as the Gavi vaccine alliance and the Bill &#38; Melinda Gates Foundation, as well as US and foreign governments. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Innovation . The innovation in our MVA-VLP-TV vaccine is in the design of the individual vectors, which use unique MVA shuttle vectors combined with appropriate strength promoters and codon optimizations to achieve genetically stable vectors expressing high levels of filovirus and LASV VLPs. We have developed three different generations of shuttle vectors, spanning 15 years of collaboration with NIH in developing MVA/HIV vaccines expressing VLPs. The latest shuttle vectors insert transgenes between essential genes, such that the loss of genes involving adjacent sequences during manufacture (the most frequent genetic mutation associated with loss of gene expression in earlier MVA vectors) results in replication incompetent viruses that do not outgrow the insert containing virus. We use a synthetic early late promoter that provides high, yet not lethal, levels of VLP expression, which is initiated immediately after infection. VLPs, expressed by MVA, in turn, form a basis of a highly effective vaccine, as the VLPs are made in the person being vaccinated and do not have to be purified, reducing manufacturing costs. Moreover, they can express native forms of membrane-displayed viral envelope glycoproteins (the form we use is mutated to not express secreted S). The array of GPs on the VLPs is highly favorable for cross-linking B cell receptors and initiating an Ab response. The expression of VP40 or Z in infected cells stimulates CD8 T cell responses against the relatively conserved matrix proteins broadening protection. 

&#160; 

Many consider MVA a boosting, not a priming vaccine. However, our MVA-expressed VLPs are very good priming vaccines. In guinea pigs, a single dose of the GeoVax EBOV vaccine (MVA/Z-VLP) raises the same levels of Abs as raised by a single dose of a recombinant VSV vaccine expressing the EBOV GP. 

&#160; 

Our TV-MVA vector affords other unique advantages: 

&#160; 

Safety : GeoVax/NIAID rMVA HIV vaccines have demonstrated outstanding safety in human clinical trials. Safety for MVA has been shown in more than 120,000 subjects in Europe, including immunocompromised individuals during the initial development of MVA and more recently with the development of MVA as a safer vaccine against smallpox. 

&#160; 

Durability : GeoVax/NIAID rMVA technology raises highly durable vaccine responses, the most durable in the field of vectored HIV vaccines (G. Tomaras, HVTN Spring Meeting, 2015). We hypothesize that elicitation of durable vaccine responses is conferred on responding B cells by the vaccinia parent of MVA, which raises highly durable responses for smallpox. 

&#160; 

Limited pre-existing immunity to vector : Following the eradication of smallpox in 1980, smallpox vaccinations subsequently ended, leaving all but those born before 1980 and selected populations (such as vaccinated laboratory workers, first responders) unvaccinated and without pre-existing immunity. 

&#160; 

No need for adjuvants: MVA stimulates strong innate immune responses and does not require the use of adjuvants. 

&#160; 

Thermal stability: MVA is stable in both liquid and lyophilized formats (&#62; 6 years of storage). 

&#160; 

Genetic stability and manufacturability: If appropriately engineered, MVA is genetically stable and can reliably be manufactured in either the established Chick Embryo Fibroblast cell substrate, or novel continuous cell lines that support scalability as well as greater process consistency and efficiency. 

&#160; 

In February 2016 we entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement for material transfer with the United States Army Research Institute of Infectious Disease (USAMRIID). This agreement provides us with access to Ebola, Marburg and Lassa fever monoclonal antibodies for in vitro vaccine characterization, with USAMRIID will performing in vitro and in vivo assessment of our vaccine candidates. 

&#160; 

Our Zika Virus Vaccine Program 

&#160; 

About Zika Virus . Zika disease is a rapidly spreading emerging infection caused by the Zika virus (ZIKV) and may be linked to an increase in microcephaly in infants and Guillain-Barre syndrome (a neurodegenerative disease) in adults. ZIKV is a member of the Flaviviridae family, which includes medically important pathogens such as dengue fever, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, tick-borne encephalitis, and West Nile viruses. ZIKV, which was first discovered in 1947 in the Zika forest of Uganda, was considered only a minor public health concern for 60 years. Recently, with its appearance and rapid spread in the Americas, it has emerged as a serious threat with pandemic potential. Symptoms of Zika infection have historically been mild. In the recent epidemic, however, an alarming association between ZIKV infection and fetal brain abnormalities including microcephaly has been suspected. No approved preventive or therapeutic products are currently available to fight the Zika epidemic. Public health officials recommend avoiding exposure to ZIKV, delaying pregnancy, and following basic supportive care (fluids, rest, and acetaminophen) after infection. A vaccine is urgently needed to prevent a Zika pandemic. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Our Vaccine Development Efforts. To address the unmet need for a ZIKV vaccine, we are developing novel vaccine candidates constructed in our MVA-VLP live vector platform, which has already shown great promise in our HIV and Ebola vaccines. Unlike other vaccines in development, the GeoVax vaccine combines a highly potent, yet safe, replication deficient viral vector (MVA). Utilizing the MVA vector to express antigens of interest that assemble into VLPs within the vaccinated person, we combine the strengths of the MVA vector with those of VLPs. Advantages of MVA-VLPs include efficient stimulation of highly durable antibody responses with neutralizing and Fc-mediated mechanisms of protection; enhanced cross-protection by the elicitation of antigen specific T cells as well as antibody; and stimulation of the innate immune response without the need for an adjuvant. Also, MVA has an outstanding safety record, which is particularly important given the need to include pregnant women and newborns among those being vaccinated. We expect these features to yield a safe and highly effective vaccine that is well suited to provide potent and durable immunity against ZIKV infection. 

&#160; 

Our primary collaboration on the development of a ZIKV vaccine is with the University of Georgia (UGA), which will develop animal models and perform mouse studies. The US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) is developing its own animal models (AG129 mice, developed for dengue vaccine testing, and guinea pigs) and will serve as a backup strategy in case UGA is unsuccessful. Collaborating researchers at the Rocky Mountain Laboratories are developing non-human primate models for ZIKV testing. ZIKV and reagents will be supplied by the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB). Working with multiple collaborators and multiple candidate vaccines, we will manage risk by providing multiple paths toward the selection of the best vaccine candidate. 

&#160; 

Our Cancer Immunotherapy Program 

&#160; 

About Cancer Immunotherapy . Cancer is the second most common cause of death in the US, exceeded only by heart disease. Its global burden is expected to rise to 22 million new cases by 2030. Currently, there is only one FDA approved cancer vaccine, PROVENGE&#174; (sipuleucel-T). PROVENGE&#174; is a personalized therapy for prostate cancer patients, which prolongs survival times by about 4 months. However, the field of immune-oncology has received new momentum with the discovery and initial launch of monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) called immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Tumors hijack the body&#8217;s natural immune checkpoints by over expressing immune checkpoint ligands (proteins that bind to and activate the inhibitory activity of immune checkpoints), as a mechanism of immune resistance, especially against the T cells that are specific for tumor antigens and can kill cancer cells. ICIs block the interaction of Immune checkpoints with their ligands on tumor cells, allowing poorly functional T cells to resume proliferation, cytokine production and killing of tumor cells. 

&#160; 

Unlike conventional therapies (e.g. radiation, chemotherapy, antibody, etc.), cancer vaccines have the potential to induce responses that not only result in the control and even clearance of tumors but also establish immunological memory that can suppress and prevent tumor recurrence. Convenience, safety, and low toxicity of cancer vaccines make them invaluable tools to be included in future immunotherapy approaches for treating tumors. Currently, there are only a few vectored cancer vaccines being tested in combination with ICIs, all of which are in early clinical stages. 

&#160; 

Our I mmuno-O ncology Development Efforts. GeoVax has established a collaboration with Dr. Olivera Finn, a leading expert in cancer immunotherapy at the University of Pittsburg. Dr. Finn was the first to show that many tumors express an abnormal form of cell surface-associated Mucin 1 (MUC1) protein that is recognized by the immune system as foreign. Given this, we are developing our MVA-VLP vaccine platform to deliver abnormal forms of MUC1 with the goal of raising protective anti-tumor antibodies and T cell responses in cancer patients. 

&#160; 

Our approach to cancer immunotherapy will likely utilize a combination approach, for which each component has already shown some promising results in clinical trials. DNA and MVA-VLP-MUC1 will be used to elicit antibody and T cell responses to MUC1 in the patients&#8217; own bodies. Prior to vaccination, patients will undergo their Standard of Care (SOC) treatments, such as chemotherapy or radiation. We expect ICIs will be used to activate suppressed T cells and enable the patients&#8217; immune system to respond to VLP-delivered MUC1 antigen, with the goal of causing tumor regression. 

&#160; 

We expect to demonstrate proof-of-concept in preclinical engineered murine tumor models for MUC1 at the University of Pittsburgh during 2016 and, subject to adequate funding, we anticipate that within three years GeoVax will be able to file an IND with the FDA and initiate a Phase 1 trial in a limited number of cancer patients. 

&#160; 

Support from the United States Government 

&#160; 

With the exception of the GV-TH-01 Phase 1 therapeutic trial (treatment interruption protocol), all of our human clinical trials to date have been conducted by the HVTN and funded by NIH. This financial support has been provided by the NIH directly to the HVTN, so has not been recognized in our financial statements. Our responsibility for these clinical trials has been to provide sufficient supplies of vaccine materials and technical expertise when necessary. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

In addition to clinical trial support from the NIH, our operations have been partially funded by NIH research grants. Refer to our Financial Statements beginning on page F-1, and to &#8220;Management&#39;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221;, for additional information regarding revenue and funds availability from these grants. 

&#160; 

Regulations 

&#160; 

Regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries is a significant factor in our ongoing research and development activities and in the manufacture of our products under development. Complying with these regulations involves considerable time and expense. 

&#160; 

In the United States, drugs are subject to rigorous federal and state regulation. Our products are regulated under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended (FD&#38;C Act), and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and other federal and state statutes and regulations. These laws govern, among other things, the testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of medications and medical devices. Product development and approval within this regulatory framework is difficult to predict, takes a number of years and involves great expense. The steps required before a human vaccine may be marketed in the United States include: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Pre-clinical laboratory tests, in vivo pre-clinical studies and formulation studies; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Manufacturing and testing of the product under strict compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application for human clinical testing which must become effective before human clinical trials can commence; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product; 

&#160; &#9679; 

the submission of a Biologics License Application to the FDA, along with the required user fees; 

&#160; &#9679; 

FDA approval of the Biologics License Application prior to any commercial sale or shipment of the product; and 

&#160; &#9679; 

Post-marketing requirements imposed by FDA. 

&#160; 

Each of these steps is described further below. Before marketing any drug or biologic for human use, the product sponsor must obtain FDA approval. In addition, each manufacturing establishment must be registered with the FDA and must pass a Pre-Approval Inspection (PAI) before introducing any new drug or biological product into commercial distribution. Because GeoVax does not manufacture vaccines for human use within our own facilities, we must ensure compliance both in our own operations and in the outsourced manufacturing operations. All FDA-regulated manufacturing establishments (both domestic establishments and foreign establishments that export products to the United States) are subject to inspections by the FDA and must comply with the FDA&#8217;s Good Manufacturing Practices for products, drugs and devices. 

&#160; 

FDA determines compliance with applicable statutes and regulations through documentation review, investigations, and inspections. Several enforcement mechanisms are available to FDA, ranging from a simple demand to correct a minor deficiency to mandatory recalls, closure of facilities, and even criminal charges for the most serious violations. 

&#160; 

Preclinical Testing. Preclinical testing includes laboratory evaluation of chemistry and formulation, as well as cell culture and animal studies to assess the safety and potential efficacy of the product. Preclinical safety tests and certain other pivotal preclinical studies must be conducted by laboratories that comply with the FDA&#8217;s Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP. The results of pre-clinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of the IND application and are reviewed by the FDA prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. Unless the FDA objects to an IND, the IND becomes effective 30 days following its receipt by the FDA. 

&#160; 

CGMP-Compliant Manufacturing and Testing . FDA has issued, and frequently updates, extensive regulations on current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP). Any drug, biologic, or device for human use, whether commercial or investigational, must be manufactured under these regulations. CGMP regulations include a wide variety of requirements covering personnel, documentation, facilities, equipment, testing procedures, and many other aspects of manufacturing and testing. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Clinical Trials. Clinical trials involve the administration of investigational drugs to volunteers or to patients under the supervision of a qualified, medically trained clinical investigator. Clinical trials are conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practices under protocols that detail the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used to monitor safety and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol and the qualifications of the investigators who plan to carry it out must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Further, each clinical trial must be conducted under the auspices of an independent institutional review board at the institution where the trial will be conducted. The institutional review board will consider, among other things, ethical factors, the safety of human subjects and the possible liability of the institution. 

&#160; 

Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In the Phase 1 clinical trial, the initial introduction of the product into healthy human subjects, the vaccine is tested for safety (including adverse side effects) and dosage tolerance. The Phase 2 clinical trial is the proof of principal stage and involves trials in a limited patient population to determine whether the product induces the desired effect (for our vaccines this means immune responses) and to better determine optimal dosage. The continued identification of possible safety risks is also a focus. When there is evidence that the product may be effective and has an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 clinical trials, Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to evaluate clinical efficacy and to test for safety within an expanded patient population. Phase 3 trials are completed using multiple clinical study sites which are geographically dispersed. The manufacturer or the FDA may suspend clinical trials at any time if either believes that the individuals participating in the trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks. 

&#160; 

Biologics License Application and FDA Approval Process. The results and details of the pre-clinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA in the form of a Biologics License Application (BLA), which is equivalent to the New Drug Application (NDA) submitted by companies seeking to market new drugs. If the BLA is approved, the manufacturer may market the product in the United States. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), FDA charges user fees to applicants to offset the costs of its operations. The PDUFA user fee for a new vaccine is over $2 million, unless the applicant obtains a waiver or reduction through certain programs designed to encourage development of certain types of products. 

&#160; 

Post- marketing Requirements. FDA frequently imposes post-marketing requirements as a condition of NDA or BLA approval. Common post-marketing requirements include additional clinical trials (Phase 4 trials) or observational studies. Post-marketing requirements are especially relevant to our Ebola and Marburg vaccines. We intend to pursue approval of these vaccines using the accelerated approval process, in which FDA grants approval based on performance against a criterion other than actual protection against the disease but requires the manufacturer to monitor and submit data on efficacy of the approved product. Unlike pathogens such as human papillomavirus, Ebola and Marburg are not constantly in circulation; instead, they occur in sporadic but extremely deadly outbreaks. For this reason, it would be impractical and potentially unethical to attempt to perform a traditional Phase 3 trial in which vaccinated participants are compared against unvaccinated participants to determine the efficacy of the vaccine in preventing infection with Ebola or Marburg. The accelerated approval process allows FDA to approve a new medicine based on its performance against a surrogate endpoint (in the case of Ebola or Marburg, its performance in raising immune responses). We anticipate that, as a condition of receiving accelerated approval, GeoVax would agree to monitor the real-world performance of our Ebola and Marburg vaccines. 

&#160; 

International Approval. Whether or not the FDA has approved the drug, approval of a product by regulatory authorities in foreign countries must be obtained prior to the commencement of commercial sales of the drug in such countries. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials and drug approvals vary widely from country to country, and the time required for approval may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. 

&#160; 

Other Regulations. In addition to FDA regulations, our business activities may also be regulated by the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other present and potential future federal, state or local regulations. Violations of regulatory requirements at any stage may result in various adverse consequences, including regulatory delay in approving or refusal to approve a product, enforcement actions, including withdrawal of approval, labeling restrictions, seizure of products, fines, injunctions and/or civil or criminal penalties. Any product that we develop must receive all relevant regulatory approvals or clearances before it may be marketed. 

&#160; 

Manufacturing 

&#160; 

We do not have the facilities or expertise to manufacture any of the clinical or commercial supplies of any of our products. To be successful, our products must be manufactured in commercial quantities in compliance with regulatory requirements and at an acceptable cost. To date, we have not commercialized any products, nor have we demonstrated that we can manufacture commercial quantities of our product candidates in accordance with regulatory requirements. If we cannot manufacture products in suitable quantities and in accordance with regulatory standards, either on our own or through contracts with third parties, it may delay clinical trials, regulatory approvals and marketing efforts for such products. Such delays could adversely affect our competitive position and our chances of achieving profitability. We cannot be sure that we can manufacture, either on our own or through contracts with third parties, such products at a cost or in quantities that are commercially viable. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

We currently rely and intend to continue to rely on third-party contract manufacturers to produce vaccines needed for research and clinical trials. We have entered into arrangements with third party manufacturers for the supply of our DNA and MVA vaccines for use in our planned clinical trials. These suppliers operate under the FDA&#8217;s Good Manufacturing Practices and (in the case of European manufacturers) similar regulations of the European Medicines Agency. We anticipate that these suppliers will be able to provide sufficient vaccine supplies to complete our currently planned clinical trials. Various contractors are generally available in the United States and Europe for manufacture of vaccines for clinical trial evaluation, however, it may be difficult to replace existing contractors for certain manufacturing and testing activities and costs for contracted services may increase substantially if we switch to other contractors. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The biopharmaceutical industry and the vaccine market is competitive and subject to rapid and substantial technological change. Developments by others may render our proposed vaccination technologies noncompetitive or obsolete, or we may be unable to keep pace with technological developments or other market factors. Technological competition in the industry from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, universities, governmental entities and others diversifying into the field is intense and is expected to increase. Many of the pharmaceutical companies that compete with us have significantly greater research and development capabilities than we have, as well as substantially more marketing, manufacturing, and financial resources. In addition, acquisitions of, or investments in, small pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies by such large corporations could increase their research, financial, marketing, manufacturing and other resources. Competitive technologies may ultimately prove to be safer, more effective or less costly than any vaccine that we develop. 

&#160; 

There are currently no FDA licensed and commercialized Zika vaccines, Ebola vaccines, Marburg vaccines, Lassa fever or HIV vaccines available in the world market. We are aware of several development-stage and established enterprises, including major pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms, which are actively engaged in vaccine research and development in these areas. For Ebola, these include NewLink Genetics and Merck, Johnson &#38; Johnson, Novavax, Profectus Biosciences, Protein Sciences, Inovio and GlaxoSmithKline. For HIV, these include Novartis, Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline. Other HIV vaccines are in varying stages of research, testing and clinical trials including those supported by the NIH Vaccine Research Center, the U.S. Military, IAVI, the European Vaccine Initiative, and the South African AIDS Vaccine Initiative. For Zika, these include NewLink Genetics, Inovio, Sanofi, Merck and NIH (NIAID). We may also experience competition from companies that have acquired or may acquire technologies from companies, universities and other research institutions. As these companies develop their technologies, they may develop proprietary technologies which may materially and adversely affect our business. 

&#160; 

If any of our competitors develop products with efficacy or safety profiles significantly better than our products, we may not be able to commercialize our products, and sales of any of our commercialized products could be harmed. Some of our competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater product development capabilities and financial, scientific, marketing and human resources than we do. Competitors may develop products earlier, obtain FDA approvals for products more rapidly, or develop products that are more effective than those under development by us. We will seek to expand our technological capabilities to remain competitive; however, research and development by others may render our technologies or products obsolete or noncompetitive, or result in treatments or cures superior to ours. 

&#160; 

Our competitive position will be affected by the disease indications addressed by our product candidates and those of our competitors, the timing of market introduction for these products and the stage of development of other technologies to address these disease indications. For us and our competitors, proprietary technologies, the ability to complete clinical trials on a timely basis and with the desired results, and the ability to obtain timely regulatory approvals to market these product candidates are likely to be significant competitive factors. Other important competitive factors will include the efficacy, safety, ease of use, reliability, availability and price of products and the ability to fund operations during the period between technological conception and commercial sales. 

&#160; 

Our Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

We will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary rights are described by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. Accordingly, we are pursuing and will continue to pursue patent protection for our proprietary technologies obtained or developed through our collaborations with Emory University, the NIH, and the CDC, or developed by us alone. Our patent portfolio, described more fully below, includes applications directed to DNA and MVA based HIV vaccines, their genetic inserts expressing multiple HIV protein components, composition, structure, claim of immunization against multiple subtypes of HIV, routes of administration, safety and other related factors and methods of therapeutic and prophylactic use thereof including administration regimes. Also included are applications directed to preventive vaccines against Ebola, Marburg, Lassa virus, HBV, CMV and Zika virus and use thereof, as well as immuno-oncology vaccine compositions and methods of use thereof. We are the licensee of at least nine issued or allowed U.S. patents and at least fourteen issued or allowed non-U.S. patents. We are actively pursuing five U.S. provisional applications and two international patent applications as the owner of record, in addition to at least four U.S. patent applications and at least fourteen non-U.S. patent applications in five jurisdictions under license. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

We are the exclusive, worldwide licensee of a number of patents and patent applications, which we refer to as the Emory Technology, owned, licensed or otherwise controlled by Emory University for HIV or smallpox vaccines pursuant to a License Agreement originally entered into on August 23, 2002 and restated on June 23, 2004, which we refer to as the Emory License. Through the Emory License we are also a non-exclusive licensee of four issued United States patents owned by the NIH related to the ability of our MVA vector vaccine to operate as a vehicle to deliver HIV virus antigens, and also to induce an immune response in humans. The four issued United States patents owned by the NIH expire in 2023. All of our obligations with respect to the HIV NIH-owned MVA patents are covered by the Emory License. The Emory License expires on the expiration date of the last to expire of the patents licensed thereunder including those that are issued on patents currently pending. We will not know the final termination date of the Emory License until such patents are issued. The Company may terminate the Emory University License upon 90 days&#8217; written notice. The Emory License also contains standard provisions allowing Emory University to terminate upon breach of contract by the Company or upon the Company&#8217;s bankruptcy. We may only use the Emory Technology for therapeutic or prophylactic HIV or smallpox vaccines. Emory University also reserved the right to use the Emory Technology for research, educational and non-commercial clinical purposes. Due to the use of federal funds in the development of the Emory Technology, the U.S. Government has the irrevocable, royalty-free, paid-up right to practice and have practiced certain patents throughout the world, should it choose to exercise such rights. 

&#160; 

The Emory License, among other contractual obligations, requires payments based on the following: 

&#9679; 

Milestone Payments. An aggregate of $3,450,000 is potentially due to Emory University in the future upon the achievement of clinical development and regulatory approval milestones as defined in the Emory License. To date, we have paid a nominal milestone fee upon entering Phase 2 clinical trials for our preventive HIV/AIDS vaccine. 

&#9679; 

Maintenance Fees. The Company has achieved the specified milestones and met its obligations with regard to the related payments, and no maintenance fees are (or will be) owed to Emory University. 

&#9679; 

Royalties. Upon commercialization of products covered by the Emory License, we will owe royalties to Emory University of between 5% and 7.5%, depending on annual sales volume, of net sales made directly by GeoVax. The Emory License also requires minimum annual royalty payments of $3 million in the third year following product launch, increasing annually to $12 million in the sixth year. 

&#9679; 

Sublicense Royalties. In the event that we sublicense a covered product to a third party, we will owe royalties to Emory University based on all cash or noncash compensation we receive from our sublicensees. Those royalties will be 19% of all sublicensing consideration we receive prior to the first commercial sale of a related product. Commencing with the first commercial sale, the royalty owed to Emory University will be 27.5% of all sublicensing consideration we receive. 

&#9679; 

Patent Reimbursements. During the term of the Emory License, we are obligated to reimburse Emory University for ongoing third party costs in connection with the filing, prosecution and maintenance of patent applications subject to the Emory License. The expense associated with these ongoing patent cost reimbursements to Emory University amounted to $113,914, $179,958, and $98,042 for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 

&#160; 

We are not a party to any litigation, opposition, interference, or other potentially adverse proceeding with regard to our patent positions. However, if we become involved in litigation, interference proceedings, oppositions or other intellectual property proceedings, for example as a result of an alleged infringement or a third-party alleging an earlier date of invention, we may have to spend significant amounts of money and time and, in the event of an adverse ruling, we could be subject to liability for damages, invalidation of our intellectual property and injunctive relief that could prevent us from using technologies or developing products, any of which could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial conditions or results of operations. In addition, any claims relating to the infringement of third-party proprietary rights, or earlier date of invention, even if not meritorious, could result in costly litigation, lengthy governmental proceedings, divert management&#8217;s attention and resources and require us to enter royalty or license agreements which are not advantageous if available at all. 

&#160; 

In addition to patent protection, we also attempt to protect our proprietary products, processes and other information by relying on trade secrets and non-disclosure agreements with our employees, consultants and certain other persons who have access to such products, processes and information. Under these agreements, all inventions conceived by employees are our exclusive property. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that these agreements will afford significant protection against misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of our trade secrets and confidential information. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

We cannot be certain that any of the current pending patent applications we have licensed, or any new patent applications we may file or license, will ever be issued in the United States or any other country. Even if issued, there can be no assurance that those patents will be sufficiently broad to prevent others from using our products or processes. Furthermore, our patents, as well as those we have licensed or may license in the future, may be held invalid or unenforceable by a court, or third parties could obtain patents that we would need to either license or to design around, which we may be unable to do. Current and future competitors may have licensed or filed patent applications or received patents, and may acquire additional patents or proprietary rights relating to products or processes competitive to ours. In addition, any claims relating to the infringement of third-party proprietary rights, or earlier date of invention, even if not meritorious, could result in costly litigation, lengthy governmental proceedings, divert management&#8217;s attention and resources and require us to enter royalty or license agreements which are not advantageous to us, if available at all. 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

Our expenditures for research and development activities were $1,693,102, $1,812,969, and $2,914,878 during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. As our vaccines continue to go through the process to obtain regulatory approval, we expect our research and development costs to increase as human clinical trials proceed. We have not yet formulated any plans for marketing and sales of any vaccine candidate we may successfully develop. Compliance with environmental protection laws and regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position to date. 

&#160; 

Properties and Employees 

&#160; 

We lease approximately 8,400 square feet of office and laboratory space located at 1900 Lake Park Drive, Suite 380, Smyrna, Georgia under a lease agreement which expires on December 31, 2016, with a 12-month renewal option. We believe this space is adequate for our current needs. As of March 15, 2016, we had six full-time and three part-time employees. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and we believe that our employee relations are good. 

&#160; 

Corporate Background 

&#160; 

Our primary business is conducted by our subsidiary, GeoVax, Inc., which was incorporated under the laws of Georgia in June 2001. The predecessor of our parent company, GeoVax Labs, Inc. (the reporting entity) was originally incorporated in June 1988 under the laws of Illinois as Dauphin Technology, Inc. (&#8220;Dauphin&#8221;). In September 2006, Dauphin completed a merger with GeoVax, Inc. As a result of the merger, GeoVax, Inc. became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dauphin, and Dauphin changed its name to GeoVax Labs, Inc. In June 2008, the Company was reincorporated under the laws of Delaware. We currently do not conduct any business other than GeoVax, Inc.&#8217;s business of developing new products for the treatment or prevention of human diseases. Our principal offices are located in Smyrna, Georgia (metropolitan Atlanta).
