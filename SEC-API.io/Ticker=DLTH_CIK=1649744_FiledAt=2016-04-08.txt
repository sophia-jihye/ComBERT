 ITEM 1. 

BUSINESS 

Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;Duluth,&#8221; &#8220;Duluth Trading,&#8221; &#8220;Duluth Holdings,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our&#8221; or &#8220;us&#8221; are used to refer to Duluth Holdings Inc. and its subsidiary on a consolidated basis. 

Effective February 2013, we changed our fiscal year end from December 31 to the Sunday nearest to January 31. &#160; The following discussion contains references to fiscal years 2015 , 2014 and 2013, which refer to our fiscal year s ended January 31, 2016, February 1, 2015 and February 2, 2014, respectively. Fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013 were 52-week periods. 

On November 25, 2015, our &#8220;S&#8221; corporation status terminated and we converted to a &#8220;C&#8221; corporation. We became subject to corporate-level federal and state income taxes at prevailing corporate rates. See Note 8 &#8220;Income Taxes,&#8221; to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our &#8220;S&#8221; corporation termination. 

On November 25, 2015, we completed an initial public offering (&#8220;IPO&#8221;) in which we issued and sold 7,666,667 shares of our Class B common stock, which includes 1,000,000 shares of Class B common stock issued pursuant to the underwriters&#8217; option to purchase additional shares, at a price to the pubic of $12.00 per share, less the underwriting discount. We received n et proceeds of approximately $83 . 9 million after deducting the underwriting discount of $6.4 million and related fees an d expenses of approximately $1.7 million. We used $46.3 million of the net proceeds from the IPO to pay in full the amount previously borrowed from a bank to pay a portion of the distribution of 100% of the cumulative undistributed taxable earnings to our then existing shareholders from the date of our formation through the date of termination of our &#8220;S&#8221; corporation status. 

Duluth Trading is a rapidly growing lifestyle brand of men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s casual wear, workwear and accessories sold exclusively through our own channels. We offer a comprehensive line of innovative, durable and functional products, such as our Longtail T&#174; shirts, Buck Naked TM underwear and Fire Hose&#174; work pants, which reflect our position as the Modern, Self-Reliant American Lifestyle brand. Our brand has a heritage in workwear that transcends tradesmen and appeals to a broad demographic of men and women for everyday and on-the-job use. Approximately 88% of our fiscal 2015 net sales consisted of proprietary products sold under our Duluth Trading brand name. We believe the foundation of our success is our culture of &#8220;poking average in the eye&#8221; by seeing things for what they could be and should be and finding a way to make them exactly that, and we like to do it all with a big, toothy grin. Our brand is defined by three brand pillars: solution-based products manufactured with high quality craftsmanship, humorous and distinctive marketing and an outstanding customer experience. 

Our products solve the problems our customers experience with the limitations of commonly available apparel and gear. Our design process reflects a &#8220;there&#8217;s gotta be a better way&#8221; attitude, resulting in differentiated products with unique features that appeal to a broad array of customers. Our products represent enduring styles that go beyond short-lived fashion trends. We strive to make shopping for our products fun by using attention- grabbing advertisements that are humorous, i rreverent and quirky and serve to reinforce our brand identity. We also use storytelling to differentiate our products in the marketplace and create emotional connections with our customers. We provide our customers with a unique and entertaining experience across all channels through our content-rich website, catalogs and &#8220;store like no other&#8221; retail environment. We treat our customers like next-door neighbors, as exemplified by our exceptional customer service and unconditional &#8220;No Bull Guarantee&#8221; on all purchases. The combination of these three pillars has fostered a growing and engaged community of 1.7 million active customers wit hin the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016 . 

To protect the integrity of the Duluth Trading brand, we offer our produc ts exclusively through our omni channel distribution network, consisting of our website, catalogs and retail stores. This model creates multiple touch points with our customers and enables us to control both our Duluth Trading brand expression and the pricing of our products. Our distribution strategy eliminates the need to sell through third-party retailers, allowing us to focus on our core competencies of product development, storytelling and serving customers. Our direct segment, consisting of our website and catalogs, offers products nationwide and represented 88 % of our fiscal 2015 net sales. In 20 10, we added retail to our omni channel platform with the opening of our first store. Since then, we have expanded our retail presence, and as of January 31, 2016, we operated seven retail stores and two outlet stores. Our retail segment represented 12% of our fiscal 2015 net sales. 

Duluth Trading was founded in 1989 when two brothers in the home construction industry were tired of dragging tools from job to job using discarded five-gallon drywall compound buckets. The two brothers were never satisfied with the status quo and believed &#8220;there&#8217;s gotta be a better way.&#8221; So they invented the Bucket Boss&#174; - a ruggedly durable canvas tool organizer that fits around a drywall bucket and transformed the way construction workers organized their tools. Capitalizing on their initial success, these brothers launched a catalog that later became known as Duluth Trading Company. Under the initial philosophy of &#8220;Job Tough, Job Smart,&#8221; this catalog was dedicated to improving and expanding on existing methods of tool storage, organization and transport. In December 2000, GEMPLER&#8217;S Inc., an agricultural and horticultural supply catalog 

&#160;

business founded and owned by Stephen L. Schlecht, acquired Duluth Trading and brought the two mail order companies together. Both catalogs had customers who worked outside and embraced the spirit of hands-on, self-reliant Americans. In February 2003, the GEMPLER&#8217;s catalog business was sold to W.W. Grainger (NYSE:GWW) and proceeds from that sale have been used to fund the growth of Duluth Trading. With that transaction, GEMPLER&#8217;S changed its corporate name to Duluth Holdings Inc. 

From what began as an idea aimed at those working in the building trades, Duluth Trading has become widely recognized brand and proprietary line of innovative and functional apparel and gear. We have created strong brand awareness, built a loyal customer base and generated robust sales momentum. We have done so by sticking to our roots of &#8220;there&#8217;s gotta be a better way&#8221; and through our relentless focus on providing our customer with quality, functional products. 

What Makes Us Different 

We believe the following strengths differentiate us and provide a foundation for future growth: 

Differentiated, Everyday Lifestyle Brand 

Our understanding of the Modern, Self-Reliant American Lifestyle enables us to create personal connections with our customers who lead a hands-on lifestyle, value a job well-done and are often outdoors for work and hobbies. The workwear heritage of our products is the foundation of our authentic and differentiated brand. We communicate our brand values and product performance nationally through multiple mediums, including television, catalogs, digital advertising and sponsored events. We believe these marketing efforts make our brand synonymous with this lifestyle, validate our authenticity and establish Duluth Trading as a trusted provider of reliable casual wear and workwear. 

Solution-Based Design 

Our products solve the problems our customers experience with commonly available apparel and gear. We see things for what they could be and what they should be, and we find a way to &#160; make them exactly that, and we &#160; like to do it all with a big, toothy grin. We generate new product ideas in part by proactively seeking input from our consumers, including our trades panels, which are comprised of select groups located across the United States with expertise in various fields. Our trades panels test our products in intense conditions and offer suggestions for new and improved features. For example, one of our trades panel members, a farrier shoeing horses, experienced frustration with his heavy and restrictive work pants when he was required to bend, squat and sit throughout the day. His feedback led to the creation of our Duluthflex &#174; Ballroom &#174; jeans, which are built with 1% spandex and are more flexible than average jeans, allowing customers to &#8220;crouch without the ouch.&#8221; We believe that our focus on thoughtful product design and commitment to quality, such as &#8220;triple stitching the extra stitch&#8221; and &#8220;doubling down on extra durable fabric,&#8221; keeps our existing customers engaged while also attracting new customers to our brand. And we do it all because there are a whole lotta legs, torsos, feet and crotches out there counting on us. 

Humorous and Distinctive Marketing 

We make shopping for our products fun by using attention-grabbing advertisements that are humorous, irreverent and quirky. Our national advertising campaigns that feature characters such as our Giant Angry Beaver, Buck Naked Guy and Grab-Happy Grizzly, continue to increase our brand awareness and drive customers to our brand. These types of advertisements appeal to a wide audience and enable us to highlight the distinctive attributes of our products in a memorable way. We also use storytelling to make connections with our customers. For example, the story of our customer Tony the Diver, who wears our Fire Hose work pants over his wetsuit for added protection while working on marine construction, inspired a catalog cover and is featured on our website. Our advertising inspires our female customers by featuring women of &#8220;grit and substance&#8221; whose professions range from ranching to horse training to dog sled racing to landscape design. We believe our approach to marketing gives our products a distinct identity, enhances our brand and helps us stand out in the market. 

Outstanding and Engaging Customer Experience 

An important principle that shapes our brand is treating our customers like next-door neighbors. We provide a seamless, consistent omnichannel experience that makes shopping for casual wear, workwear and accessories fun, inviting and hassle-free. We are dedicated to delivering outstanding customer service by standing behind all purchases with our unconditional &#8220;No Bull Guarantee.&#8221; Our content-rich, user-friendly website is designed to provide an enjoyable, informative and efficient shopping experience. Our call center is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and is staffed with friendly, knowledgeable representatives dedicated to making every customer experience positive. Our stores are designed to bring our brand to life by creating a unique and entertaining experience with knowledgeable sales associates, a compelling and complete assortment of our products and hospitality areas with complimentary coffee and water. We also showcase unique attractions at each retail store, such as the tool museum in our Mt. Horeb, Wisconsin store, that celebrate the heritage of the local area. We believe these elements help promote customer loyalty and drive repeat purchases. 

&#160;

Attractive, Loyal Customer Base 

Our customers come to us for many aspects of their everyday casual wear and workwear needs. The quality and consistency of our product offering attracts a broad demographic of men and women who lead the Modern, Self-Reliant American Lifestyle . According to an internal company survey, 88% of our customers identified themselves as working outside of the building trades. Our average customer is a homeowner with an annual household income of over $75,000. Based on these characteristics, we be lieve our customers have a high level of disposable income and are attracted to the quality and enhanced features of our products. In addition, we currently have over 200,000 online product reviews, over 90% of which are four or five star ratings. 

Omnichannel Presence with Complete Distribution Control 

We sell our products exclusively through our direct and retail channels, giving us complete control of the presentation of our brand and the relationships with our customers. This strategy allows us to present our brand in a consistent manner, including marketing, pricing and product presentation. It also enables us to reduce logistical complexities and costs because we are not subject to timing, delivery and quantity requirements set by third-party retailers, allowing our employees to concentrate on product development, storytelling and serving customers. We believe this approach to distribution is a significant advantage for our brand, allowing us to deliver feature rich, superior quality products at competitive prices. 

Seasoned Management Team Driving an Impassioned Culture 

Our senior management team has extensive experience across a broad range of key disciplines. With an average of approximately 30 years of experience in their respective functional areas, our management team has been instrumental in driving results and in developing a robust and scalable infrastructure to support our continued growth. Our senior management team embraces the Modern, Self-Reliant American Lifestyle and has fostered a culture committed to &#8220;outthink, outsmart and outcraft average,&#8221; which is shared by employees throughout our organization. Our strong company culture and spirited corporate personality is exemplified by the long tenure of our team members with us. We believe the strength of our senior management team, supported by our dedicated board of directors and passionate employees, is a key driver of our success and positions us well to execute our long-term growth strategy. 

Our Growth Strategies 

Our goal is to expand the reach of the Duluth Trading brand, using strategies that will further drive growth and profitability: 

&#183; 

Building Brand Awareness to Continue Customer Acquisition . We are a rapidly growing lifestyle brand and have built strong brand awareness and successfully acquired customers over the past six years. As a relatively young brand , we believe that we have a significant opportunity to build even greater brand awareness. We plan to introduce potential customers to our brand through our national television and digital advertising campaigns, catalogs and retail store expansion. We have made significant investments in marketing to build brand awareness among our potential customers and expect to achieve leverage from these investments as our business continues to grow. 

&#183; 

Accelerating Retail Expansion. We believe our customers&#8217; purchasing decisions are heavily influenced by the availability of our retail stores. We believe that our customers&#8217; desire to shop in stores, combined with the number of potential markets for our retail stores and the compelling unit economics of our existing retail stores, provide us with a significant opportunity to grow our U.S. retail presence. We have identified markets with the potential for approximately 100 U.S. store locations that feature high concentrations of existing Duluth Trading customers and potential customers that fit our brand demograph ics. We anticipate opening four to five stores during fiscal 2016 and expect the rate of new store openings to accelerate over the coming years. Our existing retail stores have been profitable in both metropolitan and rural locations across multiple markets and have achieved an average payback of less than two years. We plan to continue building our organization and investing in software systems and operational infrastructure to support the growth in our retail segment. Based on our experience to date, we believe the combination of our direct and retail channels in an individual geographic market substantially increases the net sales and customer acquisition potential in that market. For example, since opening our retail stores in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area, our direct segment net sales in that area have continued to grow. Additionally, we believe our retail stores provide ancillary marketing benefits by giving new and existing customers a destination to experience our brand. 

&#183; 

Selectively Broadening Assortments in Certain Men&#8217;s Product Categories . We believe there is an opportunity to grow our men&#8217;s business by selectively broadening our assortment in certain product categories that exhibit high growth potential and resonate with the lifestyle of our core men&#8217;s customers, such as outerwear and footwear. 

&#160;

Through product introductions that expand seasonality and occasions for wear, we believe we can grow our share of closet with new and existing men&#8217;s customers. 

&#183; 

Growing Our Women&#8217;s Business . Since launching in 2005, our women&#8217;s business has grown significantly to represent approximately 20% of our net sales in fiscal 2015. We believe that we have a significant opportunity to continue to grow our women&#8217;s business through customer acquisition, and we plan to continue to leverage all of our marketing channels, including national television and digital advertising, our catalogs and retail stores to do so. We expect that our women&#8217;s business will continue to represent an increasing portion of our net sales, and accordingly, we are allocating a higher percentage of our total advertising budget to the women&#8217;s business. We believe that as our retail footprint expands, our women&#8217;s business will continue to grow based on our current customers&#8217; shopping patterns. While the core of our women&#8217;s product assortment will continue to consist of solution-based apparel that fits the Modern, Self-Reliant American Lifestyle, we plan to selectively expand our product offering to appeal to a wider range of female customers. 

Our Sales Channels 

We sell our products exclusively through our direct and retail channels, giving us complete control of our brand presentation as well as direct interaction with the consumer. Our omnichannel business strategy allows our sales channels to work in synergy to seamlessly deliver a consistent brand experience, including consistent marketing, pricing and product presentation. 

Direct Segment 

Our direct channel, which comprised 88% of our fiscal 2015 net sales, reaches customers nationwide through our website and catalogs. 

&#183; 

e-Commerce . Our website, www.duluthtrading.com, serves as a storefront for our product assortment and provides an interactive, user-friendly, content-rich customer experience. In fiscal 2015, our website accounted for approximately 79 % of our direct segment net sales . Our website&#8217;s homepage and category content, including pricing, seasonal promotions and products, are updated frequently in order to keep them current and seasonally appropriate, which coincides with updates to our catalogs and retail store displays. Our entire product offering is available on our website with certain new products offered exclusively online during their initial introduction, as well as out-of-season but in-stock products. Our website features humorous product videos and customer testimonials that educate our customers on the features and benefits of our products, which we believe enhances our visitors&#8217; shopping experience. We believe our e-commerce customer experience has been successful in converting website visitors into customers. 

We offer our new and existing customers the ability to shop across multiple platforms and devices, including mobile devices, tablets and desktop computers. During fiscal 2015, we sold merchandise to customers through our website in all 50 states and had 34.4 million website visits, an increase of approximately 28.1% from fiscal 2014. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Catalog . Our catalog business is an important part of our heritage and a key differentiator in our market. Our catalogs serve as a tangible vehicle for our authentic and humorous storytelling and drive customers to visit our website and retail stores. In fiscal 2015, our catalogs accounted for approximately 21% of o ur direct segment net sales, which were transacted via our call center, and sales through this channel continue to grow year over year. During fiscal 2015, we published 35 catalog issues and distributed over 52 million copies, approximately 23 m illion of which were mailed to prospective customers. Our catalogs reflect our tailored approach to marketing and include particular expressions of our brand that resonate with our target customers. For example, we produce separate catalogs for our men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s product offerings, showcasing illustrations in our men&#8217;s catalogs and featuring women of &#8220;grit and substance&#8221; in our women&#8217;s catalogs. In addition to generating a significant portion of our direct net sales, we believe our catalogs are clever, informative and eye catching and are a vital part of building the Duluth Trading brand. 

Retail Segment 

In 2010, we opened our first retail store and have since expanded our retail presence, operating seven retail stores and two outlet stores as of January 2016. In fiscal 2015, our retail stores produced $37.8 million in ne t sales, representing 12% of &#160; total net sales , compared to $23.0 million in net sales in fiscal 20 14, representing 10% of total net sales . Our existing stores have been profitable in both metropolitan and rural locations. During fiscal 2015, our retail store customer visits increased by 62% to approximately 1.1 million visits , compared to approximately &#160; 680 ,000 visits in fiscal 2014. Our retail stores allow us to reach customers who prefer to shop in a brick and mortar setting and give new and existing customers the opportunity to touch and feel our innovative products before making a purchase decision. Our stores range in size from approximately 6,000 to 11,000 selling square feet and are designed to bring our brand to life by creating a unique &#160; and entertaining experience, 

&#160;

including engaging sales associates, a compelling and complete product assortment, custom made fixtures to fit our brand, free wireless Internet and complimentary coffee and water. We also showcase unique attractions at each retail store that celebrate the heritage of the local area, such as the tool museum in our Mt. Horeb, Wisconsin store and the &#8220;Exploded Tractor&#8221; exhibit in our Ankeny, Iowa store. We believe these local community elements help promote customer loyalty and drive repeat purchases. 

Our retail stores allow us to reach customers that prefer to shop in a brick and mortar setting and give new and existing customers the opportunity to touch and feel our products in person before making a purchase decision. Our retail stores also provide ancillary marketing benefits, such as brand visibility in high traffic areas. We provide additional conveniences to customers at our stores, as they can order our products online and have them shipped for free to our store for pick up. Customers can also return products purchased online at our retail stores and can buy certain Duluth Trading-branded products not available in the store at the registers or in-store kiosks and have them shipped directly to their homes. 

See Note 7 &#8220;Segment Reporting ,&#8221; of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for our segment net sales, profit, total assets and other operating data. 

Retail Store Expansion Opportunities and Site Location 

We believe we have a compelling retail model that supports our ability to grow our store footprint in both new and existing markets across the United States with the potential to simultaneously enhance our direct segment sales in those markets and overall sales potential of the area. Unlike traditional brick and mortar retailers, we are able to leverage the wealth of customer data from our direct segment to identify potential markets for new stores that feature high concentrations of existing Duluth Trading customers and potential customers that fit our brand demographics. 

We select the potential markets for our new stores based on existing customer data from our direct segment and select our store locations based on customer input, access to the freeway, visibility, store accessibility and parking. Our current retail store information also informs our future merchandising decisions. We intend the range in selling square footage, as determined by market size of each of our new stores, to be approximately 7,000 to 12,000 selling square feet. We plan to continue building our organization and investing in software systems and operational infrastructure to support the growth in our retail segment. 

Our Products 

We offer a comprehensive line of innovative, durable and functional casual wear, workwear and accessories for both men and women. Our product assortment includes shirts, pants, underwear, outerwear, footwear, accessories and hard goods. Our products feature proprietary designs and distinct names , such as our Longtail T&#174; shirts, Buck Nak ed TM underwear and Fire Hose&#174; work pants. The table below present s net sales by business for each of the last two fiscal years.

We offer a stable product assortment, which appeals to our customers for their everyday and on-the-job use. The majority of our products represent enduring styles that go beyond short-lived fashion trends. We believe many of our customers &#8217; purchases are driven by our thoughtful design and high quality craftsmanship, and our best-selling styles tend to be items that carry over year to year with only minor updates. Accordingly, the majority of our product assortment is not subject to typical inventory markdowns and is generally sold at full price across all channels. 

We believe the authenticity of our products is driven by a number of factors, including our solution-based design process, use of technical materials, sophisticated manufacturing methods and innovative product features. Our products are sold at competitive prices and are designed to offer superior performance with added features such as underarm panels for more freedom of movement, triple-stitched seams for durability and mid-leg utility pockets for functionality. We also collaborate with our suppliers to develop advanced fabrics that we sell under our trademarks. For example, we incorporate our Duluthflex &#174; Fire Hose &#174; cotton canvas into products to provide strength and abrasion resistance with stretch for freedom of movement. 

&#160;

Product Development 

We are focused on developing apparel and gear that builds upon the Duluth Trading brand&#8217;s product heritage of &#8220;there&#8217;s gotta be a better way,&#8221; resulting in distinctive products with enhanced features. We primarily use an innovative feedback-based design process through which we actively seek the input of our customers, including a group of more than 100 products testers with expertise in the trades industry. These trades panel members have become an integral part of our product development process, as they test and evaluate select products in intense conditions, providing real-time feedback on performance and functionality. Members of our product development team also regularly read online customer product reviews, attend tradeshows and collaborate with our vendors, which facilitates new product innovation. Our product development team incorporates all of this input to develop new product solutions and features, ensure consistent fit, style and color and design functional and durable fabrics. 

We have a long history of product innovation. We have introduced a number of solution-based products, some of which are highlighted in the chart below:

Marketing 

Our marketing strategy is designed to build brand awareness, acquire new customers, enhance customer loyalty and drive sales transactions. We are nationally known for our creative, irreverent and quirky advertising that features our Giant Angry Beaver, Buck Naked Guy and Grab-Happy Grizzly characters to showcase our brand philosophy, humor and innovation. We also feature testimonials in our marketing campaigns, which put our products in context, tying them to the individuals who represent our core customer, who leads a hands-on lifestyle, values a job well-done and is often outdoors for work and hobbies. We believe our customers identify with the inspiring stories of real men and women, recognize our products&#8217; versatility and appreciate the extreme and demanding conditions our products can withstan d. 

We pursue our marketing strategy through multiple forms of media, which gives our products an identity and enhances our brand: 

&#183; 

Television . We advertise on cable and broadcast television networks to build brand awareness for both men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s products and to reach a large, national audience. These advertisements feature our animated characters and are intended to be humorous, irreverent and quirky in order to grab the viewer&#8217;s attention, while highlighting the particularly innovative, solution-based features of our core products and the Duluth Trading name. 

&#183; 

Catalogs . Our catalogs are an important part of our heritage and represent a tangible vehicle for our authentic and humorous storytelling. In fiscal 2015, we published 35 catalog issues and distributed over 52 million catalogs, approximately 23 million of which were mailed to prospective customers. Our catalogs support both sales channels, and we believe serve as an important customer acquisition tool by driving visits to our website and retail stores. 

&#183; 

Digital and Email Marketing . We employ a variety of digital and online advertising strategies. These efforts include display advertising, digital video advertising, search engine marketing and optimization and targeted email, which we send to customers to introduce new products and offer promotions on select merchandise. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Social Media . We have an engaged social media community, which allows us to personally connect with our customers online, and we believe further raises brand awareness. We maintain a social media presence on Facebook, Pinterest, YouTube and Twitter. We also maintain a corporate blog: the &#8220;Whatchamablog.&#8221; 

&#183; 

Radio, Collateral Print and Outdoor Marketing . We use traditional radio and collateral print advertising, such as newspaper inserts and postcards, and billboards in the areas surrounding our retail stores to build brand awareness, drive traffic to our website and stores, highlight certain promotions and events and support new store openings. 

&#183; 

Event Sponsorship . We sponsor both national and local events, including the STIHL TIMBERSPORTS Series, a competition of the world&#8217;s top lumberjack athletes, which is one of our most prominent sponsorships with a national airing on the ABC television network, and the John Beargrease Sled Dog Marathon, the longest sled dog race in the lower 48 states. 

Customer Service 

We are committed to providing outstanding customer service and believe in treating our customers like next-door neighbors. Our retail stores are stocked with a comprehensive assortment of our products and staffed with knowledgeable and well trained sales associates. We stand behind all purchases with our unconditional &#8220;No Bull Guarantee.&#8221; Our call center is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week and is staffed with friendly, knowledgeable representatives dedicated to making every customer experience positive. 

Manufacturing 

We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. Instead, we arrange with third-party vendors for the manufacturing of our merchandise. We have built strong, long-term relationships with our vendors, with our top six suppliers in fiscal 2015 supplying approximately 83% of our total purchases. In fiscal 2015, 54% of our purchases came from our largest supplier, an agent partner in Hong Kong who manages multiple factories across Asia, including Cambodia, China, Indonesia and Vietnam. Approximately 17% of our purchases in fiscal 2015 came from our second largest supplier, which is based in Thailand. We believe sourcing inventory through this agent allows us to leverage the agent&#8217;s purchasing power with multiple factories, as well as transportation and logistics capabilities, allowing our internal team to focus on our core competencies of product development, storytelling and serving customers, rather than factory and mill management or logistics. 

Our sourcing strategy focuses on identifying and employing vendors that provide quality materials and fine craftsmanship that our customers expect of our brand. To ensure that our high standards of quality and timely delivery of merchandise are met, we work closely with our third-party agent partners. All of our products are produced according to our specifications, and we require all of our manufacturers to adhere to strict regulatory compliance and standards of conduct. We seek to ensure the consistent quality by employing Duluth Trading-certified factory auditors to selectively examine pre-production samples, conduct periodic site visits to certain of our vendors&#8217; production facilities and inspect inbound shipments at our distribution centers. 

Distribution Centers 

Our distribution centers are currently located across the United States in order to minimize transit times to our customers. We own and operate a distribution center in Belleville, Wisconsin, which is approximately 115,000 square feet of production and warehouse space. Our Belleville distribution center processes all online and in-store returns, stocks and replenishes products in our retail stores and handles our direct segment distribution needs for the Midwest. In 2014, we opened our first third-party logistics center in Sparks, Nevada for our distribution needs for western states. In September 2015, we opened another third-party logistics center in Hebron, Kentucky for our distribution needs on the east coast and in the south. Orders are generally assigned to the distribution center closest to the customer&#8217;s ship-to location. We believe our current distribution network will allow us to substantially improve delivery times to key customer concentrations in the Eastern and Western United States and is well-positioned to provide sufficient capacity to support our planned continued growth for the foreseeable future. 

Information Technology 

We use technology to provide customer service, business process support and business intelligence across our sales channels. We continually aim to have more efficient supply chain and distribution systems operations. Our Distributed Order Management systems provide us with omnichannel capabilities that have a global view of available-to-promise inventory management and also process direct orders from our retail stores. Our Belleville distribution center implemented a new warehouse management system in July 2015. Our Product Lifecycle Management System, which launched in June 2015, systematically coordinates efforts across our product development teams, allowing these teams to dedicate their time to building and executing so lution-based product introductions. Our Vendor Portal is a web-based system that allows us to interface with key partners. We intend to make key technology investments of approximately $3.0 million to $5.0 million over &#160; 

&#160;

the next 12 to 24 months in a new order management system, asset management system, assortment planning system and e-commerce platform that we believe are needed to support the future growth in our direct and retail segments.
