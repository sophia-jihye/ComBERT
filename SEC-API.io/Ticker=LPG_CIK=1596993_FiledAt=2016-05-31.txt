Overview 

&#160; 

We are a Marshall Islands corporation incorporated in the Marshall Islands on July 1, 2013 and headquartered in the United States. We are focused on owning and operating VLGCs in the LPG shipping industry. Our founding executives have managed vessels in the LPG shipping market since 2002. We currently own and operate a fleet of twenty-two VLGCs, including nineteen new fuel-efficient 84,000 cbm ECO-design VLGCs, or our ECO VLGCs, and three 82,000 cbm VLGCs. The twenty-two VLGCs in our fleet have an aggregate carrying capacity of approximately 1.8 million cbm and an average age of 1.9 years as of May 26, 2016. We provide in-house commercial and technical management services for all of our vessels, including our vessels deployed in the Helios Pool, which may receive commercial management services from Phoenix (described below). 

&#160; 

Sixteen of our ECO VLGCs were constructed at Hyundai Heavy Industries Co., Ltd., or Hyundai, and three of our ECO VLGCs were constructed at Daewoo Shipping and Marine Engineering Ltd, or Daewoo. Our nineteen ECO VLGCs, which incorporate fuel efficiency and emission-reducing technologies and certain custom features, were acquired by us for an aggregate purchase price of $1.4 billion, which was financed with proceeds from a $758 million debt facility that we entered into in March 2015 with a group of banks and financial institutions, or the 2015 Debt Facility, proceeds from equity offerings, and cash generated from operations. These nineteen ECO VLGCs were delivered to us between July 2014 and February 2016, seventeen of which were delivered during calendar year 2015 or later. 

&#160; 

On April 1, 2015, we and Phoenix Tankers Pte. Ltd., or Phoenix, &#160; a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mitsui OSK Lines Ltd., a company not related to us, began operation of Helios LPG Pool LLC, or the Helios Pool, a joint venture owned 50% by us and 50% by Phoenix. We believe that the operation of certain of our VLGCs in this pool will allow us to achieve better market coverage and utilization. Vessels entered into the Helios Pool are commercially managed jointly by Dorian LPG (UK) Ltd., our wholly-owned subsidiary, and Phoenix. The members of the Helios Pool share in the net pool revenues generated by the entire group of vessels participating in the pool, weighted according to certain technical vessel characteristics, and net pool revenues are distributed as variable rate time charter hire to each participant. The vessels entered into the Helios Pool may operate either in the spot market, pursuant to contracts of affreightment, or COAs, or on time charters of two years' duration or less. We and Phoenix have agreed that the Helios Pool will have a right of first refusal to operate each VLGC of our respective fleets not employed on a time charter of more than two years' duration. In March 2016, &#160; the Helios Pool reached an agreement with Oriental Energy Company Ltd., or Oriental Energy, one of the largest propane dehydrogenation plant operators and LPG importers in China to operate eight VLGCs on its behalf. As of May 26, 2016, the Helios Pool operated twenty-four VLGCs, including eighteen of our vessels, four Phoenix vessels, and two Oriental Energy vessels. When fully delivered, the Helios Pool will operate six additional VLGCs for Oriental Energy, some of which will be time chartered-in at a fixed time charter hire rate. In addition, the Helios Pool has entered into a COA with Oriental Energy covering Oriental Energy&#8217;s shipments from the United States Gulf, which gives us exposure to the growing Chinese LPG market.

The LPG Shipping Industry 

&#160; 

International seaborne LPG transportation services are generally provided by two types of operators: LPG distributors and traders and independent shipowner fleets. Traditionally the main trading route in our industry has been the transport of LPG from the Arabian Gulf to Asia. With the emergence of the United States as a major LPG export hub, the U.S. Gulf to Asia has become an important trade route. Vessels are generally operated under time charters, bareboat charters, spot charters, or contracts of affreightment. LPG distributors and traders use their fleets not only to transport their own LPG, but also to transport LPG for third-party charterers in direct competition with independent owners and operators in the tanker charter market. We operate in markets that are highly competitive and based primarily on supply and demand of available vessels. Generally, we compete for charters based upon charter rate, customer relationships, operating expertise, professional reputation and vessel specifications (size, age and condition). We also believe that our in-house technical and commercial management allows us to provide superior customer service and reliability which enhances our relationships with our charterers. Our industry is subject to strict environmental regulation, including emissions regulations, and we believe our modern, ECO-class fleet and our high level of crew training and vessel maintenance make us a preferred provider of VLGC tonnage. 

Our Customers 

&#160; 

Our customers, either directly or through the Helios Pool, include or have included global energy companies such as Exxon Mobil Corp., China International United Petroleum &#38; Chemicals Co., Ltd., Royal Dutch Shell plc and Statoil ASA, commodity traders such as Itochu Corporation and the Vitol Group and importers such as E1 Corp., SK Gas Co. Ltd. and Indian Oil Corporation. See &#8220;Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis&#8212;Overview&#8221; for a discussion of our customers that accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues and &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212;We expect to be dependent on a limited number of customers for a material part of our revenues, and failure of such customers to meet their obligations could cause us to suffer losses or negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows.&#8221; For the year ended March 31, 2016, approximately 70.2% of our revenue was generated through the Helios Pool as net pool revenues&#8212;related parties. See &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212;We and the Helios Pool operate exclusively in the LPG shipping industry. Due to our lack of diversification and the lack of diversification of the Helios Pool, adverse developments in the LPG shipping industry may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.&#8221; 

&#160; 

We intend to pursue a balanced chartering strategy by employing our vessels on a mix of multi-year time charters, some of which may include a profit-sharing component, shorter-term time charters, spot market voyages and COAs. Six of our vessels are currently on fixed time charters, including two vessels on fixed time charter within the Helios Pool. These fixed time charters have an average remaining term of 2.4 years as of May 26, 2016. See &#8220;Our Fleet&#8221; above for more information . 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

LPG carrier capacity is primarily a function of the size of the existing world fleet, the number of newbuildings being delivered and the scrapping of older vessels. According to industry sources, there were 1,377 LPG carriers with an aggregate capacity of about 27.6 million cbm as of April 1, 2016. As of such date, a further 180 LPG carriers with an aggregate carrying capacity of about 8.28 million cbm were on order for delivery by the end of 2018, equivalent to 30% of the existing fleet in capacity terms. In contrast to oil tankers and drybulk carriers, according to industry sources, the number of shipyards with LPG carrier experience is quite limited, and as such, a sudden influx of supply beyond what is already on order before 2017 is unlikely. In the VLGC sector in which we operate, as of April 1, 2016, there were 215 vessels with an aggregate carrying capacity of 17.5 million cbm in the world fleet with 61 vessels on order for delivery by 2018. 

&#160; 

Our largest competitors for VLGC shipping services include BW LPG Limited, or BWLPG, Navigator Holdings Ltd., or NVGS, Avance Gas Holding Ltd., or Avance, Petredec, Astomos Energy Corporation and a number of smaller, closely held vessel owners. According to industry sources, there were approximately 55 owners in the entire worldwide VLGC fleet as of April 1, 2016, with the top ten owners possessing 51% of the total carrying capacity in service. Competition for the transportation of LPG depends on the price, location, size, age, condition and acceptability of the vessel to the charterer. We believe we own and operate the youngest and second largest fleet in the VLGC size segment, 

&#160;

which, in our view, enhances our position relative to that of our competitors. But see &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212;We will face substantial competition in trying to expand relationships with existing customers and obtain new customers.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Seasonality 

&#160; 

Liquefied gases are primarily used for industrial and domestic heating, as a chemical and refinery feedstock, as a transportation fuel and in agriculture. The LPG shipping market is typically stronger in the spring and summer months in anticipation of increased consumption of propane and butane for heating during the winter months. In addition, unpredictable weather patterns in these months tend to disrupt vessel scheduling and the supply of certain commodities. Demand for our vessels therefore may be stronger in our quarters ending June 30 and September 30 and relatively weaker during our quarters ending December 31 and March 31, although 12-month time charter rates tend to smooth these short-term fluctuations. To the extent any of our time charters expire during the relatively weaker fiscal quarters ending December 31 and March 31, it may not be possible to re-charter our vessels at similar rates. As a result, we may have to accept lower rates or experience off-hire time for our vessels, which may adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of March 31, 2016 , we employed 67 persons in our offices in the United States, Greece and the United Kingdom. In addition to our shore-based employees, we had approximately 530 seafaring staff serving on our owned vessels. Seafarers are sourced from seafarer recruitment and placement service agencies and are employed with short-term employment contracts. 

&#160; 

Classification, Inspection and Maintenance 

&#160; 

Every large, commercial seagoing vessel must be "classed" by a classification society. A classification society certifies that a vessel is "in class," signifying that the vessel has been built and maintained in accordance with the rules of the classification society and the vessel's country of registry and the international conventions of which that country is a member. In addition, where surveys are required by international conventions and corresponding laws and ordinances of a flag state, the classification society will undertake them on application or by official order, acting on behalf of the authorities concerned. 

&#160; 

For maintenance of the class certificate, regular and special surveys of hull, machinery, including the electrical plant and any special equipment classed, are required to be performed by the classification society, to ensure continuing compliance. Vessels are drydocked at least once during a five &#8209; year class cycle for inspection of the underwater parts and for repairs related to inspections. Vessels under five years of age can waive drydocking provided the vessel is inspected underwater. If any defects are found, the classification surveyor will issue a "recommendation" which must be rectified by the shipowner within prescribed time limits. The classification society also undertakes on request of the flag state other surveys and checks that are required by the regulations and requirements of that flag state. These surveys are subject to agreements made in each individual case and/or to the regulations of the country concerned. 

&#160; 

Most insurance underwriters make it a condition for insurance coverage that a vessel be certified as "in class" by a classification society, which is a member of the International Association of Classification Societies, or the IACS. In December 2013, the IACS adopted harmonized Common Structure Rules that align with International Maritime Organization, or the IMO, goal standards. Our VLGCs are currently classed with Lloyd's Register, the American Bureau of Shipping, or ABS, or Det Norske Veritas, all members of the IACS . All of the vessels in our fleet have been awarded International Safety Management, or ISM, certification and are currently "in class." 

&#160; 

We also carry out inspections of the ships on a regular basis; both at sea and while the vessels are in port. The results of these inspections are documented in a report containing recommendations for improvements to the overall condition of the vessel, maintenance, safety and crew welfare. Based in part on these evaluations, we create and implement a program of continual maintenance and improvement for our vessels and their systems. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Safety, Management of Ship Operations and Administration 

&#160; 

Safety is our top operational priority. Our vessels are operated in a manner intended to protect the safety and health of the crew, the general public and the environment. We actively manage the risks inherent in our business and are committed to preventing incidents that threaten safety, such as groundings, fires and collisions. We are also committed to reducing emissions and waste generation. We have established key performance indicators to facilitate regular monitoring of our operational performance. We set targets on an annual basis to drive continuous improvement, and we review performance indicators every three months to determine if remedial action is necessary to reach our targets. Our shore staff performs a full range of technical, commercial and business development services for us. This staff also provides administrative support to our operations in finance, accounting and human resources. 

&#160; 

Risk of Loss and Insurance 

&#160; 

The operation of any vessel, including LPG carriers, has inherent risks. These risks include mechanical failure, personal injury, collision, property loss, vessel or cargo loss or damage and business interruption due to political circumstances in foreign countries or hostilities. In addition, there is always an inherent possibility of marine disaster, including explosions, spills and other environmental mishaps, and the liabilities arising from owning and operating vessels in international trade. We believe that our present insurance coverage is adequate to protect us against the accident related risks involved in the conduct of our business and that we maintain appropriate levels of environmental damage and pollution insurance coverage consistent with standard industry practice. However, not all risks can be insured, and there can be no guarantee that any specific claim will be paid, or that we will always be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at reasonable rates. 

&#160; 

We have obtained hull and machinery insurance on all our vessels against marine and war risks, which include the risks of damage to our vessels, salvage or towing costs, and actual or constructive total loss. However, our insurance policies contain deductible amounts for which we are responsible. We have also arranged additional total loss coverage for each vessel. This coverage, which is called hull interest and freight interest coverage, provides us additional coverage in the event of the total loss of a vessel. 

&#160; 

We have also obtained loss of hire insurance to protect us against loss of income in the event one of our vessels cannot be employed due to damage that is covered under the terms of our hull and machinery insurance (marine and war risks). Under our loss of hire policies, our insurer will pay us an agreed daily rate in respect of each VLGC in excess of 180 deductible days for the time that the vessel is out of service as a result of damage, for a maximum of 180 days. 

&#160; 

Protection and indemnity insurance, which covers our third party legal liabilities in connection with our shipping activities, is provided by mutual protection and indemnity associations, or P&#38;I clubs. This insurance includes third party liability and other expenses related to the injury or death of crew members, passengers and other third parties, loss or damage to cargo, claims arising from collisions with other vessels or from contact with jetties or wharves and other damage to other third party property, including pollution arising from oil or other substances, and other related costs, including wreck removal. Subject to the capping discussed below, our coverage, except for pollution, is unlimited. 

&#160; 

Our current protection and indemnity insurance coverage for pollution is $1 billion per vessel per incident. The thirteen P&#38;I clubs that comprise the International Group of Protection and Indemnity Clubs, or the International Group, insure approximately 90% of the world's commercial tonnage and have entered into a pooling agreement to reinsure each association's liabilities. Each P&#38;I club has capped its exposure in this pooling agreement so that the maximum claim covered by the pool and its reinsurance would be approximately $5.45 billion per accident or occurrence. We are a member of three P&#38;I Clubs: The Standard Club Ltd., The United Kingdom Mutual Steamship Assurance Association (Bermuda) Limited and The London Steam &#8209; Ship Owners' Mutual Insurance Association Limited. As a member of these P&#38;I clubs, we are subject to a call for additional premiums based on the clubs' claims record, as well as the claims record of all other members of the P&#38;I clubs comprising the International Group. However, our P&#38;I clubs have reinsured the risk of additional premium calls to limit our additional exposure. This reinsurance is subject to a cap, and there is the risk that the full amount of the additional call would not be covered by this reinsurance. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Environmental and Other Regulation 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

Governmental and international agencies extensively regulate the carriage, handling, storage and regasification of LPG. These regulations include international conventions and national, state and local laws and regulations in the countries where our vessels now or, in the future, will operate or where our vessels are registered. We cannot predict the ultimate cost of complying with these regulations, or the impact that these regulations will have on the resale value or useful lives of our vessels. Various governmental and quasi-governmental agencies require us to obtain permits, licenses and certificates for the operation of our vessels. For the years ending March 31, 2017 and 2018, we estimate that capital expenditures for reducing our environmental emissions would total approximately $0.6 million on two of our VLGCs relating to performance enhancing devices to achieve power savings resulting in lower fuel consumption. 

&#160; 

Although we believe that we are substantially in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and have all permits, licenses and certificates required for our vessels, future non &#8209; compliance or failure to maintain necessary permits or approvals could require us to incur substantial costs or temporarily suspend operation of one or more of our vessels. A variety of governmental and private entities inspect our vessels on both a scheduled and unscheduled basis. These entities, each of which may have unique requirements and each of which conducts frequent inspections, include local port authorities, such as the U.S. Coast Guard, or USCG, harbor master or equivalent, classification societies, flag state, or the administration of the country of registry, charterers, terminal operators and LPG producers. 

&#160; 

International Maritime Organization Regulation of LPG Vessels 

&#160; 

The IMO is the United Nations' agency that provides international regulations governing shipping and international maritime trade, including the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, the International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage, and the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, or the MARPOL. The flag state, as discussed in the United Nations Convention on Law of the Sea, has overall responsibility for the implementation and enforcement of international maritime regulations for all ships granted the right to fly its flag. The "Shipping Industry Guidelines on Flag State Performance" evaluates flag states based on factors such as sufficiency of infrastructure, ratification of international maritime treaties, implementation and enforcement of international maritime regulations, supervision of surveys, casualty investigations, and participation at IMO meetings. Each of our vessels is flagged in the Bahamas. The requirements contained in the International Management Code for the Safe Operation of Ships and Pollution Prevention, or the ISM Code, promulgated by the IMO, govern our operations. Among other requirements, the ISM Code requires shipowners, ship managers and bareboat charterers to develop and maintain an extensive safety management system that includes, among other things, the adoption of policies for safety and environmental protection setting forth instructions and procedures for operating its vessels safely and also describing procedures for responding to emergencies. We are compliant with the requirement to hold a Document of Compliance under the ISM Code for LPG ships (Gas carriers). 

&#160; 

Vessels that transport gas, including LPG carriers, are also subject to regulation under the IMO's International Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Liquefied Gases in Bulk Gas Carrier Code, or the IGC Code. The IGC Code and similar regulations in individual member states, address fire and explosion risk posed by the transport of liquefied gases. Collectively these standards and regulations impose detailed requirements relating to the design and arrangement or cargo tanks, vents, and pipes; construction materials and compatibility; cargo pressure; and temperature control. Compliance with the IGC Code must be evidenced by a Certificate of Fitness for the Carriage of Liquefied Gases of Bulk. Each of our vessels is in compliance with the IGC Code. Non &#8209; compliance with the IGC Code or other applicable IMO regulations may subject a shipowner or a bareboat charterer to increased liability, may lead to decreases in available insurance coverage for affected vessels and may result in the denial of access to, or detention in, some ports. 

&#160; 

The IMO also periodically amends the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea 1974 and its protocol of 1988, otherwise known as SOLAS, and its implementing regulations. SOLAS includes construction, equipment, and procedure requirements to assure the safe operation of commercial vessels. Among other things, SOLAS requires lifeboats and other life &#8209; saving appliances be provided on vessels and mandates the use of the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System, an international radio equipment and watchkeeping standard, afloat and at shore stations. The IMO has also 

&#160;

adopted the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, or STCW. New SOLAS safety requirements relating to lifeboats and safe manning of vessels that were adopted in May 2012 came into effect on January 1, 2014. Flag states that have ratified SOLAS and STCW generally employ the classification societies, which have incorporated SOLAS and STCW requirements into their class rules, to undertake surveys to confirm compliance. 

&#160; 

In the wake of increased worldwide security concerns, after the September 11, 2001 attack in the United States, the IMO amended SOLAS and added the International Ship and Port Facilities Security Code, or ISPS, as a new chapter to that convention. The objective of the ISPS, which came into effect on July 1, 2004, is to detect security threats and take preventive measures against security incidents affecting ships or port facilities. Amendments to SOLAS Chapter VII, made mandatory in 2004, apply to vessels transporting dangerous goods and require those vessels to be in compliance with the International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code, or IMDG Code. We have developed Ship Security Plans, appointed and trained Ship and Office Security Officers and all of our vessels have been certified to meet the ISPS Code requirements. 

&#160; 

SOLAS and other IMO regulations concerning safety, including those relating to treaties on training of shipboard personnel, lifesaving appliances, radio equipment and the global maritime distress and safety system, are applicable to our operations. Non &#8209; compliance with these IMO regulations may subject us to increased liability or penalties, may lead to decreases in available insurance coverage for affected vessels and may result in the denial of access to or detention in some ports. For example, the USCG and European Union, or EU, authorities have indicated that vessels not in compliance with the ISM Code will be prohibited from trading in U.S. and EU ports. 

&#160; 

The MARPOL Convention establishes environmental standards relating to oil leakage or spilling, garbage management, sewage, air emissions, handling and disposal of noxious liquids and the handling of harmful substances carried in bulk, liquid or packaged form. 

&#160; 

The IMO amended Annex I to MARPOL by adding a new regulation relating to oil fuel tank protection that applies to various ships delivered on or after August 1, 2010. It includes requirements for the protected location of the fuel tanks, performance standards for accidental oil fuel outflow, a tank capacity limit and certain other maintenance, inspection and engineering standards. IMO regulations also require owners and operators of vessels to adopt Ship Oil Pollution Emergency Plans. Periodic training and drills for response personnel and for vessels and their crews are required. 

&#160; 

In 2012, the IMO's Marine Environmental Protection Committee, or MEPC, adopted a resolution amending the International Code for the Construction of Equipment of Ships Carrying Dangerous Chemicals in Bulk, or IBC Code. The provisions of the IBC Code are mandatory under MARPOL and SOLAS. These amendments, which entered into force in June 2014, pertain to revised international certificates of fitness for the carriage of dangerous chemicals in bulk and identifying new products that fall under the IBC Code. In May 2014, additional amendments to the IBC Code were adopted that became effective in January 2016. These amendments pertain to the installation of stability instruments and cargo tank purging. Our ECO VLGCs are equipped with stability instruments and cargo tank purging. We may need to make certain financial expenditures to comply with these amendments for the remaining VLGCs. 

&#160; 

The IMO continues to review and introduce new regulations. It is impossible to predict what additional regulations, if any, may be passed by the IMO and what effect, if any, such regulation may have on our operations. 

&#160; 

Air Emissions 

&#160; 

In September 1997, the IMO adopted MARPOL 73/78 Annex VI "Regulations for the prevention of Air Pollution" to MARPOL, or Annex VI, to address air pollution from ships. Annex VI came into force on May 19, 2005. It applies to all ships, fixed and floating drilling rigs and other floating platforms, sets limits on sulfur oxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from ship exhausts, and prohibits deliberate emissions of ozone depleting substances, such as chlorofluoro carbons. "Deliberate emissions" are not limited to times when the ship is at sea; they can for example include discharges occurring in the course of the ship's repair and maintenance. Shipboard incineration (from incinerators installed after January 1, 2000) of certain substances (such as polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs) are also prohibited. Annex VI also includes a global cap on sulfur content of fuel oil and allows for more stringent controls on sulfur emissions in special coastal areas known as Emission Control Areas, or ECAs, designated by the MEPC. Ships weighing more than 400 gross 

&#160;

tons and engaged in international voyages involving countries that have ratified the conventions, or ships flying the flag of those countries, are required to have an International Air Pollution Prevention Certificate, or an IAPP Certificate. Annex VI has been ratified by some but not all IMO member states. Annex VI came into force in the United States on January 8, 2009. All the vessels in our operating fleet have been issued IAPP Certificates. 

&#160; 

Amended Annex VI also establishes new tiers of stringent nitrogen oxide emissions standards for new marine engines, depending on their date of installation. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or the EPA, promulgated equivalent (and in some senses stricter) emissions standards in late 2009. As a result of these designations or similar future designations, we may be required to incur additional operating or other costs. 

&#160; 

On July 1, 2010, amendments to Annex VI that require progressively stricter limitations on sulfur emissions from ships took effect. As of January 1, 2012, fuel used to power ships was not permitted to contain more than 3.5% sulfur. This cap will then decrease progressively until it reaches 0.5% by January 1, 2020, subject to a feasibility review to be completed no later than 2018. However, in ECAs such as the North America ECA fuels cannot contain more than 0.1% sulfur as of January 1, 2015. The Annex VI amendments also establish new tiers of stringent nitrogen oxide emissions standards for new marine engines, depending on their date of installation. Further, the European directive 2005/33/EU, which became effective on January 1, 2010, bans the use of fuel oils containing more than 0.1% sulfur by mass by any merchant vessel while at berth in any EU country. Our vessels have achieved compliance, where necessary, with both the applicable IMO and EU sulfur regulations, by being arranged to burn compliant fuels for the area of their operation. 

&#160; 

Additionally, as discussed above, more stringent emission standards could apply in coastal areas designated as ECAs, such as the United States and Canadian coastal areas designated by the MEPC. U.S. air emissions standards are now equivalent to these amended Annex VI requirements, and once these amendments become effective, we may incur costs to comply with these revised standards. Additional or new conventions, laws and regulations may be adopted that could require the installation of expensive emission control systems. 

&#160; 

Ballast Water Management Convention 

&#160; 

The IMO adopted the International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships' Ballast Water and Sediments, or the BWM Convention, in February 2004. The BWM will not enter into force until 12 months after it has been adopted by 30 states, the combined merchant fleets of which represent not less than 35% of the gross tonnage of the world's merchant shipping tonnage. As of late March 2016, 49 states had adopted the BWM Convention, coming close to the 35% threshold. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the BWM Convention has not been ratified. Proposals regarding implementation have recently been submitted to the IMO, but we cannot predict the ultimate timing for ratification. Many of the implementation dates originally written into the BWM Convention have already passed, so on December 4, 2013, the IMO Assembly has passed a resolution revising the dates of applicability of the requirements of the BWM Convention so that they are triggered by the entry into force dated, and not the dates originally in the BWM Convention. This in effect makes all vessels constructed before the entry into force date &#8220;existing vessels,&#8221; and delayed the date for installation of ballast water management systems on vessels until the first renewal survey following entry into force of the convention. Furthermore, in October 2014 the MEPC met and adopted additional resolutions concerning the BWM Convention&#8217;s implementation. Upon entry into force of the BWM Convention, mid-ocean ballast exchange would become mandatory. When mid-ocean ballast exchange or ballast water treatment requirements become mandatory, the cost of compliance could increase for ocean carriers, and the costs of ballast water treatment, may be material. However, many countries already regulate the discharge of ballast water carried by vessels from country to country to prevent the introduction of invasive and harmful species via such discharges. The United States, for example, requires vessels entering its waters from another country to conduct mid-ocean ballast exchange, or undertake some alternate measure, and to comply with certain reporting requirements. Although we do not believe the costs of compliance with mandatory mid-ocean ballast exchange would be material, it is difficult to predict the overall impact of such a requirement on our operations . 

&#160; 

Bunkers Convention / Civil Liability Convention State Certificates 

&#160; 

The International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damaged of 2001, or the Bunker Convention, entered into force on November 21, 2008. The Bunker Convention provides a liability, compensation and compulsory insurance system for the victims of oil pollution damage caused by spills of bunker oil. The Bunker 

&#160;

Convention requires the ship owner liable to pay compensation for pollution damage (including the cost of preventive measures) caused in the territory, including the territorial sea of a State Party, as well as its economic zone or equivalent area. Registered owners of any sea going vessel and seaborne craft over 1,000 gross tonnage, of any type whatsoever, and registered in a State Party, or entering or leaving a port in the territory of a State Party, will be required to maintain insurance which meets the requirements of the Bunker Convention, an amount equal to the limits of liability under the applicable national or international limitation regime (but not exceeding the amount calculated in accordance with the Bunker Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims of 1976, as amended, or the LLMC) and to obtain a certificate issued by a State Party attesting that such insurance is in force. The State issued certificate must be carried on board at all times. With respect to non-ratifying states, liability for spills or releases of bunker fuel is determined by the national or other domestic laws in the jurisdiction where the events or damage occur. 

&#160; 

Many countries have ratified and follow the liability plan adopted by the IMO and set out in the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage of 1969, as amended in 2000, or CLC. Under this convention and depending on whether the country in which the damage results is a party to the 1992 Protocol to the CLC, a vessel's registered owner is strictly liable for pollution damage caused in the territorial waters of a contracting state by discharge of persistent oil, subject to certain complete defenses. The limited liability protections are forfeited under the CLC where the spill is caused by the owner's personal fault and under the 1992 Protocol where the spill is caused by the owner's personal act or omission or by intentional or reckless conduct. Vessels trading to states that are parties to these conventions must provide evidence of insurance covering the liability of the owner. 

&#160; 

In jurisdictions such as the United States where the CLC or the Bunkers Convention has not been adopted, various legislative schemes or common law govern, and liability is imposed either on the basis of fault or on a strict-liability basis. 

&#160; 

P&#38;I Clubs in the International Group issue the required Bunkers Convention "Blue Cards" to enable signatory states to issue certificates. All of our vessels are in possession of a CLC State &#8209; issued certificate attesting that the required insurance coverage is in force. 

&#160; 

Anti &#8209; Fouling Requirements 

&#160; 

In 2001, the IMO adopted the International Convention on the Control of Harmful Anti &#8209; fouling Systems on Ships, or the Anti &#8209; fouling Convention. The Anti &#8209; fouling Convention, which entered into force on September 17, 2008, prohibits the use of organotin compound coatings to prevent the attachment of mollusks and other sea life to the hulls of vessels. Vessels of over 400 gross tons engaged in international voyages must obtain an International Anti &#8209; fouling System Certificate, or AFS, and undergo a survey before the vessel is put into service or when the antifouling systems are altered or replaced. We have obtained AFSs for all of our vessels, which are subject to the Anti &#8209; fouling Convention, and do not believe that maintaining such certificates will have an adverse financial impact on the operation of our vessels. 

&#160; 

United States Environmental Regulation of LPG Vessels 

&#160; 

Our vessels operating in U.S. waters now, or in the future, are or will be subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment. In some cases, these laws and regulations require us to obtain governmental permits and authorizations before we may conduct certain activities. These environmental laws and regulations may impose substantial penalties for noncompliance and substantial liabilities for pollution. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties. As with the industry generally, our operations will entail risks in these areas, and compliance with these laws and regulations, which may be subject to frequent revisions and reinterpretation, increases our overall cost of business. 

&#160; 

Oil Pollution Act and Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act 

&#160; 

The U.S. Oil Pollution Act of 1990, or OPA90, established an extensive regulatory and liability regime for environmental protection and cleanup of oil spills. OPA90 affects all owners and operators whose vessels trade with the United States or its territories or possessions, or whose vessels operate in the waters of the United States, which include the U.S. territorial waters and the two hundred nautical mile exclusive economic zone of the United States. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, or CERCLA, applies to the discharge of 

&#160;

hazardous substances whether on land or at sea. While OPA90 and CERCLA would not apply to the discharge of LPG, they may affect us because we carry oil as fuel and lubricants for our engines, and the discharge of these substances could cause an environmental hazard. Under OPA90, vessel operators, including vessel owners, managers and bareboat or "demise" charterers, are "responsible parties" who are all liable regardless of fault, individually and as a group, for all containment and clean &#8209; up costs and other damages arising from oil spills from their vessels. These "responsible parties" would not be liable if the spill results solely from the act or omission of a third party, an act of God or an act of war. The other damages aside from clean &#8209; up and containment costs are defined broadly to include: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

natural resource damages and related assessment costs; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

real and personal property damages; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

net loss of taxes, royalties, rents, profits or earnings capacity; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

lost profits or impairment of earning capacity due to injury, destruction or loss of real or personal property or natural resources; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

net cost of public services necessitated by a spill response, such as protection from fire, safety or health hazards; and 

&#160; 

&#183; 

loss of subsistence use of natural resources. 

&#160; 

Effective December 21, 2015, the USCG adjusted the limits of OPA90 liability to the greater of $2,200 per gross ton or $18,796,800 for any double &#8209; hull tanker that is over 3,000 gross tons (subject to possible adjustment for inflation). These limits of liability do not apply, however, where the incident is caused by violation of applicable U.S. federal safety, construction or operating regulations by a responsible party (or its agent, employee or a person acting pursuant to a contractual relationship), or a responsible party&#8217;s gross negligence or willful misconduct. These limits likewise do not apply if the responsible party fails or refuses to report the incident or to cooperate and assist in connection with the substance removal activities. These limits are subject to possible adjustment for inflation. OPA90 specifically permits individual states to impose their own liability regimes with regard to oil pollution incidents occurring within their boundaries, and some states have enacted legislation providing for unlimited liability for discharge of pollutants within their waters. In some cases, states, which have enacted their own legislation, have not yet issued implementing regulations defining shipowners' responsibilities under these laws. 

&#160; 

CERCLA, which also applies to owners and operators of vessels, contains a similar liability regime and provides for cleanup, removal and natural resource damages for releases of "hazardous substances." Liability under CERCLA is limited to the greater of $300 per gross ton or $0.5 million for each release from vessels not carrying hazardous substances, cargo or residue, and $300 per gross ton or $5 million for each release from vessels carrying hazardous substances, cargo or residue. As with OPA90, these limits of liability do not apply where the incident is caused by violation of applicable U.S. federal safety, construction or operating regulations, or by the responsible party's gross negligence or willful misconduct or if the responsible party fails or refuses to report the incident or to cooperate and assist in connection with the substance removal activities. OPA90 and CERCLA each preserve the right to recover damages under existing law, including maritime tort law. 

&#160; 

OPA90 requires owners and operators of vessels to establish and maintain with the USCG evidence of financial responsibility sufficient to meet the limit of their potential strict liability under OPA90/CERCLA. Under the regulations, evidence of financial responsibility may be demonstrated by insurance, surety bond, self &#8209; insurance or guaranty. Under OPA90 regulations, an owner or operator of more than one vessel is required to demonstrate evidence of financial responsibility for the entire fleet in an amount equal only to the financial responsibility requirement of the vessel having the greatest maximum liability under OPA90/CERCLA. Each of our shipowning subsidiaries that has vessels trading in U.S. waters has applied for, and obtained from the USCG National Pollution Funds Center, three &#8209; year certificates of financial responsibility, supported by guarantees which we purchased from an insurance based provider. We believe that 

&#160;

we will be able to continue to obtain the requisite guarantees and that we will continue to be granted certificates of financial responsibility from the USCG for each of our vessels that is required to have one. 

&#160; 

In response to the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill, a number of bills that could potentially increase or even eliminate the limits of liability under OPA90 have been introduced in the U.S. Congress. In April 2015, it was announced that new regulations are expected to be imposed in the United States regarding offshore oil and gas drilling. In December 2015, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement announced a new pilot inspection program for offshore facilities. Compliance with any new requirements of OPA90 may substantially impact our cost of operations or require us to incur additional expenses to comply with any new regulatory initiatives or statutes. Compliance with any new requirements of OPA90 may substantially impact our cost of operations or require us to incur additional expenses to comply with any new regulatory initiatives or statutes. Additional legislation, regulation, or other requirements applicable to the operation of our vessels that may be implemented in the future as could adversely affect our business and ability to make distributions to our shareholders. 

&#160; 

Clean Water Act 

&#160; 

The United States Clean Water Act, or CWA, prohibits the discharge of oil or hazardous substances in United States navigable waters unless authorized by a permit or exemption, and imposes strict liability in the form of penalties for unauthorized discharges. The CWA also imposes substantial liability for the costs of removal, remediation and damages and complements the remedies available under OPA90 and CERCLA. In additional, many U.S. states that border a navigable waterway have enacted environmental pollution laws that impose strict liability on a person for removal costs and damages resulting from a discharge of oil or a release of a hazardous substance. These laws may be more stringent than U.S. federal law. The EPA recently proposed revisions to the CWA. 

&#160; 

The EPA and the USCG have enacted rules relating to ballast water discharge, compliance with which requires the installation of equipment on our vessels to treat ballast water before it is discharged in or the implementation of other port facility disposal arrangements or procedures at potentially substantial costs, and/or otherwise restrict our vessels from entering U.S. waters. 

&#160; 

The EPA requires a permit regulating ballast water discharges and other discharges incidental to the normal operation of certain vessels within U.S. water under the Vessel General Permit for Discharges Incidental to the Normal Operation of Vessels, or VGP. For a new vessel delivered to an owner or operator after September 19, 2009, to be covered by the VGP, the owner must submit a Notice of Intent, or NOI, at least 30 days before the vessel operates in U.S. waters. On March 28, 2013, the EPA re-issued the VGP for another 5 years. This VGP took effect on December 19, 2013. The VGP focuses on authorizing discharges incidental to operations of commercial vessels and the new VGP contains numeric ballast water discharge limits for most vessels to reduce the risk of invasive species in U.S. waters, more stringent requirements for gas scrubbers and the use of environmentally acceptable lubricants. 

&#160; 

The USCG regulations adopted under the U.S. National Invasive Species Act, or NISA, also impose mandatory ballast water management practices for all vessels equipped with ballast water tanks entering or operating in U.S. waters, which require the installation of equipment to treat ballast water before it is discharged in U.S. waters or, in the alternative, the implementation of other port facility disposal arrangements or procedures. Vessels not complying with these regulations are restricted from entering U.S. waters. The USCG must approve any technology before it is placed on a vessel but has not yet approved the technology necessary for vessels to meet the foregoing standards. 

&#160; 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, as of January 1, 2014, vessels are technically subject to the phasing-in of these standards. As a result, the USCG has provided waivers to vessels which cannot install the as-yet unapproved technology. The EPA, on the other hand, has taken a different approach to enforcing ballast discharge standards under the VGP. On December 27, 2013, the EPA issued an enforcement response policy in connection with the new VGP in which the EPA indicated that it would take into account the reasons why vessels do not have the requisite technology installed, but will not grant any waivers. 

&#160; 

It should also be noted that in October 2015, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals issued a ruling that directed the EPA to redraft the sections of the 2013 VGP that address ballast water. However, the Second Circuit stated that 2013 VGP 

&#160;

will remains in effect until the EPA issues a new VGP. It presently remains unclear how the ballast water requirements set forth by the EPA, the USCG, and IMO BWM Convention, some of which are in effect and some which are pending, will co-exist. 

&#160; 

Compliance with the VGP could require the installation of equipment on our vessel to treat ballast water before it is discharged or the implementation of other disposal arrangements, and/or otherwise restrict our vessel from entering United States waters. In addition, certain states have enacted more stringent discharge standards as conditions to their required certification of the VGP. We submit NOIs for our vessel where required and do not believe that the costs associated with obtaining and complying with the VGP have a material impact on our operations. 

&#160; 

Clean Air Act 

&#160; 

The U.S. Clean Air Act of 1970, as amended, or the CAA, requires the EPA to promulgate standards applicable to emissions of volatile organic compounds and other air contaminants. Our vessels are subject to vapor control and recovery requirements for certain cargoes when loading, unloading, ballasting, cleaning and conducting other operations in regulated port areas and emission standards for so &#8209; called "Category 3" marine diesel engines operating in U.S. waters. The marine diesel engine emission standards are currently limited to new engines beginning with the 2004 model year. On April 30, 2010, the EPA promulgated final emission standards for Category 3 marine diesel engines equivalent to those adopted in the amendments to Annex VI. The emission standards apply in two stages: near &#8209; term standards for newly &#8209; built engines went into effect from 2011, and long &#8209; term standards requiring an 80% reduction in nitrogen dioxides, or NOx, that went into effect on January 1, 2016. We have incurred costs to install control equipment on our vessels to comply with these standards. 

&#160; 

European Union 

&#160; 

The EU has also adopted legislation that would: (1) ban manifestly sub &#8209; standard vessels (defined as those over 15 years old that have been detained by port authorities at least twice in a six month period) from European waters and require port states to inspect vessels posing a high risk to maritime safety or the marine environment; and (2) provide the EU with greater authority and control over classification societies, including the ability to seek to suspend or revoke the authority of negligent societies. 

&#160; 

The EU has implemented regulations requiring vessels to use reduced sulfur content fuel for their main and auxiliary engines. The EU Directive 2005/EC/33 (amending Directive 1999/32/EC) introduced requirements parallel to those in Annex VI relating to the sulfur content of marine fuels. In addition, the EU imposed a 0.1% maximum sulfur requirement for fuel used by ships at berth in EU ports, effective January 1, 2010. 

&#160; 

In 2009, the EU amended a directive on ship &#8209; source pollution imposing criminal sanctions for intentional, reckless or seriously negligent illicit ship-source discharges of polluting substances by ships including minor discharges and the discharges, individually or in the aggregate, result in deteriorations or the quality of water. Aiding and abetting the discharge of a polluting substance may also lead to criminal penalties. The directive could result in criminal liability for pollution from vessels in waters of European countries that adopt implementing legislation. Criminal liability for pollution may result in substantial penalties or fines and increased civil liability claims. We cannot predict what regulations, if any, may be adopted by the EU or any other country or authority. 

&#160; 

Regulation of Greenhouse Gas Emissions 

&#160; 

In February 2005, the Kyoto Protocol entered into force. Pursuant to the Kyoto Protocol, adopting countries are required to implement national programs to reduce emissions of certain gases, generally referred to as greenhouse gases, which are suspected of contributing to global warming. The 2015 United Nations Convention on Climate Change Conference in Paris did not result in an agreement that directly limited greenhouse gas emissions from ships. 

&#160; 

Currently, the emissions of greenhouse gases from ships involved in international transport are not subject to the Kyoto Protocol. In December 2009, more than 27 nations, including the United States and China, signed the Copenhagen Accord, which includes a non &#8209; binding commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, in December 2011, 

&#160;

the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention on Climate Change adopted the Durban Platform which calls for a process to develop binding emissions limitations on both developed and developing countries under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change applicable to all Parties. In April 2015, the European Parliament approved EU draft rules, which will require annual CO2 emission monitoring and reporting from ship owners who use EU ports. These rules are expected to be effective in 2018 and apply to ships over 5,000gt. For 2020, the EU made a unilateral commitment to reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions from its member states by 20% of 1990 levels. The EU also committed to reduce its emissions by 20% under the Kyoto Protocol's second period, from 2013 to 2020. 

&#160; 

As of January 1, 2013, all ships must comply with mandatory requirements adopted by MEPC in July 2011 in part to address greenhouse gas emissions. The amendments to Annex VI Regulations for the prevention of air pollution from ships add a new Chapter 4 to Annex VI on Regulations on energy efficiency requiring new ships to meet the Energy Efficiency Design Index, or EEDI, and all ships to develop and implement a Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan, or SEEMP. Other amendments to Annex VI add new definitions and requirements for survey and certification, including the format for the International Energy Efficiency Certificate. The regulations apply to all ships of 400 gross tonnage and above. These new rules will likely affect the operations of vessels that are registered in countries that are signatories to Annex VI or vessels that call upon ports located within such countries. The implementation of the EEDI and SEEMP standards could cause us to incur additional compliance costs. MEPC is also considering market &#8209; based mechanisms to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from ships. It is impossible to predict the likelihood that such a standard might be adopted or its potential impact on our operations at this time. 

&#160; 

In the United States, the EPA has issued a final finding that greenhouse gases threaten public health and safety, and has promulgated regulations that regulate the emission of greenhouse gases from certain mobile sources and has proposed regulations to limit greenhouse gases from large stationary sources. The EPA enforces both the CAA and the international standards found in Annex VI concerning marine diesel emissions and the sulfur content found in marine fuel. Any climate control legislation or other regulatory initiatives adopted by the IMO, the EU, the U.S., or other countries where we operate, or any treaty adopted at the international level to succeed the Kyoto Protocol, that restrict emissions of greenhouse gases could require us to make significant financial expenditures, including capital expenditures or operational changes to upgrade our vessels, that we cannot predict with certainty at this time. In addition, even without such regulation, our business may be indirectly affected to the extent that climate change results in sea level changes or more intense weather events. 

&#160; 

Vessel Security Regulations 

&#160; 

Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, there have been a variety of initiatives intended to enhance vessel security. On November 25, 2002, the Maritime Transportation Act of 2002, or MTSA, came into effect. To implement certain portions of the MTSA, in July 2003, the USCG issued regulations requiring the implementation of certain security requirements aboard vessels operating in waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. The regulations also impose requirements on certain ports and facilities, some of which are regulated by the EPA. Similarly, in December 2002, amendments to SOLAS created a new chapter of the convention dealing specifically with maritime security. The new chapter XI-2 became effective in July 2004 and imposes various detailed security obligations on vessels and port authorities, most of which are contained in the ISPS Code. The ISPS Code is designed to protect ports and international shipping against terrorism. After July 1, 2004, to trade internationally, a vessel must attain an International Ship Security Certificate, or ISSC, from a recognized security organization approved by the vessel's flag state. Among the various requirements are: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

on &#8209; board installation of automatic identification systems to provide a means for the automatic transmission of safety &#8209; related information from among similarly equipped ships and shore stations, including information on a ship's identity, position, course, speed and navigational status; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

on &#8209; board installation of ship security alert systems, which do not sound on the vessel but only alert the authorities on shore; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

the development of vessel security plans; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#183; 

ship identification number to be permanently marked on a vessel's hull; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

a continuous synopsis record kept onboard showing a vessel's history including, the name of the ship and of the state whose flag the ship is entitled to fly, the date on which the ship was registered with that state, the ship's identification number, the port at which the ship is registered and the name of the registered owner(s) and their registered address; and 

&#160; 

&#183; 

compliance with flag state security certification requirements. 

&#160; 

The USCG regulations, intended to align with international maritime security standards, exempt non &#8209; U.S. vessels from obtaining USCG &#8209; approved MTSA vessel security plans provided such vessels have on board an ISSC that attests to the vessel's compliance with SOLAS security requirements and the ISPS Code. 

&#160; 

We have developed security plans, appointed and trained Ship and Company Security Officers and each of our vessels in our fleet complies with the requirements of the ISPS Code, SOLAS and the MTSA. 

&#160; 

Other Regulation 

&#160; 

In 1996, the International Convention on Liability and Compensation for Damages in Connection with the Carriage of Hazardous and Noxious Substances by Sea, or HNS, was adopted and subsequently amended by the 2010 Protocol, or the 2010 HNS Convention. Our LPG vessels may also become subject to the HNS Convention, if it is entered into force. The HNS Convention creates a regime of liability and compensation for damage from HNS, including liquefied gases. The HNS Convention introduces strict liability for the shipowner and covers pollution damage as well as the risks of fire and explosion, including loss of life or personal injury and damage to property. The 2010 HNS Convention sets up a two &#8209; tier system of compensation composed of compulsory insurance taken out by shipowners and an HNS Fund which comes into play when the insurance is insufficient to satisfy a claim or does not cover the incident. Under the 2010 HNS Convention, if damage is caused by bulk HNS, claims for compensation will first be sought from the shipowner up to a maximum of 100 million Special Drawing Rights, or SDR. If the damage is caused by packaged HNS or by both bulk and packaged HNS, the maximum liability is 115 million SDR. Once the limit is reached, compensation will be paid from the HNS Fund up to a maximum of 250 million SDR. The 2010 HNS Convention has not come into effect. It will come into force eighteen months after the date on which certain consent and administrative requirements are satisfied. While a majority of the necessary number of states has indicated their consent to be bound by the 2010 HNS Convention, the required minimum has not been met. We cannot estimate the costs that may be needed to comply with any such requirements that may be adopted with any certainty at this time .

Taxation 

&#160; 

The following is a discussion of the material Marshall Islands and United States federal income tax considerations relevant to an investment decision by a United States Holder and a Non &#8209; United States Holder, each as defined below, with respect to the common shares. This discussion does not purport to deal with the tax consequences of owning our common shares to all categories of investors, some of which, such as financial institutions, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, tax &#8209; exempt organizations, insurance companies, persons holding our common stock as part of a hedging, integrated, conversion or constructive sale transaction or a straddle, traders in securities that have elected the mark &#8209; to &#8209; market method of accounting for their securities, persons liable for alternative minimum tax, persons who are investors in partnerships or other pass &#8209; through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes, dealers in securities or currencies, United States Holders whose functional currency is not the United States dollar and investors that own, actually or under applicable constructive ownership rules, 10% or more of our shares of common stock, may be subject to special rules. This discussion deals only with holders who purchase and hold the common shares as a capital asset. You are encouraged to consult your own tax advisors concerning the overall tax consequences arising in your own particular situation under United States federal, state, local or non &#8209; United States law of the ownership of common shares. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Marshall Islands Tax Considerations 

&#160; 

In the opinion of Seward &#38; Kissel LLP, our United States counsel, the following are the material Marshall Islands tax consequences of our activities to us and of our common shares to our shareholders. We are incorporated in the Marshall Islands. Under current Marshall Islands law, we are not subject to tax on income or capital gains, and no Marshall Islands withholding tax will be imposed upon payments of dividends by us to our shareholders as there is no reciprocal tax treaty between the Marshall Islands and the United States. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

United States Federal Income Tax Considerations 

&#160; 

In the opinion of Seward &#38; Kissel LLP, the following are the material United States federal income tax consequences to us of our activities and to United States Holders and Non &#8209; United States Holders, each as defined below, of the common shares. The following discussion of United States federal income tax matters is based on the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or the Code, judicial decisions, administrative pronouncements, and existing and proposed regulations issued by the United States Department of the Treasury, or the Treasury Regulations, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. The discussion below is based, in part, on the description of our business as described in this report and assumes that we conduct our business as described herein. 

&#160; 

United States Federal Income Taxation of Operating Income: In General 

&#160; 

We anticipate that we will earn substantially all our income from the hiring of vessels for use on a time or spot charter basis, including through the Helios Pool, and from the performance of services directly related to those uses, all of which we refer to as "shipping income." 

&#160; 

Unless we qualify for an exemption from United States federal income taxation under the rules of Section 883 of the Code, or Section 883, as discussed below, a foreign corporation such as the Company will be subject to United States federal income taxation on its "shipping income" that is treated as derived from sources within the United States, to which we refer as "United States source shipping income." For United States federal income tax purposes, "United States source shipping income" includes 50% of shipping income that is attributable to transportation that begins or ends, but that does not both begin and end, in the United States. 

&#160; 

Shipping income attributable to transportation exclusively between non &#8209; United States ports will be considered to be 100% derived from sources entirely outside the United States. Shipping income derived from sources outside the United States will not be subject to any United States federal income tax. 

&#160; 

Shipping income attributable to transportation exclusively between United States ports is considered to be 100% derived from United States sources. However, we are not permitted by United States law to engage in the transportation of cargoes that produces 100% United States source shipping income. 

&#160; 

Unless we qualify for the exemption from tax under Section 883, our gross United States source shipping income would be subject to a 4% tax imposed without allowance for deductions as described below. 

&#160; 

Exemption of Operating Income from United States Federal Income Taxation 

&#160; 

Under Section 883 and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, a foreign corporation will be exempt from United States federal income taxation of its United States source shipping income if: 

&#160; 

1) 

it is organized in a "qualified foreign country" which is one that grants an "equivalent exemption" from tax to corporations organized in the United States in respect of each category of shipping income for which exemption is being claimed under Section 883; and 

&#160; 

&#160;

2) 

one of the following tests is met: 

&#160; 

A) 

more than 50% of the value of its shares is beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by "qualified shareholders," which as defined includes individuals who are "residents" of a qualified foreign country, to which we refer as the "50% Ownership Test"; or 

&#160; 

B) 

its shares are "primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market" in a qualified foreign country or in the United States, to which we refer as the "Publicly &#8209; Traded Test." 

&#160; 

The Republic of The Marshall Islands, the jurisdiction where we and our ship &#8209; owning subsidiaries are incorporated, has been officially recognized by the United States Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS, as a qualified foreign country that grants the requisite "equivalent exemption" from tax in respect of each category of shipping income we earn and currently expect to earn in the future. Therefore, we will be exempt from United States federal income taxation with respect to our United States source shipping income if we satisfy either the 50% Ownership Test or the Publicly &#8209; Traded Test. 

&#160; 

We believe that we satisfy the Publicly &#8209; Traded Test, a factual determination made on an annual basis , with respect to our taxable year ended March 31, 2016, and we expect to continue to do so for our subsequent taxable years, and we intend to take this position for U.S. federal income tax reporting purposes. We do not currently anticipate circumstances under which we would be able to satisfy the 50% Ownership Test. 

&#160; 

Publicly &#8209; Traded Test 

&#160; 

The Treasury Regulations under Section 883 provide, in pertinent part, that shares of a foreign corporation will be considered to be "primarily traded" on an established securities market in a country if the number of shares of each class of stock that are traded during any taxable year on all established securities markets in that country exceeds the number of shares in each such class that are traded during that year on established securities markets in any other single country. The Company's common shares, which constitute its sole class of issued and outstanding stock is "primarily traded" on the New York Stock Exchange, or the NYSE, an established securities market for these purposes. 

&#160; 

Under the Treasury Regulations, our common shares will be considered to be "regularly traded" on an established securities market if one or more classes of our shares representing more than 50% of our outstanding stock, by both total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote and total value, are listed on such market, to which we refer as the "listing threshold." Since all of our common shares are listed on the NYSE, we expect to satisfy the listing threshold. 

&#160; 

The Treasury Regulations also require that with respect to each class of stock relied upon to meet the listing threshold, (i) such class of stock traded on the market, other than in minimal quantities, on at least 60 days during the taxable year or one &#8209; sixth of the days in a short taxable year, which we refer to as the "trading frequency test"; and (ii) the aggregate number of shares of such class of stock traded on such market during the taxable year must be at least 10% of the average number of shares of such class of stock outstanding during such year or as appropriately adjusted in the case of a short taxable year, which we refer to as the "trading volume" test. We anticipate that we will satisfy the trading frequency and trading volume tests. Even if this were not the case, the Treasury Regulations provide that the trading frequency and trading volume tests will be deemed satisfied if, as is expected to be the case with our common shares, such class of stock is traded on an established securities market in the United States and such shares are regularly quoted by dealers making a market in such shares. 

&#160; 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Treasury Regulations provide, in pertinent part, that a class of shares will not be considered to be "regularly traded" on an established securities market for any taxable year in which 50% or more of the vote and value of the outstanding shares of such class are owned on more than half the days during the taxable year by persons who each own 5% or more of the vote and value of such class of outstanding stock, to which we refer as the "5% Override Rule." 

&#160; 

For purposes of being able to determine the persons who actually or constructively own 5% or more of the vote and value of our common shares, or "5% Shareholders," the Treasury Regulations permit us to rely on those persons that 

&#160;

are identified on Schedule 13G and Schedule 13D filings with the Commission, as owning 5% or more of our common shares. The Treasury Regulations further provide that an investment company which is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, will not be treated as a 5% Shareholder for such purposes. 

&#160; 

In the event the 5% Override Rule is triggered, the Treasury Regulations provide that the 5% Override Rule will nevertheless not apply if we can establish that within the group of 5% Shareholders, qualified shareholders (as defined for purposes of Section 883) own sufficient number of shares to preclude non &#8209; qualified shareholders in such group from owning 50% or more of our common shares for more than half the number of days during the taxable year. 

&#160; 

We believe that we satisfy the Publicly &#8209; Traded Test and will not be subject to the 5% Override Rule for taxable year ending March 31, 2016 and we also expect to continue to do so for our subsequent taxable years. However, there are factual circumstances beyond our control that could cause us to lose the benefit of the Section 883 exemption. For example, we may no longer qualify for Section 883 exemption for a particular taxable year if 5% Shareholders were to own, in the aggregate, 50% or more of our outstanding common shares on more than half the days of the taxable year, unless we could establish that within the group of 5% Shareholders, qualified shareholders own sufficient number of our shares to preclude the non-qualified shareholders in such group from owning 50% or more of our common shares for more than half the number of days during the taxable year. Under the Treasury Regulations, we would have to satisfy certain substantiation requirements regarding the identity of our shareholders. These requirements are onerous and there is no assurance that we would be able to satisfy them. Given the factual nature of the issues involved, we can give no assurances in regards of our or our subsidiaries' qualification for the Section 883 exemption. 

&#160; 

Taxation in Absence of Section 883 Exemption 

&#160; 

If the benefits of Section 883 are unavailable, our United States source shipping income would be subject to a 4% tax imposed by Section 887 of the Code on a gross basis, without the benefit of deductions, or the "4% gross basis tax regime," to the extent that such income is not considered to be "effectively connected" with the conduct of a United States trade or business, as described below. Since under the sourcing rules described above, no more than 50% of our shipping income would be treated as being United States source shipping income, the maximum effective rate of United States federal income tax on our shipping income would never exceed 2% under the 4% gross basis tax regime. 

&#160; 

To the extent our United States source shipping income is considered to be "effectively connected" with the conduct of a United States trade or business, as described below, any such "effectively connected" United States source shipping income, net of applicable deductions, would be subject to United States federal income tax, currently imposed at rates of up to 35%. In addition, we would generally be subject to the 30% "branch profits" tax on earnings effectively connected with the conduct of such trade or business, as determined after allowance for certain adjustments, and on certain interest paid or deemed paid attributable to the conduct of our United States trade or business. 

&#160; 

Our United States source shipping income would be considered "effectively connected" with the conduct of a United States trade or business only if: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

we have, or are considered to have, a fixed place of business in the United States involved in the earning of United States source shipping income; and 

&#160; 

&#183; 

substantially all of our United States source shipping income is attributable to regularly scheduled transportation, such as the operation of a vessel that follows a published schedule with repeated sailings at regular intervals between the same points for voyages that begin or end in the United States. 

&#160; 

We do not intend to have, or permit circumstances that would result in having, any vessel sailing to or from the United States on a regularly scheduled basis. Based on the foregoing and on the expected mode of our shipping operations and other activities, it is anticipated that none of our United States source shipping income will be "effectively connected" with the conduct of a United States trade or business. 

&#160; 

&#160;

United States Taxation of Gain on Sale of Vessels 

&#160; 

Regardless of whether we qualify for exemption under Section 883, we will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to gain realized on a sale of a vessel, provided the sale is considered to occur outside of the United States under U.S. federal income tax principles. In general, a sale of a vessel will be considered to occur outside of the United States for this purpose if title to the vessel, and risk of loss with respect to the vessel, pass to the buyer outside of the United States. It is expected that any sale of a vessel by us will be considered to occur outside of the United States. 

&#160; 

United States Federal Income Taxation of United States Holders 

&#160; 

As used herein, the term "United States Holder" means a holder that for U.S. federal income tax purposes is a beneficial owner of common shares and is an individual United States citizen or resident, a United States corporation or other United States entity taxable as a corporation, an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source, or a trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary jurisdiction over the administration of the trust and one or more United States persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust. 

&#160; 

If a partnership holds the common shares, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and upon the activities of the partnership. If you are a partner in a partnership holding the common shares, you are encouraged to consult your tax advisor. 

&#160; 

Distributions 

&#160; 

Subject to the discussion of passive foreign investment companies below, any distributions made by us with respect to our common shares to a United States Holder will generally constitute dividends to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under United States federal income tax principles. Distributions in excess of such earnings and profits will be treated first as a nontaxable return of capital to the extent of the United States Holder's tax basis in its common shares and thereafter as capital gain. Because we are not a United States corporation, United States Holders that are corporations will not be entitled to claim a dividends received deduction with respect to any distributions they receive from us. Dividends paid with respect to our common shares will generally be treated as foreign source dividend income and will generally constitute "passive category income" for purposes of computing allowable foreign tax credits for United States foreign tax credit purposes. 

&#160; 

Dividends paid on our common shares to certain non &#8209; corporate United States Holders will generally be treated as "qualified dividend income" that is taxable to such United States Holders at preferential tax rates provided that (1) the common shares are readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States (such as the NYSE, on which our common shares will be traded), (2) the shareholder has owned the common stock for more than 60 days in the 121 &#8209; day period beginning 60 days before the date on which the common stock becomes ex &#8209; dividend, and (3) we are not a passive foreign investment company for the taxable year during which the dividend is paid or the immediately preceding taxable year. 

&#160; 

There is no assurance that any dividends paid on our common shares will be eligible for these preferential rates in the hands of such non &#8209; corporate United States Holders, although, as described above, we expect such dividends to be so eligible provided an eligible non &#8209; corporate United States Holder meets all applicable requirements and we are not a passive foreign passive investment company in the taxable year during which the dividend is paid or the immediately preceding taxable year. Any dividends paid by us which are not eligible for these preferential rates will be taxed as ordinary income to a non &#8209; corporate United States Holder. 

&#160; 

Special rules may apply to any "extraordinary dividend"&#8212;generally, a dividend in an amount which is equal to or in excess of 10% of a shareholder's adjusted tax basis in a common share&#8212;paid by us. If we pay an "extraordinary dividend" on our common shares that is treated as "qualified dividend income," then any loss derived by certain non &#8209; corporate United States Holders from the sale or exchange of such common shares will be treated as long term capital loss to the extent of such dividend. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Sale, Exchange or Other Disposition of Common Shares 

&#160; 

Assuming we do not constitute a passive foreign investment company for any taxable year, a United States Holder generally will recognize taxable gain or loss upon a sale, exchange or other disposition of our common shares in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized by the United States Holder from such sale, exchange or other disposition and the United States Holder's tax basis in such shares. Such gain or loss will be treated as long &#8209; term capital gain or loss if the United States Holder's holding period is greater than one year at the time of the sale, exchange or other disposition. Such capital gain or loss will generally be treated as United States source income or loss, as applicable, for United States foreign tax credit purposes. Long &#8209; term capital gains of certain non &#8209; corporate United States Holders are currently eligible for reduced rates of taxation. A United States Holder's ability to deduct capital losses is subject to certain limitations. 

&#160; 

Passive Foreign Investment Company Status and Significant Tax Consequences 

&#160; 

Special United States federal income tax rules apply to a United States Holder that holds shares in a foreign corporation classified as a "passive foreign investment company," or a PFIC, for United States federal income tax purposes. In general, we will be treated as a PFIC with respect to a United States Holder if, for any taxable year in which such holder holds our common shares, either 

&#160; 

&#183; 

at least 75% of our gross income for such taxable year consists of passive income (e.g., dividends, interest, capital gains and rents derived other than in the active conduct of a rental business); or 

&#160; 

&#183; 

at least 50% of the average value of our assets during such taxable year produce, or are held for the production of, passive income. 

&#160; 

For purposes of determining whether we are a PFIC, we will be treated as earning and owning our proportionate share of the income and assets, respectively, of any of our ship &#8209; owning subsidiaries in which we own at least 25% of the value of the subsidiary's stock. Income earned, or deemed earned, by us in connection with the performance of services would not constitute passive income. By contrast, rental income would generally constitute "passive income" unless we were treated under specific rules as deriving our rental income in the active conduct of a trade or business. 

&#160; 

We believe that income we earn from the voyage charters, and also from time charters, for the reasons discussed below, of our Initial Fleet during our initial taxable year ended March 31, 2014 and our taxable year ended March 31, 2015, will be treated as active income for PFIC purposes and as a result, we intend to take the position that we satisfy the first leg of the PFIC criteria, the 75% income test, for our initial taxable year ended March 31, 2014, and the taxable year ended March 31, 2015. 

&#160; 

Whether we were a PFIC for our initial taxable year ended March 31, 2014, and our taxable year ended March 31, 2015, will depend, in part, upon whether our newbuilding contracts and the deposits made thereon are treated as assets held for the production of passive income and the level of cash held on hand during each of these taxable years. In making such determination, we intend to take the position that the newbuilding contracts and the deposits thereon are assets held for the production of active income on the basis that we expect to either time or voyage charter all vessels upon their completion and delivery under the newbuilding contracts. However, there is no direct authority on this point and it is possible that the IRS may disagree with our position. 

&#160; 

As of the date of this Annual Report, we have taken delivery of all of the vessels under our newbuilding contracts. Accordingly, based on our current and anticipated operations, we do not believe that we will be a PFIC for our taxable year ended March 31, 2016, or subsequent taxable years, and we intend to take such position for our U.S. federal income tax reporting purposes. Our belief is based principally on the position that the gross income we derive from our voyage or time chartering activities should constitute services income, rather than rental income. Accordingly, such income should not constitute passive income, and the assets that we own and operate in connection with the production of such income, in particular, the vessels, should not constitute passive assets for purposes of determining whether we are a PFIC. There is substantial legal authority supporting this position consisting of case law and IRS pronouncements concerning the 

&#160;

characterization of income derived from time charters as services income for other tax purposes. However, there is also authority which characterizes time charter income as rental income rather than services income for other tax purposes. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the IRS or a court of law will accept this position, and there is a risk that the IRS or a court of law could determine that we are a PFIC. In addition, although we intend to conduct our affairs in a manner to avoid being classified as a PFIC with respect to any taxable year, we cannot assure you that the nature of our operations will not change in the future. 

&#160; 

As discussed more fully below, for any taxable year in which we are, or were to be treated as, a PFIC, a United States Holder would be subject to different taxation rules depending on whether the United States Holder makes an election to treat us as a "Qualified Electing Fund," which election we refer to as a "QEF election." As an alternative to making a QEF election, a United States Holder should be able to make a "mark &#8209; to &#8209; market" election with respect to our common shares, as discussed below. A United States holder of shares in a PFIC will be required to file an annual information return containing information regarding the PFIC as required by applicable Treasury Regulations. We intend to promptly notify our shareholders if we determine we are a PFIC for any taxable year. 

&#160; 

Taxation of United States Holders Making a Timely QEF Election 

&#160; 

If a United States Holder makes a timely QEF election, which United States Holder we refer to as an "Electing Holder," the Electing Holder must report for United States federal income tax purposes its pro rata share of our ordinary earnings and net capital gain, if any, for each of our taxable years during which we are a PFIC that ends with or within the taxable year of the Electing Holder, regardless of whether distributions were received from us by the Electing Holder. No portion of any such inclusions of ordinary earnings will be treated as "qualified dividend income." Net capital gain inclusions of certain non &#8209; corporate United States Holders would be eligible for preferential capital gains tax rates. The Electing Holder's adjusted tax basis in the common shares will be increased to reflect any income included under the QEF election. Distributions of previously taxed income will not be subject to tax upon distribution but will decrease the Electing Holder's tax basis in the common shares. An Electing Holder would not, however, be entitled to a deduction for its pro rata share of any losses that we incur with respect to any taxable year. An Electing Holder would generally recognize capital gain or loss on the sale, exchange or other disposition of our common shares. A United States Holder would make a timely QEF election for our common shares by filing one copy of IRS Form 8621 with his United States federal income tax return for the first year in which he held such shares when we were a PFIC. If we take the position that we are not a PFIC for any taxable year, and it is later determined that we were a PFIC for such taxable year, it may be possible for a United States Holder to make a retroactive QEF election effective for such year. If we were to be treated as a PFIC for our initial taxable year 2014 and our taxable year 2015, we anticipate that, based on our current projections, we would not generate significant amounts of taxable income or gain that would be required to be included in income for each such year by United States Holders who have QEF elections in effect for such year. If we determine that we are a PFIC for any taxable year, we will provide each United States Holder with all necessary information required for the United States Holder to make the QEF election and to report its pro rata share of our ordinary earnings and net capital gain, if any, for each of our taxable years during which we are a PFIC that ends with or within the taxable year of the Electing Holder as described above. 

&#160; 

Taxation of United States Holders Making a "Mark &#8209; to &#8209; Market" Election 

&#160; 

Alternatively, for any taxable year in which we determine that we are a PFIC, and, assuming as we anticipate will be the case, our shares are treated as "marketable stock," a United States Holder would be allowed to make a "mark &#8209; to &#8209; market" election with respect to our common shares, provided the United States Holder completes and files IRS Form 8621 in accordance with the relevant instructions and related Treasury Regulations. If that election is made, the United States Holder generally would include as ordinary income in each taxable year the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the common shares at the end of the taxable year over such Holder's adjusted tax basis in the common shares. The United States Holder would also be permitted an ordinary loss in respect of the excess, if any, of the United States Holder's adjusted tax basis in the common shares over its fair market value at the end of the taxable year, but only to the extent of the net amount previously included in income as a result of the mark &#8209; to &#8209; market election. A United States Holder's tax basis in his common shares would be adjusted to reflect any such income or loss amount recognized. In a year when we are a PFIC, any gain realized on the sale, exchange or other disposition of our common shares would be treated as ordinary income, and any loss realized on the sale, exchange or other disposition of the common shares would be treated as ordinary 

&#160;

loss to the extent that such loss does not exceed the net mark &#8209; to &#8209; market gains previously included by the United States Holder. 

&#160; 

Taxation of United States Holders Not Making a Timely QEF or Mark &#8209; to &#8209; Market Election 

&#160; 

For any taxable year in which we determine that we are a PFIC, a United States Holder who does not make either a QEF election or a "mark &#8209; to &#8209; market" election for that year, whom we refer to as a "Non &#8209; Electing Holder," would be subject to special rules with respect to (i) any excess distribution (i.e., the portion of any distributions received by the Non &#8209; Electing Holder on the common shares in a taxable year in excess of 125% of the average annual distributions received by the Non &#8209; Electing Holder in the three preceding taxable years, or, if shorter, the Non &#8209; Electing Holder's holding period for the common shares), and (ii) any gain realized on the sale, exchange or other disposition of our common shares. Under these special rules: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

the excess distribution or gain would be allocated ratably over the Non &#8209; Electing Holder's aggregate holding period for the common shares; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

the amount allocated to the current taxable year, and any taxable year prior to the first taxable year in which we were a PFIC, would be taxed as ordinary income and would not be "qualified dividend income"; and 

&#160; 

&#183; 

the amount allocated to each of the other taxable years would be subject to tax at the highest rate of tax in effect for the applicable class of taxpayer for that year, and an interest charge for the deemed tax deferral benefit would be imposed with respect to the resulting tax attributable to each such other taxable year. 

&#160; 

United States Federal Income Taxation of "Non &#8209; United States Holders" 

&#160; 

As used herein, the term "Non &#8209; United States Holder" means a holder that, for United States federal income tax purposes, is a beneficial owner of common shares (other than a partnership) that is not a United States Holder. 

&#160; 

If a partnership holds our common shares, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and upon the activities of the partnership. If you are a partner in a partnership holding our common shares, you are encouraged to consult your tax advisor. 

&#160; 

Dividends on Common Shares 

&#160; 

A Non &#8209; United States Holder generally will not be subject to United States federal income or withholding tax on dividends received from us with respect to our common shares, unless: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

the dividend income is effectively connected with the Non &#8209; United States Holder's conduct of a trade or business in the United States; or

&#183; 

the Non &#8209; United States Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year of receipt of the dividend income and other conditions are met. 

&#160; 

Sale, Exchange or Other Disposition of Common Shares 

&#160; 

A Non &#8209; United States Holder generally will not be subject to United States federal income or withholding tax on any gain realized upon the sale, exchange or other disposition of our common shares, unless: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

the gain is effectively connected with the Non &#8209; United States Holder's conduct of a trade or business in the United States; or 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#183; 

the Non &#8209; United States Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year of disposition and other conditions are met. 

&#160; 

Income or Gains Effectively Connected with a United States Trade or Business 

&#160; 

If the Non &#8209; United States Holder is engaged in a United States trade or business for United States federal income tax purposes, dividends on our common shares and gain from the sale, exchange or other disposition of our common shares, that are effectively connected with the conduct of that trade or business (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a United States permanent establishment), will generally be subject to regular United States federal income tax in the same manner as discussed in the previous section relating to the taxation of United States Holders. In addition, in the case of a corporate Non &#8209; United States Holder, its earnings and profits that are attributable to the effectively connected income, which are subject to certain adjustments, may be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a rate of 30%, or at a lower rate as may be specified by an applicable United States income tax treaty. 

&#160; 

Backup Withholding and Information Reporting 

&#160; 

In general, dividend payments, or other taxable distributions, and the payment of the gross proceeds on a sale of our common shares, made within the United States to a non &#8209; corporate United States Holder will be subject to information reporting. Such payments or distributions may also be subject to backup withholding if the non &#8209; corporate United States Holder: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

fails to provide an accurate taxpayer identification number; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

is notified by the IRS that it has have failed to report all interest or dividends required to be shown on its federal income tax returns; or 

&#160; 

&#183; 

in certain circumstances, fails to comply with applicable certification requirements. 

&#160; 

Non &#8209; United States Holders may be required to establish their exemption from information reporting and backup withholding with respect to dividends payments or other taxable distribution on our common shares by certifying their status on an appropriate IRS Form W &#8209; 8. If a Non &#8209; United States Holder sells our common shares to or through a United States office of a broker, the payment of the proceeds is subject to both United States backup withholding and information reporting unless the Non &#8209; United States Holder certifies that it is a non &#8209; United States person, under penalties of perjury, or it otherwise establish an exemption. If a Non &#8209; United States Holder sells our common shares through a non &#8209; United States office of a non &#8209; United States broker and the sales proceeds are paid outside the United States, then information reporting and backup withholding generally will not apply to that payment. However, United States information reporting requirements, but not backup withholding, will apply to a payment of sales proceeds, even if that payment is made outside the United States, if a Non &#8209; United States Holder sells our common shares through a non &#8209; United States office of a broker that is a United States person or has some other contacts with the United States. Such information reporting requirements will not apply, however, if the broker has documentary evidence in its records that the Non &#8209; United States Holder is not a United States person and certain other conditions are met, or the Non &#8209; United States Holder otherwise establishes an exemption. 

&#160; 

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Rather, a refund may generally be obtained of any amounts withheld under backup withholding rules that exceed the taxpayer's United States federal income tax liability by filing a timely refund claim with the IRS. 

&#160; 

Individuals who are United States Holders (and to the extent specified in applicable Treasury regulations, Non &#8209; United States Holders and certain United States entities) who hold "specified foreign financial assets" (as defined in Section 6038D of the Code) are required to file IRS Form 8938 with information relating to the asset for each taxable year in which the aggregate value of all such assets exceeds $75,000 at any time during the taxable year or $50,000 on the last day of the taxable year (or such higher dollar amount as prescribed by applicable Treasury Regulations). Specified foreign 

&#160;

financial assets would include, among other assets, our common shares, unless the common shares are held in an account maintained with a United States financial institution. Substantial penalties apply to any failure to timely file IRS Form 8938, unless the failure is shown to be due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect. Additionally, in the event an individual United States Holder (and to the extent specified in applicable Treasury Regulations, a Non &#8209; United States Holder or a United States entity) that is required to file IRS Form 8938 does not file such form, the statute of limitations on the assessment and collection of United States federal income taxes of such holder for the related tax year may not close until three years after the date that the required information is filed. United States Holders (including United States entities) and Non &#8209; United States Holders are encouraged consult their own tax advisors regarding their reporting obligations in respect of our common shares.
