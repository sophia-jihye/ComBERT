 ITEM 1. &#32; BUSINESS &#32; 

Overview 

We are a Nevada corporation that was initially formed in 1987. We have operated in the pharmaceutical industry since 1995. Our current focus is on the development and commercialization of innovative products and product candidates in the areas of urology and rheumatology. Our proprietary drug delivery technology is a permeation enhancer called NexACT &#174; . 

We have two product candidates in Phase 2 development, fispemifene for the treatment of symptomatic male secondary hypogonadism and RayVa &#8482; &#32;for the treatment of Raynaud&#8217;s phenomenon, secondary to scleroderma. We have one commercial product, Vitaros &#174; &#32;for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (&#8220;ED&#8221;), which is currently in development in the United States, approved in Canada and marketed throughout Europe. 

Fispemifene 

Fispemifene is a once-daily, orally administered, tissue-specific selective estrogen receptor modulator designed to potentially treat a variety of men&#8217;s health conditions, including secondary hypogonadism, lower urinary tract symptoms (&#8220;LUTS&#8221;) and chronic prostatitis in men. Fispemifene acts in secondary hypogonadism by inhibiting the negative feedback of testosterone production via an estrogen-blocking effect at the level of pituitary, resulting in increased testosterone production in the testes, which in turn restores circulating testosterone levels to within, but not beyond, the normal range. Fispemifene has also shown other positive tissue effects in animal studies, such as preserving bone density, anti-proliferative activity in prostate and breast cancer, a beneficial effect on lipids, reduction of prostate inflammation and improved urodynamics. 

We in-licensed the United States development and commercialization rights to fispemifene from Forendo Pharma Ltd. in October 2014. Prior to 2014, two Phase 2a clinical trials in a total of 154 men with secondary hypogonadism showed that fispemifene normalized testosterone levels while retaining (and, in some cases restoring) testicular function. We are conducting a randomized double-blind Phase 2b clinical trial in symptomatic secondary hypogonadism, which began in May 2015. The primary endpoint is to measure improvements in ED from a baseline measurement period. We completed enrollment in our Phase 2b clinical trial in the fourth quarter of 2015 and we expect to release top-line data during the first quarter of 2016. We also initiated certain activities for a study in LUTS in the fourth quarter of 2015. 

Approximately 90 million men over 40 years old in the United States suffer from secondary hypogonadism, chronic non-bacterial prostatitis or LUTS. In 2013, the market for testosterone replacement treatment for primary and secondary hypogonadism was approximately $1.7 billion. Based on this market size, we estimate the market opportunity for fispemifene to treat adult men with symptomatic secondary hypogonadism to be approximately $1 billion. 

RayVa &#8482; &#160; 

RayVa &#8482; &#32;(alprostadil) is our product candidate for the treatment of Raynaud's Phenomenon associated with scleroderma (systemic sclerosis). The RayVa &#8482; &#32;product combines alprostadil, which dilates blood vessels, with our proprietary permeation enhancer, NexACT &#174; , and is applied as an on-demand topical cream to affected extremities. 

&#160; 

Raynaud's Phenomenon is characterized by constriction of the blood vessels in response to cold or stress of the hands and feet, resulting in reduced blood flow and the sensation of pain, which can be severe. Primary Raynaud's Phenomenon, which is not associated with an underlying medical condition, affects an estimated 3-5% of the United States population. Secondary Raynaud&#8217;s Phenomenon, affecting approximately 500,000 in the United States, is driven by an underlying medical condition, such as scleroderma, lupus or rheumatoid arthritis. Symptoms are severe and patients risk associated fingertip ulcerations. There are an estimated 100,000 adult patients with scleroderma in the United States, of which approximately 90% have secondary Raynaud&#8217;s Phenomenon. Approximately 80% of scleroderma patients are women. Both primary and secondary Raynaud&#8217;s Phenomenon disproportionately affects women. 

RayVa &#8482; &#32;received clearance in May 2014 from the United States Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;) to begin clinical studies. We reported results from our Phase 2a clinical trial of RayVa &#8482; &#32;for the treatment of Raynaud&#8217;s phenomenon secondary to scleroderma in September 2015, which supported moving RayVa &#8482; &#32;forward into future clinical trials. We expect to initiate a Phase 2b clinical trial in the second half of 2016. 

We believe that RayVa &#8482; &#32;presents an attractive commercial opportunity. There is currently no approved therapy for Raynaud&#8217;s Phenomenon in the United States, representing an unmet medical need. Moreover, because there are only approximately 4,500 rheumatologists treating secondary Raynaud&#8217;s patients in the United States, we believe we can commercialize RayVa &#8482; &#32;efficiently if we receive FDA approval. 

Vitaros &#174; &#160; 

Vitaros &#174; &#32;(alprostadil) is a topically-applied cream formulation of alprostadil, which dilates blood vessels, combined with our proprietary permeation enhancer NexACT &#174; , which directly increases blood flow to the penis, causing an erection. We own the non-United States rights to Vitaros &#174; , which we out-license to our marketing partners for commercialization in their respective territories. Allergan plc (&#8220;Allergan&#8221;) owns the rights to Vitaros &#174; &#32;in the United States and in September 2015, we entered into an agreement with Allergan to license the United States development and commercialization rights for Vitaros &#174; . Vitaros &#174; &#32;is currently in development in the United States, approved in Canada and marketed throughout Europe. 

Our European marketing partners for Vitaros &#174; &#32;include Laboratoires Majorelle (&#8220;Majorelle&#8221;), Bracco S.p.A. (&#8220;Bracco&#8221;), Hexal AG (&#8220;Sandoz&#8221;), Takeda Pharmaceuticals International GmbH (&#8220;Takeda&#8221;) and Recordati Ireland Ltd. (&#8220;Recordati&#8221;). Vitaros &#174; &#32;is currently approved for marketing in the Netherlands, Germany, the United Kingdom (the &#8220;UK&#8221;), Ireland, Italy, France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Spain, Sweden, Austria, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Portugal and Romania. Our licensing partners began launching Vitaros &#174; in certain territories in Europe beginning in the second half of 2014 and the product is now launched in Germany, the UK, Italy, France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Spain and Sweden by our commercial partners. In addition, in October 2015, we announced that Ferring International Center S.A. (&#8220;Ferring Pharmaceuticals&#8221;) will be our Vitaros &#174; &#32;distributor in certain Latin American countries. We have a second-generation Vitaros &#174; &#32;product candidate in development, which is a proprietary stabilized dosage formulation that is expected to be stored at room temperature conditions, which we refer to as &#8220;Room Temperature Vitaros &#174; .&#8221; 

With our broad Vitaros &#174; expertise and internal know-how, coupled with the proven success in obtaining regulatory approvals for Vitaros &#174; &#32;in other territories, we believe we are well equipped to pursue regulatory approval for Vitaros &#174; in the United States. We initiated certain activities in 2015 to address issues previously raised by the FDA in a 2008 non-approvable letter, including possible safety risks associated with our proprietary permeating enhancer, DDAIP.HCl, and certain chemistry, manufacturing and control issues. We expect to re-submit a revised new drug application (&#8220;NDA&#8221;) with the FDA in the second half of 2016. 

We believe Vitaros &#174; offers greater market opportunity compared to other alprostadil dosage forms due to its patient-friendly delivery form as well as a competitive alternative to oral ED products. ED affects approximately 150 million men worldwide. In the United States, ED is estimated to affect 20 million men, of which approximately 5 million have been diagnosed and only approximately 1.25 million are being treated. An estimated 600,000 men are newly diagnosed each year. In the United States, the ED market is approximately $3 billion annually. 

Growth Strategy 

To develop and commercialize our proprietary products and product candidates, through these primary initiatives: 

Develop and commercialize in the United States additional technologies and products based upon proprietary technologies developed in-house or acquired from third-parties 

We will continue to develop fispemifene, a tissue-specific SERM designed to treat secondary hypogonadism, LUTS and chronic prostatitis in men, with the goal of commercializing it in the United States. We initiated and completed enrollment in our Phase 2b clinical trial last year and we expect to release top-line data in the first quarter of 2016. Depending on those results and based upon the feedback received from the FDA, we may initiate additional clinical trials in the future. 

&#160; 

Our product candidate for the treatment of Raynaud&#8217;s Phenomenon secondary to scleroderma, RayVa &#8482; , is also currently in development. We completed and reported top-line data on the Phase 2a clinical trial for RayVa &#8482; &#32;and we believe the data, coupled with previously generated non-clinical data, supports moving RayVa &#8482; &#32;forward into future clinical trials designed to evaluate symptomatic effects in subjects with Raynaud&#8217;s secondary to scleroderma. 

We also plan to continue to evaluate other product candidates and we may also acquire or develop other complementary products leveraging our regulatory and development experience. 

Commercialize Vitaros &#174; &#32;through partnerships

We will continue to leverage Vitaros &#174; &#32;as a cash-generating asset through royalty and milestone payments and by expanding the product&#8217;s market reach via additional ex-U.S. launches by our commercialization partners. Last year, we expanded Vitaros &#174; &#32;partnerships to include parts of Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America. 

Our licensing partners have launched Vitaros &#174; in France, Italy, Germany, the United Kingdom, Spain, Belgium, Luxemburg and Sweden and we expect to obtain European approval for one or more variations to the approved product with the goal of enhancing the profile of Vitaros &#174; . In addition, we have licensed the U.S. development and commercialization rights for Vitaros &#174; &#32;from Allergan and we expect to re-submit the NDA for Vitaros &#174; &#32;in the United States in the second half of 2016. 

Establish new Vitaros &#174; &#32;and RayVa &#8482; licensing partnerships with pharmaceutical companies 

In the future, we will seek new partnerships to license, develop and commercialize Vitaros &#174; &#32;and RayVa &#8482; in markets not covered by existing partnerships. For Vitaros &#174; , these territories primarily consist of Japan and China. For RayVa &#8482; , these territories consist of all countries, including the United States. We expect that any such agreements will provide us with one or more of the following: up-front payments, the right to receive regulatory and sales milestone payments and/or royalty payments. 

&#160; 

NexACT &#174; &#32; Drug Delivery Technology 

The NexACT &#174; &#32;drug delivery technology is designed to enhance the delivery of an active drug to the patient. If successful, the combination of our NexACT &#174; &#32;technology with active drugs could improve therapeutic outcomes and reduce systemic side effects that often accompany existing medications. 

The NexACT &#174; &#32;technology consists of a small molecule permeation enhancer called Dodecyl 2-(N,N dimethylamino)-propionate (&#8220;DDAIP&#8221;) that enables the rapid absorption of high concentrations of an active pharmaceutical ingredient directly at the target site, which is designed to enhance the delivery of an active drug to the patient. 

NexACT &#174; &#32;was designed to enable multi-route administration of active drugs across numerous therapeutic classes. The NexACT &#174; &#32;technology has been tested in human clinical trials by us and our partners as a means of transdermal delivery of drugs (through the skin) and has been shown in pre-clinical animal studies to have the potential to serve as an effective vehicle for the delivery of a wide range of drugs and drug classes, via numerous routes of administration, including transdermal (topical), oral, subcutaneous, rectal and buccal (absorbed in the mouth). 

NexACT &#174; &#32;is based on proprietary permeation enhancers that are biodegradable, biocompatible, and mimic the composition of human skin. NexACT &#174; &#32;has been tested in clinical trials in over 5,000 patients, including those subjects exposed to Vitaros &#174; &#32;&#32;and RayVa &#8482; . In these clinical trials, NexACT &#174; &#32;demonstrated a favorable safety profile, with minimal serious adverse events that were likely attributed to the active ingredients in the drug candidates. 

Product and Product Candidate Portfolio 

Fispemifene for the Treatment of Secondary Hypogonadism 

In October 2014, we licensed from Forendo the exclusive United States rights to develop and commercialize fispemifene, a tissue-specific SERM designed to treat secondary hypogonadism, chronic prostatitis and LUTS in men. Fispemifene acts using the body&#8217;s own regulatory mechanisms, through the hypothalamus and pituitary glands, to normalize production of testosterone by the testes whereas testosterone replacement therapies do not. Fispemifene has also been shown to provide other benefits in animal models, such as reduction of prostate inflammation, improved urodynamics, and preservation of bone density, among others. We initiated and completed enrollment in our Phase 2b clinical trial last year and we expect to release top-line data in the first quarter of 2016. 

Competition for Fispemifene 

There is significant competition and financial incentive to develop, market and sell drugs for the treatment of hypogonadism (a syndrome consisting of &#8220;Low-Testosterone&#8221; or &#8220;Low-T&#8221; and related symptoms). Leading drugs approved and on the market for Low-T belong to a class called testosterone replacement therapy. This class consists of branded and generic topical testosterone gels, patches, buccal tabs, implantables, and injectables, such as Androgel (sold by Abbott Labs), Axiron (sold by Eli Lilly), and Testim, Testopel, Striant, Aveed and Fortesta (sold by Endo Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) that increase hormone levels via external testosterone supplementation. In addition, we are aware of other testosterone formulations under development, which include a subcutaneous delivery from Antares and oral formulations from Clarus Therapeutics and Lipocine. As patents expire for the leading topical testosterone formulation, Androgel, we anticipate that generic gel alternatives will impact the overall market for testosterone replacement. There are no other FDA-approved SERMs for hypogonadism, which differ from TRT in that SERMs increase the body&#8217;s own production of endogenous testosterone. A future potential competitor to fispemifene is enclomifene citrate (developed by Repros Therapeutics). Enclomifene is the trans-isomer of a compound named clomiphene, which is a SERM approved for the treatment of infertility in women. We are aware that clomiphene is sometimes used off-label to treat hypogonadism in men despite not being approved by the FDA for that use. Repros recently received a complete response letter from the FDA and will likely need to run additional clinical trials to address the deficiencies raised by the FDA. Beyond enclomifene, we are not aware of any other company actively developing a SERM for hypogonadism. 

RayVa TM &#32; for the Treatment of Raynaud&#8217;s Phenomenon Secondary to Scleroderma &#32; 

RayVa TM &#32;is our product candidate for the treatment of Raynaud&#8217;s Phenomenon secondary to scleroderma. Raynaud&#8217;s Phenomenon secondary to scleroderma is a disorder of the small blood vessels of the extremities, which affects approximately 100,000 people in the United States RayVa TM &#32;utilizes our NexACT &#174; technology, combining alprostadil and NexACT &#174; &#32;in an on-demand topical application to the affected areas. There are currently no approved prescription treatments in the United States for Raynaud&#8217;s Phenomenon and we are unaware of any other products currently in development to treat Raynaud&#8217;s Phenomenon secondary to scleroderma. 

We completed and reported top-line data on the Phase 2a clinical trial for RayVa &#8482; , and we believe the data, coupled with previously generated non-clinical data, supports moving RayVa &#8482; &#32;forward into future clinical trials designed to evaluate symptomatic effects in subjects with Raynaud&#8217;s secondary to scleroderma. 

&#160; 

Vitaros &#174; &#32; for Erectile Dysfunction 

Vitaros &#174; , our lead product for the treatment of ED, is a topically-applied cream formulation of alprostadil, a vasodilator and NexACT &#174; , which directly increases blood flow to the penis causing an erection. Alprostadil is one of several treatment options for ED, and is a widely accepted alternative to the PDE5 inhibitors, such as Viagra &#174; . Following the approval by the European and Canadian Health Authorities, Vitaros &#174; &#32;has been deemed a safe and effective treatment, and has the potential to address a meaningful market opportunity due to its patient-friendly form of administration versus both other alprostadil dosage forms and its non-systemic safety profile. 

The current leading ED medications are taken in pill form and work by inhibiting an enzyme called PDE5. We believe there is a need for new, safe and effective treatments, especially for those patients who cannot or prefer not to take or do not respond to oral medications. Vitaros &#174; &#32;is a topically-applied, on-demand, non-PDE5 inhibitor that may be appropriate for ED patients who: 

1. 

Want a fast-acting and on-demand treatment; 

2. 

Prefer a locally-acting treatment instead of an oral systemic treatment; 

3. 

Have contraindications to PDE5 inhibitors due to medications or concurrent disease (estimated to be approximately 18% of the ED market); 

4. 

Are healthy enough to take the PDE5 inhibitors but stop taking them because they are non-responders (estimated to be approximately 21% of the ED market); or 

5. 

Drop out because of poor tolerability or side effects from oral PDE5 inhibitors. 

Factors such as these lead to an estimated 31% drop out rate after initial prescription for patients taking sildenafil citrate, which increases to an estimated 48% drop-out rate after three years of taking the drug. 

In clinical studies, Vitaros &#174; showed efficacy in patients suffering from ED, including men who did not respond to sildenafil citrate. The side effects reported were localized and transient. According to the European Male Aging Study assessing ED prevalence in eight countries, 30% of men in that study reported moderate or severe ED increasing to 64% in men 70 years or older. In Germany and Spain, the prevalence of ED was reported to be between 18-19% for men 40 years or older while in France, the percentage climbs to 32%. With an overall ex-United States ED market affecting nearly 150 million men worldwide and representing approximately $2.0 billion in revenue, we believe that Vitaros &#174; &#32;represents a major market opportunity, particularly as a distinct product that addresses a significant underserved population. 

Vitaros &#174; &#32;is currently manufactured by Therapex, a division of E-Z-EM Canada Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bracco SpA in Italy (&#8220;Therapex&#8221;) and by Groupe Parima, Inc. Our third-party manufacturers are subject to numerous regulations, including Good Manufacturing Practices, (&#8220;cGMPs&#8221;), FDA regulations governing manufacturing processes and related activities and similar foreign regulations. Both of these manufacturers are located in Canada and are capable of providing commercial product for our partners. 

The first-generation Vitaros &#174; &#32;product (&#8220;Cold Chain Vitaros &#174; &#8221;) is stored in one chamber of our AccuDose &#174; &#32;dispenser. This single-chamber formulation requires that the product be stored by customers in a refrigerator until a short time prior to use. Cold Chain Vitaros &#174; &#32;was the product used in the Company&#8217;s clinical trials, and was approved in Canada and Europe. In November 2010, Health Canada approved Cold Chain Vitaros &#174; &#32;for a current shelf-life of nine months for the 330 micrograms (&#8220;mcg&#8221;) product and six months for the 220 mcg product. These shelf-life durations are calculated at a temperature of 2&#176;C-8&#176;C. At room temperature conditions, Cold Chain Vitaros &#174; &#32;has an approved shelf-life of up to seven days. Therefore, Cold Chain Vitaros &#174; &#32;can be conveniently carried by the patient and brought up to room temperature prior to use. In June 2013, through the European Decentralized Procedure (&#8220;DCP&#8221;), Vitaros &#174; &#32;was approved for a current shelf-life of eighteen months for the 300 mcg product and nine months for the 200 mcg product. These shelf-life durations are calculated at a temperature of 2&#176;C-8&#176;C. At room temperature conditions, Cold Chain Vitaros &#174; &#32;has an approved shelf-life in Europe of up to three days through the European DCP. 

It is expected that the product ingredients in our second-generation Vitaros &#174; product candidate (&#8220;Room Temperature Vitaros &#174; &#8221;) , will be stored in two separate chambers. This will allow alprostadil to be segregated from ingredients that cause it to become unstable at room temperature. The contents of each of the two chambers are then mixed in the dispenser immediately prior to use. This mixture is expected to result in the same pharmaceutical formulation as the approved Cold Chain Vitaros &#174; . This proprietary stabilized dosage form is expected to allow the product to be stored at room temperature conditions with a current target shelf-life duration for Room Temperature Vitaros &#174; &#32;of twenty-four months. We plan to perform the necessary equivalence and stability studies to market Room Temperature Vitaros &#174; &#32;in Canada, Europe and other future-approved territories, and to seek to increase the shelf-life over time. 

Competition for Vitaros &#174; &#160; 

There is significant competition and financial incentive to develop, market and sell drugs for the treatment of ED. Leading drugs approved for ED indications are PDE5 inhibitors that target the vascular system, such as sildenafil citrate (sold by Pfizer under 

&#160; 

the trade name Viagra &#174; ), vardenafil (sold by GlaxoSmith-Kline under the trade name Levitra &#174; ), tadalafil (sold by Lilly under the trade name Cialis &#174; ) and avanafil (sold in the United States by Endo Pharmaceuticals, Inc. under the trade name Stendra &#174; and sold in Europe and New Zealand by The Menarini Group under the trade name Spedra &#174; ). In addition, we are aware of other PDE5 inhibitors under development. As patents for the three major PDE5 inhibitors, sildenafil citrate, tadalafil and vardenafil, are expiring over various dates in each country, we anticipate that generic PDE5 inhibitors will impact the overall market for ED products. Generic PDE5 inhibitors are being sold at lower prices than their brand equivalents. Other drugs approved for ED indications include alprostadil for injection directly into the penis (sold by Pfizer under the trade name Caverject Impulse &#174; , and Edex, sold in the United States by Endo Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), and alprostadil in urethral suppository format (sold by Meda under the trade name MUSE &#174; ). In addition, a variety of devices, including vacuum devices and surgical penile implants, have been approved for ED indications. We are aware of a number of companies developing new drugs for ED indications including Futura Medical Inc., which is developing MED 2002, a topical gel applied directly to the penis for the treatment of ED. MED2002 is based on the active compound glyceryl trinitrate within a patented gel delivery system. We are not aware of any company actively developing a topical alprostadil drug for ED.

Patent Portfolio 

We currently own or exclusively license approximately 347 &#32;issued patents which will expire from 2017 through 2032, approximately, and 134 &#32;patent applications. Should the patent applications issue, they may extend our patent exclusivity on our NexACT &#174; &#32;technology, our acquired products and on our other products and technologies throughout the world until approximately 2032, based upon the potential expiration date of the last to expire of those patent applications. Patents covering Vitaros &#174; &#32;for ED have been issued in Australia, Canada, Eurasia, Europe, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Turkey, Taiwan, and the United States. We have licensed our patent rights to Vitaros &#174; &#32;to commercial partners in a number of these countries and we are actively seeking commercial partners in other jurisdictions. 

In the United States, we hold 21 &#32;United States patents in connection with our NexACT &#174; &#32;technology and our NexACT &#174; -based products under development. In January 2015, the United States Patent and Trademark Office issued to us a United States patent related to methods for treating Raynaud&#8217;s Phenomenon, that is secondary to systemic sclerosis. 

In October 2014, we exclusively licensed United States patents and applications from Forendo. The licensed patents and applications include six &#32;United States patents and one &#32;United States patent applications related to the SERM, fispemifene, for investigational treatment for urological conditions in men. These patents will expire between 2020 and 2028. 

To further strengthen our global patent position on our proprietary products under development and to expand the patent protection to other markets, we have filed foreign patent applications, many of which correspond to our issued United States patents and pending United States patent applications. These foreign filings have resulted in numerous issued patents and currently pending patent applications. 

While we have obtained patents and have patent applications pending, the extent of effective patent protection in the United States and other countries is highly uncertain. No consistent policy addresses the breadth of claims allowed in or the degree of protection afforded under patents of medical and pharmaceutical companies. Patents we currently own or may obtain might not be sufficiently broad to protect us against competitors with similar technology. Any of our patents could be invalidated or circumvented. 

The holders of competing patents could determine to commence a lawsuit against us and may even prevail in any such lawsuit. Litigation could result in substantial cost to and diversion of effort by us, which may harm our business. In addition, our efforts to protect or defend our proprietary rights may not be successful or, even if successful, may result in substantial cost to us. 

Trademark Portfolio 

We currently own approximately 133 &#32;registered trademarks, 28 &#32;pending trademark applications and 11 &#32;allowed pending trademark applications worldwide. We own registered trademarks for Vitaros &#174; &#32;and NexACT &#174; &#32;in certain countries and territories throughout the world. 

Vitaros &#174; &#32;is our registered trademark in certain countries and is pending registration in certain other countries, including the United States. Solely for convenience, we have used the &#174; symbol throughout this report, even when discussing territories where the trademark registration is pending. 

While we have obtained registered trademarks, have trademark applications pending and may have common law trademark rights where applicable, the extent of effective trademark protection in the United States and other countries is highly uncertain. Trademarks we currently own or may obtain might not be sufficiently broad to protect us against competitors. Any of our trademarks could be invalidated or circumvented. 

Even where we have registered trademarks, competitors could seek to invalidate these registrations. Any such litigation could result in substantial cost to and diversion of effort by us, which may harm our business. In addition, our efforts to protect or defend our proprietary rights may not be successful or, even if successful, may result in substantial cost to us. 

&#160; 

Governmental Regulation 

Government authorities in the United States (including federal, state and local authorities) and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the manufacturing, research and clinical development, marketing, labeling and packaging, storage, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, advertising and promotion, pricing and export and import of pharmaceutical products, such as our products and product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Moreover, failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may result in, among other things, warning letters, clinical holds, civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of products, injunction, disbarment, partial or total suspension of production or withdrawal of the product from the market. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. 

United States Government Regulation 

In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, (&#8220;FDCA&#8221;), and its implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process required by the FDA before product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 

&#8226; 

submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug (&#8220;IND&#8221;) which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually; 

&#8226; 

completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests and preclinical animal studies, all performed in accordance with the FDA&#8217;s Good Laboratory Practice regulations; 

&#8226; 

performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each proposed indication; 

&#8226; 

submission to the FDA of an NDA after completion of all pivotal clinical trials; 

&#8226; 

a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to file the NDA for review; 

&#8226; 

satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the active pharmaceutical ingredient, (&#8220;API&#8221;), and finished drug product are produced and tested to assess compliance with cGMP regulations; and 

&#8226; 

FDA review and approval of an NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States. 

An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human studies. The IND also includes results of animal studies or other human studies, as appropriate, as well as manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature to support the use of the investigational new drug. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to the proposed clinical trials. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before clinical trials can begin. Accordingly, submission of an IND may or may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. 

Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with cGCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Additionally, approval must also be obtained from each clinical trial site&#8217;s IRB before the trials may be initiated, and the IRB must monitor the study until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and clinical trial results to public registries. 

The clinical investigation of a drug is generally divided into three phases. Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined. The three phases of an investigation are as follows: 

&#8226; 

Phase 1. Phase 1 includes the initial introduction of an investigational new drug into humans. Phase 1 clinical trials are typically closely monitored and may be conducted in patients with the target disease or condition or in healthy volunteers. These studies are designed to evaluate the safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the investigational drug in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. During Phase 1 clinical trials, sufficient information about the investigational drug&#8217;s pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects may be obtained to permit the design of well-controlled and scientifically valid Phase 2 clinical trials. The total number of participants included in Phase 1 clinical trials varies, but is generally in the range of 20 to 80. 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Phase 2. Phase 2 includes controlled clinical trials conducted to preliminarily or further evaluate the effectiveness of the investigational drug for a particular indication(s) in patients with the disease or condition under study, to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks associated with the drug. Phase 2 clinical trials are typically well-controlled, closely monitored, and conducted in a limited patient population, usually involving no more than several hundred participants. 

&#8226; 

Phase 3. Phase 3 clinical trials are generally controlled clinical trials conducted in an expanded patient population generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the drug has been obtained, and are intended to further evaluate dosage, clinical effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational drug product, and to provide an adequate basis for product approval. Phase 3 clinical trials usually involve several hundred to several thousand participants. 

A pivotal study is a clinical study which adequately meets regulatory agency requirements for the evaluation of a drug candidate&#8217;s efficacy and safety such that it can be used to justify the approval of the product. Generally, pivotal studies are also Phase 3 studies but may be Phase 2 studies if the trial design provides a well-controlled and reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in situations where there is an unmet medical need. 

The FDA, the IRB or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study. We may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate. 

Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, detailed investigational drug product information is submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product&#8217;s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug product to the satisfaction of the FDA. 

Once the NDA submission has been accepted for filing, generally two months after submission, the FDA&#8217;s goal is to review applications for new molecular entities within ten months of the filing date or, if the application relates to an unmet medical need in a serious or life-threatening indication, six months from the filing date. The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it typically follows such recommendations. 

After the FDA evaluates the NDA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the drug product and/or its API will be produced, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s), and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. Even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The FDA could also approve the NDA with a risk evaluation and mitigation strategies plan to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct one or more post-market studies or clinical trials. Such post-market testing may include Phase 4 clinical trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product&#8217;s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. Regulatory approval of oncology products often requires that patients in clinical trials be followed for long periods to determine the overall survival benefit of the drug. 

After regulatory approval of a drug product is obtained, we are required to comply with a number of post-approval requirements. The holder of an approved NDA must report, among other things, certain adverse reactions and production problems to the FDA, to provide updated safety and efficacy information, and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for the approved product. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval to ensure and preserve the long term stability of the drug product. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP, which imposes extensive procedural, substantive and record keeping requirements. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior 

&#160; 

FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. 

We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our product candidates. Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at our facilities or at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary, FDA-initiated or judicial action that could delay or prohibit further marketing. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product&#8217;s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA&#8217;s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development. 

The Hatch-Waxman Amendments 

ANDA Approval Process 

The Hatch-Waxman Act, established abbreviated FDA approval procedures for drugs that are shown to be equivalent to proprietary drugs previously approved by the FDA through its NDA process. Approval to market and distribute these drugs is obtained by filing an ANDA with the FDA. An ANDA is a comprehensive submission that contains, among other things, data and information pertaining to the active pharmaceutical ingredient, drug product formulation, specifications and stability of the generic drug, as well as analytical methods, manufacturing process validation data and quality control procedures. Premarket applications for generic drugs are termed abbreviated because they generally do not include preclinical and clinical data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Instead, a generic applicant must demonstrate that its product is bioequivalent to the innovator drug. 

In certain situations, an applicant may obtain ANDA approval of a generic product with a strength or dosage form that differs from a referenced innovator drug pursuant to the filing and approval of an ANDA Suitability Petition. The FDA will approve the generic product as suitable for an ANDA application if it finds that the generic product does not raise new questions of safety and effectiveness as compared to the innovator product. A product is not eligible for ANDA approval if the FDA determines that it is not equivalent to the referenced innovator drug, if it is intended for a different use, or if it is not subject to an approved Suitability Petition. However, such a product might be approved under an NDA, with supportive data from clinical trials. 

505(b)(2) NDAs 

As an alternative path to FDA approval for modifications to formulations or uses of products previously approved by the FDA, an applicant may submit an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. Section 505(b)(2) was enacted as part of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments and permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant or for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. If the 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on FDA&#8217;s previous findings of safety and effectiveness is scientifically appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements, including clinical trials, to support the change from the approved branded reference drug. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all, or some, of the label indications for which the branded reference drug has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the 505(b)(2) applicant. 

Orange Book Listing 

In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patents whose claims cover the applicant&#8217;s product. Upon approval of an NDA, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the Orange Book. Any applicant who files an ANDA seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the Orange Book or a 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must certify to the FDA that (1) no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA; (2) such patent has expired; (3) the date on which such patent expires; or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. This last certification is known as a paragraph IV certification. A notice of the paragraph IV certification must be provided to each owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification and to the holder of the approved NDA to which the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application refers. The applicant may also elect to submit a &#8216;&#8216;section viii&#8217;&#8217; statement certifying that its proposed label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. If the reference NDA holder and patent owners assert a patent challenge directed to one of the Orange Book listed patents within 45 days of the receipt of the paragraph IV certification notice, the FDA is prohibited from approving the application until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the paragraph IV certification expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant. The 

&#160; 

ANDA or 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the branded reference drug has expired as described in further detail below. 

Non-Patent Exclusivity 

In addition to patent exclusivity, the holder of the NDA for the listed drug may be entitled to a period of non-patent exclusivity, during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application that relies on the listed drug. For example, a pharmaceutical manufacturer may obtain five years of non-patent exclusivity upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity, (&#8220;NCE&#8221;), which is a drug that contains an active moiety that has not been approved by FDA in any other NDA. An &#8216;&#8216;active moiety&#8217;&#8217; is defined as the molecule or ion responsible for the drug substance&#8217;s physiological or pharmacologic action. During the five year exclusivity period, the FDA cannot accept for filing any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug or any 505(b)(2) NDA for the same active moiety and that relies on the FDA&#8217;s findings regarding that drug, except that FDA may accept an application for filing after four years if the follow-on applicant makes a paragraph IV certification. A drug, including one approved under Section 505(b)(2), may obtain a three-year period of exclusivity for a particular condition of approval, or change to a marketed product, such as a new formulation for a previously approved product, if one or more new clinical studies (other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies) was essential to the approval of the application and was conducted/sponsored by the applicant. Should this occur, the FDA would be precluded from approving any ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for the protected modification until after that three-year exclusivity period has run. However, unlike NCE exclusivity, the FDA can accept an application and begin the review process during the exclusivity period. 

Europe/Rest of World Government Regulation 

In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. 

Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In Europe, for example, a clinical trial application, (&#8220;CTA&#8221;), must be submitted to each country&#8217;s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country&#8217;s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed. 

The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with cGCPs and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 

To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug under European Union regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application. The application used to file the NDA in the United States is similar to that required in Europe, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements. 

For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with cGCPs and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 

If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. 

Authorization Procedures in the European Union 

Medicines can be authorized in the European Union (&#8220;EU&#8221;) by using either the centralized authorization procedure or national authorization procedures. 

&#8226; 

Centralized Procedure. Under the Centralized Procedure a so-called Community Marketing Authorization is issued by the European Commission, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency (&#8220;EMA&#8221;). The Community Marketing Authorization is valid throughout the entire territory of the European Economic Area (&#8220;EEA&#8221;) (which includes the 28 Member States of the EU plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland). The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, and medicinal products indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU. 

. 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

For medicines that do not fall within these categories, an applicant has the option of submitting an application for a centralized marketing authorization to the EMA, as long as the medicine concerned is a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if its authorization would be in the interest of public health. 

&#8226; 

National authorization procedures. There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several countries, which are available for investigational drug products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure: 

&#8226; 

Decentralized Procedure. Using the Decentralized Procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one European Union country of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any European Union country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure the applicant chooses one country as Reference Member State. The regulatory authority of the Reference Member State will then be in charge of leading the assessment of the marketing authorization application. 

&#8226; 

Mutual Recognition Procedure. In the Mutual Recognition Procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one European Union Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following this, further marketing authorizations can be sought from other European Union countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization. 

In the EU, upon receiving marketing authorization, new chemical entities generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. If granted, data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator&#8217;s data to assess a generic application. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator&#8217;s data may be referenced, but no generic product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. However, there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the European Union&#8217;s regulatory authorities to be a new chemical entity, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity. 

Other Health Care Laws 

We may also be subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments where we may market our product candidates, if approved. These laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, physician sunshine and privacy and security laws and regulations. 

The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Anti-Kickback Statute is subject to evolving interpretations. In the past, the government has enforced the Anti-Kickback Statute to reach large settlements with healthcare companies based on sham consulting and other financial arrangements with physicians. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act. The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws which establish similar prohibitions and in some cases may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers. 

Additionally, the civil False Claims Act prohibits knowingly presenting or causing the presentation of a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to the United States government. Actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the False Claims Act can result in very significant monetary penalties and treble damages. The federal government is using the False Claims Act, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies throughout the United States, for example, in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other sales and marketing practices. The government has obtained multi-million and multi-billion dollar settlements under the False Claims Act in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers' and manufacturers' compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws. 

The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, (&#8220;HIPAA&#8221;), also created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 

There has also been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, (collectively, &#8220;the Affordable Care Act&#8221;), among other things, imposed new reporting requirements on drug manufacturers for 

&#160; 

payments made by them to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year (or up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for &#8220;knowing failures&#8221;), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission. Drug manufacturers are required to submit reports to the government by the 90th day of each calendar year. Certain states also mandate implementation of compliance programs, impose restrictions on drug manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians. 

We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, (&#8220;HITECH&#8221;), and their respective implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA&#8217;s privacy and security standards directly applicable to &#8220;business associates,&#8221; defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney&#8217;s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts. 

Coverage and Reimbursement 

Sales of our products and product candidates, once approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, private health insurers and managed care organizations. Third-party payors generally decide which drugs they will cover and establish certain reimbursement levels for such drugs. In particular, in the United States, private health insurers and other third-party payors often provide reimbursement for products and services based on the level at which the government (through the Medicare or Medicaid programs) provides reimbursement for such treatments. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Sales of our products and product candidates, if approved, will therefore depend substantially on the extent to which the costs of products and our product candidates will be paid by third-party payors. Additionally, the market for our products and product candidates will depend significantly on access to third-party payors&#8217; formularies without prior authorization, step therapy, or other limitations such as approved lists of treatments for which third-party payors provide coverage and reimbursement. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for therapeutic products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor&#8217;s decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. As a result, the coverage determination process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately and will be a time-consuming process. 

In addition, the United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our future net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our products and product candidates or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our products or product candidates could reduce physician usage of our products and product candidates, if approved, and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. 

Health Care Reform 

In the United States and foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future results of operations. There have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the United States federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs. 

In particular, in the United States, the Affordable Care Act has had, and is expected to continue to have, a significant impact on the healthcare industry. The Affordable Care Act was designed to expand coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. The Affordable Care Act, among other things, addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, established annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs, and established a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs 

&#160; 

to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer&#8217;s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance were also enacted, which may require us to modify our business practices with healthcare providers and entities. 

In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. In August 2011, the President signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation&#8217;s automatic reduction to several government programs. This included reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will stay in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Additionally, in January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures.
